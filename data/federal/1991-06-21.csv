3,Mr BEAZLEY,PRESENTATION OF PAPERS,"Papers are tabled as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the papers will be recorded in Hansard and the Votes and Proceedings. The schedule read as follows1. AUSTRALIAN POLICE MINISTERS' COUNCIL-National Common Police services-Annual Report 1989-90. 2. REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH CRIMINAL LAW-Fifth Interim Report-June 1991. NA NA  310th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Ordered that the report be printed.  Business Migration Program, is the first of two reports on the Committee's inquiry into the business migration program and the control of visitor entry. The need for this first report arose after the inquiry commenced in June 1990. So widespread was the concern in the community about the operation of the business migration program that the Committee decided it would need to examine the program before looking at matters relating to the control of visitor entry. The Committee has recommended in its report that there be major changes to the system of business migration to Australia. It has recommended the abolition of the accredited agents scheme, effectively abolishing the business migration program in its existing form, and the introduction of a skills-based category of business migration within the independent category of migration. The Committee has recommended that the primary purpose of this new entry category should be the establishment of businesses in Australia and that selection under this category of migration should be based on a points system. The Committee has further recommended that the determining factor in developing a points test for business skills should be the demonstration of a successful business background by the applicant and that the components of the criterion should be the ownership and operation of a successful bona fide business in the applicant's country of origin. In terms of program objectives, if any government program is to be success-ul it is important that it have clear obje8tives and some clear measures of success. If a program's objectives are vague or if it does not have good performance measures, it will not be possible to determine whether its objectives are being met. This has been an issue for the department responsible for Australia's business migration program-the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The stated objectives of the business migration program are to bring economic benefit to Australia through, firstly, employment creation or retention of employment that would otherwise be lost; the introduction of new and improved technology; export expansion; and import substitution. In setting the program tives, the Department made an implicit requirement that a business migrant must establish a business in Australia. However, the Committee considers that this should have been articulated in the program objectives from the beginning to clarify the expectations placed on business migration applicants. The implementation of an effective tem of monitoring of program performance is, in our view, an essential element of the accountability of public sector managers to the Parliament and to the Australian people. Over the first four years of the life of the business migration program the use of surveys by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has generated insufficient data from which to base conclusive judgments on the achievement of program objectives. A monitoring system introduced in July 1988 is only now beginning to produce data. However, the Committee is still unable to get an overview on the achievement of program objectives from this data. While the amount of data available from the surveys has provided some useful indicators on the program, it is important to note that it does not provide conclusive evidence that the program's objectives are, in fact, being met. The Committee has concluded that there has not been adequate scrutiny of the business migration program. It has recommended that a much improved monitoring scheme be implemented for migrants arriving in Australia with business skills. Compliance with this schemc would be mandatory for migrants coming to Australia under the business skills category of entry. Failure to comply would incur a financial penalty. The business migration program has been unique in so far as it has involved the private scctor in the vetting of business migrants wishing to come to Australia. In cxamining the accredited agents scheme, the Committee was aware that any administrative schcme involving both the public and private sector would inevitably have teething problems. However, the Committee identified a number of objec- basic flaws in the accredited agents scheme. Firstly, accredited agents are not responsible to the Commonwealth, they act as agents for their clients. Secondly, the speed with which the accredited agents scheme was introduced brought a large number of accredited agents with varying degrees of experience into the migration consultancy arena. As a result, the Desys- partment's control over the scheme has, in our view, been reduced. Thirdly, the number of accredited agents relative to the small client base has led to agents being undcr pressure to find suitable cascs in order simply to survive financially. Lastly, and perh-ps most importantly, foreign based subagents, who are outside the control of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, are in a position to exploit the financial vulnerability of accredited agents. The conclusion reached by the Committee was that the combination of these factors, together with the lack of any effective monitoring scheme, made the business migration scheme vulnerable to abuse. The Committee is of the view that, while there is an ongoing role for the private sector in terms of migration consultancy, the public of Australia should quite rightly expect that the total responsibility for assessment of applications for migration to this country should remain clearly with the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Committee has, therefore, rccommended that the accredited agents scheme should be abolished. In relation to the new business skills category, the Committee does not wish for its recommendation that the accredited agents scheme be abolished to be interpreted as a desire to terminate business skills based migration to this country. The opposite is, in fact, true. As I mentioned earlier, the Committee has recommended that a business skills based category of migration be created to replace the business migration program. The adoption of this recommendation should, we believe, align the administration of assessment of applications under this category with all other categories of entry and, importantly and fundamentally, return the total responsibility of application assessment to the Commonwealth. It should also eliminate the problems identified with the accredited agents schemc. That brings me to the aspect of criminal involvement in the program. Since the inception of the business migration program, allegations have linked the program with criminal activity concerning the possible movement of financial and other assets derived from criminal sources to Australia. From the information provided during its inquiry, the Committee concluded that the screening procedures by the Department to conduct security checks on business migrant applicants were as extensive as practicable. The Committee further concluded that the business migration program is not, and has not been, the subject of large scale assault by organised criminal groups and that there is only a limited number of instances of penetration into Australia by identified criminal figures. However, the Committee has noted with concern the view of the New South Wales Police, the Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police that the potential exists for exploitation of the business migration program, as it currently stands, by criminal groups. That leads me to the issue of money recycling. Allegations have also been made linking the business migration program with money recycling, that is, the transferring of money brought into Australia under the business migration program back to the business migrant's country of origin. A monitoring scheme implemented in November 1989 gave the Commonwealth Departmcnt of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs the authority to chcck on accounts held by business migrants. Howevcr, up until this time, the Dcpartment had no formal monitoring scheme in place. After examination of this matter, the Committee has concluded that money recycling did occur prior to November 1989, but, due to the lack of an effective monitoring scheme, the full extcnt of this recycling cannot be determined. The Committee is of the view that the Department's monitoring scheme is acting now as a deterrent to further recycling. In conclusion, the implementation of the Committee's recommendations contained in this report will undoubtedly bring about significant changes to business migration in Australia. The Committee's belief is that this report will contribute towards the development of a much improved system of migration for those individuals with business skills. The report should also be of assistance to the Department in its current review of the business migration program. It remains for me to thank the other members of the Public Accounts Committee, particularly the members of Sectional Committee D, who have worked so diligently on this inquiry and in the finalisation of its report. In particular, I would like to thank the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Neh!), the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), Senator Bishop and Senator Reynolds and also our Deputy Chairman, Senator Watson, who has been involved in the inquiry from time to time. I would also like to thank the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Hand) for his cooperation. Finally, I would also like to thank the staff of the Committee who have worked so very hard on this report: Miss Jenny Blood, Mr Richard Cavanagh, Mrs Lorraine Hendy and Mrs Sarah Hnatiuk. r recommend the report to the House and move: That consideration of the report be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Question resolved in the affirmative.",12
4,Mr ALDRED,ACCOUNTS,"by leave-It gives me great satisfaction to be able to speak this morning to the tabling of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) report into Australia's business migration program (BMP). As the honourable member who initiated the PAC inquiry into business migration, it is particularly gratifying to see it brought to a successful conclusion. Prior to the inquiry I had over time publicly raised a number of concerns about the conceptual basis and operation of the business migration program, as indeed had various journalists and other interested individuals in the community. These concerns ranged over a wide area. They included grave reservations about the narrow capital transfer basis upon which the program was essentially founded, questions as to what proportion of business migrants ever actually set up a business, doubts about the narrowing geographical base from which business migrants are recruited, worries as to the role being performed by accredited agents, and serious concern as to recurring allegations of money recycling, document falsification and criminality. A reading of the report will demonstrate that generally these concerns were more than justified. At the outset. it has to be said that the esscntial basis upon which business migrants wcre assessed for entry to this country was not only a most inadequate means of dctermining their future potential, but also highly inequitable. The notion that the mere possession of the requisite $500,000 or other appropriate amount according to age should be the principal determinant of entry was, quite frankly, a fatuous proposition. It was too simple a measurement of an individual's capacity to set up and successfully operate a business in a new country, though the Committee has recommended that it is reasonable to take capital transfer into account as part of the overall assessment of an applicant. Moreover, the single minded previous emphasis on capital movement substantiated, to a degree, the criticism that the business migration program was simply the means for a down payment on residence and, ultimately, on citizenship of Australia. This inherent weakness of the BMP also carried the seeds of other problems, in particular those that developed in respect of money recycling, which the Chairman has referred to. If the excessive emphasis on money pushed the BMP into extreme difficulty, then the arrival of the accredited agents in 1988 guaranteed its inevitable passage to disaster. In retrospect, it seems inconceivable that such a fundamental function of government could have been handed to private individuals who, on the evidence, clearly acted in the interests of the business migrants who retained them and not those of the Commonwealth whose imprimatur they carried. Whatever views individual members have about privatisation-and there would be a wide range in this House-the task of deciding who enters this country is indisputably a function of the national Government. In addition, this already vulnerable situation was exacerbated by a number of accredited agents, obviously perceiving their BMP role as nothing more than a vehicle for advancing their other lines of business activity. The Commonwealth regrettably legitimised this activity by putting the seal of accreditation upon them. Therefore, on any rational judgment, the departure of the accredited agents will not be mourned except by some of them, of course. All aspects of immigration policy must be operated in the broad national interest of Australia and Australians and not to the advantage of sectional interests or individuals placed in an unwarranted position of preferment. To this end, the Public Accounts Committee has properly recommended that the future recruitment of those with business skills be done in the context of our general immigration program on a points assessed basis. By recommending that those with eligible business skills, for which there is a real economic need in the development of this nation, be assessed on the basis of proven success in business operation, facility in English, a reasonable consideration of capital transfer and other appropriate criteria, the Public Accounts Committee is aiming at instituting a more balanced and effective component of the immigration program. If from the beginning individuals with a greater potential to succeed are selected, then many of the other problems with the existing business migration program should be substantially reduced. In any situation of recruitment, if one initially picks the right people, logically one must be better off overall. The principle has, to a notable extent, not been applied to the business migration program. Available survey data on business start-up rates by business migrants over the decade of the program's operation is limited, as has already been stated. But on an examination of the evidence, it would appear that the majority of business migrants have never set up a business. Another matter that disturbed the Public Accounts Committee was the narrowing geographical base for the recruitment of business migrants to Australia under the BIvIP. As with all aspects of Australia's immigration program, the BMP was launched with the intention of attracting migrants on a global basis; in this instance, migrants with entrepreneurial skills who could add to our industrial infrastructure. Instead, it has, in recent years, overwhelmingly drawn upon Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia and the businesses that have been established in Australia have been heavily biased towards the services sector. Given all the foregoing difficulties referred to, it was inevitable that significant abuses would develop in the operation of the BMP and, of course, they did. Currently, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is investigating disturbing allegations of money recycling and document falsification in respect of Taiwan and Hong Kong. There have been limited instances of criminal penetration of the BMP and there have also been suggestions of tax evasion. Furthermore, the Australian Federal Police, the New South Wales Police Service, and the Victoria Police all advised the Public Accounts Committee that the potential existed for further abuse and criminal exploitation of the BMP. Little wonder that a number of us on the sectional committee viewed with sardonic humour the announcement earlier this year that, after heavy lobbying by immigration lawyers, the United States Government was setting up its own business migration scheme. In a few short years we may well all be reading about a congressional inquiry into the American business migration scheme. However, I now return to the PAC report now before us. There is a place for business skills in Australia's migration program, but on a rigorous points-assessed recruitment basis and run in a professional manner. Above all else, it must be operated in Australia's own national interest and not that of groups or individuals who would seek to exploit it for their own particular selfish ends. The business migration program has been a bad business for Australia. Implementation of the stringent recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee will help to ensure that such a debacle is not repeated. In conclusion, I must say that it has been a tremendous pleasure working with a great team on this inquiry. I refer to the Public Accounts Committee Chairman, the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), the sectional committee members, and the very dedicated staff of the Public Accounts Committee secretariat, especially Mr Richard Cavanagh. This report is now before the House only because of the incisive and unrelenting work of all of them. I join the Chairman in commending the report to the House.",15
5,Mrs SULLIVAN,ACCOUNTS,"by leave-I was not a member of the Public Accounts Committee, but I have taken a very keen interest in the course of the inquiry. Very recently, I attended a conference in North Korea as part of the Parliament's delegation to the Interpariiamentary Union. I took the opportunity to make a study of the business migration program in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. I would like to make this contribution to the debate today. Whilst there are a number of criticisms around about the business migration program with which I would agree, including the way it was introduced and the lack of safeguards and checks and balanccs at the time, some of the criticisms that arc currently being made of it are out of date. Over time, there has been quite a shakeout in the business migration program. Many people who went into it thinking it was an easy way to make a killing have found out that it is nothing of the sort. My basic experience when invcstigating the matter, from talking to departmental people, clients and those involved in the business whilst overseas, was that it is not easy money; it is anything but. Basically, the people who are involved in it now arc working very hard for the money they make and they are working well and in the interests of the program. I think that it is not a total disaster. think that we have an investment in this country's future. I instance one aspect of it, that is, the matter of our future trade in the region. Many members are unaware that South Korea is now our third largest trading partner and Taiwan is, I think, our sixth largest, which certainly makes it a very major trading partner and one which we should be working very hard to expand our trade relations with. Through the business migration program we are building up a resource witbin our community of people who have skills that will be very valuable to this country in extending out trading relations and the knowledge that is necessary for future trade and the development of tradc with those countries. I believe the dcvelopment of that trade is vital to this country's economy. I think that is where the future of this country ultimately lies. I am concerned that people too glibly look at people putting money in the bank and then doing nothing with it when I think therc is a real investment in our future, not only in terms of money but in terms of people. That is a very valuable investment, a unique one and one we would not have without the business migration program. I am concerned, as I am sure a number of other honourable members are, that this debate about the business migration program at times has taken on a straight out racial dimension, a dimension which is cnormously damaging to this country and not in its interests. I am one who would never withdraw from telling the truth about the program. I have made speeches in this chamber criticising aspects of the program in the past, but I think we should always be very careful to distance ourselves from those whose interest is simply to make racist propaganda on any issue they can. The business mi-ration program has been one of those Issues.",16
6,Mrs CROSIO,ACCOUNTS,"by leave-I will be brief, but I must say to the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), in supporting the report on the business migration program of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and in I commending not only the staff but all those who were involved in it-particularly the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) and my colleagues-that we examined in great detail the problems that people were concerned about. We also conducted something like 10 public hcarings and five in camera hearings all around Australia and took over 1,000 pages of evidence. I point out, for the benefit of the Housc and for the Hansard record, that nowhere did the Committee encounter anything that could have been classified as baving a racial slant. The concerns expressed by the honourable member for Moncrieff, who has had first-hand experiencc of this issue through her visits overseas, could also be acknowledged by my electorate. I understand and appreciate those concerns. I would say that in my electorate the majority of the business people from overseas have been through the business migration program. Therefore, I can speak first-hand from the experiences that I have been able to relate to and, certainly, the problems that I have been able to relate to. In presenting the report, both the Chairman and my colleague the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) have certainly hit the nail on the head, to use a cliche. What we are concerned about is not the program in total, but how certain people have brought it into fruition. We are concerned that we have continual growth in this country and particularly that we have financial as well as business skills. But certainly our great concern is that in some way, and certainly we have had evidence that this did happen, people were using this program as an open door to come into this country. I think we must be very particular about how we look at our programs in the future. We must also acknowledge the work that has been done in the past. When we have found error in what has been implemented, we must be able to stand up and say, 'Change we must have, change we should have'. But never at any time should there be any racial overtones in those calls. I commend the report. It was certainly a very invigorating investigation by the Committee. It was one that I was thoroughly involved with and certainly very concerned with. I share many of the feelings that have been expressed in the past in relation to what has been happening with this particular program. I commend the report to all honourable members, particularly the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). We hope that the recommendations will be taken into account and adopted.

NA (STANDARD TIME) AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 May, on motion by Mr Ronald Edwards: That the Bill be now read a second time.",17
7,Mr BEVIS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I am pleased to be able to enter this debate in support of the National Measurement (Standard Time) Amendment Bill 1991, which deals with a matter that would have little impact on some States, but would have some impact on others-notably Queensland, of recent years, and Western Australia. Benjamin Franklin, who has many other great outcomes to his credit, is credited with introducing the concept of daylight saving in a paper which he prepared in 1784. However, it was not until 1916 that the concept of daylight saving time was introduced in Germany and Britain. In Australia, our history of determination of time and time zones has varied over the course of our development. Some of that history was set out quite clearly and comprehensively by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) is satisfied in his second reading speech. It is of some significance that the Bill has been moved by a member from Western Australia and that, on this side of the House, the bulk of the speakers come from Western Australia and Queensland-the two States which have been most reluctant to introduce daylight saving, out of step with the rest of the country. Daylight saving is one of those issues which has managed to evoke deep passions in debate and, from time to time, not the most rational of contributions. We are all familiar with the problems purportedly created by daylight saving. Orders Most notable is the absurd proposition that <iaylight saving contributes to the fading of curtains in the household. That sort of comment has been made in Queensland. I have heard those comments not only in joke form, but as serious concerns. Those sorts of comments underlie the difficulty that one can have in addressing this debate. r am not in any way trying to belittle the concerns of people who have objections to daylight saving. There are in some parts of Australia, including Queensland, genuine concerns about the impact of daylight saving, particularly as it affects children going to school in the mornings when it can be dark. That can be a problem, particularly in rural Australia, where long bus runs are required to get children to and from school. Some people are concerned about the longer nights making it difficult for young families with respect to getting children to go to bed. The comment has also been made that daylight saving forces some farmers to start work in the dark. Some of those things were addressed recently by the Queensland Government in its application of daylight saving, and I note that contributions from both sides of the House have acknowledged that. In my contribution this morning, I wish to acknowledge the genuine concerns that some people have, while recognising that there are remedies to the problems in the implementation of daylight saving, and they have been successfully applied in Queensland recently. The situation in Queensland is most notable because, in many respects, it reHects part of the opposition to the daylight saving debate. Over the last 10 or 11 years, there have been two trials of daylight saving in Queensland. In the interim, what we have seen is a rebellion against the application of eastern standard time during those periods when the rest of the country was on daylight saving time. In 1987, there were a number of press rcports concerning the reaction of businesses in south-east Queensland-notably on the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast. But it is not just in those two areas that business communities and recreational communities have taken it upon themselves to change the clocks one hour in defiance of the Queensland Government. It is often said in Queensland that the problem with daylight saving is that the further north one gocs, the bigger the problem. It is said that in north Queensland, where the days are hotter and there are longer hours of sunshine, daylight saving is not a benefit, but a burden. That is simply not the case, and it is not borne out by the view of the people in north Queensland. In 1987, some of those who rebelled against the National Party Government were the tourist operators in the north Queensland holiday resorts. Various tourist operators on Hamilton Island, on South Molle Island and in the Whitsunday Passage took it upon themselves to go onto daylight saving time. They viewed that as in their best interests, not only in terms of the quality of life in the rcsorts in that part of Queensland, but also because of the commercial impact on their businesses of being out of step with the rest of the country. In the following year it spread. Not only did the islands get involved in that, but some of the mainland arcas in north Queensland also decided that they would go on daylight saving whether the Queensland National Party Government wanted thcm to or not. So, in fact, there was opcn rcbellion not just, as is popularly regarded, in the south-east corner or on the Gold Coast, but also in far north Queensland-the area where opponents of daylight saving would argue that there are no benefits. It is simply not the case. The people who live in that part of Queensland are keenly supportive of daylight saving. It is not just the people in north Queensland or, for that matter, in my electorate of Brisbane who support daylight saving. Daylight saving has enjoyed the support of a cross-section of the business community for many years. In 1987 during the Brisbane City Council election campaign, the Australian Labor Party's lord mayoral candidate, Mrs Jean Davis, advocated the introduction of daylight saving and received the support of the Queensland Confederation of Industry, which publicly announced its support for Labor's plan to introduce daylight saving. Two years later in 1989 the Courier Mail reported the following ahout the Queensland Confederation of Industry: Queensland industry was losing money because the State did not have daylight saving, the Queensland Confederation of Industry said yestcrday. Not to be deterred though-Queensland at that time was shackled by a governdaylight ment that refused to opens its eyes to many of the realities of life, one of which just happened to be daylight saving-the National Party went through a number trials and tribulations in coming to some conclusion about it. There were, in fact, number of National Party members who advocated the introduction of daylight to run their day on. saving, but it was not to be. On 10 August 1989, the Courier-Mail headlined an article, 'Queensland Nats Crush United Push For Daylight Saving'. The article went on to point out that just about everybody in the community except the National Party supported daylight saving, but that it would not be implelike mented in Queensland, it was not National Party policy and the people of QueensSunday-Mail reported: land were not to have it. The editorial of the Brisbane Courierson'sMail of that same day recorded: Despitc the public opinion polls, despite ness community's complaints, despite the attitude of local government, and dcspite the proposal by the Premier,who at the time was Mr Ahern, whom some honourable members may recallfor a trial, National Party parliamentarians havc voted against daylight saving. The result of that was that within a week there were headlines in the Brisbane Sunday-Mail saying, 'Daylight Saving volt'. The reaction of the people of Queensland to that National Party deciposed sion in 1989 was again to revolt and say that they would introduce daylight saving time with or without the approval Government. The response of the Queensland Govto this debate said: ernment in August 1989 was led by the ] believe then Premier, Mike Ahern, who was reing been ported in the Sunday-Mail of 13 August around the country. as follows: Mike Ahern yesterday said businesses which wanted daylight saving were welcomc to ""go alone"" with their own hours. In other words, he was abrogating the State's then legislative authority to determine the hours for the State of Queensland. He was basically saying to the community that if they wanted to have saving in their houses, in their places of employment or in their towns, by all means they could go ahead and do it. That was a pretty untenable position of and I do not need to speak at length to demonstrate the absolute absurdity of a a situation in which anybody in the State could determine what time they wanted Again, I refer to north Queensland because it is often cited as an area disadvantaged by daylight saving. The local government communities in north Queensland came out strongly in support of daylight saving and understandably in opposition to the go-it-alone, do-what-youapproach of the then National Party Government led by Mike Ahern. The Local Government authorities in Mackay, Cairns and Townsville have rallied behind Aid Atkinwho was then Brisbane's Lord Mayorthe busibid for daylight saving. Aid Tony Mooney, head of the Lahor-dominated Townsville City Council, said he backed the plan . . . Mackay's mayor, Aid Peter Jardine, is also fully supportive, but said daylight saving should be introduced throughout the state, or not at all. Of course, that is the only common sense position that one can take. It is the only basis upon which one can regulate times. That issue goes very much to the heart of Rethis debate. The Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia are not opto this Bill because of any opposition to daylight saving. It is worth noting some of the comments that have been of the made. The honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) in her contribution very strongly that, daylight saving havinstituted, it should at least be uniform Very sensibly, there is support for the concept of a uniform application of time it throughout the country; we should operate as a nation, at least with respect to when we set our clocks. That hardly seems to be a radical position; I would have thought it common sense. Similarly, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), who represents a part of Queensland that has been in the forefront of the campaign to have daylight saving introduced, in this House on 16 May 1991 said: . . . I support daylight-saving but I do have reservations, . . . that this is not a question of daylight-saving but a question of States' rights. There we have the real agenda-the real problem that honourable members opposite have. It is not just a problem they have when it comes to matters of when we should set our clocks. It has been evident in debates on industrial relations, on the environment, on health and a whole range of other areas. With respect to this Bill, Opposition members have come into the House saying, 'We support what the Bill is trying to do. We believe that all the States should agree on time zones, but we do not agree that we should say it. We do not agree that the Parliament should actually legislate to do that'. The hub of the debate is a States rights issue. The States rights issue has been reflected in other areas. In Australia, it is largely due to our development from colonies to Federation. It was in 1892, nearly 100 years ago, that the colonies decided it was best to reduce the number of time zones to three across the country. At about that time the States subsequently legislated to provide for standard time hours within their States. That emanated from that 1892 agreement of the colonies. One hundred years after the colonies agreed that we should have three time zones, one would think it was about time for the nation to adopt the view that it might just be mature enough to agree on time zones. Not only should the States agree to have basically the same times in all the States, but the national legislative body should also be able to legislate to implement it. It is a fairly damning indictment of the Opposition that it is unable to support this Bill because of its hang-ups on States rights. On an issue similar to this, honourable members are reminded of the absurdity of the Australian rail system, where rail gauges vary throughout the country so that the rolling stock has to be changed at the borders because of the same sorts of propositions that the Opposition harbours and has advanced in this debate. It is an absurdity for the Opposition to suggest that there is somehow a fundamental States rights issue that says the States have an ordained privilege to determine the hours that should apply in their own States, particularly when, as honourable members opposite have said in this House, they support the view contained in the Bill. The United States of America confronted a similar problem with States determining their time zones. In 1966 it had the good sense to introduce national uniform time legislation, which has ensured some degree of uniformity and consistency across the United States of America. I was a little surprised to find that it took America until 1966 to enact that legislation. I certainly would not think that we are in a position to criticise, given that in 1991 the Opposition is formally opposing a proposal that we should enact Australian legislation to have an Australian agreed standard on time. In Queensland we have now had a couple of trials of daylight saving time, most recently last summer. The response has been overwhelmingly in support of it. In April of last year the Brisbane Courier Mail reported the results of survey work conducted by the Brisbane City Council into the daylight saving trial. It said: Families spent more time in public libraries during the daylight saving trial . . . Use of council facilities including parks, bikeways, golf courses and swimming pools also increased. Its survey showed that its own employees enjoyed daylight saving and preferred it. They said they enjoyed driving to work in the cool mornings and getting home in the daylight hours. Significantly-somewhat unexpectedly for me-the survey found that absenteeism declined during the period of daylight saving. Work attendances actually improved. There were not only positive spinoffs with respect to people's quality of life as a result of daylight saving, but there were also quantifiable improvements in productivity and output-absenteeism fell. I would have thought that together those benefits would have been sufficient to lead to unanimous support for the proposition that the honourable member for Stirling has moved in this place. As I said, it is not to be. It would appear as though the Opposition has bedded itself into a States rights position that does not enable it to adopt even basic common sense propositions that are not controversial in the community but somehow attack a States rights principle that it holds dear, which I would be interested to hear it enunciate. I support the Bill. I know that the people of Brisbane support the Bill. What is more, I know that the people of Queensland support the Bill. The people of Australia, 100 years after the colonies agreed on standard time zones, have reached the point of maturity where they can accommodate the Australian Parliament saying, 'We should have some commonality across the country of how we set our clocks'. There is no doubt that this Parliament has the constitutional authority to enact this legislation; the Constitution quite expressly gives this Parliament power over measurements. That has been exercised with respect to weights and measures and a number of other scientific calculations. Mr Ronald Edwards-Decimal currency.",21
8,Mr BEVIS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"As the honourable member for Stirling correctly points out, the change to decimal currency is an example. In many respects, this debate is reminiscent of the debate on metrication and the sorts of concerns that were expressed by some about that. At least in that debate there was an acknowledgment of the right of this Parliament to enact the legislation. The absurdity of this debate and the absurdity of the position of Opposition members is that they accept the principles, the argument and the wisdom of this Bill but they cannot accept the authority of the Australian Parliament to legislate in this matter. That is a damning indictment upon them. It is an indictmcnt that reflects upon their attitudes in other policy areas. They would do well to reconsider their position and endorse this Bill, as does the Government.",25
9,Mr TUCKEY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and the person who has introduced the National Measurement (Standard Time) Amendment Bill, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), make a fundamental error in their premise about the rights of this Parliament and its constitutional powers. The first right and the fust responsibility of those two members is to the people. People have some varying vicws and, in a nation as physically large as Australia, that is not surprising. The honourable member for Brisbane wants to criticise the Opposition for taking a pcople oriented view. It is a long time since he has considered the people. His view is, 'I'm a trade union boss, I'm now a parliamentarian, they will do as the law allows me to impose upon them'. This legislation should not be known as a Bill for an Act to amend the Measurement Act; it should be called the Western Australian daylight saving Bill. The rest of Australia has made a decision on this matter: they have opted for daylight saving-and Western Australians say good luck to them. However, the situation is a little different in Western Australia. The Court Liberal Government succumbed to pressure from certain groups in the community and all owed a trial daylight saving period. If one is like the honourable member for Stirling and goes to the beach after work, one probably would like daylight saving. If onc were a businessman who does not want to go into work earlier in order to ring up people in the Eastern States, one might have a point of interest. However, those pressure groups eventually convinced the then Premicr of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court, to give daylight saving a trial. Being a people oriented politician, as opposed to that mob on the other side of this chamber who just keep jamming things down people's necks because they think they are in the interests of the people, Sir Charles Court then had a referendum. It was a little akin to what the Swiss, a highly democratic nation of long standing, do. What did the referendum provide? The people of Western Australia said, 'We have tried it; we don't like it', and they voted against daylight saving. Had they had a trial daylight saving period in the recent summer, when temperatures in Western Australia on two occasions passed 46 degrees centigrade, they might well have voted against it again. No doubt the honourable member for Stirling has ignored its effect on women with small children in his electorate because they do not have the time to go to the beach. In the recent summer the housewives of Perth found it very difficult to get their kids to go to bed in broad daylight-as well as 40 degrees centigradeplus temperatures-so they voted against it. Notwithstanding that, the Burke Government-I am not sure who in the business community dropped another $100,000 into the chaff bag, as I see it but called the leader's account; no doubt there was some influence somewhere because the Burke Government seems not to have done anything until the money was put up front-thought it would give daylight saving another go. I wrote to Brian Burke saying, 'I do not mind you giving it another go'. He was just going to have another referendum and I said, 'Let us have another trial'. Although the Burke Government was extremely popular at that time, the people of Western Australia rejected daylight saving again. The Liberal Opposition in Western Australia has said that it is prepared to give daylight saving another trial and to have another referendum. But the Premier of Western Australia, Dr Carmen Lawrence, has said, 'No referendum. We know what the outcome of that will be; we know what the people will say. They will reject it, so we will not have one of those silly little referendums. You either poke it down their necks or we are not interested' . She is not preparcd to go the whole hog, but the honourable member for Stirling thinks, 'We are going to lose most of our seats in Western Australia at the next election. I'm gone; I may as well at least make life more comfortable in my retirement and change the time zones in Western Australia so I can get to the beach for a bit longer each day'. Mr Sciacca-You don't really believe that, do you?",25
10,Mr TUCKEY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I do; 1 know you blokes. They do not believe in the people. The Australian Labor Party used to be a party of the people, but that finished a long time ago. Honourable members opposite constantly go through the Constitution looking for means to impose their rules on the people-and God save the people. When it suits those opposite to have political expediency-and we know the approach of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to political expediency-it will do anything, if it gets the Party a vote. The Prime Minister said that in Parliament. When the Government wanted to close down a public works project in Tasmania, it went to the foreign affairs power. That was an outrageous situation. The poor old founding fathers would have got gravel rash in their graves had they anticipated that the foreign affairs power granted to the Commonwealth would ever be abused in that way. The simple fact is that in two referendums the people of Western Australia have said no to daylight saving. That is the situation today, but the real fundamental is more power for the Commonwealth-let us abuse the Constitution. It is interesting to see that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for FremantIe (Mr Dawkins), has come into listen to this debate because he was the bloke who dug this one up. Over time, if this is imposed on the housewives of Western Australia, and I assume it will be, the honourable member for Fremantle will have to go around door knocking, because I do not think even his 13 per cent margin is safeif it is still that; I have not checked it recently. There is a fair likelihood that he will have to explain to a few housewives in his electorate why their kids are sweating in bed at 6 o'clock at night because the clock says it is 7 o'clock. There are other aspects to all of this. The business community in Western Australia seems to think it is necessary to get locked into the eastern States' time scale. But we are not passing a law to tell the people of Singapore, Hong Kong or Japan to get in line with us. In fact, Western Australia's time position under the present arrangements is very attractive to doing business with those people-our export markets. But of course that is to be ignored because some people do not like getting up early for work. There is no problem for the banking sector or the business sector in Western Australia; people just have to get to work a bit earlier so that they run their businesses in time with the people on the east coast. Some businessmen have said to me that they find it rather convenient to be able to come to work an hour earlier and do their business with the east coast prior to the local phones starting to ring. So there is not even a constant body of opinion amongst the business community in Western Australia. There are others who have discovered that, with that extra bit of time difference, they get more business from the eastern States because the eastern States have a longer period in which to ring them, or<;ier goods-such as an urgent part or something that is needed in order to keep a works going-which come back on our midnight flights and are available in Sydney the following morning. So it is not all a good idea and that is the sort of thing we should take some account of as well. But, more importantly, we are talking about the rights of Western Australians. They do not want it; they have said so. That is the point. But another factor is always ignored by people: that is, that Western Australians all live in the western extremity of Western Australia. They, almost entirely, live on the coast. When one looks at the time-eight hours in advance of what is now called coordinated universal time, it used to be Greenwich Mean Time-we find that the actual point where Western Australia becomes eight hours ahead of GMT is somewhere east of Southern Cross out Kalgoorlie way. In other words, the bulk of Western Australia's population has 30 minutes of daylight saving all the year round and they do not particularly believe they need another hour of it. That is what is different. It gets dark pretty early in Western Australia on the coast because one has to go 300 miles inland to be at the exact time point. I think this factor should be taken into account by people from this side of the world, who are assisted by a few Western Australian politicians who either have a private agenda or just do not care about the rights of individual Western Australians and their views expressed in referendums in the democratic process-which I thought we all stood to protect in this place. The simple fact is that the people have said 'no thank you' on two occasions and the Premier of Western Australia says she will not test them again because she knows they will give her the same answer again. But there is another aspect to all of this. If a national referendum were held, considering the huge population base on the east coast which has accepted daylight saving-notwithstanding that, even amongst themselves, the States have had some difficulty working out the exact times-no doubt the pressure of that huge vote would push Western Australia into that system. I heard the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) talk about commonality across the nation. It is not my preferred position but, if the Commonwealth feels it has all this power over time, let us get it right. Consequently, I have had an amendment circulated in my name that addresses that situation in the schedule. If we are fair dinkum about commonality of time, let us have it. Let us have the entire Australian continent on one time. That will give all the residents of the east coast permanent daylight saving because, obviously, we would go to a point nine hours ahead of GMT. It would mean that the eastern States could even have daylight saving in the winter time-and they seem to think it is such a good idea. The business tommunity would be satisfied because it would open its doors across Australia at the same time. It would be very dark in Western Ausis tralia. We would all go to work with headlights on all the year round, but that should not worry the honourable member for Stirling. It does not worry him that, in the opinion of most Western Austrato lians, they would be inconvenienced the summertime, so why not make a job of it? If those opposite want commonalthat ity-and I presume the honourable memThese ber for Brisbane is going to vote on this matter because he said commonality the cause and we should shrug off all the stupid States rights issues-let us have simple examples. one time for Australia. Let us alter the schedule of this legislation to put everyspend body nine hours in advance of coordinews nated universal time. I will move that amendment in the committee stage. I pect that, notwithstanding my opposition and that of the coalition parties to the total Bill, the Government would have vote for it on its rhetoric to date. It members of the Government who say that, in the interests of commonality, we should shrug off the fact there is genuine sition by the people of Western Australia it has finished. to this proposal. Why not have some fair dinkum commonality? I hope that some Labor members who have yet to speak on this Bill will make some remarks about that. It not my preferred position, but if those opposite really and truly believe that the Commonwealth has a role in this matter they should fix it up properly. If they not believe that the sun has something to do with the time of day and want to ignore that, if they do not believe in the established principles of coordinated versal time and want to start fiddling the clocks, let them fiddle with them ern properly-make a good job of it. That is how stupid this legislation is in the first instance. It is creating an artificial situaan tion. What people do not understand is that when all these things happen those who are not affected so much by the sun in the sky are those who just do things acinstead cording to the clock. They change the clock and put on the television at the same time as they did the day before. But for people who work in daylight hours it a huge imposition. In the rural areas, our people keep working because the sun is up. They are obliged to do that, particularly in these tough economic times imposed upon them by the recession we had have. It is a fact of life that when they income into watch, for instance, the 7 o'clock news on television, they will find it was on an hour ago; it has gone. people become very annoyed about that, but they have no solution, of course, is because the next day they have to work during daylight hours again. They are just Nobody says, 'People are now going to more time outside. The television should start at 7 o'clock daylight saving time or 8 o'clock daylight saving extime depending on which program people choose to watch'. The television stations do not do that. They leave the programs to on at the same time so that people such is as the honourable member for Stirling who like to go to the beach to exercise their muscles, or whatever they do there, do opponot see the news when they come home: Even in a situation that I object to, these other people do not make any adjustment in terms of indoor entertainis ment such as television which, if those opposite are going to make a real thing of daylight saving, should shift its programs back. Surely daylight saving is about do keeping people outside the house, outside the office. But that is not the case. That is how illogical this whole thing is. It is illogical because it is against the unimajority-preferred position expressed in with two referendums by the people of WestAustralia; it is illogical because it fiddles with a scientific calculation of time; and it is illogical because, having achieved opportunity, presumably, for people to spend more time outside on other forms of interest and entertainment, the Government now says, 'Come back inside because you now watch the news at 5 o'clock of 6 o'clock'. All those prime time television programs and the other things that attract people back into the house are being provided in direct opposition to daylight saving. I think it is stupid. It is not an issue of States' rights; it is an issue of people's rights. The people of the eastern States have opted for it. They like it; they tell me so. Good luck to them. I do not want to stand here as a member of parliament and say, 'As a Western Australian, I demand that you all forgo daylight saving. I;n fact, - am going a step further and will offer It all year because you like it'. The people of Western Australia do not like it, and I can find no reason to push it down their necks. That is a classic example of what is wrong with t-is Governm.ent. Origin.ally, the introductIOn of the BIll was a bIt of tokenism. The honourable member for Stirling looked at the referendum results in his electorate and found that there was a bigger vote for the i.ntro-uction of daylight saving than against It. That IS not surprising because of all the beach suburbs and public servants in his electorate. Public servants work flexitime anyway; most of the time they cannot be found when one rings them up. He thought, 'I'm going to have a very tough election ca.mpaign next time and a fe,:"" more campaI-n donations from the busmess community would not go astray; Brian Burke showed us how easy it is. I will put in a private member's Bill on Thursday morning'. That was a bit of a joke because we all know that we have an agreement between both sides of the House that says we do not vote on private members' Bills that come up on Thursday mornings. I made that point in Western Australia. I do not know whether we are debating this further today because of that or because suddenly the members of the Labor Party Caucus have found another way to grab a little more power for Canberra, poke it up the nose of people and dcmonstrate the power given to them under the Constitution. I do not know which it is, but it is wrong and it should not happen. If this Government has a total commitment to commonality and uniformity, let it vote for the amendment I will move in the committee stage. Let the Government show Australia that it is fair dinkum, that it truly believes that 9 o'clock i.s 9 .o'c-ock anywhere in Australia at any p.omt m tlm-, because that is the opportumty I offer It today. As I said, I do it reluctantly, because I really do not believe in this Bill in any form; but I want t.o tcst. the resol-e of this Government to stick WIth the lOgIC of its argument that all the doors shou-d open at the same time around Austraha and there should never be a difference in the time that they do so. Mr Bevis-There should be national coordination.",26
11,Mr TUCKEY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"That is being fair dinkum. I think I will see whether the honourable member for Brisbane will second the motion; after all, he has already made a plea in this place for commonality. Let me summarise my remarks. The people of Western Australia had two trials under two separate governments of opposing political colour. On both. occasions in the referendums, they rejected the proposal for daylight savin&. T-e Labor Premier of Western Austraha Said that if there was anothcr referendum, they wou'ld reject it again; but she still thinks they should have it, which makes her as bad as the people in this place, who propose to impose this measure on - estern Australians when they do not want It, and use Federal law to achieve it. I oppose the legislation, but,. as I expect it. to proceed in the commIttee stage I will move an a-endment to test the real integrity of this Government.",29
12,Mr DAWKINS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I support the National Measurement (Standard Time) Ame.ndment Bill. The speech that we have Just heard from the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) must go down as being one of his most cx-raordinary. It was a mishmash of confusIOn; he trotted out his well known prejudices about all kinds of groups in the community; and, most importantly, it was full 0'£ his usual hypocrisy-this apparent deSIre - o see people h-ve more control, somethmg totally at ddds with not only what he normally talks about but also what his Party stands for. Of course, as I will go on to say, the honourable member for O'Connor has got it absolutely wrong. His amendment, in fact, will have exactly the reverse effect to the one he intends. But once again, it is a question of the honourable member being too smart by half, something for which he is renowned in this Parliament and perhaps around the country. But before talking about the arguments of the honourable member for O'Connor, let me restate very briefly why this Bill is here today. There can be no question that the Commonwealth Parliament has the right to legislate in this area. The question of time is not just a national issue. It is, if anything, a universal issue, an international issue. In fact, it is a matter which is the subject of international agreements going back to around the turn of the century. Almost all nations have given effect to those international agreements and have done so through the processes of their national legislatures. That is what is proposed here. Notwithstanding the fact that before Federation all States enacted legislation to deal with time in their own areas, those States which came into the federation all agreed that the question of weights and measures should be one of those powers which the State parliaments would cede to the national Parliament. The fact that it has taken 90 years for us to do something about the regulation of time is no argument against our doing it now. It is simply the fact that we are now catching up with and trying to rectify an historic anomaly. But, unlike the honourable member for O'Connor, with his amendment and some of the rhetorical flourishes in which he engaged during the course of his speech, we are not trying to impose a system on the nation which is different from that already in existence. We are, in fact, intending to entrench the time zones which have been set by the States, except in one particular regard-that relating to summertime in Western Australia. There can be no question about the authority of this Parliament to legislate in this area and, indeed, we are only following the course which has been taken by national governments in other countries, including in federations like ours. Therefore, it is rather tendentious of those opposite to say that the Commonwealth does not have the power to legislate in this area when clearly it docs. Indeed, this power was exercised by a Liberal-Country Party government to give effect to metrication-the other part of the weights and measures system. So the important point here is that we are exercising a quite proper power of the national Parliament. We have listened to the honourable member for O'Connor with his quaint, even unbelievable, appeals to populism and the rights of individual Australians-of course forgetting that his is the Party which has for years agreed to entrenched gerrymanders and the malapportionment of electorates all around the place. That attitude ensured, of course, that there was no equality of representation in the Western Australian Parliament until such time as the Labor Party came to office in Western Australia and, in fact, did away with gerrymanders and malapportionment in that State. It is only since we overcame some of the resistance in Western Australia that we have achieved at least something approaching a fairer parliament than the one which the Party of the honourable member for O'Connor maintained, and maintained with a resolution which was verging on the passionate in terms of trying to ensure that the will of the people in Western Australia was never reflected accurately in their Parliament which was designed to represent them. Even now, we are a long way short of having a totally representative parliament in Western Australia. At least it is better, but let me say that what we are trying to do now is to give the opportunity to the elected Government of Western Australia to have the time zones which it wants but which opportunity the Legislative Council, dominated as it is by politically motivated members of the Liberal and National parties, seeks to deny. We are endeavouring to allow the elected Government of Western Australia to, in fact, provide the time zones which the Government wants and which the Government has made no secret about at the time of each election. If anyone had a strenuous opposition to daylight saving in Western Australia, no doubt that person would not have voted Labor at the last election because it has always been a part of the Labor policy there to give effect to daylight saving. Let us not carry on with this tongue-incheek appeal by the honourable member for O'Connor to acknowledge and reflect the will of the people because that is something for which he has, in so many ways, a very scant regard. I will not indulge myself, as he has done, and remind people of the way in which he has treated his public trust on occasions when he has had the opportunity.",29
13,Mr TUCKEY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,You'd better not.,31
14,Mr DAWKINS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I just might, but I do not think I will in the context of this debate. I have done it once or twice before. If anyone should hang his head in shame, in terms of his regard for the way in which he has dealt with his public oath and his public trust, it is the honourable member for O'Connor.",31
15,Mr TUCKEY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. What the Minister is saying is a reflection on me. He knows the procedures of this House; he can move an appropriate motion. I would be delighted to accommodate him on the issues, because he is a liar.",31
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will withdraw that phrase.,31
17,Mr TUCKEY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I will withdraw 'liar', but I sincerely hope that the Minister appropriately withdraws his allegations against me and, what is more, apologises.",31
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! There is no point of order.,31
19,Mr TUCKEY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I rise on a further point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Minister has reflected on my character very specifically and said that I have betrayed my trust. If that should not be withdrawn, I do not know what should.",31
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Order! The honourable member has made his point, but there is no point of order. I have listened very carefully to what the Minister has said. I do not believe that he has, so far, transgressed the Standing Orders, but he is getting very close to it and I advise the Minister to stick to the subject under debate.",31
21,Mr DAWKINS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"J will take your advice, Mr Deputy Speaker, and return to the subject matter of this debate. The point I want to make is that what is being attempted here is the proper exercise of the powers of the national Government. What is being portrayed on the other side of the Parliament is that in some way elected representatives in a State parliament are more responsive to the wishes of the people than are the elected representatives in this Parliament. I simply reject that out of hand. The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), I and everyone else-even the honourable members on the other sideare elected properly to represent the interests and the wishes of the people in their constituencies. The fact that those people also have representatives in a State parliament does not in any way suggest that their representatives in State parliament are in any way superior to us or better placed to represent their views. We are just as capable of understanding the interests of the people in our constituencies and exercising our national responsibilities in accordance with their wishes. That is precisely what is being done on this occasion-the proper exercise of a national function in pursuance of international agreements, and in pursuance of trying to get some sense into the way in which this country is managed in relation to time zones. The honourable member for O'Connor really does test our patience and our acceptance of any rationality on his part. In the first place he says, 'This is nothing to do with the national Parliament.' Then he says, 'But if it is going to be something to do with the national Parliament, we are not going to entrench the time zones which e)f.ist now, we are going to change them all,l We are going to impose a totally new system of time on everyone in Australia'. What the Government is doing with this Bill is entrenching the current time zones, except in one very small respect, that being summer time in Western Australia. The argument of the honourable member for O'Connor is totally facetious and fraudulent. He says, on the one hand, that the Commonwealth Parliament should not enact in this area but, on the other hand, he says that if we are going to, let us do the job properly and totally abandon the current system of time zones as has been established in the various States and Territories. I go one stage further. I have had experts from the National Standards Commission look at the honourable member for O'Connor's amendment. His amendment will, in fact, have precisely the reverse effect to that which he intends. It would give even more daylight saving to Western Australia than is being proposed in this measure and even less to the eastern States, which is of course the exact reverse of what he maintains. Indeed, in Perth in June, sunrise would occur at 8.10 a.m. The amazing suggestion is that this will do something about reversing the effect of the half-hour of daylight saving which Perth naturally has, but the honourable member for O'Connor, by this amendment, is in fact extending daylight saving even further. In Hobart in June, sunset would occur at about the time that kids left school-3.45 p.m. So in Hobart, under the honourable member for O'Connor's proposals, the kids would actually go home from school in the dark. What kind of craziness is this man up to on this occasion? It is a totally ridiculous proposition on his part which has the reverse effect to that which he intends. This is not surprising because, of course, it is not the first time that what he says in here and what he actually intends are at odds with each other. We must remember in this regard that what we are trying to do is to ensure that, if there is to be two hours difference between Western Australia and the eastern States in the wintertime, there should be two hours difference between Western Australia and the eastern States in the summertime as well. All that is being said here is that there ought to be a level of consistency for business in Western Australia-indeed for the normal citizens of Western Australia-not to mention those people who are trying to organise timetables for interstate transport and those people who are trying to organise programming for television and radio networks. Under this Bill, at least people know that if there is two hours difference between Perth and Sydney the difference will be two hours for the whole of the year and they will not be thrown into confusion in October and March of each year. That is the simple proposition of this Bill and it is the simple proposition of the Western Australian Government. It is only the politically inspired, conservative dominated Opposition in the Legislative Council which actually prevents this happening. Why does that happen? If the honourable member for O'Connor and honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) are really interested in this particular matter, why do they not give their legislative councillors a free vote on this question? Why do they not give all their members of parliament a free vote on this question? The reason they will not do so is that this is all about trying to stitch up ari arrangement between the Liberal Party and the National Party-something which has defeated them for almost 10 years. This is an indication of the Liberal Party being subservient to the National Party. Three or four National Party members in the Legislative Council are the tail that is wagging the Liberal Party dog. The Liberal Party is desperate to stitch up any sort of coalition with the National Party in Western Australia in order to put some semblance of a unified front so as to confront the Labor Government in that State. This is all about a sleazy backroom deal between the Liberal Party and the National Party. It has got nothing whatever to do with the interests of Western Australians. It certainly has nothing to do with the interests of metropolitan residents in Perth, who after all are represented in almost as many numbers by the Liberal Party as they are by the Labor Party. Many Liberal Party members in the State Parliament would like to have daylight saving and they resent the fact that it is the National Party in the Legislative Council which is preventing them from having it. Indeed, the new member for Cottesloe, Mr Colin Barnett, decided to initiate a Bill to achieve just that purpose. However, he was quickly put in his place when hc was told, 'No, we don't act in the interests of our constituents. We do not act in the intcrests of city dwellers in Perth. We have to do what the unrepresentative National Party wants us to do in order to try to secure some support from them on things which might advance their interests'. Just while we are on this question, let me say that the honourable member for O'Connor put the arguments of the honourable member for Stirling totally on their head. This is almost so trite an issue that one does not even want to mention it. Mr Carlton-What does it indicate?",31
22,Mr DAWKINS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,It just indicates how ridiculous-Mr Carlton-What has that got to do with running the country?,33
23,Mr DAWKINS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"What it has a lot to do with is a bit of sensible micro-economic reform which should not be denied to Western Australia. The honourable member for Mackellar is the great ideologue, the great theoretician, of the Liberal Partv. What additional cost does he think is volved in changing timetables for the airlines because of this nonsense, changing programming for the national broadcasting networks, not to mention the confusion which arises in business as a result of two hours in one part of the year becoming three hours in another part of the year? Mr Carlton-Go back and convince the people.",33
24,Mr DAWKINS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Here we have another populist-Mr Carlton-Have another referendum.,33
25,Mr DAWKINS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Another referendum! As you know, any referendum-",33
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! The Minister will address the Chair and members of the Opposition will address themselves to themselves. I call the Minister again.,33
27,Mr DAWKINS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me return to this squalid little argument of the honourable member for O'Connor which says that the honourable member for Stirling really wants daylight saving so that he can have more time at the beach in the afternoons. In fact, the honourable member for Stirling goes to the beaeh in the morning, therefore daylight saving will be a disadvantage to him, not an advantage. If the honourable member for O'Connor is going to trot out his prejudices and his dishonesty, he should at least do it on a consistent basis and understand what he is doing. The most classic and glaring absurdity of what the honourable member for O'Connor is on about is that he says that the national Parliament should not legislate in this area but that, if we do, we should pay no regard to what anyone anywhere in Australia wants. He would have us change all the time zones of everyone in Australia and, not only that, but in exactly the reverse of what he wants. His amendment will give Western Australia more daylight saving than what is being proposed here and it will give the eastern States less, when that is what he says they want. So he wants to deny the ineastern States the daylight saving that they want and to give it to Western Australia in even greater quantities than he says they want. Where is this man coming from and where is he going to? It is no wonder that once again he been discarded to the back bench. Let us come back to the real crux of this issue. It is a question of saying that if there is a two-hour time difference between Perth and Sydney-and no-one is denying that or trying to change it-let us keep it at two hours throughout the year rather than having the enormous inconvenience and confusion of a three hour difference i between October and March. On occasions, the Liberal Party seems to be concerned about tackling some of the issues and doing something about the enormous problems of trying to do business in this Federation where we have different rules for all kinds of things in the various States. Where the Commonwealth has an undisputed power to try to bring about a bit of sensible rationality to the conduct of business in this countrywhich is difficult enough, as honourable members opposite all know, in a country like this, which has so much power of regulation in the hands of the States-at least it can act sensibly and accept its international and national responsibilities to give effect to time zones. At least we can ensure that there is a greater measure of consistency which will make the difficult task of doing business and conducting commerce between one side of the country and the other a little more predictable and a little more simple. That is really what this is all about. We do not have to get carried away about States rights; we do not have to get carried away about referendums, which will always be equally divided on this issue. This is a question of taking our national responsibilities seriously and doing something sensible.",33
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,34
29,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I rise to speak this morning on the National Measurement (Standard Time) Amendment Bill, a most important piece of legislation. Here we have one of the most senior Ministers in Cabinet-Mr Beale-The next Treasurer.",34
30,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"He possibly will be the next Treasurer; who knows? Who knows what is happening in the Government? It is in absolute chaos, in anarchy. At a time when this country is in dire economic straits, in great economic chaos, one of the most senior Ministers in the Cabinet, who has an obvious economic portfolio, comes in here aspiring to be the Treasurer of this country and wastes 20 minutes of his valuable time on this Bill. It is absolutely unbelievable and it demeans the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). Mr Beale-He just said he would not waste any more.",34
31,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,He will not waste any more? Mr Beale-He thinks he wasted the last 20 minutes.,34
32,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,He means he has wasted the time.,34
33,Mr TUCKEY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Perhaps we might be better off with him in here rather than back in his office.,34
34,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! Members of the Opposition will address the Chair and the subject matter before the House.,34
35,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, it is relevant, because it does show a certain course of behaviour by the Minister. He comes in here and wastes 20 minutes of his valuable time while there are vast queues of unemployed people waiting for him to do something about this country's dire unemployment situation. He talks about a Bill which effectively tries to take away what is in reality the decision making rights of the people of Western Australia in order to deflect people's attention away from the major issues of the day. After the incredible decision to ban mining at Coronation Hill, I imagine the whole place now has been taken over by Bula. It is not fading curtains which should be worrying members of the Federal Government at present; it is the fact that it is curtains for them unless they do something about this country's economic situation. The Minister for one million unemployed has been in here wasting his time while the dole queues are getting longer and longer. He has been talking about democracy and rights; he has been talking about the rights of the Federal Parliament to impose measurements on the people of Western Australia. If the Minister wants to talk about democracy, perhaps he ought to talk about the democratic process in the Cabinet. The decision on Coronation Hill was 12 to 8. The Minister was one of the 12. Yet at the end of the day Cabinet allowed the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), that poor old chap, to get away with it when he was in a clear minority. My message to the Minister, after his woeful performance, is that he should go back to his ministry and start looking after the interests of the long queues of the unemployed, many of whom are in the electorate of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards). They are probably waiting for some action. I oppose this Bill. It is not a question of whether I support the Bill's intent or whether I am in support of daylight saving; it is a question of who should decide whether there should be daylight saving in Western Australia. Regardless of the merits of this Bill and whether it is right or wrong, it is still the people of Western Australia who should dccide in the end whether their lives or their lifestyle should bc altered or affected by the Bill proposed by the honourable member for Stirling. Let us bear in mind that in Western Australia there is only a very small population in relative terms. We know that the great centres of business in this country are in the eastern States, but it is important that the interests of people in Western Australia are properly represented. I and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) have come today to talk about the Bill and to speak against the Bill in order to represent those interests properly. As we know, over the years the Western Australian Parliament has heard a number of debates on the question of daylight saving; to date, they have failed to resolve the situation once and for all. In the end it is the Western Australian Parliament and the members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council who have to decide whether the people of Western Australia will effectively have one hour of daylight saving in the summer time. The Western Australian Parliament should decide on this particular matter because thosc members of the Western Australian Parliament are a lot closer to the people of Western Australia than those Federal members who may come from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Tasmania, or anywhere else for that matter. They are obviously in a better position to know what the Western Australian people really aspire to when it comes to the question of their daylight saving or their hours of business. One of the unfortunate situations in the Western Australian Parliament is that the State Labor Government wants to impose daylight saving on the people of Western Australia, even though there are many in the community in Western Australia who do not wish to sec that occur. Unfortunately for those Labor members in Western Australia, they now represent only about 25 per cent of the population. They are at an all time historical low as far as the polls go. I imagine that that is of great concern to those members in marginal seats, such as the honourable member for Stirling, to the extent that they are trying to draw up some sort of issue that will deflect the attention of the people of Western Australia from those great economic problems that are occurring there. We only have to took at the situation nationally with the recession which is the worse since the Great Depression and the 1920s. We have mass unemployment, as I have already mentioned. Virtually one million people are in the dole queues. We have a crippling national debt of $140 billion. Mr O'Keefe-Is this all to do with when the sun rises?",34
36,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"It has a lot to do with why this Bill is before the Parliament today. The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) knows very well why it is here today, It is to take the minds of people in Western Australia off the main issue, the main game. When we look at the two economic basket cases in this country, one of which is the honourable member's Labor Government in Victoria, then - e understand why this Bill is before us on this day when we have been recalled to determine matters of importance. Wc arc now dealing with what is effectively something that can be well and truly decided, and determined in Western Australia and in the Western Australian Parliament. At a time when we have all these great problems of mass unemployment, economic recession, huge financial problems in the States of Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia, we are here today debating a Bill about whether there should be daylight saving in Western Australia. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is this a matter of great national importance? Of course it is not. It is only here to deflect people's attention from the main game. We know that. We ask ourselves: why the hurry to get this Bill on today? Why the hurry to deal with the Bill today? Why has it come on? Mr O'Keefe-Are you part of the country?",35
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! The honourable member is listed to speak and he will have his chance to speak in the debate later.,36
38,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, he has little to say and he is probably interjecting merely because he will have nothing to say at the next opportunity when he speaks. Let us also look at the other reason why this Bill is before us today. At present in Western Australia we have the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters examining the dealings of the State Labor governments of Western Australia from 1983 to 1990. The honourable member for Stirling grimaces. I know that the honourable member for Stirling has taken an interest in criticising the Burke governments. I acknowledge the fact that he has criticised the Burke governments. The honourable member for Stirling should also acknowledge that this Bill is not a matter of import to the nation. It is a matter of import to the people of Western Australia. At a time when the Royal Commission is hearing daily revelations about such issues as the casino, et cetera, this is precisely the sort of diversionary smokescreen that is likely to deflect people's minds to the issue of daylight saving. Mr O'Keefe-Can you tell the time? You haven't mentioned it yet.",36
39,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I will come to that very shortly. Mr O'Keefe-Good. Well, let's hear about it.",36
40,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"The honourable member for Burke, who now has his feet up on his desk, will hear it very shortly. Mr O'Keefe-Point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker!",36
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Are you calling a point of order? If you are you should rise to your feet. Mr O'Keefe-I will let him voluntarily correct himself.,36
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Order! If the honourable member for Burke is calling a point of order he will rise to his feet and do it formally or he will not call a point of order. Does he call a point of order? Mr O'Keefe-No, I do not, Mr Deputy Speaker.",36
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Please respect the Chair.,36
44,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was obviously going to be a frivolous point of order.",36
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,The honourable member for Moore will not comment on what comes from the Chair.,36
46,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I take your point, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let us have a quick look at the history of daylight saving in Western Australia. Let us look at what has effectively happened in relation to daylight saving. We all know that one-hour daylight saving was introduced first in Australia in 1917 but was abandoned the same year by public demand. It was reintroduced in all States in 1942 by the Australian Government, acting under national security regulations during World War II, to conserve coal and electricity. The scheme remained in effect until 1944, although Western Australia was granted exemption earlier following strong representations from the electors of that State. They claimed, amongst other things, that the time change caused inconvenience and hardship to many sections of the community, such as shift workers and farmers. Over the years the issue has been a matter of public debate. As the honourable member for O'Connor has already acknowledged, it was under the Court Liberal Government that daylight saving was experimented with in 1974. There was a referendum on the issue in 1975. Do honourable members opposite know what a referendum is? It is when the people determine what they feel about a particular issue.",36
47,Mr TUCKEY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,It's a secret ballot.,37
48,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Yes, it is a secret ballot, something that honourable members opposite would know little about. Following a referendum in 1975, the daylight savings scheme was abandoned. We now find ourselves moving into recent times. Recent surveys and polls have been taken to try to determine exactly how the Western Australian people feel about the issue of daylight saving. Let us look at the referendum of 1975. In that referendum 250,000 people, or thereabouts, voted 'yes' and 290,000 people voted 'no', which was about a ratio of 87 : 54. In April 1984, 54 per cent of the voters were opposed to the proposal. Each time the country part of Western Australia was heavily opposed. The strongest 'yes' votes came from-and the honourable member for Stirling will acknowledge this-areas in his electorate and my electorate. For instance, in the State seat of Whitford, the strongest 'yes' vote was registered and also in Joondalup. It was also registered very strongly in Karrinyup, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Stirling, and also in Balga and Nollamara-which are also in that electorate-as well as in other areas. Ironically, in the city the strongest 'no' vote came from areas such as Floreat, Cottesloe, Fremantle and Perth. Hence, we can perhaps understand some of the problems in trying to determine the exact feeling of the Western Australian people towards this particular issue. I acknowledge to the honourable member for Burke and the honourable member for Stirling that I support daylight saving. Mr O'Keefe-Of course you do.",37
49,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,My particular opinion about daylight saving should not be imposed-,37
50,Mr MELHAM,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,It's called secession for Western Australia.,37
51,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,It is not called secession at all; it is called allowing the people to decide. The honourable member for 'Blanks' has come into this House to interject. Mr o 'Keefe-You have confirmed my judgments about you.,37
52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! I warn the honourable member for O'Keefe that he should not interject at this time.,37
53,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"The Confederation of Western Australian Industry did a survey. Four hundred businesses returned responses to that survey. The results showed that 79.4 per cent were in favour of daylight saving and 19.3 per cent were against it. I think about 1.3 per cent offered no preference. There was a clear determination by sections of the business community that they wanted daylight saving. I acknowledge that because it is important to look at the facts and look at exactly what Western Australians feel about this particular issue. Small businesses which responded, those with no more than 20 employees, were 78 per cent in favour. Then we have the other confusing surveys coming into play. For instance, the there Morgan Gallup poll on 2 April 1991 showed that support for daylight saving was down by 14 per cent to 47 per cent of the community. This indicates that there is no clear majority for or against daylight saving. Opposition to daylight saving had risen before that period by 8 per cent to 40 per cent. Approximately 13 per cent of the community has no opinion either one way or the other. The television stations have conducted straw polls from time to time. I might say that more than 24,000 people registered a yes vote for daylight saving in the Channel 9 poll. In a 1989 poll there was a break of a1;>out 56 per cent to 46 per cent in favour of daylight saving. I concede that in the metropolitan area people wish to have daylight saving; I acknowledge that, but I am not arguing from that viewpoint. In addition, private research conducted by Channel 7 found that in the city 64 per cent voted yes and 36 per cent voted no, while in the country those results were exactly reversed, with 36 per cent voting yes and 64 per cent voting no. In 1989 Channel 10 had an overwhelming yes result in a poll on daylight saving. However, on 12 May 1989 a Westpoll showed that a majority of people in the city were against daylight saving and an overwhelming majority of people in the country were against it. It is highly confusing to try to determine the feelings of Western Australians from straw polls or from television surveys, and it is obviously very difficult to properly represent the views of people in that State. In dealing with this matter in the Western Australian Parliament recently, the Opposition parties there put forward what I consider to be a very sensible proposition. I would like to inform the House exactly what this proposition is because it is important to bear it in mind when we come to consider whethcr this Bill is worthy of support. The State Opposition has detcrmined that the next time legislation to bring in daylight saving is introduced by the Premier, Dr Carmen Lawrence, the Opposition will agree to it with the following provisions: that there be a trial period for daylight saving followcd by a referendum, and the decision of that referendum would be accepted by the State Government. In other words, the amended legislation would bind the State Government to accept the results of the referendum. There would also be built into that an option to allow rural communities to commence work an hour later during the period of daylight saving. Similar legislation was adopted in Queensland. I consider that proposed solution to this problem to be the most sensible way of dealing with what is a very difficult decision. The decision should be made by the Western Australian Parliament because the members of the Western Australian Parliament are more likely to be more knowledgeable of the will of the Western Australian people than members of parliament from other States. J am not putting an idle States' rights argument on this; I do not think that would be appropriate. However, we are talking about an issue which would affect people's lives. Their lives would be affected by a difference of one hour during daylight saving. Obviously, it is important that a decision that affects people's lives in such a way should be made by the people who are closest to them, and those people are the members of the Western Australian Parliament. I might add that the Labor Premier of Western Australia has also rejected the Bill proposed by the honourable member for Stirling. Under the circumstances, and bearing in mind the great problems that this country has at the moment and the relative unimportance of this Bill in terms of the national crisis, we should leave this matter to the Western Australian Parliament-which, after all, has somc very sensible solutions in front of it-to determine whether the people of Western Australia will have daylight saving. We should not use the argument used by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), which is that because the Government has the power it should use it, whether the people want daylight saving or not. That is the old argument of the Kirribilli conspiracy-the end justifies the means; might is right; if the Government has the power, it should use it whether the people want it or not because that is the way the Government operates in this particular political system, and woe to anyone who does not agree.",37
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,38
55,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Burke) (11.54 a.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, at the outset I must apologise for being a little unruly during the contribution made by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), but I have worked with him on some committees and I regard him as an intelligent man who occasionally makes a sensible contribution. He just was not doing himself justice with the drivel he went on with at the start of his contribution. I totally support the initiative of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) in introducing the National Measurement (Standard Time) Amendment Bill. I had to chuckle at the thought that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), has been through this whole argument in Queensland for the last three decades. One of the early initiatives of the State Government was to bring Queensland into the twentieth century by introducing times standard with the rest of the east coast. I guess the Minister will be able to reassure us that the sun still rises in the east and sets in the west and that Queensland has managed to cope with that transition. Some 10 or 15 minutes into the contribution of the honourable member for Moore he finally showed his true position, which is that he supports the introduction of daylight saving in Western Australia and what rational man could not? Let us get to the point that the honourable member for Stirling is trying to expose, which is that it is the conservative and retrograde upper House in Western Australia that is blocking this attempt to bring Western Australia into the national time zones during daylight saving, and doing it for all the worse reasons that have been used in the past by conservative governments and elements of conservative political parties. When put to the testand when daylight saving has actually been introduced-it is all found to be a nonsense and a sort of witchery and demagoguery. I will tell the House about the Victorian experience and the dairy industry. I do not know whether the cows in Western Australia wear watches or, indeed, what the problem over there is, but the cows of Victoria have been able to handle daylight saving. The dairy industry in Victoria is still the most productive dairy industry in Australia. Victorian cows still seem to get milked in the morning, the milk seems to get to the factories, it seems to get turned into milk products and we do it all very well. Representatives from Western Australia can reassure their colleagues in the Western Australian upper House that the end will not fall out of the cows' world if Western Australia changes to daylight saving. I can reassure them of that. Mr Beddall-Are you 'udderly' sure about that?",38
56,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Yes, I am sure about that. I am a member of the Prime Minister's country task force. I have travelled all over Australia looking at rural areas and I have yet to see cows anywhere suffering because of daylight saving. Tell the West Australians not to worry about that; it is okay. Let us get to some serious aspects. The Australian economy is such that we need to take a very serious look at energy consumption and we must rationalise the production and use of energy on a national grid. In world parameters it is becoming very clear that pollution derived from the production of energy and the greenhouse gas emissions flowing from that will no longer be tolerated on a world scale. Countries around the world are committing themselves to the principles that have been agreed to. The Hawke Labor Government has committed itself to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2005, which is the international target date. This means that one way or another energy efficiencies will be forced upon the world. Energy will either become more costly as part of that process or the countries which are best at energy conservation will gain economic advantages. One of the significant gains from the use of daylight saving is the savings in energy that come about from bringing industrial and workplace use of energy forward in the morning, so that maximum usc is made of natural light and solar processes. That is a fact of life. I see that the honourable member for Stirling agrees. If Western Australia intends to be part of the national drive to maximise energy efficiencies, it will have to take the benefits which are &0 obvious in the other States and which come about with the introduction of daylight saving. The other great argument that the Country Party conservatives always trot out is the effect that daylight saving will have on family values-we cannot get the children to sleep at night. It has been my experience that daylight saving has meant that in many families there is much more leisure and recreation time for parents to spend with their children towards the end of the day because work is over earlier in light times-not in actual watching the clock times. In other words, we have an extra hour of light towards the end of the day. Certainly, in my part of Victoria it is very common to see families going, for instance, to Lake Eppalock for an evening barbecue or picnic, or families doing things together, be it at the tennis courts, at the local cricket ground or the basketball courts. Because there is a little more time to do outdoor things, in the garden or wherever, families actually benefit from an opportunity to do things together outside rather than perhaps sitting inside watching a television set when there is not much communication between family members. So I ask my farmer friends to have a broader perspective. The children will still insist on their seven or eight hours sleep per night. Once they get past the first couple of days of the introduction of daylight saving and the body adjusts to the slight change in time mechanisms the kids still get tired at night. They still go to bed, they still sleep and they still get up in the morning. So this view that in some way it is imposing on normal family life and cutting back opportunities for family leisure and recreation is another conservative nonsense which does not stand up to scrutiny when one looks at what has happened where daylight saving has been introduced. All of those things address-as the honourable member for Stirling pointed out in his introductory speech-the fact that there are significant benefits for Western Australia in moving to daylight saving. But I want to say something about the rest of Australia. The fact of the ter is that Western Australia is part of this nation and many people have reason to deal, in one form or another-be it in transport, business, or family relationships-with Western Australians. People do find the differences in time zones both frustrating and, at times, confusing. People often try to ring someone in Western Australia because it is about 10 o'clock in the morning and they think, instinctively 'They'll be on deck now, we'll give them a quick ring' but there is no answer.",39
57,Mr FILING,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,There is two hours difference anyway.,40
58,Mr OKEEFE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"We are all quite comfortable with two hours, but when it becomes three-because the conservatives cannot sort if out-we then have to start making adjustments and the rest of Australia has to deal with this. It means that in order to conduct normal business activities and reach someone who is still at work at 5 o'clock in the afternoon in Perth, one is making phone calls at 8 o'clock at night. All I am saying is that there are efficiencies which the rest of us would like to have flow through to the whole economy. So I ask the honourable member for Moore to convey to his colleagues in the upper House in Western Australia the fact that their belligerence on this issue in fact causes inefficiencies and frustrations for other Australians. I know that they are secessionists by nature and that they would like to have their own little kingdom over there, but they can go out to Hutt River Province for a bit of that. If they are going to be a part of the real world and a part of Australia they should act like it. The farmers will gain real efficiencies in the use of their time and the cows will not object-they really will not object. I promise that I have never seen the cows anywhere stack on a turn about daylight saving. The kids will still sleep at night. But, in all seriousness, there are very real energy efficiencies to be gained in the Western Australian economy and I commend the honourable member for Stirling for his initiative. As I said earlier, I was mat- frustrated by the honourable member for Moore putting the view that in some way or other the honourable member for Stirling was bringing this matter forward as some kind of distraction from other political problems in Western Australia. That is a nonsense proposal. Anybody who knows the honourable member for Stirling knows that his commitment to ensuring outcomes which make sense for people in his electorate cannot be questioned. He has brought forward a very sensible proposal which no intelligent person in this House could argue against. The honourable member for Moore will be embarrassed by this, but that is why, halfway through this speech, he had to qualify all of the garbage by saying, 'Of course I support daylight saving'. Now he is saying, '1 support it but I'm leaving it to them to make the decision'. This brings me to the final point I wish to make. Should we wait while the Western Australian upper House evolves to the same situation as the rest of Australia or should we say, as the honourable member for Stirling has, that this is a national qucstion? Perhaps, in approving the honourable member's legislative proposal, we might be giving a signal to the Premiers and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in their ongoing talks about a fruitful change of powers between the States and the Federal Government that we should have a national time measurement and time zone structure. Maybe the quickest way to bring Western Australia in line with the rcst of Australia in this context is to take a national approach to the matter. That is what the honourable member for Stirling is recommending in his legislation and I am very happy to support him. But I do not think the honourable membcr for Moore, who as I said earlier has been known to make a sensible and intelligent contribution around the place from time to time, did himself justice with his approach. I was glad to hear him concede during his contribution that he docs support daylight saving and that he will vote in favour of the proposal which has bcen introduced by the honourable member for Stirling. 1\11' TRUSS (Wide Bay) (12.07 p.m.)The National Measurement (Standard Time) Amendment Bill does not actually mention the words 'daylight saving' but it is quite clear that its intent is to force States which have chosen not to manipulate their time zones into adopting the same kind of standards as are applied in other States-in other words, to force States to adopt daylight saving. MI' Cobb-By deception.",40
59,Mr TRUSS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"By deception or other means. Certainly, I guess we should not be surprised to see this attempt to stamp on the rights of the States coming from a Labor Government which is, after all, a ccntralist government which believes that everyone should look and be the same. However, the States have rights in these areas. There are differences of opinion and very strongly held views. Clearly, Australians who live in various parts of this continent have the right to have different views on questions such as this. We know that there has been a lot of trouble about this issue in Western Australia. It seems that the Western Australian Labor Government has been unable to make up its mind on what it should do about this question. InitiallY, the Minister ex- for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on 8 December 1990 revealed a plan to force Western Australia to adopt daylight saving. That plan was devised despite the fact that Western Australia had had two previous trials of daylight saving and two previous referendums. In 1975, 53 per cent of Western Australians, after having endured daylight saving for a year, said that they did not want it any more and the Government of the day responded to their wishes. In 1984, the pressure had built up onee again so there was another trial period in Western Australia. But this time 55 per cent of Western Australians decided that they did not want any more daylight saving. So, again, the Government of the day went along with the wishes of the people at that time. We have reached the stage where we have this particular Bill. A minority of Western Australians would like to have daylight saving but a majority do not wish to have it. Those views are apparent in other parts of Australia as well. It is quite clear that people in southern Australia have a great desire and a great support for daylight saving whereas those in northern Australia have different views. It seems that this Bill is endeavouring to inflict the will of southern Australians on those in northern and western parts of this continent by telling them how thcy should tell the time. That kind of heavyhanded approach fails to acknowledge the legitimate differences of opinion which exist in this particular arca. A majority opinion does not seem to be important to Labor; it just wants to have an exercise in thuggery to bully Western Australia and other States into adopting what it considers is best for all people. The Western Australian Premier, Dr Lawrence, seems to be uncertain; or is she just attempting to have distant Canberra make a decision that is too hard for her to make herself? So we progress to the stage where the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) has introduced this Bill as a private member's Bill, but now, surprismgly, the Government has decided to take it on, presumably as part of one of the latest trade-off deals in the leadership row. It seems that this Bill has now been brought forward to suit one particular faction to get it to vote for one particular candidate whenever the next leadership challenge might come along. So the Australian Labor Party is demonstrating once again how out of touch it is with the feelings of real Australians. Daylight saving is not some nebulous, academic issue; it is not something where there are all sorts of mysterious concepts that are not widely understood in the community. Basically, all Australians have firm opinions. There are few who are undecided; everyone has strong views. Everyone has experienced daylight saving and knows whether they like it or not. It is not simply a matter of obscuring this legislation in concepts that ordinary Australians would not understand. They all have opinions on the issue and hold them very strongly. Queensland, too, has had two daylight saving trials-both, I might add, introduced by National Party governments. The first was in 1971 and the second more recently in. 1989. In 1971, there was no referendum following the trial. There did not need to be because there was sllch overwhelming opposition that the Government of the day decided not to continue with daylight saving. In 1989, the pressure had built up again to such an extent that there was a further trial. Again, th.ere was no referendum following the tnal, but there was a committee of review to look at the various complaints and advantages put forward after a year's experience with daylight saving. That committee of review, after looking at all the submissions, came up with the proposal that the daylight saving trial had worked well for some but not for many others. It proposed splitting the State into t:"",o sepa.rate time zones, one with daylIght savmg and the other without it. I - elieve the Government was right to reJect that committee of inquiry's findings. Clearly, that would havc caused confusion as the line would have split towns and communities and caused obvious inconvenience to many people. About that time we had a change of government. The new Labor Govcrnment declared it would have daylight saving regardless of whether people wanted it. So daylight saving has continued in the State of Queensland. There has been a degree of selfishness on the part of those who got what they wanted by their refusal to extend any worthwhile concessions to the vast area of the State that is still opposed to .daylight saving. That was very disappomtmg and has tended to accentuate the differences and the intensity of feeling that currently exist. For instance, the television stations were not prepared to run weather forccasts later in the evening so that country people could see them; they were not prepared to reschedule programs to a time when people were able to watch them. I think that kind of selfishness by those who got what they wanted has helped to entrench the bitterness that currently exists in that area. It is interesting to note that the pressure for the additional trial in 1989 for daylight saving was led by none other than the then Mayor of Brisbane, Sallyanne Atkinson. The response of the people of Brisbane to her was quite apparent at the last election. Daylight saving helped to destroy Sallyanne Atkinson. It certainly destabilised former Premier Ahern's leadership in Queensland. It was not much longer after he introduced daylight saving in Queensland that he fell from the leadership and was replaced by another leader of the National Party who did not support daylight saving. It is also quite clear that Premier Goss will see this issue as being one which will contribute to his downfall as Premier of Queensland. There are very strong views there. The Goss Government has refused to hold a referendum in Queensland for the obvious reason that it knows it will not be supported. Premier Goss knows there is still majority opposition in Queensland to daylight saving. That has been demonstrated through public opinion polls, television surveys and the like. He could have had a referendum in association with the last local government elections. He forced a referendum on the people with regard to four year parliamentary terms at that time but chose not to have one on daylight saving because he knew, as well as everyone else, that only in Brisbane is there majority support for daylight saving. Even on the coastal areas around the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, support is at best fifty-fifty. As soon as we move out into country areas, particularly in the north and west, opposition mounts. When we get into the extreme west and the extreme north, there is almost universal opposition. That opposition is bipartisan. The Labor members of parliament speak out against daylight saving just as strongly as National Party members. It needs to be recognised that as we move north we also move west so that we end up with a degree of natural daylight saving in States such as Queensland. Cairns is roughly in line with Charleville and not much farther east than Broken Hill. By the time we get to Mount Isa we are approximately in line with Adelaide. At Mount Isa, at the end of the daylight saving period in Queensland, the sun rises at about 8.15 a.m. and so similar conditions apply to those in South Australia. There is no long twilight in the north as there is in the south of Australia and so the alleged benefits that accrue from daylight saving are not nearly as apparent in Queensland. Forcing Western Australia, the Northern Territory and other States into daylight saving will not create a uniform panacea for the whole of Australia; indeed, it will not create time uniformity. Australia is a vast country and, with or without daylight saving, we will still have a number of time zones-at least three. If we count the Australian Territories, there are at least seven separate time zones. Australia is not uncommon in that regard. All large countries have a considerable number of time zones. If there is confusion, that will still be there; if there are business disadvantages, they will still apply. Of course, the alleged national benefits from daylight saving are at best minimal. What benefits there may be are offset by the losses caused by not taking advantage of the differences that occur as a result of our vast climatic variations. Australia is a huge country with vast variations not only of climate, temperature and the like but also of day length. We should not see those as disadvantages that need to be corrected by some kind of manipulation of the clocks but as factors that we can take advantage of and use. It is acknowledged that daylight saving has some considerable disadvantages. It requires many children to travel to and from school in the dark or in the heat of the day. It extends the working day and results in exhaustion, strife, short tempers and the like. There can be no doubt that that is a clear fact of life, a clear fact of experience, that can be attested to by so many mothers and families around Australia. As one who lives in a country area, I know that in daylight saving time meetings start at 9 o'clock instead of 8 o'clock. At times such as harvest there is considerable disadvantage as the depots close as the best harvest time is about to begin; there is no i service available for machinery during the best time for harvesting at the best part of the day. Dairying and similar tasks have to be undertaken at inconvenient times to suit the factories and the processing arrangements. The same applies to vegetable growers and some other industries as well. Forcing uniformity might be good socialism, but it does nothing to advance the natural disparity and diversity that occurs in a country such as Australia. The States are best equipped and best able to make decisions on these matters, and the heavy-handed Commonwealth should stay out of it and leave the States to make their own decisions. Southerners are very quick to ridicule the anti-daylight saving arguments. They like to laugh at stories of faded curtains and drying grass, but the arguments supporting daylight saving are equally easy to ridicule and make fun of. We are told that daylight saving creates longer days. That is absolute nonsense. The gap between sun-up and sundown does not alter one bit. There is no extra daylight at all. Daylight saving merely creates a system to con people into making better use of daylight. It is a prop for lazy people to get them out of bed a little earlier in the morning. All anyone who wants to make better use of the daylight has to do is get out of bed a bit earlier in the morning. There is no law against factories and shops opening at 8 a.m. instead of 9 a.m. The Australian Stock Exchange can start at 9 in the morning instead of 10 if it chooses. Particularly in these days of flexi-time, there are all sorts of different starting hours anyway. Whatever time is gained at the end of the day is lost at the beginning of the day. Clearly, daylight saving does nothing at all to make days longer or improve the opportunity for productivity. It is often said that daylight saving helps tourism. There is no evidence to support the argument that more people go on holidays because of daylight saving. If there is ever a time when we can get out of bed whenever we choose, it is when we are on holidays. If ever there is a time when we are masters of our own time, it is when we have no business or other commitments. The use we choose to make of daylight hours during our holiday times is completely within our own destiny. If resorts want to fiddle their time, that is okay; that does not interfere with anybody else, and they should be free and able to do that kind of thing. We are told that we need to have time uniformity. I have already pointed out that we do not have that, with or without daylight saving. There are still at least seven separate time zones in Australia. We also have different starting and finishing dates for daylight saving. We seem to be surviving all of that quite well. If there is an argument that we lose business time as a result of different opening or closing hours in particular States-and it has not disadvantaged South Australia and Western Australia all that much over the years-how can those same people agree to have such things as flexi-time? That has done far more damage to the standard opening and closing times of Australia than daylight saving will ever do or has ever done. If anything has extended the lunch hour over countless hours, it has been flexi-time, not daylight saving.  off in this building.",41
60,Mr TRUSS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Or switch the lights off whenever we choose to do so. These days, as we internationalise our economy and deal internationally, a lot of that work is done at night, anyway. It does not seem to have worried the business community too much. The arguments in favour of supporting the business community in relation to daylight saving are flimsy and threadbare to say the least. We are told also that daylight saving saves money and is an important part of micro-economic reform. This again defies logic. If true, it suggests that the streetlights will be on for a shorter period because of daylight saving-again, clearly a nonsense. Just as there is no extra daylight, there is no extra night light; so the amount of time that lights are on does not change. If we turn them off earlier at night, we turn them on earlier in the morning. We consume more electricity to cool our buildings because we are working in the heat of the day longer than we otherwise would. There are extra costs associated with overtime-with factories having to operate at different hours. Any alleged savings are more than offset by the costs that are associated with manipulating hours. We are told that the media need to network their programs around the country and, therefore, need to have standardised times. I do not know that too many people believe that the loss of localism is a merit or an advantage. They always have to record and replay programs for Western Australia and South Australia anyway, so there would seem to be no real benefits as far as that is concernedlet alone the loss of television weather broadcasts when people want to see them and the refusal to adjust program times to accommodate the wishes of others. Those can hardly be seen as advantages; they must be seen as disadvantages. We are told that there is uncertainty and confusion in travel. Schedules are confusing enough as they are, and there are plenty of different time zones that international travellers and people travellinterference ing around Australia have to live with as it is. But clever travellers use the time differences to their advantage. Airlines able to position aircraft to get better use of curfews and to use their aircraft for cross-continent travel, particularly at night. There can be no doubt that this leads to increased utilisation and efficiency within the airlines. Perhaps the greatest nonsense of all is that daylight saving makes business more profitable. What a clear nonsense. If we examine the States that have daylight saving and those that do not, we see· that those that have been without daylight saving have benefited the greatest-that that is where the real growth has been. The population has flocked to those States that do not have daylight saving. That is where all the business investment has been as well. It is clearly nonsense to suggest that Victoria, New South Wales or Tasmania has benefited from having daylight saving. Tasmania has had it longer than other States and, without doubt, it has the worse economy. Victoria was the second cab off the rank, and it without doubt is also amongst those with appalling economies. The growth has been in the States of Queensland and Western Australia, which have done without daylight saving. Indeed, the decline that is occurring in Queensland at present has coincided with the election of the Goss Government but also with the introduction of daylight saving. It is clearly nonsense to suggest that daylight saving boosts business profits. The people have voted with their feet and flocked to those States that have not had daylight saving. Australia is a vast continent. We have a right to differences. We have a right to take advantage of the climatic differences that occur from State to State. If Tasmania wants long periods of daylight saving-if Western Australia or Queensland do not want it at all-we have a right to take advantage of those opportunities. There is overwhelming opposition to daylight saving in many parts of Australia, and an attempt to inflict it upon them, whether at State or Federal level, will be resisted. A heavy-handed Commonwealth in an issue such as this is obviously unnecessary.",44
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! The honourable member's measured time has expired.,45
62,Mr DUNCAN,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Makin) (12.27 p.m.)My time also will be measured carefully, Mr Deputy Speaker. At the outset I congratulate the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) on introducing the National Measurement (Standard Time) Amendment Bill, which I support. In my view this measure is long overdue. It opens up an issue which I think is of importance to all of us in this place and throughout the nation in these difficult economic times, when much discussion and debate on micro-economic reform has been undertaken throughout the nation. The time zones that we have at present are based principally on colonial boundaries, because they generally follow State boundaries, and I think it is well arguable that they do not provide the most efficient time zones that we could have in this. nation. We will not get to a position where there is any real consideration of the time zones themselves until we have a national approach to this issue. So I welcome this Bill in that, for the first time, it recognises the need for a national approach to this issue. I do not want to deal with the argutime ments that have been put up by others this place. I am sure that the honourable member for Stirling will do that when he responds. Suffice it to say that they have consisted of two arguments. On the one hand there have been arguments in favour of States rights. I leave it to the honouris able member for Stirling to dismiss those arguments with the contempt with which they should be treated. The other arguagement ment has been about daylight saving. Little has been said about time zones themselves. We have heard arguments about the country versus cities. I point out to the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who spoke immediately preceding me, that the people of Mount time. Isa, for example, live in a permanent state of daylight saving. We do not hear complaints from them about the fact that live in a permanent state of daylight ing. In Western Australia, the people Carnarvon likewise live in a permanent state of daylight saving and-as I see it anyway-the people of Wyndham and sky. other places in the east of Western Ausa.m. tralia, for example, live in a state of conavailable siderable disadvantage because of the existing time zones. I think it is about time that we had a proper look at the whole issue of time zones for Australia. We may not find better solution than the one we have, but there are certainly dramatic inemcieneies in the way our time zones are drawn up at the moment. In the brief amount time available to me, I want to look very quickly at some of the issues that I think ought to be raised. Before I do that, howknow ever, I point out that, in relation to ergy efficiency, the Industry Commission has had a reference on the matter of entalked ergy generation and distribution. I underwould stand its report is about to be tabled the Parliament in the near future; I look forward to reading that and hope that the Commission has dealt with the issue of time zones. There are very serious disadvantages to the nation because the two major cities of Melbourne and Sydney, with their power generation grids, are both in the same zone, with the result that the peaks in and troughs occur at the same time in New South Wales and Victoria. Therefore, there is not the opportunity for the saving in generation capacity that would exist if Mclbourne and Sydney were on slightly different time zones. I think that a matter which ought to be taken up. We could consume less energy if we were able to have better time zone manthan we have had in this nation to date. We would have that not only because we would be able to manage the peaks and troughs, as I mentioned, but also possibly because, if we were able to manage the time zones more efficiently, we would be able to make better use of daylight hours than we do at the present It is a strange thing. People in they Melbourne, where it is dark for longer savhours in winter, get up at the same time of on the clock as people in New South Wales, but they get up half an hour earlier in terms of the position of the sun in the People are rising in Melbourne at 7 with the same level of daylight as is in Sydney at 6.30 a.m., so clearly in Melbourne people may put more lights on, use more heat, et cetera, than if they rose later. There arc significant and worthwhile ara guments in relation to the time zones themselves, and we certainly will not get a debate, an argument, a proper rational discussion of these issues while they are of left to the States to sort out. lt has always seemed to me to he quite illogical simply to use State boundaries. r the historical reasons for that, but, enif honourable members went to the west coast of my State of South Australia and to the people of Port Lincoln, they get one hell of an argumcnt about in why they should have to be on central standard timc. Those people want to be on a different time zone because of all the inconveniences they see applying because they live in a state of permanent daylight saving. I am sure those arguments operate elsewhere in the nation. One has only to go to Darwin. My sister lives in Darwin. When I go to see her occasionally, I am constantly amazed by the fact that the sun gets up so early in the morning, in winter as well as summer. The reason is that Darwin is about an hour ahead of the time line that determines central standard time. In these circumstances, there are cogent and strong arguments for reviewing the time zones that apply in this nation. This Bill is a worthwhile initial piece of legislation which sets out to exercise the powers of the Commonwealth in relation to the setting of time zones. I support this Bill and I hope that it goes through. hope that in the future it provides a basis for us to completely review the time zones operating in Australia, so that we can take advantage of the micro-economic reform efficiencies that could be achieved if we were to review the time zones and offset them, particularly the time zones applying in Sydney and Melbourne. I commend the Bill to the House and I compliment the honourable member for Stirling, who brought it before the Parliament.",45
63,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"in reply-I am conscious that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) will move some amendments to the National Measurement (Standard Time) Amendment Bill at the committee stage, so I will keep an eye on the clock to ensure we make time for those. In summing up the second reading debate, I would like to acknowledge the support of my colleagues in the Federal parliamentary Labor Party who have enabled me to introduce the Bill to the House with the support of Caucus. I would also like to acknowledge the support of a former colleague, Mr Ralph Jacobi, the former member for Hawker, who has written some wonderful pieces about daylight saving. In one he refers to a gentleman called Colonel Blimp. He says: Gad, Sir, say the conservatives, reforms are all right as long as they don't change anything. I thank Ralph Jacobi for that. It is in a book called Roads to Ruin and, in many senses, that is what people have been saying: it is a good idea to have reform, but please let us not change anything. This Bill is about changing. It is about making some sensible changes. I also acknowledge my parliamentary colleagues on the other side of the House who have spoken in the debate-the honourable member for O'Connor, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus), the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay). I acknowledge their contributions. I would also like to thank my col1 also leagues the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) for their support in this Bill. They have made many worthwhile contributions in this debate. There are many things one could say about the issue of daylight saving but I will just sum up very briefly. Clearly, noone is contesting that constitutionally, under section 51, placitum (xv), the Federal Parliament has the power over this issue. There is a constitutional authority behind it. We also have an international obligation with respect to time zone management. The question of States' rights has been brought up. Are people really saying that States should be able to print their own currency or have their own system of weights and measures? Of course they are not. Therefore, we would not argue that the States ought to have the capacity to manage their own time zones. Incidentally, it is approximately 100 years since the States first enacted legislation. I would also make this point: the legislation provides that we consult with States. Much has been made of the question of 'imposing'. We consult with States. The lower House of the Western Australia Parliament supports daylight saving; it is the upper House that opposes it. There are considerable benefits in terms of business efficiency. This is a form of micro-economic reform. The question of energy efficiency has not been addressed by those opposite, and that is unfortunate, but there are sufficient energy savings. When daylight saving was first introduced in 1908 in Britain, in a short experiment in April of that year, there was an estimated saving of some £2,000. Tasmania introduced daylight saving for energy efficiency after a drought in 1967. There are considerable recreational benefits in daylight saving, with people being able to enjoy the evenings together. As my colleague the honourable member for Brisbane pointed out, the Brisbane City Council reported in a survey published in the Courier-iVai! the benefits that people gained from being involved in recreation and using public libraries. There are considerable benefits. Much has been done to misrepresent this issue. The Bill is not a diversionary tactic. It happens to be something that is worth doing. It is something that the Federal Parliament has control over through the Constitution, and it is a sensible way to proceed. I conclude by reflecting on the words the most significant contributor to the question of time, and that is Albert Einwide variety. stein. In talking about people like Stalin and Hitler, he said, 'They shouted so loud as to silence the voice of reason even inside in their own heads'. In the debate on this issue much has been shouteddoes not in this Parliament, but outside-to try to silence the voice of reason; it has not silenced the voice of reason, and I time zones, hope it does not. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

In fact, he argues for a considerable widening of the particularly between Melbourne and Sydney. In terms of energy efficiency, he is quite right. If those massive peaks could be altered somewhat by further manipulation of the clocks, less equipment would be required; the capital requirement of supplying energy would be reduced. I have had some experience in generatelectricity, as a member of local government. The great worry that we had was the amount of capital equipment sitting there for probably one or two hours a day when, for instance, people turned on their electric stoves and that type of equipment. There is a real demand generated by time. It is equally a fact that by shifting the clocks back an hour we do not stop people in office buildings, for example, from turning on the lights. They turn the lights on when they get to work and turn them off when they leave, irrespective of what time that is. Furthermore, as was said, today all external lighting and street lights are run by photoelectric The cells no longer respond to the clock but to the amount of light that is available. The purpose of my amendments is to simply test the Government on its logic. The logic of the Government and the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) is that we should have uniformity. I made the point in my second reading speech that the proposition was rejected by the people. There has been a lot of debate about the Parliament, the powers and the rights of the State Parliament. I reject all of that and refer to the rights of the people. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) made a passing reference to gerrymanders. There is no gerrymander in a referendum; it is a vote taken across all the people. The people of Western Australia said in two referendums that they did not want daylight saving. I believe that should be the end of the matter. I do not like this particular device to impose daylight saving upon them. If it is the resolve of the Parliament to take the powers available to it to impose itself, in this case, on the people of Western Australia and their democratic rights, I would have thought it was logical that it should go the whole hog and have a single time for Australia. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training was totally illogical.' In one breath he argued in support of the mechanism to readjust the clocks and, in the next breath, he rejected my amendments on the ground that they would interfere with time. This was exactly why I brought the amendments before the Parliament. I wanted to see how dinkum the Government was about imposing itself upon the people; it is not dinkum. My proposal is as illogical as the Billthey are both illogical. Time is about the sun. It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Makin refer-he thought he was being original-to the situation that presently exists in Western Australia where the city of Perth is on half an hour's daylight saving all year round. He also mentioned a town that I resided in cells. for 20-odd years, Carnarvon, which has almost an hour's daylight saving all year round because of its geographical location in relation to the point on the map that somebody identified as the time zone for the State of Western Australia-which comprises a third of the continent and, what is more, is as big as Europe. Europe does not have one time zone, as I recollect. That is the situation. The honourable member for Makin is probably correct: there is room for additional time zones. How would the Minister for Employment, Education and Training accommodate that? He says that additional time zones inconvenience the airlines. Other people have told me that the international airlines operate on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) as and when they arrive. The airlines do not ring up Perth and ask, 'What time will we get there?'. That is for the people of Perth to discover. The airlines announce that they are arriving on GMT because they fly around the world and they cannot be annoyed by time. As the Minister said, if we really want to help the airlines, we should give them one time; if that is paramount in the operation of Australia, we should give them one time. I have reservations about my amendments. I believe that the honourable member for Stirling should be embracing them because it is fundamental to what he is trying to tell us. He is trying to tell us that because half of Australia, in geographic terms, wants something the other half has to cop it. I do not agree with that. I hope that Australia never gets to that point. I do not think that it has anything to do with States' rights. I reject the concept of States' rights: it is people's rights. In the case of this issue, the people of Western Australia have made some fairly clear decisions as to what they believe. These are the sorts of things which must be taken into account. I have tested the logic· of the Government and honourable members opposite. They have gone from the point of arguing for more time zones, saying that they support legislation when they do not. The honourable member for Makin clearly does not support the schedule. I have given the honourable member the extreme alternative of altering the schedule, and he clearly would not support that. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training thinks that the Bill is great but he does not support my amendment because he does not see that the commonality that the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) demanded is a good idea. All I have achieved in testing the Government with these amendments is to demonstrate how illogical it has been on this issue. There is a total diversity of opinion and it ignores the fundamental point that daylight is daylight and what time we put on the face of the clock has nothing to do with it. The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) told us that back in 1908 the people tried daylight saving in Western Australia and did not like it. I am sure it has a lot do with the fact that Western Australia has half an hour's daylight saving all of the time. I do not think that this Parliament should impose daylight saving on those people. The reality of my amendments was to take this particular pieee of Commonwealth centralised intervention to its logical conclusion-which is one time for all of Australia. It is clear from the speeches made that those in the majority in this place will not support the amendments. Of course, in failing to support them, they are being totally illogical. I have proved my point. I thank the Parliament for its time.",47
64,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I raise two points in quickly responding to the amendments moved by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). First, I refer to Ashmore and Cartier Islands. They happen to be right on 120 degrees longitude, which is the Western Australian time zone. If we were to make the adjustment, as recommended in the amendments, and put them into central time, it would create a considerable difficulty for them. I understand the arguments behind it in relation to their dealings with Darwin. I acknowledge that point, but in practical terms there is a difficulty. Secondly, I refer to the question of having one time zone. I could not deny that the honourable member has taken the issue to its logical conclusion. But, as has been pointed out earlier, if we were to have one time zone, in June the sun would set at 3.45 p.m. in Hobart and 3.54 p.m. in Sydney; and the sun would not rise until 8.09 a.m. in Perth. We are trying to provide a balance between the sun time and the time that we actually commit in terms of regulation. That is the strategy. I thank the National Standards Commission, Mr John Birch and Professor . Goldsmid. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard some eharts which depiet the matters I have referred to. Leave granted.

67,Mr HAND,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Eth1991 nic Affairs) (2.01 p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Government has introduced some amendments to the Migration Amendment Bill 1991 which will strengthen the operation of the custody provisions contained in sections 88 and 89 of the Migration Act. The amendments are not extensive, but they serve to underline the Government's intention to maintain effective control of Australia's borders under the Migration Act. The explanatory memorandum gives full details of the amendments. The amendments will have two effects. First, if a person arrives in Australia and immigration officers believe he or she would be an illegal entrant, then that perAusson may be taken into custody. At the moment, in some cases an officer must (1) and believe that the person has formed an intention to enter Australia. Secondly, the custody provisions will be amended to clarify the circumstances in which a person will be released. For example, section 89 applies to arrivals by air. When the amendment is in place, it will be clear in the Act that custody will cease only when a person is removed from Australia or obtains an entry permit. The Government is concerned that in recent months the courts have, in a number of cases, ordered the release of people held in custody under the Migration Act. At the time of thcir release, these people had no legal entitlement to enter Australia. The amendments are intended to signal to the courts that custody will cease only in the circumstances set out in the Act. The Government is also concerned that adequate powers exist to detain people deported from Australia because of serious criminal conduct who are returned to Australia by the authorities of another country. We do not want to see the situation where such a person is taken into custody and then later released by the courts, ignoring the clear intent of the Parliament as reflected in these and other provisions of the Migration Act. Let me give an example. Some recent criminal deportees have had an appalling criminal history in this country. Their activities have ranged from serious drug offences to crimes against the person. It is clearly not in the interests of the Australian community to admit a person who, for example, has had multiple convictions for grievous bodily harm and malicious injury. Under the Migration Act and Regulations, these people are permanently prohibited from re-entering Australia. The Government believes that it must have the power to maintain the integrity of Australian borders. Criminal deportees of the type I have described should not be readmitted by recourse to the judicial process when they have no other entitlement to enter Australia. The amendments are intended to clarify the Government's intention in these matters. I also believe these amendments are fully supported by the Opposition, which shares our strong belief in maintaining the integrity of Australia's borders. I commend the amendments to the Committee.",59
68,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Dundas) (2.04 p.m.)The Minister is correct: the Opposition enthusiastically endorses these amendments. We supported them in the Senate and we support the Government's intention to send a clear signal that Australia has control over its own borders and there is a determination to maintain the integrity of Australia's borders. It is quite clear that in a number of circumstances our borders are the subject of assault at this time. Our ability to determine who shall or shall not enter Australia is the subject of contest. It is one of the fundamental principles enshrined in the subject of immigration, long endorsed by the Opposition and reaffirmed by the Government on a number of occasions, that the question of control and entry into Australia is a matter in which the Government of the day must be able to make the relevant decisions. We have situations where people arrive in Australia by boat; we have seen a number of examples of that. We are aware, as it has been the matter of some comment of late, that people who are not in situations of immediate risk to life, and where claims of refugee status have not been made, have nevertheless sought to arrive hcre by boat with a view to remaining here permanently. I certainly hope that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) is able to indicate reasonably quickly that the Government has been able to take action to remove such people from Australia. There should be no doubt that people who arrive in such circumstances ought to be able to be taken into custody and removed from Australia unless they comply with the law that determines the basis upon which entry to Australia will be granted. The Minister has rightly identified a situation in which people who may well have been deported from Australia under criminal deportation laws-that is, people who have committed offences against our law-and for whom there are bars to re-entry to Australia under the law that this Parliament has put in place might well be brought to this country. Under the law as it is now worded, as I understand it, there is the possibility that the courts could take it into their hands to release such a person into the Australian community. I am given to understand that there are some four or five cases where the courts have already intervened to release into the community people who should not be allowed to rc-enter on the basis of the law relating to the issue of entry permits. It is for the Parliament to determine-and it does so by way of statute and byway of regulations-who shall enter the country and who shall not. It is not a matter of a person making an application to a court and the court reviewing decisions that are made in accordance with the law. The Opposition has certainly formed the view that if the courts continue to take this decision-making out of the hands of the Government of the day, we will have to review the very basis upon which those decisions are reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. It is not because there is any lack of compassion or understanding on this side of the House, nor do I believe on the Government's side of the House. But in the matter of determining entry to Australia, a wider range of issues needs to be addressed than just the particular circumstances in a particular case. Certainly, if the courts were to take the matter of entry out of the hands of the Parliament, where numbers are relevant, and the circumstances which they were prepared to credit as giving a basis for admission could give rise to 20,000, 30,000 or 40,000 people on compassionate circumstances, we can readily see how consideration of a specific case could sometimes distort judgments which would have far wider implications than any court could readily have put to it and appreciate. The Opposition is very much aware of this difficulty and that is why we give support to these amendments, which are limited. I have closely scrutinised the form and effect of them. The purpose for people who arrive by sea and air is to ensure that the only way that people will enter is if they have satisfied the law in relation to the issue of entry permits. The only other basis upon which they may be released from custody is if they are prepared to leave Australia. They should be the only two bases upon which those decisions can be taken. That is the purpose, the intent, of these amendments; and that intent of the Parliament needs to be clearly understood. I understand that this Bill, as it was originally before the Parliament, dealt with the question that other countries are in a position to legislate in relation to airlines that introduce people to their shores and to require people to be removed. They have laws similar to our own, but I understand that Singapore has recently taken steps to raise the penalties and consequences as a result of airlines having brought individuals to Singapore. But Singapore has also extended its law to enable it to take action against airlines of countries from which individuals may have come-not an airline which necessarily may have brought an individual to Singapore, but against airlines of other countries. I say to the Minister that, if the provisions of the Migration Act are inadequate to enable these questions to be fully and properly addressed, which might make it a matter of contest which could threaten the integrity of our immigration laws and the basis upon which people enter this country, the Minister would have the support of the Opposition if he were to introduce amendments to ensure that Australia's law was equal to the laws of others. I offer those comments in a positive and constructive way to assist the Minister in any discussions he may have with his colleagues in relation to further amendments that might take place. I have offered comments in the same vein in relation to the basis for an administrative review by the courts. If the law is to be increasingly the subject of threat through that process, the Minister would have the support of the Opposition were he and his colleagues so minded to move to limit the capacity of the courts to make decisions in that area.

72,Mr GEAR,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I present the report from the Committee of Privileges in connection with a matter referred to the Committee by the House on 18 April 1991, together with the minutes of proceedings of the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",62
73,Mr GEAR,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"by leave-The report I have just presented on behalf of the Committee follows the reference to the Committee of the question of the possible intimidation of Mr Winston Willis in respect of his involvement with an inquiry by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. At the outset may I reiterate the importance which the Committee of Privileges gives to the protection of individual witnesses and to the wider question of the protection of witnesses generally. Parliamentary committees depend very hea vily on their ability to obtain information and views from persons and organisations throughout the community. The Committee of Privileges is acutely aware of the responsibilities it has to ensure that witnesses are not intimidated, harassed or subjected to improper intcrference or pressure on account of their involvement with committee inquiries. One general observation I make in presenting this report is that some familiarity with the law and procedures applying to parliamentary committee inquiries is obviously important for organisations and businesses which may become involved with committee inquiries. The background to the case was that Mr Willis had had a submission made on his behalf to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in connection with its inquiries into corporate practices and the rights of shareholders. The issue of privilege arose following receipt of two letters-one dated 30 November 1990 from the Chairman of  and one dated 7 March 1991 from the Secretary of Defiance Holdings Ltd, Mr M. K. Hoey. The issue of possihle intimidation was brought before the House on behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and Mr Speaker later gave precedence to a motion to allow the matter to be referred to the Committee. I will not go into the details of the inquiry other than to say that the Committee received a considerable amount of documentary evidence. In addition, oral evidence was taken from Mr W. Willis and his wife, Mrs Mary Willis and from  The Committee's conclusion was that, although Mr and Mrs Willis certainly felt intimidated as a consequence of actions taken following Mr Willis's involvement with the parliamentary inquiry, in the opinion of the Committee this perception did not establish that intimidation or improper interference was intcnded or attempted. The claim of intimidation was denied strenuously by Messrs O'Brien and Mr Hoey in their written and oral evidence. On the evidence available to it, the Committee has found that no contempt has been committed. I commend the report to the House.  I will be very brief. I listened with to what the Chairman of the Standing Committee of Privileges, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), reported to the Parliament on this matter, and I noted with great interest that he said the Committee was acutely aware of intimidatory factors that relate to this matter. My mind went to the fact that you, Mr Speaker, took a decision with which I do not concur. Accordingly, 1I have this day given a notice of motion in regard to itnamely, the alleged intimidation of Labor members who did not do what Mr Ludwig of the Queensland Australian Workers Union (A WU) demandcd. The day will come in this Parliament whcn that will be argued out, and I believc that the authorities that I have-Mr Hand-What are you talking about?  know all about it because he has probably been heavying them down in Victoria as Mr Ludwig has been up in Queensland.",62

76,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Order! The honourable member for Kooyong will not use this report from the Privileges Committee as a vehiele to rehash matters that have been decided. The honourable member can address himself to the particular report that has been brought down by the Privileges Committee. He will not anticipate debate on his own motion.  just considered a matter of intimidation. That arose from a letter that was written. I would have said, with the greatest respect to you, Mr Speaker, that the prima facie case of this letter, which you referred to the Committee, was infinitely less valid in terms of its prima facie intimidatory elements than the matter that I raised about Mr Ludwig, who was going to take away the preselections of members in this House. As a consequence, there is a direct linkage on this question of intimidation. This will be argued out on another day. As I said, undoubtedly your decision, Mr Speaker, was incorrect. I have given notice of motion and I look forward to debating it later.",64

WOOL TAX (Nos 1 to 5) AMENDMENT BILLS 1991 Message received from the Senate returning the Bills and acquainting the House that the Senate insists upon the amendment disagreed to by the House.",64
78,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I feel that it is my duty as Speaker to draw the attention of the House to the constitutional question that this message involves. When similar circumstances have arisen in the past, Speakers of all persuasions have advised the House of the constitutional principles involved, and the House has invariably endorsed their statements. The messagc purports to rcpeat the request for amendments contained in message No. 244, which the House rejected at its sitting yesterday. The House of Rcpresentatives has never accepted that the Senate has a right to repeat, and thereby press or insist on, a requcst for an amcndment in a Bill which the Senate may not amend. The question as to the justiciability of the Senate purportedly pressing a request by repetition is uncertain. It is, however, a matter of constitutional propriety as between the Houses, based on the provisions of sections 53 to 57 of the Constitution. Legal opinions supporting the argument that the Constitution does not empower the Senate to press a request have been advanced by Quick and Garran, who were intimately involved in the development of the Constitution, and by eminent constitutional lawyers, past and present. Respectfully, I agree with the opinions but do not propose to repeat the arguments, which are summarised in HOllse oj Representatives Practice. Copies of the relevant extracts from the House oj Representatives Practice have been circulated to members in the chamber. From time to time, the House, having regard to the fact that the public welfare demanded the early passage of legislation, has resolved to refrain from the determination of its constitutional rights in respect of a message purporting to press requests, and to advise the Senate of this resolution in any message returning the Bill to the Senate. The House has then considered the message. It rests with the House as to whether it will consider message No. 257 in so far as it purports to press the requests that were contained in message No. 244. In the circumstances of the present case, the House may deem it appropriate to pass a resolution that, as the public welfare demands the early consideration of the legislation, the Housc refrains from affirming its constitutional rights in respect of such a message. Motion (by Mr Crean) agreed to: That(1) this House endorses the statement of the Speaker in relation to the constitutional questions raised by Message No. 157 transmitted from the Senate in relation to the Wool Tax (Nos. 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1991; (2) this House having regard to the fact that the public intcrest demands the early consideration of the legislation, refrains from the determination of its constitutional rights in respect of such message; (3) this House resolves to consider the message in committee of the whole House forthwith; and (4) part (2) of this resolution be incorporated in the message when the Bill is returned to the Senate. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration in Committee of the Whole House forthwith. Consideration of Senate's requested amendments. Senate requested amendmcntsClause 4, page 2, paragraph (b), omit ""15%"", substitute ""10%"".",64
79,Mr CREAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I move: That the requested amendments be not made, but in place thereof each of the Bills be amended as follows: Clause 6, page 2, after paragraph (g) insert the following paragraph: ""ga"" by inserting in subsection (5) 'that is to be applicable on or after 1 July 1992' after 'tax';H, The Seriate has again referred back to the House its request that this House agree to a wool tax rate of 10 per cent. There have been intensive discussions and negotiations over the past 72 hours on this issue. In part, in the last 24 hours, they have centred on the nature of the Government's commitment to facilitate the $200m commercialloan by the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. In addition to that consideration, and to ensure that the legislation and the future of the wool industry do not fall into a hiatus, the Government has now agreed to facilitate that loan by the provision, by way of grant to the Commission, of $22. 5m in each of 1991-92 and 1992-93. This subvention reprcsents the estimated interest component of the loan. This, together with a recognition of the desirability of being able to proceed now with the total package as proposed by the Government, has also enabled us to now propose that the total wool tax in 199192 be 121J2 per cen t. [ am therefore proposing an amendment to each of the wool tax Bills which will have the effect, within the present 15 per cent tax rate set down, of enabling a lower tax rate to be set by regulation. The amendment brings into play the requirements of clause 6(h) of the Bill, dealing with recommendations on the rate from the Realisation Commission and annual general meetings of wool taxpaycrs, only for regulations to apply from 1 July 1992 onwards, thereby leaving the Minister free In Committee to set the rate for 1991-92. Subject to acceptance of the package of wool legislation in both Houses, I would then take the nccessary steps to have the 121/2 per cent set by regulation to apply from 1 July 1991. The Government hopes-given discussions that have taken place this morning, including with the industry-that the Senate will accept this outcome in the spirit in which it is offered. Whilst there is some risk that if our parameters are not realised it may be necessary to increase the wool tax rate for 1992-93, the Government nevertheless hopes that, given the right conjunction of market circumstances, 12lj2 per cent will prove adequate. I commend the amendment to the House.",65
80,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"At this very latc hour the Government is at least accepting some of the reality of the situation. Our ncw Treasurer (Mr Kerin) refers to the situation in the Senate. I cannot remember a time when there has been such a combined and strong opposition to legislation. Mr Kerih-Opposition bastardry in the Senate. lVIr LLOYD-If one wants to talk about bastardry, one should talk about the bastardry of the Government in relation to the wool industry of Australia. If we want to talk about people without birth certificates, it is members of the Government who do not have birth certificates! Honourable members inteljecting",65
81,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Order!,66
82,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"For the Treasurer to talk about being able to read figures is unbelievable stuff when one considers what is happening to this country at present. As I was saying before we had some of the woolly thinking from Government members, the strong opposition of all sections and all parts of the political spectrum in the Senate to this attempt by the Government to bankrupt thousands of wool growers in Australia is an indication that we now have some more sense-and certainly morc sense than the threats that were being made about a 25 per cent wool tax-Mr Ewen Cameron-That was rubbish.",66
83,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Yes, it was, and is, rubbish. I acknowledge that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) arranged more discussions about the projected figures between his advisers and members of the Opposition this morning. After lQoking at those figures and making some amendments to allow for some of the things that have been said, the Opposition still bclieves-and still ures to show-that 10 pcr cent is all that is necessary. Wc have the advice of others who have been doing work on this to the same effect. When one talks about flexibility in figures, at least the Government is showing somc flexibility. lVIr Crean-But you are not.",66
84,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The Opposition is because it has incorporated some things. If the Government and its advisers were a little morc realistic, they would also accept some of the things the Opposition has said. Presumably the Government has accepted somc because the figure is now down to 12.5 pcr cent. My first point in relation to this is that the Government is at least showing some honesty by rcinstating the $200m loan which the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, had indicated on several occasions would be there for the industry by the up-front provision of the interest component of $22.5m for the first two years. A little more honesty from the Government would also be helpful, as would a firm commitment from the Government on how many years this project-the requirement to pay off the stockpile debt-will take. Will this project last for seven years, as stated by the earlier Ministcr in his statement; is it five years or is it now six years? It would certainly be helpful if the industry were to know exactly what the Government intends to do with regard to those repayments. Mr Crean-Up to seven.",66
85,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Seven? Mr Kerin-Up to seven.,66
86,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Okay, up to seven years it is. One accepts that if the market picks up-Mr Kerin-If you can predict on the market, tell us.",66
87,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,One accepts that jf the market picks up-Mr Kerin interjecting,66
88,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The Minister should give me a chance to reply because I happen to be the person who is supposed to be has the fig- speaking, not you!",66
89,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,-Order! The honourable member for Murray will direct his remarks through the Chair.,66
90,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I seek your support in allowing me to speak. I accept the point about whether the market does pick up, but that is quite different from the Government's saying that irrespective of the market the whole show has to be over within a certain number of years. I hope there is also some more sense with regard to the question of making some sales from the stockpile when we have falling production. Presumably the 12.5 per cent, - the amended figure, accepts some reality with that. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has indicated that the Government is anxious to get this Bill back to the Senate. I acknowledge that; therefore, there will be no further speakers from the Opposition.",66
91,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,We would like to.,67
92,Mr LLOYD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I accept that: Opposition members would like to and I think they would all make good contributions when speaking about the mess this Government has created for this industry. However, the Opposition accepts that point. The Opposition parties will maintain 10 per cent because 10 per cent is credible, sustainable, maintainable and does something to preserve the future of wool growers at this most critical time. Therefore the Opposition will show its feelings on this subject by dividing on the amendments now before the chamber.",67
93,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The question is: That the amendments be agreed to. I think the ayes have it. Mr Fife-No, I think the noes have it.",67
94,Mr SINCLAIR,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I can see no reason for the agreement that has been entered into for this debate to be prematurely aborted. I regard this as one of the most significant pieces of legislation to come before the chamber.",67
95,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Order! The right honourable member for New England did not have the call.,67
96,Mr SINCLAIR,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I am just seeking it and asserting it. I have risen in this place and it is not for you, Mr Deputy Chairman, to move to put the question when a member is on his feet; it is for you to call the member or to call some other member.",67
97,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Order! The right honourable member for New England will resume his seat.,67
98,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Chairman. You called the vote, Mr Deputy Chairman; you asked for ayes and noes, and then you called the division. We are not in a situation in which people can now interrupt the debate. The division has been called for, the bells should be rung and the vote had.",67
99,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,That is correct. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) had indicated a division.,67
100,Mr SINCLAIR,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"On the same point of order, Mr Deputy Chairman: did you call a division? Nobody up here heard it.",67
101,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Order! I put the question and members of the Opposition indicated that a division was required. A division is required, ring the bells.",67
102,Mr SINCLAIR,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Chairman. J suggest that if a point of order is being raised, it needs to be raised by somebody who has the call. Firstly, it was not heard; secondly, it was not certainly within the proceedings of this place that somebody rose and moved that the question be put. If someone does so, that is another thing. J point out to you, Mr Deputy Chairman, that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was rising purely on a point of procedure-he was raising the point of order he addressed to you a moment ago. I suggest that the proceedings of the chamber are still intact and for that reason I suggest, Mr Deputy Chairman, that you either give the call to me, to seek to address this amendment before the Committee or, if the Leader of the House rises to move a motion, you should call him. You cannot just proceed without calling people and having motions properly put to this Parliament. Government members might want to go home, but there are wool growers out there who are going broke while they are mucking around. I think all of this business is absolutely appalling. Mr Deputy Chairman, I suggest that you either call the Leader of the House to move his motion, if that is what you wish or, if not, I rise to speak on this Bill.",67
103,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Order! There is no point of order. The member was not on his feet when I put the question and the members of the Opposition had also called for a division. The question was put that the motion be agreed to and a division was called by members of the Opposition; a division is now required and we will now ring the bells for the division. Question put.

The Australian Securities Commission (ASC) has extensive investigatory powers both on its own initiative and through the Persons subject to these investigations may not refuse to answer questions or provide documents on the grounds that prothey may incriminate themselves. However, they may, by claiming privilege self-incrimination, ensure that their answers and any documents they have any produced cannot be used as evidence in criminal proceedings other than for This is described as use immuSubsections 597 (12) and 68 (3) go further and provide that any information, document or other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person giving answers, making statements, or signing records is not admissible in evidence in any criminal proceedings other than for perjury. This has been described as derivative use immunity. Subsection 68 (3) extends these immunities to civil proceedings for the imposition of a penalty. It has been argued that the use immunity with regard to the production of documents and the derivative use immunity seriously restrict the ability of the ASC to pursue its regulatory responsibilities. This Committee will examine those two provisions and report to the Parliament in the first sitting week in October 1991. As part of its ongoing scrutiny of the Corporations Law, the Committee will also examine the exposure draft of the second Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1991 which is to be released in July 1991. ARTS, SPORT, ENVIRONMENT AND NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Simmons, and read a first time - The Protection of Movable Cultural Second Reading",70
106,Mr SIMMONS,TOURISM LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Arts, Sport, Environment and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 amends 15 Acts administered in the Arts, Sport, Environment Tourism and Territories portfolio. The amendments are mainly to make the administration of various Government programs more efficient and cost effective. One measure affects a range of programs. The Bill implements for 13 statutory authorities in my portfolio the journed. Government's decision that the Remuneration Tribunal should have jurisdiction over the recreation leave entitlements of full time officeholders. Authorities in other portfolios have already been covered by the Industrial Relations Legislation quests: Amendment Act 1991. The other amendments in the Bill cover specific programs: - Five statutory authorities will have the value limit beyond which they need to obtain ministerial approval for contracts and other transactions increased, generally to $250,000: the Australia Council; the Australian Film, Television and Radio School; the Australian National Maritime Museum; the Australian National Gallery; and the National Museum of Australia. - An officer of the Navy will be an ex officio member of the Council of the Australian National Maritime Museum, and section 49 of the Museum Act, which exempts the Museum from taxation, will be clarified. - The three representatives of the Convocation of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School on the council of the school will be appointed by the Council, rather than elected by the Convocation. It is becoming increasingly difficult to conduct an effective election among the more than 1,000 members of the Convocation. Heritage Committee will be made able to hold meetings by conference telephone and similar methods. - The maximum fee that can be levied under the regulations for an export or import permit under the Hazardous Wastes (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 will be increased from $4,000 to $8,000. The $4,000 limit introduced in July 1990 was intended to enable full cost recovery but experience has shown that it is insufficient.

107,Mr FREE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I table on behalf of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) an explanatory memorandum dealing with the Proceeds of Crime Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. NA (REGULATION OF EXPORTS AND IMPORTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 June, on motion by Mrs Kelly: That the Bill be now read a second time. 1991 Mr COBB (Parkes) (2.56 p.m.)-When debate on the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill was adjourned last night, I was expressing my disappointment that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) could not see fit to allow the export of four native birds from this countrynamely, the greater sulphur-crested cockatoo, the galah, the little corella and the long-billed corella-because they have bred into .plague proportions wherever crops are growing. It is so bad in some areas that farmers cannot sow summer crops at all and have difficulty even in sowing winter crops. The birds not only pluck the seed out of the ground, but if the seed is sown and germinated the birds take the grains away at harvest time. If the farmers are lucky enough to get it off then, the birds will attack the stored grain sheds in their hundreds of thousands and they cause tremendous damage. Apart from that they also damage the environment. They are very aggressive and drive out other birds from the areas. They destroy nesting sites. In other words, they upset the avian ecological balance of the areas. They defoliate trees, ringbark trees and kill them-especially stringy barks, as I have seen in my part of the world. They do a great amount of other damage to power lines in the western part of New South Wales. They are blacking out whole towns by chewing through Telecom wires and shorting them. Broken Hill has been blacked out on more than one occasion by the little corellas. What do farmers do about this? In their frustration they have tried many methods. They have tried shooting these birds, using explosive scare guns, scarecrows, high pitched sound and all these type of things, but nothing seems to work. Cockatoos, in particular, are very cunning and intelligent birds. They would probably givc most of the honourable members in this chamber a run. One thing that is effective is poisoning. Various poisons are used but I strcss that nearly all of them are unpleasant or painful. It may be that 1080 is not; but the organophosphorous poisons are. The poisons are put on the grain, the trail is laid out-I have photographs here if anyone is interested-the birds eat the grain and die in their thousands. A truck could bc filled with them afterwards. It is a great shame that we have to do this. It is cruel and wasteful and, worse of all, in many senses it is indiscriminate because it can pick up non-target species. I have seen instances where up to 14 non-target species have also been poisoned. There is one other effective method, and that is trapping with nets. I am not talking about mist nets which are illegal, but ground nets where a decoy bird is put in a cage on the ground, grain is spread and the birds come in in their thousands. The net is triggered, it folds over on top of the birds and they are caught. What is done with these birds? There are various options. They can be killed by walking around on top of the net treading on the birds, they can be clubbed to death or they can be put in special cages and taken away for release elsewhere. If they arc not taken far enough away they will fly straight back again. They can be gassed in 44gallon drums, as was done by Mrs Kirner when she was the environment Minister in Victoria some years ago. They can be sold within Australia in unlimited numbers. There is no restriction on it, but there is a very limited market so only a few birds can be got rid of by that method. They could be sold overseas where there is an enormous demand for these birds, but the law says we cannot do that. I put it to honourable members from the birds' point of view: if vou were one of these trapped birds and had one of these options: either be killed or be put in a cage and sold overseas to a wealthy American and fed-probably better than we are-for the rest of your life, what option would you take? I think there is only one reasonable answer to come to. The export regulations are already in place; we are allowed to export non-native birds from Australia now. So there is no use in saying that we have to set up another bureaucracy, because it is already there. The export regulations are very strict. There are 10 costly steps to go through. Exporters have to have a certified quarantine establishment licence. The overseas importer has to have a certified quarantine establishment so that the birds arc not ending up in some shonky place in somc other country where they will be maltreated. The exporter has to have a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) licence, which is issued by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service at a cost of $40. All avian species destined for overseas must be inspected by a qualified Government veterinary officer from animal quarantine not more than 48 hours prior to dispatch. A health certificate is issued. A numbered seal is then attached to the cage opening, and the seal cannot be broken prior to dispatch. The identification of the avian species to make sure that the right ones· are in there is done by non-government bodies at no cost to the Government. Since 1950 this has been available to exporters as a free service by ornithologists who come from either the Australian Museum or an A class zoological garden. They issue a document. In this regard, there has not been one case of fraud in this country that I know of in all the time that that has been operating. The airports have holding facilities for avifauna, which are the responsibility of the airway companies. They are housed according to a code of practice laid down by the International Air Transport Association. The exporter must sign one of . these IATA forms indicating that all the packaging and health standard requirements are met. One must have an export Customs clearance, which involves more money. One must have a Customs rccheck for any anomalies. Customs checks that the applicant is a signatory to the CITES agreement. Upon arrival in the importing country, the consignment is mct at the airport by animal quarantine officials who inspect the species and examine the seals on the cages. The birds are not allowed to be released unless they go to proper licensed private quarantine facilities. A proper and thorough procedure for non-native species is already in place. Why it cannot be allowed to operate for these native species is totally beyond my comprehension. Compared with death, it is better for the birds. I ask the Minister to give it a trial for a couple of years. It has many other advantages. Perhaps it would attract overseas money for research into these birds, similar to that which we are now seeing with Japanese money pouring in for research on koalas. It could earn millions of dollars for Australia. We see galahs being advertised overseas for $8,000 a pair and long-billed corellas for $20,000 a pair. We cannot give them away in Australia. Even if we charged $100 a pair for them overseas, many millions of dollars could flow into coffers here. It would take the pressure off much rarer parrots being smuggled out of places around the world such as Indonesia and the northern part of South America, such as in Surinam, and that would provide a service to rarer birds around the world. It would lessen smuggling from Australia. Before 1959, when these restrictions were brought in, smuggling out of Australia of these types of birds was almost unknown. Most birds smuggled out of Australia today are the four species that I am talking about. What happens to the birds being smuggled is not very pleasant. They inject tranq uillisers into the breast muscle of the birds, bind them up, tape their beaks together so they cannot make a noise to give themselves away, put them in narrow plastic tubes and then pack them into suitcases. After all of that, it is not surprising that most of these birds end up suffocating; they panic and drown in their own vomit. They do not have any water supply. It is not unusual for 90 per cent or more to die. Clearly, it is cruel and inhumane, and this is one way of lessening its occurrence. We could charge royalties for these birds going out and use that money for research here or for looking after national parks. For farmers, it would mean better income-running into scveral tens of millions of dollars. Because trapping would become profitable, it would eliminate the poisoning of these birds, which causes the drcadful, needless waste that is going on in this country at the moment and the killing of non-target species. There are even little side benefits, such as the cage industry in Australia blossoming under this type of arrangement, because proper cages have to be used for these birds when exporting is being done legally. The cages must have non-spill drinking equipment, absorbent floor coverings, adequate feed, proper space-one cage per bird-and so 'on. The proposals that I am putting up are not radical. In 1976, an all-party House of Representatives committee recommended the relaxation of total export controls for this type of native fauna. I know that the National Parks and Wildlife Service argues against it. It has put up various alternatives, such as spraying grain at planting because the bad taste will put the birds off taking it out the groundbut this costs several dollars per acre. If it rains it does not work; even if it does not rain, it does not seem to work properly. They have used high pitched soundthat does not work. They have used decoy crops. They tell a farmer to go out and spend $5,000 planting a crop so that the birds will attack that crop and not his main crop. I have never heard anything so ridiculous. All it does is attract more birds to the area. In many cases it has exactly the opposite effect. What depresses me is that the job security of the advisers in this Department seems to depend on the bird problem continuing. So I do not think we will get much joy out of that area. All of its suggestions and research have come to naught; it is useless. Most of them are inexperienced. I hear complaint after complaint about these people going out in the heat in the middle of the day, flying around in helicopters, saying that they can see no birds and that there are not many of them around. That is what the farmers are up against. The proposal to relax exports of these types of birds is consistent with the ideals of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (lUCN), which was founded in 1948. Over 100 countries are signatories to this ment, including Australia. This is funded by the United Nations environment program (UNEP). I will run through a bit of history. In 1961, the IUCN and the UNEP founded the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), whose aim was to finance conservation projects. That has been largely successful. Since that time, they have channelled over $US 100m into hundreds of projects in ovcr 130 countries. It has established 260 national parks and other protected areas on five continents. In 1975, the CITES agreement was established. Over 103 countries are signatories to that agreement. That was set up to control trade in endangered species. The appendix I listing is for endangered species where trade is now banned, such as in ivory with elephants. They have an appendix II listing for vulnerable species, in which trade is regulated. That is what I am talking about today. In 1980, the IUCN also published its world conservation strategy. It abides by three principal objectives, which are worth reading out. They were not drawn up in a hurry. It was done after consultation with UNEP, TUCN, the World Wildlife Fund, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, after the United Nations ecosystem conservation group had a look at it. The three principles are: to maintain essential ecological processes and life support systems; to preserve genetic diversity; and-this is particularly important and relevant to this Bill-to ensure the sustainable utilisation of species and ecosystems. In other words, if something can be harvested for the good of mankind, it can be a proper practice to do so. That is what I am advocating today. Animal rights organisations reject this third principle, and this Government, for fear of offending some green group yet again, has become paralysed as far as common sense and good government in this area. It is regrettable that the IUCN, the WWF and CITES have now been infiltrated by animal rightists to a large extent-particularly the WWF-and these groups are determined to destroy this third agreeprinciple. I remind the Government that a person cannot even join the IUCN unless that person endorses the third principlc; so there is a contradiction there. Australia is a member of the IUCN, it is bound to observe and abide by the principles of the world conservation strategy. I hope the Government bears that in mind. In conclusion, what I am saying is that the four species of native fauna about which I have spoken should be allowed to be exported. It would be the best thing that could happen in this country for agriculture; it would be the best thing from the point of view of the environment; it would certainly be the best thing from the point of view of the birds that are being trapped and poisoned and killed now; and what I am proposing is consistent with the principles of international conservation groups to which we are signatoriesthe IUCN, the world conservation strategy and CITES. It is tragic that such an illogical and harmful ban exists now, and the sooner it is removed the better.",72
108,Mrs JAKOBSEN,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,"I would like to comment on the remarks made by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), although I was not able to hear his speech in to to. He may have made some other comments earlier in the debate; I am not sure. In the context of this debate it is important to note that the Government supports well-managed commercial exports of wildlife products-but not live species-which are not detrimental to the status of the species involved. In othcr words, we are concerned to ensure that the species involved-of bird life in particular, to comment on the points made by the honourable mcmber for Parkes-are not those species that arc endangered. Contrary to the claims of some of the people who have already spoken in this debate, the decision to place a ban on the export of native fauna was not made in isolation. It arose from a conference of all State and Territory wildlife agencies in 1960. The issue of the export of birds was reconsidered in 1985 by the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers, and that body endorsed the current Commonwealth Government policy. Departments of agriculture in Australia do not see the export of pest birds as a viable solution to crop damage. It is important that we deal with that issue-and I am not sure whether other members are aware of this-because some of the agricultural departments produce booklets which talk about bird damage and attempt to show farmers alternative ways of cropping. I take the point made by the honourable member for Parkes that there are some circumstances where the solutions suggested may seem in an economic sense to be counterproductive to the farmers involved-presumably he was referring to alternative crops which the birds can then fecd on, enabling the economic crop to be left alone-and that would seem to many farmers, I am sure, to be ludicrous. But there are also very many sensible suggestions for farmers. Simply by cropping in different areas or by cropping more closely together, by ensuring the removal of dead trees and areas where the birds could be perching, areas where they could be observing for danger and those sorts of things, farmers can make the crop less susceptible to bird damage. Those are important points to make because it has also been commented that the extent of bird damage to the crop in an economic sense, whilst very high in some years and in some regions, is not very significant when compared with other pests of agriculture. So the departments of agriculture, as I have said, do not see the export of pest birds as a viable solution to crop damage. In February 1990 a national bird pest workshop was conducted, and the delegates agreed that there was no such thing as a bird pest species. There are situations, of course, in which birds cause problems. The workshop recommended the appointment of a coordinator of bird pest research and that further research be performed. Exporting the birds was not seen as a solution. On the contrary, some papers stated explicitly that it was not a solution. Furthermore, the Australian Government's stance is consistent with the principle adopted by the parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species relating to wild flora and fauna, which requires that member countries endeavour to restrict the collection of wild animals for the pet trade and encourage the breeding of animals for this purpose with the objective of eventually limiting the keeping of pets to those species which can be bred in captivity. The species of galah and little corellas that the honourable member for Parkes was mentioning are flock birds and, frequently, keeping them in captivity in isolation is extremely damaging to them. They end up damaging and mutilating themselves-and I may say more about that later, if time permits. But for the bird to be exported rather than being trapped, stomped on and killed is certainly not an attractive option, as the honourable member was trying to make it sound. I think most of these birds would still prefer to be flying free, even if sometimes making a bit of a pest of themselves. But they are native to this country and many of them are quite endangered and rare. The vast majority of countries do not allow the exploitation of their native wildlife. Many do not export commercial wild bird shipments. Some do allow the export of exotic birds bred in captivity, such as domestic pigeons and zoological exports. As a trend, more countries arc ceasing exploitation of native species. As I indicated earlier, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has funded research into methods of protecting crops, as it is saying that this problem is the key to the arguments of those advocating the commercial export of live birds. This research was undertaken in order to obtain a better understanding of the birds' behaviour patterns with a view to using this knowledge to alter agricultural methods and provide long term solutions, which the export of live birds patently will not do. The research-based approach to crop damage by birds was totally supported by animal welfare agencies such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Birds often referred to as pests which should be exported are the galah, the little corella, the long-billed corella and the sulphur-crested cockatoo. Most of the States in Australia protect all of these species but will issue permits for the killing or capture of birds which are causing damage to property. The poisoning of birds is illegal in most States, for the reasons, I think, outlined by the honourable member for Parkes-that it is a very indiscriminate form of killing because one will often be killing other species that one was not intending to hurt at the time of the baiting. The keeping of both the little corella and the sulphur-crested cockatoo requires an advanced licence in Western Australia. The long-billed corella is neither abundant nor increasing in numbers and is classed as rare, endangered or in need of special protection in Western Australia also. I have had some experience with wheat farming in Western Australia and I have seen on many occasions the large piles of wheat waiting to be put into the trains. Certainly, they are subject to attack by galahs, which are fairly plentiful in the wheat belt. There is no doubt that a better method of storage could be thought up so that the galahs would find it a bit harder to get into the crop. But there is no denying that the galah has a very strong beak and claws and is an extremely determined bird. Nevertheless, I do not believe that that justifies exporting the species, because exportation is not a solution to an agricultural problem. It is a very short term solution because exporting live birds will only lead to their breeding overseas anyway and the carting overseas of other diseases which may not develop in a healthy specimen in the wild in Australia but will most likely develop in a bird which is distressed and in captivity overseas. I mention problems such as chlamydia, which are quite common amongst some Australian animals and usually will become prevalent when an animal is distressed and in captivity. Both galahs and sulphur-crested cockatoos are common and occur in all States and Territories and the range of the galah is increasing. Some surveys have indicated that the density of birds in an area is far less than perceived by farmers. For example, research by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation indicates that in Western Australia a flock of 1,000 corellas may constitute all the breeding birds from an area of 6,000 square kilometres. Furthermore, it has been suggested that loss of habitat such as nesting holes, through tree loss, farming practices and illegal trapping of chicks may mean that populations of parrots are not breeding as rapidly as is assumed in some areas. If this is correct, the current flocks may represent ageing populations of long-lived mature birdsand they do live a very long time. Australia has a history of exotic species that have become established in the wild. Rabbits, foxes, cats, cane toads and the prickly pear have either changed parts of the Australian environment or been implicated in the demise of our native fauna. I think that those examples show that we should not be party to exporting one of our native species, one which actually causes damage here, into another environment where it may cause more damage, of course, and where the damage and the problems that it will cause may not be expected by the people or the country concerned. It is not a good idea to take animals and birds from their native habitat, introduce them into another country and expect that there will not be consequences that cannot be controlled. From the point of view of both the bird and the potential owner, there are disadvantages in exporting wild-caught birds as pets. I point out a couple of things. Wildcaught adult birds do not adapt well to captivity. As I mentioned earlier, all birds which are considered to be pests are viewed that way because they are sociable and form large flocks. Isolating a sociable adult bird in a cage away from others of its species may result in the bird increasing its frequency of contact calls-that is, making more noise-especially at the normal dawn or dusk chorus. That habit would be delightful in a New York flat! It would not be appreciated in an apartment block in any country. I suggest that the owners would bc very annoyed if this started to happen. Some bored and confined parrots mutilate themselves by feather plucking or even biting off their own toes. Given the anti-social nature of adult birds, it is not surprising that in the United States zoo bird curators also record that cockatoo species are regularly offered to them as gifts by harassed pet owners. We have a problem in this country with cats and dogs in metropolitan areas. I do not think we should impose a problem of encaged wild species on other metropolitan places in the world. As Australian owners of cockatoos frequently release their noisy guests, which form feral populations in Australian cities, it would not be surprising if some overseas owners also chose this means of getting rid of their unwelcome pets. Another argument is that allowing the export of some common birds is not a solution. Smuggling is carried out for profit. Prosecution records show that the most frequently smuggled birds are the Major Mitchell or pink cockatoo; the ganggang cockatoo; the galah; black cockatoos; and longbilled corellas. Allowing the more common birds to be legally exported will not reduce the demand for the rarer, more spectacular and more valuable birds, but would tend to increase that demand. Moreover, those people who are currently smuggling the birds we do not allow to be exported would be left to export, through smuggling, the rarer species.",75
109,Mr MCARTHUR,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,"I say at the outset that I am delighted to be associated with the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) in the discussion of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Imports and Exports) Amendment Bill because of their great understanding of the bird life in cropping areas and the problems that the corellas and galahs cause to their cropping constituents. I pay tribute to the honourable member for Parkes for his depth of knowledge in this area. I know that he has had a lifetime interest in the problem facing us. The Opposition supports the Government's upholding of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna, particularly the increased penalties applicable to those who attempt to smuggle native flora and fauna out of Australia. However, I would like to discuss the possibility of looking at another way to deal with the common Australian species, especially the greater sulphur-crcsted cockatoo, the galahs and the short-billed corellas. Honourable members would be aware of the significant devastation that these subspecies of the parrot family cause grain growers, in particular. The exact figures are unavailable, but millions of dollars worth of damage would be caused cach year in Australia, particularly in grain growing areas. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in her second reading speech claimed that the central tenet of those advocating the export of live birds was the protection of crops from damage. I disagree with this assertion. The introduction of export under permit, for common Australian birds referred to, will not significantly, by itself, sec a lessening in destroyed grain and fruit crops. In 1981 the Japanese imported 110,000 parrots-although the number is believed to be less now. In 1987 the United States absorbed around 230,000 parrots and 550,000 members of other bird species. The number of native birds in Australia is hard to estimate. In south-western Victoria, the typical density of greater sulphur-crested cockatoos is two per square kilometre, whereas for galahs it is about 0.7 per square kilometre. Galahs, of course, cover a wider area than cockatoos, with the latter preferring the coastal strips. Over the last 20 years, the cockatoo has gradually increased its coverage of our land mass and is now present in urban areas. Populations of the sulphur-crested cockatoo and corella are each in the millions; the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Perth suggests that there are over one billion galahs. To cure the crop damage problem, which I have alluded to, Australia would need to export many more than the 50,000 to 100,000 birds for which it seems we could secure a market. If we were to export native birds on a large scale, permits would be necessary, to be arranged through the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. A probable export price for sulphur-crested cockatoos and galahs would be $1,000 per specimen. However, if large numbers were exported, the price may be depressed to as low as $500 per bird. Wild birds command a lower pricc on international markets, as they are not as receptive to human handling as are those born in captivity. A potential export market in the order of $ 50m to $100m per annum is therefore being effectively ignored by the Government. It is not ignored by those in the Netherlands who are only too ready to reap the benefit of this void. Opposition to any proposal would be likely to come from animal welfare groups on the basis of cruelty to the species concerned; other speakers have mentioned this particular problem, especially the way in which birds are smuggled out. The honourable member for Parkes gave some quite graphic examples of the problems there. The current policy of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) is based on opposition to the export of live birds and animals unless it is by way of direct transfer between public facilities, such as zoos, in both countries. The RSPCA justifies its policy on the basis that it believes it is improper for birds and animals to be taken from the wild. The RSPCA believes that, where birds become pests, they should be gassed-which is said to be the most humane method of destruction. A number of farmers in rural areas would have some concerns about that because of the massive mechanical problems involved in that method of destruction. I believe that the approach of the RSPCA has some problems. It obviously places great store on the standards of probity of public institutions as against private trade. Yet surely, provided housing of birds whilst being carried overseas was of a sufficiently high standard, the mere fact that they were destined for privatc sale would make little difference to the survival rates. It is in the interests of legally sanctioned exporters to minimise death rates from stress, which the RSPCA claims to be as high as 35 per cent of galahs taken from the wild within the first two weeks of captivity. Notwithstanding this, I ultimately agree with the RSPCA that it is far preferable for export stock to come from birds bred in captivity. Whilst we may not all agree with the keeping of intelligent birds such as cockatoos in captivity, the market is established. The question confronting us is really whether Australia should derive the possible export revenue or whether we should allow it to accrue to some other country. There is also the question of whether we allow the existing pools of common native birds held as pets in other nations to deteriorate with respect to their gene pools, given that they do not have the millions of galahs, cockatoos or corell as that we have in Australia. The RSPCA claims that this will be looked after by its public-to-public facility restriction. I doubt, however, that there would be sufficient numbers to stop the possibility of inbreeding. Surely genetic mutations of native birds held overseas are cruel to the species concerned. The imposition of a 10 per cent or 20 per cent levy on the value of exports at the wholesale selling price would allow the development of management plans to assist with conservation of rarer wildlife; help with increased policing of the wildlife trade, both into and out of Australia; and fund research into ways to minimise crop damage. Although the Government has provided funds for the latter area, more money could still be used for further research. As often happens in the Parliament, the Government is faced with an area that it has left largely untouched throughout the life of the last two Parliaments. The problem will not go away. With wheat growers facing a lower annual price this year, every dollar counts in trying to control the problem of birds attacking the grain crops. Why should land owners not be given the right to secure a new source of income from their land, which would occur if licensed collectors and exporters were able to catch these pests, at least in the short term, until a locally based industry exporting captive birds was able to be established? The present wasting of resources and time by primary producers who set up scare guns or scarecrows on their properties, or who use sheep dip or other methods of poisoning, could at least be obviated by the collection of this revenue. The honourable member for Parkes has drawn to my attention that the catching of cockatoos and galahs by nets in the grain growing areas has been very beneficial in controlling the birds. The fact is that, once a few of them have been caught, their friends and companions tend not to come back to the same area. The birds apparently have a high degree of intelligence and they understand that the scare guns seem to go off at certain times. The birds make a mockery of the guns as they become aware of them. Sadly, some species in other parts of the world, such as macaws in South America, may well be extinct by the time Australia gets around to relaxing its current controls. Little research seems to have been carried out into the factors that drive people overseas into placing foreign birds so high on their wish list, but it is fairly likely that an Australian sulphur-crested cockatoo, despite a current retail price of between $2,200 and $3,500 per specimen, is not regarded as a substitute for other species from Africa or South America by most bird fanciers. It seems illogical for the Minister on the one hand to say that up to six specimens of three varieties of fauna may be removed from Australia by departing permanent residents, whilst on the other hand denying commercial exporters the same benefits. I cannot see that there would be a great variance in the stresses to which these birds would be subjected, whether exported in small or large numbers. The critical issues seem to be the maintenance of standards of care rather than the ultimate destination and also whether the birds arc sourced from the wild or from captivity. Since the beginning of European settlement in Australia, a few species of our native birds have become pests in the grain growing areas. A theory has been advanced that the reproductive rate of these birds has been advanced by the intensive crop cultivation and the methods used in our cropping techniques. We need to make some morc investigations as to why the phenomenal increases in bird numbers have taken place in thcsc cropping areas. The opening up of an export market by initially using birds from the wild, and later on those reared in captivity, will not solve the present pest problem, but it will at least ensure that there are some funds available to conduct further research into this expansion of numbers. Eventually, we may know the precise answer to the seemingly uncontrollable rate of expansion. The Government's wildlife protection Bill, by failing to address these issues, is more notable for what it leaves out than for what it contains.",78
110,Mr ELLIOTT,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,"I have pleasure in speaking in support of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1991. In doing so, I wish to make a few remarks about the importance of this particular area of Commonwealth responsibility in the protection of our native fauna and to ensure that all of us, as Australian citizens who take a keen interest in the protection of our wildlife, can be satisfied that the legal regime which applies to the area of export and import control is contemporary with the value of much of the interest that occurs in this field. The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to provide a more flexible approach to the requirements for management programs which govern the export and import of wildlife. This is associated with more examination by the review committee of export controls. The amendments give additional powers in this area and ensure that the range of penalties provided for those people who contravene the law are adequate to meet the range of value of some of the smuggling that has occurred. For instance, as the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) noted in her second reading speech, there has been a lucrative market for smuggling of Australian wildlife. The question of importation and the potential disaster that can cause has been well documented not only from an environmental view but also in terms of the well-being of the wildlife concerned. Recently a court decision which involved 10 gang-gang cockatoos, Major Mitchell cockatoos and four musk lorikeets established that that particular smuggling effort alone had an overseas value of something like $US325,000which, I think most of us would say, should require that there are penalties commensurate with the sort of illegality that has occurred in those cases. However, on the other side of the coin, we have the example of many exotic species that have been imported into Australia and have moved from one part of Australia to another-such as rabbits, foxes, cats and prickly pear-which have changed parts of the Australian environment and had a significant detrimental effect on the Australian environment. We have to ensure that there are laws which effectively deal with the risk of an uncontrolled introduction of exotic species. I note that in her second reading speech the Minister referred to the problem of the cane toad. I thought it would be appropriate to touch on this becausc only this week there was the example of a cane toad being filmed-not quite in my electorate but very Close - to it-in Homebush Bay in Sydney. With due deferencc to yourself, Madam Deputy Speaker, as a Queenslander, it would appear that this cane toad came from somcwhere certainly north of Homebush Bay, and probably somewhere in Queensland. We from New South Wales have had a little trouble in recent times with the cane toads in the sporting arena! Mr Dubois-Northerners. 'v",80
111,Mr ELLIOTT,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,"Yes, the northerners. The concern is that it is apparently all too casy for this cane toad to end up in Homebush Bay creating the sort of problems which it has done. I quote from an article in the Australian yesterday about this cane toad: Bufo marin us was found sitting happily in a freshly dug hollow next to the children's playground in the Village Green area of Bicentennial Park at Sydney's Homebush Bay last week by a startled park ranger. Mr Dubois-Not too far from the abattoir.",81
112,Mr ELLIOTT,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,"Yes, not too far from the abattoir, as the member for St George rightly points out. The article continues: The ranger was not so concerned because Bufo was decidedly ugly, with slimy, green warty skinwhich he was. But he knew Bufo should not be ncar the playground-nor anywhere else in Sydney for that matter. Bufo is better known as the ugly Queenslander, the cane toad. Not a State of Origin rugby league footballer but an ecological disaster. The cane toad, first introduced to Queensland in 1935 in a short-sighted effort to control the cane beetle, has killed thousands of small domestic and native animals over the years and many scientists believe it now threatens some of the country's natural wonders, such as the Kakadu wilderness. The cane toad has a voracious sexual appetite, producing more than 20,000 eggs in a breeding season. Another large problem is that it is poisonous. The deputy director of the Australian Museum . .. said there was debate in the scientific community about how much damage was caused by the cane toad; but based on sheer numbers-in the tens of millions-there was unanimous agreement that it was a""major problem"". As far as the House is concerned when we are debating this particular legislation, it is clear that the sort of proliferation of exotic species such as the cane toad is one of the reasons why we do have laws in this area. It is also one of the reasons why we endeavour to ensure that there are p'cnalties so that people who engage in the illegal import and export of species-I am not suggesting there are too many people importing the cane toad currently because clearly that damage was done in the 1930s, but there are other problems that have occurred through short-sightedness from time to time. That is why today we have such bodies as the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the National Parks and Wildlife Service which take such a keen, enthusiastic and dedicated interest in these areas; as do organisations such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Indeed, only last year as part of a parliamentary inquiry into the Customs Service, the honourable member for St George (Mr Dubois) and I had the opportunity to see first-hand much of the diligent work that is done in northern Australia by the quarantine service and the important role it plays, particularly in dealing with the tropical conditions and the concerns for the natural fauna which thrives in parts of those areas. For that sort of reason, it is important that we do say that we want to have effective legality in this area. We want to ensure that the laws we establish are sustainable compared with the value of much of the smuggling of the species that does occur. One constantly hears examples of smuggling occurring that generate hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of value to the smugglers. But until the introduction of this particular legislation the penalties really have not matched that at all. The Bill therefore proposes that the maximum custodial penalty under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 should be raised from five to 10 years and that the option of imposing both a monetary and custodial penalty should be available. That is again a demonstration of the Government's commitment in this area. The exercise of controls on Australian and international wildlife requires, in addition to a commitment to effective law enforcement, an efficient and effective administrative control of legitimate trade in wildlife and wildlife products. The Wildlife Protection Act sets out the circumstances under which the transactions for scientific research and zoological display may occur and defines the circumstances in which the private and commercial transactions may be permitted. Clearly, there are cases where it is possible to ensure that within the legal framework we have some export and import. The law has been established, and the enforcement of the law in this area is so difficult that it is really important to try to maintain a rcgime that all in the community can feel will be sustained and, if matters do gct to the stage of prosecution, people will receive a punishment that fits the crime. That is clearly what this legislation is designed to achieve-to improve the management program, to ensure that the definitions of the specimens that will be considered by the pat:tieular program are precise and, at the same time, to take account of current trends and markets in the illegal smuggling operations that have proliferated in some areas. It will give all workers in this fieldmost of whom show enormous dedication and commitment to the provision of our quarantine services, our wildlife and our national parks-the confidence that, if they see a matter through to the stage of prosecution, appropriate measures will be taken; and that there is a sufficient penalty provision in the law so that people do not get away unduly lightly for the crimes they may have committed. The Bill has a very positive and demonstrative effect on the community at large, which has a great deal of interest in our native fauna, to ensure that there is a proper legal framework that current trends and conditions provide for. All of these issues give rise to a greater community concern about the protection of wildlife species and the need to ensure that the natural environment is one that we take a closer interest in. Yesterday I read some articles about the great tragedy caused by driftnet fishing. There was a time-and this is related to this Billwhen people probably did not pay too much regard to the devastation that driftnet fishing caused to much of the world. A report released in Washington a couple of days ago indicates that driftnet ing in the North Pacific is killing more than 500,000 seabirds each year, as well as tens of thousands of dolphins seals and porpoises. For most of us that 'would be a great tragedy, - part from anything else. It would be qUIte repugnant if the world community were not able to develop proper mechanisms to ensure that the very unsatisfactory aspects of driftnet fishing were stopped. We have made it clear that we believe that driftnet fishing should be banned. To get the world community to take a lead in this regard is di-cul-. That is why, when we come to legIslatIOn such as this it is important for Australia not only testablish the regime of enforcement that we expec.t of Austr.alians in dealing with the wIldlIfe protectIOn, but also to give a lead to the world community in terms of our commitment not only to wildlife importation and exportation, but also to the tragedy and devastation caused by driftnet fishing, and other environmental areas such as the protection of the Antarctic. For these reasons, I think that measures in this Bill will be important in providing leadership on environmental issues that as a global community, we should takseriously. It is for those reasons that I am pleased to see that initiatives have been taken in this regard. With regard to the commitment to global biological diversity, we have shown our commitment to ensure that proper action is taken in relation to the depletion of the ozone layer. There are other measures in this area of public policy on the environment where this Government is taking a lead. Our commitment to wildlife protection as proposed in this Bill is one that the whole community should see as being a very positive and tangible step when they see the sorts of things which they find repugnant on their tel-vision screens, and arc concerned at findmg our cane toads turning up in Homebush, Bay Park in Sydney, There will be mechanisms, through the legal framework, quarantine and othcr parks and wildlife services, which will ensure that Australians can be proud of the treatment and the measures that this Governmcnt provides for the protection fish- of Australia's magnificent natural fauna.  p.m.)-I am pleascd to join with the honourable mcmber for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) and the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) on this side of the Housc to speak on the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill, which amends the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982, which in itself relates to the regulation of our flora and fauna. The main provisions in the Bill increase custodial penalties from flYe to 10 years for wildlife smuggling; tighten the definition in the Act to prevent importers using Australia as a holding area while they arrange markets in other countries; restrict to six the maximum number of household pets people may take with them when leaving for overseas; and give the Minister greater flexibility in determining whether to allow 'trade in certain common species without the need for a management plan. These amendments have been in the pipeline for a long period of time and are generally of minor importance. While I will not oppose this Bill I believe that more consideration and' attention should have been given by the Government to allowing for the liberalisation of trade in Australian pest species. I say this because in recent years a number of our more common species-particularly the sulphur-crested cockatoo, Cacatua gelerita; the long-billed corella Cacatua tenuirostris; and the galah, Cacatua roseicapilla-have increased in numbers to the point where they are no longer an attractive addition to the natural environment and are, in fact causing significant damage to crops and - ther agricultural production. The growth to plague proportions of these three species is threatening the balance not just between them and the human environment, but also between them and other less common species. I have absolutely no hesitation in acknowledging and supporting increased penalties for smuggling wildlife into the international market and for the protection of our endangered species. However, where a wildlife species is not endangered and is not an exotic disease risk to the recipient nation, I strongly believe that export trade should be facilitated. For many years now there have been calls for the lifting of the ban on commercial exports of many native birds, particularly the pest species I referred to, and these calls have been rejected by wildlife authorities and relevant State and Federal Ministers. However, as far back as September 1976, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation in its report on trafficking in fauna in Australia recommended the relaxation of export controls, the argument being that the present export policy does not discriminate between rare and endangered species of fauna and common or pest species. Species considered as pests are given the same export protection as the rare and endangered ones, hence the absurd situation of smugglers earning large sums of money abroad from fauna which is being destroyed daily-legally and illegally-in Australia because it is a pest. The honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) made an excellent speech and she mentioned the fact that there are some methods that can be used to control pest species. She referred to the reduction of the nesting habitat of some of these birds via the removal of dead trees. Of course, this is not a sensible suggestion for two reasons. First of all, it is the nesting habitat of birds and, secondly, in a number of States, particularly Victoria, it is simply an illegal act to remove a dead tree from property without suitable licensing and meeting the various regulatory controls. The relaxation of export controls for common or pest species would allow authorities to concentrate their efforts-good as they are, but small as they are-on the conservation of a considerably smaller number of species. The House of Representatives Committee at that time carefully analysed the attitudes to our fauna export control policy and, while recognising the validity of some of the arguments about relaxing the controls on the export of our fauna, believed that there were some fundamental anomalies in the existing policy which should be dealt with if public support of conservation measures was sought. How can the public respect a policy which allows controlled destruction of a species and the deliberate development of mutations by aviculturists on the one hand while, on the other hand, denies the right of interested organisations and individuals overseas to keep the same animals under better conditions? The rationale for the proposed relaxation of controls was that, by depriving the illicit market of the birds and other fauna commonly available in Australia, and depressing the price overseas, a substantial proportion of the smugglers' market would be removed. In supporting these recommendations, I make it clear that I am not in any way suggesting that the export of native birds is an answer to the pest problems which our farmers face at various intervals throughout the year. The numbers which need to be culled are many times higher than those which will be able to be exported, and captive breeding will produce a quality export product which will win the top end of the legal international market once the bans on exports are lifted. However, I strongly believe that controlled legal export would undermine and destroy the illegal trade and that the farmers' problems of crop damage would in a small way be alleviated. I live in an area where some hundreds of thousands, in fact millions, of these pest species are a ""daily sight destroying crops. I am aware of one farmer last year who sowed his crop three times. He did not even get to the harvesting stage. I am also aware of a more humorous situation where a local racing club built a new judges' box and lined it with soft, soundproofing material, only to find a week later the long-billed corella had totally destroyed the new judges' box. I believe exports can be desirable and humane-more humane, in fact, than the current methods of controlling pest species. Birds would no longer be subject to the cruel conditions of the illegal trade. Those members of this House who were part of the House of Representatives committee saw some of the horrific circumstances these birds go through in attempts to illegally export them. It should also be stated that part of the revenue collected from exports-and there could be a tax applied to these exportscould be used for research into pest problems and could be used for funding, monitoring and enforcement of bird exports.",81
113,Mr COBB,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,"An excellent idea.  excellent idea. I come from an electorate of some 60,000 square kilometres, of which 30 per cent of the whole land mass is made up of national park. We are very proud of those national parks-from the Hattah-Kulkyne National Park with its incredible stand of red gums, the Wyperfeld National Park, the Big Desert and Little Desert National Parks with their incredible diversity of flora and fauna and examples of desert-type national park activity to the Grampians National Park in the southern area, one of the most outstanding national parks in this country. So I do understand, coming from an electorate which has so much national park, the very real interests and concern that people coming from urban areas have in the protection of public lands and in the protection of our flora and fauna. These people come from areas-not through their own fault but through circumstance-where most of the land mass has been covered with cement and bitumen, and I can understand the very real concern that urban members of this House have for the protection of our exotic animals, birds, trees and plant species. When we have such large areas of national parks, a stage is reached when management becomes a very big issue. If we were able to provide some additional $30m to $50m a year as a result of a tax on the legal exportation of these pest species, it would give us available funds to ensure that the. control and management of these national 'parks are realistic options. During the 1982 drought the most degraded region in my whole electorate was the Hattah-Kulkyne National Park. It was overrun by kangaroos. They were ?--t culled at that time because of the actIvIties of radical groups within the community which frustrated the genuine attempts of the Victorian Government and the Department of Conservation and Environment down there to carry out humane culling processes. This is an emotional argument and is not likely to be taken on by Ministers, who are more concerned with satisfying the tunnel vision of so many of our radical conservation groups. Preservation and management for species which are truly endangered, truly vulnerable and truly rare is absolutely essential, as is conservation management. For species, however, which are not endangered, not vulnerable and not rare other activities should be allowed. It is absolutely essential that this country, with its great variety and diversity of flora and fauna, maintains the - s­ sential ecological processes and lIfe support systems which will preserve this genetic diversity. We can ensure the sustainable utilisation of species and ecosystems while still supporting millions of rural communities as well as our major industries. It is a real challenge to this Parliament-and it will become a greater challenge over the years ahead as we try to combine the processes of economic development with the processes of conservation. I do not oppose this legislation, but I believe this nation is not acting in a rational or mature manner in relation to this issue. On behalf of the Opposition and its spokesman on the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), I simply say to the Governm-nt that we support the amendments which have been developed during the course of this legislation and as a result of input by many groups outside this Parliament. I believe the amendments place a greater obligation on the Government i- relat.ion to the issues we have been dlscussmg, particularly to publish for public comment many of the management plans which will be necessary on this issue and on the management of our national flora and fauna our parks and our public lands, et cetera. I support the legislation.",85
114,Mr SNOWDON,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,"Northern TcrritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications)(3.56 p.m.)-I rise to support the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1991. Essentially, it is housekeeping legislation which, thanks to the Opposition, will receive bipartisan support of the Parliament. Amendment 2 is of particular importance. This amendment inserts new sections 9A and 9B which require the designated authority to give public notice on an annual basis inviting intcrested persons or groups to register their interest in commenting on any proposals to declare a specimen a controlled specimen or any proposals for declarations of approved management programs under section lO of the principal Act, the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. This measure reinforces the Government's ongoing desire to open up the process of legislation and government to the people of Australia. By registering their interests, as I am sure many groups and individuals will, people can ensure that they will be kept up to date and consulted on any changes to the Act. There is a very real need to ensure appropriate legislation to cover the import and cxport of Australian native wildlife. I am sure that is supported not only by members by this House but also by the broader and wider Australian community. An aspect I will come to later is the export of crocodiles. It is something which I would not say is close to my heart, but it is certainly important to the Northern Territory and, indeed, to northern Australia. I will address that matter in a little more detail later on. Of concern to all of us is that the illegal export of or trade in wildlife not only is dangerous but also is something which most reasonable people would regard as reprehensible. Invariably, it leads to a high loss of life of animals and the widespread destruction of both native animals and fauna and flora. The question is: why is it that people regard themselves as having the right to treat animals in such a way as to cause them extreme pain and hurt? A recent experience in the Northern Territory exemplifies this. Customs officials, through diligent application, came across the smuggling of rhesus monkeys into Australia. When one sees rhesus monkeys in captivity, or even in pictures, one sees them as fairly harmless animals. We need to understand that they can and often do carry quite dangerous diseases. I bring to the attention of the House the work of the Commonwealth Customs in the Northern Territory and the headline in the Northern Territory News of 15 June-'Customs snare monkey runners'. The newspaper article states: Two monkey runners have evaded prosecution under wildlife and quarantine laws by being sent back to Bulgaria for breaking immigration rules. The two Bulgarian women, aged 37 and 30, and a 12-year-old girl, the daughter of one of the travellers, were held in custody after Customs officials discovered a monkey at Darwin airport on Thursday night. It goes on further: The baby female rhesus monkey was destroyed under quarantine regulations. The NT Quarantine and Inspection branch director, Mr Ian Kilduff, said the monkey's body would be sent under high security to an animal health laboratory in Victoria for rabies testing. The NT Collector of Customs, Mr Bill Fitzpatrick, said the women were targeted by Customs officials soon after they got ofr their Qantas flight from Bangkok and Singapore on Thursday. That is, the Thursday prior to 15 June. It is important that we appreciate the lengths to which Customs and the quarantine agencies go to seeure these animals. We also need to comprehend that this rhesus monkey apparently came from Vietnam. The Customs officials apparently found a veterinary certificate from Hanoi vouching for the health of two monkeys. We are told that one monkey died prior to arriving in Australia. The article goes on: The purpose of smuggling the monkey was unknown, but the women carried little money and Customs officials were also alerted by the ""unusual travel situation"" . . . The difficulty with rhesus monkeys is that, apart from the fact that they are exotic animals and they are prohibited, they can carry rabies. That is a disease which Australian quarantine officials and the Australian community are very keen to ensure does not become endemic to Australia. I would like to commend the work of the quarantine and Customs officials in not only apprehending these people but also taking appropriate action to ensure that the monkey was treated humanely-if I can use such a term-and was put down with the least possible pain. Unlike those people who trade in what I regard as a fairly bloody exercise, the way in which the Customs and quarantine officials deal with these animals is very professional. Since the Act came into force on 1 May 1984 there have been 49 prosecutions involving the export or attempted export of 186 Australian native birds with an estimated overseas value in excess of $1. 8m; the export or attempted export of 301 Australian native reptiles, valued at approximately $155,000; the attempted export of Australian marine shells, with an estimated value of some $30,000; the import of 43 exotic birds, with an estimated value in Australia of $440,000; the import of monkeys, such as the rhesus monkey; and the import of turtles, piranha, tarantulas, 112 koi carp, lungfish, and otter jaguar skins. One has to wonder what motivates the people concerned. Obviously, they are after the cash. Mr Simmons-Greed.",86
115,Mr SNOWDON,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,"As the Minister at the table says, it is absolute greed. The bastardry of their actions and the way in which they treat this wildlife is to be conof demned. We are talking of a very ugly and extremely cruel trade. It is a trade that sees a single orchid or parrot selling for as much as $US15,000 and an ounce of rhinoceros horn costing more than an ounce of gold. A fur coat made from South American ocelots can fetch up to $40,000 in West Germany. That is the sort of greed that I do not think we should tolerate. Whatever action can be taken has to be taken if we are to bring this trade to an end. Fortunately for us, the work of our very efficient Customs and quarantine services in Australia has seen the stemming of this illegal trade. I guess we will have all seen the pictures on television graphically depicting the way in which these people catch birds. I come from a part of Australia which is not only extremely beautiful but also has an abundance of wildlife native to Australia. We have just heard debates about Coronation Hill and Kakadu National Park. The number of special species found only in that region is extraordinary. One needs to bear in mind that the quality of our flora and fauna in Australia is something about which we need to be very proud. We ought to be protecting it in every possible way. We ought not to be allowing people to exploit it by the illegal export of animals and plants. It is an horrendous activity. I draw the attention of honourable members, as I have done already, to the interception at the Darwin Airport on 15 June of a baby female rhesus monkey. That is a clear demonstration of the need for this legislation. The health of the monkey was not known. I am aware that the monkey, as I have said, was destroyed and its blood sent to Victoria for rabies testing. It is clear that the introduction of diseases such as this poses an enormous and threat to our country, particularly our pastoral and farming industries, and not least, of course, to human beings. Clearly, rabies is a disease which we would not want in our community. In 1998-89 the following items were, among others, intercepted at our Customs barriers: 796 turtle products; 2,785 packages of medicines containing derivatives endangered species; 2,251 orchid plants; 649 elephant products; 1,482 reptile products; and 1,468 giant clam shells. The legislation not only restricts illegal imports and exports; it also regulates and facilitates the carrying on of valid businesses. There are currently a number of export industries approved under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act. These include various nurseries which export products such as tree ferns, wildflowers and bull kelp. As well, businesses export kangaroos from Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia; bush possums and mutton-birds from Tasmania; and animals, birds, fish and I, reptiles bred in captive breeding programs. As I said at the outset, one area that I would like to make special reference to is that of crocodiles, with which I am particularly familiar. The crocodile industry in the Northern Territory is a young and thriving industry. It is involved in the practice of export and is assisted by this Act. The progress and export potential of the Territory's crocodile industry has been praised on a number of occasions. The fledgling crocodile skin industry has grown from zero to be worth more than $1 m in exports this year. On current growth projections, the crocodile skin export industry could be worth more than $20m in five to six years. The crocodile meat industry also has potential for export earnings. The Territory is known for producing the best value skins so it commands the best prices. This industry is a shining example of what small businesses can achieve through exports and how we can benefit from the skilled management of natural resources. I praise the role of Mr Jon Bache, a Territorian and President of the International Crocodile Farmers Association, for his role, and that of his industry counterparts in the top end of Australia, in setting the industry on a firm footing. They have taken a very commendable and progressive approach to their industry. Previous speakers have addressed the question of feral animals. It is with some feeling that I express my concern about feral animals in this country and our need to ensure that we get rid of them as far as is possible, and to ensure through this legislation that we do not allow, either legally or otherwise, the importation of animals which could cause the same sorts of difficulties as have been caused by the previous importation of feral animals. This is of particular significance to the people who live in the central desert areas of Australia. Prior to the coming of nonAboriginal Australians to this country, Aboriginal people in central and northern Australia were guaranteed a constant and sustainable food and fuel supply from their environment. With the introduction of feral animals such as camels, horses, pigs, buffalo and rabbits, we saw the destruction of ecosystems. That meant not only that species native to Australia were destroyed, but also that the livelihood of Aboriginal Australians was put at risk. It is important that we understand the long term implications this has had, not only on these Aboriginal communities but also on those ecosystems in particular. It has meant, for example, that flora and fauna which once thrived in parts of Australia that were sensitive to environmental changes have been destroyed and lost to us. I think that is a matter of some shame. and regret. We ought to take every possible step to ensure that there is no repetition of that. I would like to make special mention of the role of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service of this country. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, one part of my electorate plays a very important role in the quarantine service-the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, where there is a quarantine station.",87
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,I opened it!,88
117,Mr SNOWDON,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,"There you go. I am very pleased to talk to you about it, Mr Deputy Speaker, because a good friend of mine, Dr Miles Cooper, is the head of the quarantine station on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and the people there have very interesting life. The Minister at the tablethe Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons)-and I have visited the quarantine station in the past. Mr Simmons-We look forward to visiting it again.",88
118,Mr SNOWDON,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,"Yes, we look forward to visiting it again shortly. I am not sure whether there are any white rhinoceros there-Mr Carlton-Just keep away from those white rhinoceros!",88
119,Mr SNOWDON,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,"Yes, indeed. When people want to import exotic animals into this country, those animals have to be quarantined. The quarantine station on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands has served the Australian community well in this regard. The alpacas recently imported into Australia came via that station; that is where they were quarantined. The rhinoceros that I understand were to have been brought into Australia were certainly going to be taken to the station on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands for their quarantine. I am not sure whether that has taken place; certainly the preparations-and I do not know of any trepidation on their partwere made by the staff at the quarantine station to handle those rather horny animals. Mr Simmons-Hardening the defences.",88
120,Mr SNOWDON,WILDLIFE PROTECTION,"They were certainly undertaken hardening the defences and building fences. I commend the people who work quarantine station on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands for their work. They provide a valuable service to the entire Australian community, not only because of their sciI entific contribution but also, as a result their work, by allowing new industries, such as the alpaca wool industry, to be developed. I cannot finish my contribution without registering my great delight at living the Northern Territory. I have already mentioned the environment of northern Australia and I have briefly mentioned Kakadu National Park. It is very imporand tant to me, and I am sure to all Austrait lians, to recognise the contribution of this Government to the preservation of native species in this country, and the work of the scientific community in looking at ways to ensure the preservation of these species and the integrity of our national parks. In that regard the Au-tralian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) is responsible for the administration of two to: parks in northern Australia that are on (1) the World Heritage List-Kakadu Nagram tional Park and the Uluru National Park. definition, The work being done by the ANPWS in northern Australia is nothing short of asthat tounding. [t has limited resources, but has earned the respect not only of the (2) people who use the parks, but also of the new clause: traditional owners of the parks and all levels of government. At the same time the Northern Territory Conservation Commission has also played a very important role in the expansion of the park system in northern Australia and the preservation of our native flora and fauna. One park-the Gurig National Park on the Cobourg Peninsula-is very important. I know that the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) has a particular interest in that area. I think it is important that we acknowledge that not only does the Commonwealth have an important role to play in looking after this flora and fauna, but that role is also by our State counterparts. The large Northern Territory Conservation Commission has a very good record and is held in very high regard for the work it at the has done in park administration. The crocodile management system to which I earlier referred is very important. earlier spoke about Mr Bache; the breedof ing programs he and others have developed in the Northern Territory are the envy of the world. Australia has a ban on the export of live crocodiles. That ban is supported by the industry: why should overseas countries get our good live aniin mals when they have killed all theirs? That is something we should reflect upon when we deal with this sort of legislation. We need to preserve our native heritage, we need to look after it to ensure that is preserved for future generations.",89

122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"Before the debate on this order of the day is resumed, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this motion and order of the day No.3, Government Business.",91
123,Mr SIMMONS,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate and, at the same time, support very strongly the measures of the Government as introduced in its economic statement of 12 March. It continues the important process of restructuring Australia's economy which will enable Australian industry to operate more competitively and efficiently in the international market as we move towards the year 2000. Today, however, I specifically want to spend my time outlining the Government's package of measures and look at what those measures mean for Australia's major export growth industry-I refer, of course, to tourism. Before this Government came to office, tourism rarely rated a mention in this House. It was an industry with unlimited potential for employment and income generation which, unfortunately, found little favour. Few were prepared to regard it in a similar light to any other economic ex- activity. It was the Hawke Government and John Brown, as the Hawke Government's Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism in 1983, who finally put the industry on its current very successful growth path. At that time the Government initially doubled the level of funding to the Australian Tourist Commission which enabled the Commission to undertake some of the most successful and innovative promotional and marketing campaigns ever conducted by any country in our major visitor source markets. It encouraged investment in the development of the industry's infrastructure and increased funding in training institutions designed to raise the level of skill and professionalism within the tourism industry. Industry responded enthusiastically to the impetus and the general direction that was finally provided by a national government which clearly recognised the industry's potential. Of course, the results are there for all to see. We now have a tourism infrastructure which provides a vastly superior quality and range of facilities than just a few short years ago. Last year, Australia welcomed more international visitors than ever before, exceeding the 2.25 million visitors who arrived in 1988, which had the added attractions of Australia's Bicentenary celebrations and the World Expo in Brisbane. I am pleased to report today that the January international arrival figures indicate a similar very positive trend: an increase of one per cent in international visitor arrivals, with continuing strong growth in our major source market of Japan and an increase of more than 19 per cent in our traditional market of New Zealand but, more importantly, there was also a very significant increase in the number of holiday-makers and convention arrivals. More than $6 billion of Australia's export earnings last year were derived from this industry-more than three times the figure when the Hawke Government came to office in 1983. This industry now represents about 9 per cent of the total value of Australian exports. That is an exceptional performance over a period when many of our other export industries have experienced considerable difficulties. Tourism has indeed been one of the success stories of the 1980s. At this point I want to say that it is the Government's intention to keep it that way right throughout the course of this decade and beyond. The Government's economic package, which will accelerate the rate of exposure to market forces and international competition across all sectors of the economy, will present few problems for most tourism operators who have worked in a very openly competitive environment for years. Apart from the umbrella promotions undertaken by the Australian Tourist Commission, tourism has traditionally not relied on government assistance. By opening other sectors that have been quarantined for many years to the same competitive forces, efficient industries such as tourism will be less disadvantaged by distortions to resource allocation which influence business and investment decision. Tourism can be expected to benefit from the fact that scarce investment funds will be directed more to the most efficient economic activities. Meanwhile, reductions in the cost of inputs through tariff reductions and wholesale sales tax cuts will also boost competitiveness and enhance the performance of export industries such as tourism. I now turn to a number of the very specific elements contained in the economic package which will be of direct interest to the tourism industry. An area of taxation which has been of particular concern to the industry is the rate of depreciation on plant and equipment. With the demand for tourism services ever changing, it is difficult for tourist facilities, such as resorts or hotels, to maintain their competitive status over 10, or even five, years without the need for regular upgrading of their amenities. As the Treasurer at the time explained, the Government has agreed to simplify depreciation provisions and to clarify the effective life depreciation system. This will introduce greater flexibility in the definition of effective life which reflects more accurately the real life of tourism plant and equipment. These changes will remove existing ambiguities and simplify the claims process considerably. They will also assist tourism industry efforts to maintain high quality modern facilities in tourism plant and equipment and will, I am absolutely certain, be welcomed by the tourism industry. As the tourism industry continues to grow it will need to remain sensitive to the environmental consequences of development in order to ensure that Australia's natural attractions are maintained. The process of preparing environmental impact statements, however, has been imposed by legislation-a costly burden on developers and the industry for which existing taxation provisions made no allowance. The Government has therefore decided to amend the relevant tax laws to allow tax deductibility of capital expenditure on equipment, consultants, expertise and overheads involved in the preparation of environmental impact statements. The tourism industry is not about destroying or despoiling our natural assets, which are the very reason why Australia is such an attractive place for international visitors as well as for holidaying Australians. As the industry continues to grow, however, we will need to be conscious of the care of our natural environment and the consequences of development. I believe the Government's initiative in this area will certainly encourage that process. Tourism will also benefit in a more general way from other initiatives within the economic package. The comprehensive education and training package announced by the Government will improve the skills base of the nation's work force and offer many additional places in training institutes for Australians. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has explained, tourism has already created some 100,000 new jobs during the 1980s. Many additional employment opportunities will emerge in the tourism sector during the 1990s encouraged by the Government's training initiatives. Also included in the package are measures directed towards the promotion of excellence and improvements in management skills which will assist in strengthening the overall skills level within the tourism industry. Tourism is a diverse sector, comprising many small independent operators providing a range of services in support of basic tourism infrastructure such as transport and accommodation. The Government's initiatives for small and mediumsized business development are aimed at improving efficiency and productivity by removing regulatory and other impcdiments to development and providing appropriate assistance at critical stages of establishment and growth. Many operators reliant on tourism for their livelihoods will clearly benefit from them. Other problems which have affected many small to medium-sized tourism operators, such as access to long term funds for business development, are also being addressed by the Government in discussion with major financial institutions. The high priority given to tourism is clearly emphasised in the decisions that have been taken by this Government. They recognise the industry's significant economic contribution as an export industry as well as its enormous employment and income growth potential. They complement other recent decisions which will also encourage the growth of Australia's tourism sector. Importantly, one of those very significant developments was the decision taken by the Hawke Government prior to Christmas 1990. I refer, of course, to Cabinet's decision to provide an additional $23m in funding for tourism activities; $22.6m of that funding was to be directed to international promotion taking advantage of the very generous offer made by Greg Norman to be our new standard-bearer for international tourism. A further $400,000 of that $23m was made available to the Bureau of Tourism Research to further complement its research activities within the field. But, portantly, the decision to increase funding to the Australian Tourist Commission by $22.6m virtually allowed the Commission to double its spending on international advertising and promotion this year. In fact, in the last three to four months of this current fIscal year, something in the order of $41 m in an advertising and promotional blitz will cover the target markets of Japan, Asia, the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom and parts of Europe as well as New Zealand, in making sure that Australia continues to be seen as the best tourist destination in the world. It is important that in this very competitive world, as other countries realise the value of tourism, that Australia is up there maintaining its high profile as the best tourist destination in the world. We all know that is the case and we have to convince other potential travellers from other parts of the world. While most other destinations have reported severe recent downturns in visitors, the limited impact in Australia is certainly a testament to the strong perception of Australia as a safe visitor destination, an image which we have subtly encouraged over recent years. In fact, Australia appears to have benefited to an extent from a diversion of travel from some of the more troubled areas of the world. I think the fIgures I quoted earlier in my contribution this afternoon amply demonstrate that point: that is, there has been an increase of some 1 per cent of international visitor arrivals in January 1991. With the uncertainties of the Gulf war now over, the timing of this new promotional campaign featuring Greg Norman as our new standard bearer is, therefore, particularly appropriate. The extra money that is going to this campaign is being dominated by television campaigns but it will also feature in print campaigns and direct mail campaigns in those target markets. After final filming takes place and the advertising campaigns are shown in those key markets, I believe we will shortly see the benefits of that advertising. As an indication of where that advertising is up imto, the television campaigns commenced in Korea in late April and in Japan about a week or so after that. They have alrcady featured for some time now in New Zealand, and through the United Kingdom and Europe, and the advertising campaign in the United States is now well under way. In the coming months I also intend to bring before the Government for consideration a national strategy for the tourism industry which will provide direction for future government policy and for industry planning. The strategy is currently being formulated specifically to provide all levels of government, as well as industry and other interests, with a clear statement of the Government's strategic approach to the development of the industry as we move towards the turn of the century. It will form the basis for the formulation of government tourism policy and aims to enhance community awareness of the economic, environmental and cultural significance of the tourism industry. Tourism has a key role to play in the process of restructuring this economy. The Government is giving the industry every opportunity to do so. The Government's economic statement of March this year is an indication of just how seriously it is addressing that task.",91
124,Mr MCGAURAN,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"by leave-Australia's various rural commodities have shown an enlightened and progressive use of rural research and development (R&D) to enhance their long term competitiveness. Despite this, the capacity of the rural sector to sustain its research and development effort has been seriously eroded because of the slump in farm incomes. Under the current system, research and development activities relevant to the particular rural commodities are identified by the various rural research corporations. The corporations dispense funds derived from the commodity groups by way of a levy system which draws on a fixed percentage of the value of each year's production. Acting as brokers of sorts, the corporation then contracts research to a wide sway of specialist research agencies. The critical problem facing this research and development effort is that production for a number of central commodities-including wool, wheat and sugar-has fallen dramatically over the past year. As a result, the funds available for sustaining a high level of R&D effort in vital areas of the agricultural sector are jeopardised. In other words, as the value of the crop plummets, so does the industry contribution to rural research and development and, correspondingly, the Government's contribution on a matching basis. The rural industries will fund up to 0.5 per cent of the yearly production of a crop into research and development, and the Government matches that dollar for dollar. One does not need to be a genius to realise that, as the value of our rural commodities falls. so does the fixed percentage directed towards research. For a long time we have known anecdotally and through common sense observation that this was occurring, but now we are getting from the Government, by way of Senate Estimate committee answers, as well as answers to questions on notice, the quantifying of what that loss amounts to. In other words, we are finding out from the Government just what research programs are to be curtailed or abandoned. Though little has been said of this issue, the falling commodity prices and farm incomes could well decimate vital areas of Australia's rural research effort. As a result of the approaches I have made to various government departments of late, the state of the rural research effort is of serious concern. I should ada that the picture is not altogether clear because of conflicting information received from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. In answering questions as to the extent of the downturn in rural research, these two departments are at odds. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has presented to me a body of argument which is in direct contradiction to that presented to me on the same issue by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free). The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has presented a rosy view of the outlook for crop related research and development. In reply to my questions on notice to the Senate Estimates committee, the Minister reported: . . . there has been no funding curtailment or withdrawal of research commitments within crops commodities as a result of little or declining financial resources. Moreover, for the coming year the Minister said, 'No curtailment of research for crops commodities is predicted'. More generally, in response to my question as to which crops research effort has been or expect to be affected by either declining government or industry contributions, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy states: No research efforts are expected to be affected. If we accept the advice tendered by the Minister and his Department, there is no curtailment of research into the crops commodities. These are direct quotcs from documents arising out of the Senate Estimates committee. This analysis of the situation facing crop related research is at odds with the advice I have received from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, which is responsible for the activities of kcy rural research agencies such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). In reply to my recent question on notice, the Minister for Science and Technology predicts a severe downturn in wheat related R&D over the coming years. The Minister for Science and Tcchnol'ogy replied: The real impact of the rural downturn has not yet been felt. However, it will affect work funded by wheat, wool and sugar funds in 1991/1992. Individual projects will be affected and CSIRO will-be seeking to negotiate with funding agencies to ensure that cuts arc made selectively so that research of the highest priority can still hc carried out effectively. There we have it. Who is right? The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is tclling us that there is no reduction in crops commodities research, and now we have the Minister for Science and Technology, who is responsible for the CSIRO, advising us in writing-as definitely as his ministerial colleague-that there will be significant cuts because there is a smaller amount of funding available for research. The words of the Minister for Sciencc and Technology amount to a far cry from those of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who, as we can obviously see, has reported that things are 'steady as she goes'. The Minister for Science and Technology reports that the CSIRO is already gearing up for cuts. He advises: with respect to the CSIRO Institute of Plant Production and Processing, reductions signalled for 1991/1992 include a 54% fall in operating funds to be provided by the Grains Corporation for 21 continuing projects in the Division of Plant Industry. A 54 per cent fall in operating funds! The Minister also says: The Division (of Plant Industry) has had only five new projects approved by the (Grains) Corporation, which is 50% down on the rolling average, and there has been a 60% reduction in the operating funds allocated for these projects. The Minister continues: There could be a continuing reduction in support for wheat research with the termination of current projects in 1992 and 1993. The downturn will also affect research on other cereals and 'Oilsecds funded by the Grains Corporation. The Ministcr for Science and Technology advises me that the research effort for sugar will also be adversely affccted by the downturn in production, but the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy tells me that sugar research will be unaffected despite the drop in available research funds this year. Where does the truth lie? Is it with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy or the Minister for Science and Technology? While the Minister for Primary Industries attempts to draw down the curtain on the crisis facing the rural rescarch community, the Minister for Science and Technology, to his credit, seemingly has been more honest in this instance, The impact of the reduction in the wool research effort caused by the crisis which has engulfed the wool industry is serious. It will havc far-reaching ramifications for the entirc rural rescarch effort. It also threatens to adversely affect the long term viability of wool against other, synthetic fibres. The research resources of the Wool Research and Development Corporation reach deeply into the nation's research effort. With regard to that research effort, funded through the wool industry levies, the Minister for Primary Industries tells me that although there have been and will be continuing cuts of 10 per cent per annum until 1996-he admits there will be cuts of 10 per cent per annum until 1996-these cuts 'would not necessitate the termination of research projects'. The Minister argues that, simply, present research will be concluded at its scheduled time and no new research will be contracted. This is an interesting point. Listen to what the Minister for Science and Technology said on this issue. He said that wool research funds support rabbit research efforts within CSIRO's Division of Wildlife and Ecology which, 'stands to be affected by the reduction in wool funds'. The Minister also advises that the reductions in wool funded research will affect large scale drought prediction research programs conducted by the CSIRO's internationally renowned Division of Atmospheric Research. Is the Minister for Primary Industries prepared to stand by his statement that the downturn in wool research will not necessitate the termination of research projects? Beyond this, the impact of the downturn on the wool industry on rural research activity-which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy seeks to mask and conceal-will be devastating. The Minister for Science and Technology did not pull any punches in answering my questions on notice in this regard. He advised that CSIRO's Division of Plant Industry's new wool supported projects, will suffer a 26 per cent reduction in operating funds and the division will have to review the employment status of six research staff. He advised that CSIRO's Division of Soils will 'incur reductions for continuing projects' as well as a curtailment in the number of new projects which will receive funding. In addition, the Minister for ence and Technology advised that the collapse of support for wool research has also affected computer based decision support packages being developed by the Division of Plant Industry. I ask the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to reassess his statement that no continuing research projects funded by the Wool Research and Development Council will be affected. Alternatively, I ask him to publicly rebuke his ministerial colleague the Minister for Science and Technology for supposedly creating-if the Minister for Primary Industries is to be believed-a contrived fear campaign in the research community and primary industry, and to show the community why the assessments he has made differ so profoundly from his colleague's. The crisis in the wool research base supporting the industry is severe. The CSIRO's Institute of Animal Production and Processing is reeling from the effects of the shortage of research funds. The Minister for Science and Technology advised me as follows: although ... no continuing projects have been stopped (in this Division) some of the ""new"" projects were intended to replace existing ones (have been cancelled) and have therefore been effectively terminated. These projects have dramatically weakened the wool industry's research base in respect of wool production, wool harvesting and raw wool marketing. The Minister for Primary Industries says that there will be no termination of continuing research projects in respect of wool. I will read to the House the advice of the Minister for Science and Technology on this matter. He said: If the situation does not improve in the next five yearsand it will not, because the Minister for Primary Industries says that the deep cuts in wool research will continue to 1996CSIRO's wool research may well have fallen to half its current level. This would mean not only a reduction in the amount of research . . . but also substantial reduction in available research skills because of the inevitable reduction in staff numbers. Sci- What does the Minister for Primary Industries and' Energy think of this? Does he agree that there might just be a problem here that requires his action? It is also worrying that the Minister for Science and Technology points out that Australia's wool textile research effort is next to be lopped. It is this effort which is critical to the domestic wool industry's long term capability to compete with synthetic fibres which are being aggressively marketed abroad. What is the outlook for Australia's rural commodities and its agricultural policies if there is a fundamental disagreement between Ministers and departments about what is happening on a key issue affecting the competitiveness of the primary sector? Is it any wonder that, in response to my question regarding what planning has been entered into on the long term impact of the decline in research funding, the Minister for Science and Technology advised: Funding bodies have not foreshadowed what happen if the rural downturn continues. So nothing is happening. There is no planning. There is no coordinated policy to ensure that the rural research base and the human skills which underpin it are protected as best as is possible during this downturn. For the sake of the agricultural sector and the high quality rural research capability, which has taken the better part of a century to build up, the Government has to act.",94
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,97
126,Mr BRERETON,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"I rise to support the Government's industry statement, Building a Competitive Australia. I do so in the knowledge that it is in no way a panacea for our current cyclical downturn. It was certainly never intended to be, and no Government member has ever portrayed it as such. Rather, it is another, albeit significant, step along the path to building a more competitive Australia. The statement builds on the previous reforms to financial markets, industry protection, the labour market, the tax system, corporate regulation, telecommunications, aviation, road and rail transport and higher education. It is another instalment from the Government whose· eight years in office have seen active decision making, which contrasts remarkably with the previous seven years of coalition indolence. Like previous economic statements, it delivers a package of lasting reforms without compromising the fiscal discipline, which has been the hallmark of this Government. The statement is pitched to the long term future of Australian industry. It is about a strong, confident Australia prepared to take on the world, rather than cower behind the protective barriers of the MCEwen-Fraser years. It is part of an ongoing trend towards export orientation set in train by this Government, which has seen investment at record levels and manufacturing exports increase at well in excess of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will average. In the encouraging net export figures of recent months, we see further evidence of this more outward looking Australia. Delivered in the midst of a domestic and international economic downturn, the statement is commendable for avoiding the obvious appeal to short term expedient measures. It shows that the Government has not lost its nerve and has not abandoned the vision of an outward looking Australia. By risking the support of some powerful interest groups, it continues the break with a past dominated by conservative governments of political opportunism. For, as we all know, it was an abdication of leadership on the part of the coalition governments-coalition governments which continually offered cynical protective bribes to their business friends-that delivered us a trade imbalance in the first place. A similar lack of will from the Fraser Government, with its huge parliamentary majorities, meant that the problem was not tackled as early as it should have been. Consistent with the twentieth century history of Australia, it has been left to a Labor Government to make the necessary long term decisions. In reducing the average effective rate of protection to 5 per cent by the year 2000, this Government has shown its faith in the adaptability and the ingenuity of the Australian people. For those who suffer, i as many will, in the inevitable adjustment process, there will be retraining opportunities and eventually much more secure employment, whilst for the long suffering Australian consumer there await real price reductions for everyday items. The contributions such price reductions will make to lower inflation will serve this country well for years to come. In the $74m subsidising work experience for the long term unemployed, the $50m allocated for prevocational training, the $15.8m to maintain apprenticeships and the $6m earmarked for management training, one witnesses the same government concern for the future. Whilst the measures will help save jobs during the current downturn, they will also enhance the skill base that Australia requires to emerge from the recession. In many previous downturns the training process was decimated and the road to recovery was hindered by a shortage of skilled labour and by the corresponding increase in wages. The Government's initiatives will help avoid a repetition of this scenario and set the country on the path to sustainable, non-inflationary growth. When linked to the Government initiated award restructuring and union rationalisation processes, these initiatives represent a positive step towards building a more productive labour force. By building on the macro-achievements of the accord in reducing real labour costs and reducing industrial disputation, one can see that the Government has done much to alleviate the comparative disadvantages that have been associated with our labour market. In doing so, it has been fortunate to deal with the most enlightened union leadership in Australia's history, and that is something that should not be forgotten for a moment by any Australians today. It has been a leadership which has recognised that long term training, real tax reductions and occupational superannuation are more beneficial to its constituency than illusory wage rises in a highly inflationary environment. Union reaction to the Government's reduction in the car industry tariff protection to 15 per cent by the year 2000 is indicative of the new approach of the labour movement. Rather than resisting the inevitable, the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia has accepted the need for change. By offering new investment, training opportunities and a leaner, more efficient car industry, the union can see opportunities arising out of the reform process. It is a commendable approach which recognises that, long before there was any talk of tariff reductions, employment was dropping in the car industry. Rather than threaten the long term viability of that car industryan industry which epitomises the folly of MCEwen protectionism-tariff reductions will help create more satisfying, more skilled and certainly much more secure positions for employees. For the industries which find themselves confronting a new international reality, the statement offers a compensation of sales tax relief for inputs. This is a welcome move which will help reduce the cost structure of export industries. In terms of competitiveness, it is unambiguously good news. It is time for State governments to exhibit their commitment to national competitiveness by looking towards the removal of the economically corrupt spectre of payroll tax. The substantial changes to wholesale sales tax contained in this statement effectively discredit the coalition's argument for a consumption tax. As a result of this statement, Australia not only has one of the lowest tax burdens in the OECD, but also has an indirect tax base which, with the exception of fuel, does not add to business costs. Other than a dubious effect on savings, there is no valid economic argument in favour of a consumption tax. If the Opposition is to persist with its inflationary consumption tax policy, then it can only be attributed to an obsessive desire to give regressive tax relief to the wealthy, rather than any ostensible concern for the national interest. If Australia is to become more internationally competitive, the tax system, which this Government has done so much to reform, will play a crucial role. The statement recognises this reality by offering a far more generous definition of depreciation for tax purposes. This will encourage the rapid replacement of obsolete equipment and keep Australia abreast of modern technology. In allowing expenditure on environmental impact studies to be written off for tax purposes, the Government is determined to ensure that future growth is not at the expense of the environment. Already at the vanguard of environmental management techniques, Australia's expertise in these areas will become a source of export dollars in a more environmentally conscious world. Research and development will be crucial in the quest for export opportunities. Unfortunately, throughout Australia's history, private sector research and development expenditure has been chronically deficient. For that reason, the statement maintains generous tax concessions for research and development expenditure. This will help Australia deepen its capital base rather than simply purchase existing technology. Is it any wonder that Japan leads the world when it spends more on research and development each year than it does on capital equipment? The phased development of 50 cooperative research establishments shows that the Government is serious about tackling Australia's inadequacies in this regard. By embracing a national trade strategy while maintaining the buy Australia campaign, the Government has shown that it will adopt a coordinated approach to tackling our trade problems. In reforming Austrade and instituting a managers and graduates fellowship program with Asia, the Government has emphasised the greater regional focus which will be integral to the new export drive. On the whole the statement is not about the past or present; it is about the future. It is about moving along the path to international competitiveness, a path which this Governmcnt took the day it gained office. Recent cxport statistics show that we are making progress, albeit gradual progress. As we enter a new decade, and soon a new century, Australia has never been bettcr equipped to tackle the international marketplace. I commend the statement to the House. Ml' TAYLOR (Groom) (4.59 p.m.)The statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), Building a Competitive Australia, of 12 March 1991 on industry policy will not make Australia strong again; indeed, it fails to come to grips with the reality of our economic circumstances and does not have any appreciation of the magnitude of the task that lies ahead in terms of boosting our national production, our exports and our import capability so we can eliminate inflation and bring debt under control. Whilc there are some welcome measures in the statement, the Government has only gonc as far as trade union leadership and its accord would allow it to go. In other words, we have a statement in which there is no labour market reform; no privatisation; no reduction in the role and influence of the public sector; and no genuine reform in taxation, in transportation, in shipping or on the waterfront. . That said, the Opposition welcomes the proposed reductions in tariffs. After all, that is simply an adoption, in effect, of our policy, which we announced late last year. The Opposition weleomes an attempt to remove taxes from business inputs, but the fact is that the Government is removing only about $200m worth of taxes in the first year out of a total wholesale sales tax package that raises about $11 billion. This will result in a complete shambles, and the system will not be any less complex. In fact, it will be markedly more complex as a result of this decision. This emphasises the case for scrapping it and, despite what the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) had to say, going for a broad-based goods and services tax, which is our policy. The electorate will hear a lot more about this in the coming months, as distinct from the irresponsiblc scaremongering on which the Government has embarked already. The Opposition accepts the accelerated depreciation decision as a good one, although we will have to scrutinise the legislation t9 see whether it matches the rhetoric. The Opposition accepts the direction of the decisions on anti-dumping and the elimination of developing countries preferences. The Opposition welcomes the emphasis on resource security but remains to be convinced on the legislative detail. Finally, the Opposition welcomes the tax deductibility of the cost of environmental impact studies and the decision to move Austrade to the portfolio of Trade and Overseas Development. However, on a negative note, the statement fails to show any understanding of the magnitude of our current problems. It supplies no new forecasts which would reflect the seriousness of our situation and offers no explanation as to what went wrong in the past. Indeed, little or nothing seems to have been learned from the past. The statement offers no adjustment to macro-economic policy. Indeed, the measures are in large part unfunded and thereby further ease fiscal policy at a time when Commonwealth and State finances are out of control and moving into significant deficit. Finally, the statement foreshadows the development of a venture capital fund, which is a potential worry in itself. One of the odd things about the industry policy statement and, more recently, the much touted defence statement of 30 May, was that everyone knew about both of them long before the official release. Clearly the Hawke Government is not the cohesive and disciplined team it arguably once was. It is hard to believe, therefore, that the leaking of most points was not deliberate. The usual reason for indulging in such leaks is that the Government knows that its decisions will be unpopular or contentious and prefers to diffuse the anger or confusion by having them slip out bit by bit. This industry statement and the defence statement are both indicative of a government in deep trouble, not only at the grassroots level but in terms of substantive policy formulation of a radical nature, exemplified once again by the recent adhockery of the Coronation Hill decision. Overall, the industry statement was mainly an updating of existing policies rather than a new departure, irrespective of the fact that it did challenge the Australian people to correct some of the country's failings themselves. It is full of rhetoric but light on substance. Commentators, perhaps to a wider degree than in any previous economic or industry initiative, have given it a general thumbs down, many of those commentators not having been known in the past for withholding media support for what the Government is about politically. To illustrate, let us reflect on what has been said. In the Sydney Morning Herald Max Walsh said: Too little too late will be the epitaph of the Hawke Government. This package of industry measures fits that description. He goes on: The coalition has embraced parliamentary consensus on the basic economic strategy required to address the nation's problems to an unprecedented degree. It is not therefore the Opposition holding up progress by threatening to exploit tough economic policy decisions with populous nostrums for a bruised electorate. It's governmental inertia. Only when we have a full blown demonstrable crisis on our hands does the Government act. Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald said that 'the statement's sins are mainly sins of omission'. And Michelle Grattan in the Age said: The Hawke statement has fallen victim to its own hype. Expectations were raised dangerously high but inadequately realised. It is extremely bold, as far as it goes, but it goes only part of the way. That is the risky political flaw. Paul Kelly, in the Australian said: The crisis of business confidence will continue and the beneficial impact of these decisions is more medium than short term. He went on to say that the pitch the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) now makes is obvious; that only he can complete the full task. Terry MCCrann in the Herald Sun said: It was the economic statement we had to have from the Government that could not hack the tough and important decisions. And he finished by saying that the whole thing basically fiddled around the edges. The editorial in that same newspaper said: Overall, Mr Hawke's March statement has failed to provide the leadership the country needs. And it finished by saying: His statement had the dreary ring of an election launch. If this is the best that the Prime Minister can come up with before he must go to the people in two years, it will be John Hewson who will be left to complete the job Bob Hawke dodged yesterday. The Brisbane Courier-Mail said, in part: What the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, proposed in his statement he could have proposed on March 6, 1983. Had he done so, that celebratory day after his historic first election, Australia would not have wasted eight years and three further elections waiting for reality to finally break through. And finally, Madam Deputy Speaker, Wallace Brown in that same newspaper said: Prime Minister Bob Hawke remains his Government's best salesman but eight years on Old Silver has lost his magic. His clarion call to all Australians now to work smarter as he cuts tariff protection for industries is a courageous one, particularly for a Labor leader in recession, but his refusal to spell out similar targets for fast reform in the transport and telecommunications industries reveals an acceptance, and certainly conveys the impression, that Labor is still too beholden to militant unions. KBMG Peat Marwick, in its executive summary said: The statement is a disappointment to those who expected measures to stimulate the economy out of its current recession. No commitment is given to further easing of interest rates. The Government believes the decision will end through natural cyclical factors in the second half endar year 1991. The focus of the statement is the long term. A series of measures are announced and aimed at enhancing Australia's future international competitiveness. Initially, measures should stimulate imports rather than exports. Hence, early improvement in Australia's balance of payments and debt problems cannot be expected. Sentiment on the Australian dollar should remain bearish. It finished by saying: No major initiatives to remove structural impediments to investment were announced other than the resource security legislation. It is not surprising, therefore, that the statement has been regarded in general as a hotchpotch of industry-related measures which together fail to add up to a coherent poll. It is a political statement on which a grab bag of economic measures has been grafted and it was driven by the Government's political agenda, not by the economic agenda. And indeed that shows with the Prime Minister taking over presentation of the statement to demonstrate his determination to retain the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. Padraic MCGuinness, in an article in the Australian on 13 March titled 'Half-hearted tactics smack of lost opportunity' said, in part: The best thing about the Prime Minister's statement is that it shows his Government has run out of ideas . . . Most of the statement is a collection of bromides and Bandaids. . . . as the statcment wears on it reads more and more like onc of the shopping lists that used to be found in old time election budget speeches. And that, after aU, is what it chiefly is. He finished by saying: . . . once again, the Government has lost an opportunity to face up to genuine problems of micro-economic reform. With the help of the Industry Commission, it has already identified most of the areas in which urgent reform is needed as far as the removal of the internal barriers to growth of exports and export competitiveness are concerned. But it is clear that it is totally unable to extricate itself from the Accord and its accompanying program of work place ""reform"" as a means of enhancing the power of the ACTU. Eric Risstrom, National Director of the Australian Taxpayers Association, has said that the statement would not do much to of cal- encourage people to invest; that changes worth $ 375m meant little to the $10 billion wholesale tax system and did not encourage people to invest. He added that the by the 1 July starting date for the new depreciation rules, purchases of new plant and equipment would stop dead. Jeff Mann of the Taxation Institute of Australia made similar comments, saying that the complex drafting required for the sales tax reforms showed that the Government had lost sight of its recent goal of simplifying the system. The Australian Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive, Ian Fletcher, said that it was a package of bandaids and that the tariff reforms should have come five years ago after the collapse of the dollar while sales tax exemptions only went part of the way. It is clear that industry has derived little pleasure f-om the statement because the Government offers few specific goals. Worse, tariff reduction without concomitant solid export support and quick microeconomic reform, especially in the labour market, could result in only more imports and the ruin of existing industry. The Prime Minister risks exacerbating the ailment he hopes to cure. From all the build-up the Prime Minister gave his statement, industry leaders in particular were hoping for genuine far-reaching reform. However, industry and the expert correspondents, almost without exception, are disappointed at the lack of coherent strategy across all areas of economic policy. Arguably, business saw the statement as the Government's last chance to salvage credibility by administering the medicine of economic reform for which the country is crying out so desperately. The Prime Minister does not tell us how much the measures in the statement will boost exports; he gives us no time-frame for the stabilisation of Australia's foreign debt; and, indeed, there is no anti-inflation strategy. While the statement may be a step in the tight direction, regrettably it is only a small step around the periphery of the fundamental issues. Much of the reasoning behind the Prime Minister's solo performance appeared to be aimed at bolstering the Government's sorry standing in the polls and to boost his standing against the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). Clearly, that standing remains one on unstable quicksand. As a weapon against recession, it will prove to be as ineffective as this Government's economic policies have been in the past in correcting the nation's other woes. Once again, the Prime Minister has simply stuck some bandaids on the patient and walked away. Like Senator Ray's recent major defence statement and the defence debate that never was, this industry statement is a further example of the Hawke Government's policy on bankruptcy. Clearly, that is just not good enough. Debate interrupted. NA NA 308th Report",97
127,Mr SPEAKER,ACCOUNTS,"I just advise the House that the 308th report for the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was tabled in both Houses on 14 March 1991. The report presents the findings of the Committee's inquiry into the Parliamentary Information Systems Office unofficial account. The report includes a number of recommendations, most of which are systemic in nature aimed at improving Commonwealth management and administration. A number of the recommendations made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts have direct relevance to the parliamentary departments, while others have wider implications. Whilst the President and I intended to respond to the Committee's recommendations at this stage, we are unable to do so because one of the recommendations requires action to be taken by one of the parliamentary departments and cannot be fully addressed at this stage. We expect all outstanding action to be concluded during the winter adjournment and it is our intention to table our response to the 308th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts early in the Budget session. NA NA Ministerial Statement [COGNATE PAPER: NA AUSTRALIA-ERRATAJ Debate resumed.  p.m.)-Listening to the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), one could only be disappointed by the carping negative nature of his comments. The statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), entitled Building a Competitive Australia, is about providing a base to improve our competitiveness, to improve our opportunities in world markets. As I listened to the honourable member for Groom, I thought: this is the same Opposition which is trumpeting how it is going to achieve zero inflation. It is going to do so by introducing a 15 per cent tax on goods, foods and all services that in itself will generate an inflation rate of 8 to 10 per cent. That is a brilliant concept! But then, that is what we have come to expect from the Opposition. The Prime Minister's statement of 12 March outlined initiatives to strengthen Australia's competitive base. The problem we face, and have faced for many years, is that we want to spend more abroad than we earn abroad. The only way that we can fund the difference between the excessive spending abroad and our earnings abroad is either by borrowings or by earning more income, by becoming more competitive in world markets. The world does not owe Australia a living but our men and women do have the capacity, talents and abilities to match and beat selected markets in the world. The task that confronts us is how to develop better skills in our markets; how to develop better skills amongst our workers, employees and managers; and to get in there and do it. There are a number of aspects to this-a combination of tariff cuts; the broadening, streamlining and shortening of depreciation provisions; the abolition of sales tax on inputs by primary producers, manufacturers and exporters; the training and retention of young Australians at school for longer periods and job retention for those who want to be retained whilst assistance is available to their employers; and faster anti-dumping procedures togethcr with a reorganisation of Austrade. That package of measures, that combination, docs provide a base for Australian industry to be more competitive and to get a greater share of world markets. It does not do anything to solve the challenges we face to parrot on, as the Opposition does, about the waterfront. Yes, the waterfront is important. The difficulty in changing workplace operations on the waterfront is simply indicative of the complexity of waterfront practices and arrangements. Everybody is involved, from warehouse to waterfront-not just the wharfies, as people like to describe in a derisory way those Australians who work on the wharf. Everybody is involved, from the warehouse manager and the factory manager to those who are responsible for importing components from abroad for assembly into products that are subsequently exported or for sale in Australia as import replacements. Everybody from go to whoa has a responsibility to learn how to do it better. The Opposition's ignorant and constant parroting over several years of 'the waterfront, the waterfront, the waterfront' is missing the real gain. The real gain is how we get everyone in the chain, from shipside through to warehouse and the reverse, doing it better. This gargantuan task on the wharf itself is being addressed. The wharf is but one cog in the wheel. So let us move to where all the other cogs of the wheel and all the other players are-I have addressed this issue before in this chamber-and that is the Rip Van Winkle land of our importers and exporters. They are all slumbering away quite peacefully because they can all blame the wharfie. We hear the chorus, 'It's the wharfie's fault, it's the wharfie's fault' from the Opposition and from a number of business leaders. But it is a different story when we say to them, 'Let's have a look at your operations. Why is it that your company only accepts goods between 12 o'clock and 2 o'clock of a day? Why is it that you only work between the hours of seven and five Monday to Friday but the waterfront works every day and 24 hours a day if necessary?'. We have to look at the performance of everybody from manager down. I want to run through some of them quickly: the industrial relations survey recently tabled in both Houses of Parliament showed that 34 per cent of workplaces have at least one specialist manager whose primary job involves industrial relations and personnel tasks; that is, only one in three workplaces has a specialist manager whose primary job is to look after industrial relations and personnel management. Even those managers made only about 25 per cent of the decisions that had to be made, with senior managers who were not involved directly in industrial relations making 30 per cent of the decisions and line managers-the people dealing with the employees right in the workplacemaking 14 per cent of the decisions. This is the fundamental problem in the whole operation; this is what is really wrong with Australian industry. It is addicted to the quick fix and the Opposition is similarly addicted. It hears the chorus call, 'Fix it, fix it and fix it quick'. I am sorry, but there are no quick fixes and no quick hits for the problems facing Australian industry. They go from the board room right down to the machine in the workplace or to the employee at the primary level of an operation. Only 66 per cent of unionised workplaces have union delegates; that is, only two in three of the unionised workplaces. We are constantly told that 70 per cent of employees in the private sector are not members of trade unions; no-one disputes that. Why is it then that the Opposition and industry leadership place so much emphasis on and parrots so much about so-called compulsory unionism when 70 per cent of people in the private sector are not in unions? What then is their concern? Fewer than one in three employees are in unions and yet members of the Opposition and industry leadership are lamenting, screaming and carrying on about compulsory unionism. It is not too compulsory when 70 per cent of employees are not in a union. Again it comes back to the fundamental weakness of Australian management: it does not have its eye on the ball, nor has the Opposition. Mr Snowdon-They missed the main game.  missed the main game. This comes back to the incompetence of so much of Australia's management. Management in this country cannot keep bashing employees, trade unionists and supervisors when the leadership, the competence and the enthusiasm do not exist at the top of the organisation, because that is where it has to come from. The industrial relations workplace survey ordered by this Government showed that unions in three out of four workplaces were not consulted or even informed about changes which would affect employees. That is almost unbelievable. We are in the midst of change. Everyone across this country is exhorting Australian employees, 'Change is the name of the game; change is inevitable; get involved in the development of the change and be part of it because tomorrow's game is ongoing change, and we have to match the world and beat it'. But in almost three out of four workplaces the employees are not even consulted about what changes are proposed. Again, whose responsibility is that? It is not the Government's, nor is it the Opposition's-it is the responsibility of management. The poor quality of management in the private sector of this country is demonstrated by the fact that only 49 per cent of workplaces have a formal procedure for settling grievances; that is fewer than half. However, 40 per cent of those said they rarely, if ever, used the procedure. So where is this coming together of management and Australian employees to get a better result for this nation? Where is this joint effort that Australian management says it wants? Where is this cooperation that we know is necessary? In this country, the reality is that most of the impetus for change in industrial practices, workplace arrangements and award restructuring has not emanated from management; it has come from the trade union movement because the trade union leadership recognises that if Australia is to have a future it has to get better at what it does. Australia can get better; Australian working men and women want to get better, but they cannot run business because that is management's job. Briefly, looking across the workplace, the role of management in this country leaves an enormous amount to be desired. Most workplace managers perceive 'factors other than traditional industrial relations concerns, such as capital limits and organisational issues, as greater impediments to improving workplace efficiency and productivity. That is my second last point, and I will repeat it: more workplace managers perceive factors other than traditional industrial relations concerns-that is, other than industrial disputes and differences of view between management and employees-such as capital limits and organisational issues, as greater impediments to improving workplace efficiency and productivity. That, again, is the ing of Australian management. Managers are saying, 'Our real problem is not industrial relations; our real problem is ital limits and the way the business is organised' . My last point is that there is a lack autonomy for managers at the workplace level where decisions need to be made. Instead the majority of important indusproducing trial relations decisions are made more senior management levels that are removed from the workplace. In other words, those decisions are made by people who are well removed from the workplace where the problems occur, where the line managers know what is involved and are dealing on a face to face basis with their employees. I ask the House, but in particular the Opposition: how do honourable membuilding bers expect us to build a spirit of cooperthus ation, enthusiasm and achievement in this efficient. country when the people in the private sector at managerial and control levels have virtually no relationship with people who actually do the job? Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) used have a policy where employees had to leave their brains outside the gate as came to work, because they were paid to do as they were told. We do not have managers in this country; we have conor trollers-people who take down orders from on high and whose job is to make sure those orders are carried out. That almost a militaristic style of management. BHP says that policy has gone. It says that it has found a goldmine, which is the experience and knowledge in the of the people on the shop floor. In Newcastle in the Hunter region the prosions duction of steel per shift has improved by almost 300 per cent a year because ideas are coming from the people who do the job. We have in this statement, Buildately ing a Competitive Australia-Mr Hollis-And at Port Kembla.  league the honourable member for Throsby reminds me, a similar situation has occurred at Port Kembla; it has happened at Whyalla too, as the honourable fail- member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) knows very well. However, under the leadership of the Fraser Government, BHP shut down capproduction in those three steel producing regions. Only the advent of this Government in 1983 caused the rehabilitation of of the steel industry. In Newcastle 4,500 to 4,700 employees are now producing more steel than almost 12,000 employees were in 1982. Similar situations exist by the in Port Kembla and Whyalla. In conclusion, the Prime Minister's statement, Building a Competitive Australia, provides a base for managers in the private sector who are genuinely committed to building a competitive Australia to reform and modernise procedures. It allows managers in the private sector who have been exposed by the industrial relations survey to change their style and inI ask volve their employees at all levels in a more competitive operation and become more productive and more",102
128,Mr CHARLES,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"La Trobe) (5.32 p.m.)the My contribution today is based on the ministerial statement entitled Building a to Competitive Australia delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in this House they on 12 March 1991. In the limited time available it is not possible to deal with every issue raised by the Prime Minister his deputies, so it is my intention to deal item by item, issue by issue, with a number of specific statements made by is the Prime Minister which I believe require comment. The Prime Minister stated: . . . we must export more manufactured goods and services and substitute more quality Austraminds lian production for imports. The challenge is therefore to make the deciand adopt the practices and attitudes which will enable this and succeeding generations to the achieve those basic goals. The Prime Minister is correct. We desperneed to increase our production of manufactured goods and services. With respect to our manufacturing industry, I believe the Prime Minister has misrepresented his position and the effectiveness of the Labor Party when in Government. I note specifically that during the period of the Whitlam Government manufacturing, as a percentage of gross domestic product, decreased by 1.1 per cent. During the years of the Fraser Government, that same indicator decreased by 0.7 per cent. The important statistic is that during the period of the Hawke Labor Government with Mr Keating as Treasurer the further decrease of the manufacturing industry as a percentage of gross domestic product was 2.1 per cent, and this decrease is continuing. In the last 20 years the demise of manufacturing under Labor governments, as a percentage of our national effort, has been in excess of 3 per cent; under the only coalition government it was 0.7 per cent. The ex-Treasurer and the current Prime Minister are very good at distorting statistics, but r think those indicators are substantial evidence that this Labor Government and its policies-or, rather, lack of policies-have been particularly devastating to manufacturing in our country. We have all but killed manufacturing. The bullets have been a rigidly, centrally controlled and uncompetitive industrial relations system; a taxation system which does not encourage equity investment and productive capital; a rigid and unhelpful bureaucracy; and the comfort blanket of a high tariff wall. I intend to expand on each of these points in my response. The Prime Minister stated: And we certainly do not resile from having taken the necessary decision to squeeze demand by high interest rates. I argue that demand within the economy is not essentially the major problem that we face. Our problem is our lack of ability to produce the goods to satisfy the demand which has been created. In essence, we have created an aggressive, high demand, expectant consumer society in our country. I cannot imagine how anyone here would decry that attitude. So the real problem is not that society has demanded further goods and services; rather, that Australian industry has not been able to produce the majority percentage of those goods and services onshore. Supply is the problem, not dcmand. Squeezing demand by the single blunt instrument of high intcrest rates has affected the demand side of the equation, but it has decimated the supply side rather than fix it. Company liquidations, receiverships and personal bankruptcies are devastating what is left of our industrial base. The Prime Minister statcd: In particular we have the opportunity to secure economic recovery: with low inflation In my view we will only retain low inflation-once we have actually achieved 1twith the following active policy prescription: firstly, real low interest rates, which are difficult to achieve considering our current debt position; sccondly, productivity increases greater than wage and wage cost increases, which is out of the question considering the accord by the Government with the Australian Council of Trade Unions; and, thirdly, stable or rising dollar values. Primary industry and the mining sector call for a reduction in the value of the Australian dollar with respect to other major stable currencies. I argue that the most successful countries in the past decade, in an economic sense, are those which have been able to stabilise their currency value and convince the international market of their increasing value with respect to others, when their increasing currency values have been an overall positive benefit to their individual countries. Fourthly, a continuing low inflation rate depends to a great degree on productive capacity being greater than or equal to demand. If we must fill Australian demand from overseas sources-we have to pay for it with inflated dollars caused by the necessary high interest rates which accompany them-then we will continue to have high inflation. So it behoves us to create additional productive capacity to satisfy Australian demand, let alone international markets. The Prime Minister stated: We are becoming more competitive. That is the greatest lot of rot in all of the statements made by the Prime Minister, the former Treasurer, and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). The recent report by Imede, the highly respected Lausanne business school, in conjunction with the world economic forum, in essence, says that the Prime Minister is wrong. That report places Australia tenth out of 22 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in terms of attractiveness for overseas development. It is devastating that Australia rates only tenth, because we have great national endowments. Realistically, that is about all we have going for us. Dynamism, industrial efficiency, market orientation, financial dynamism, human resources, state interference, outward orientation, innovative forward orientation and socio-political stability all detract from Australia being an attractive destination for equity investment. The Imede evaluation was particularly devastating with respect to depreciation allowances, where Australia rated twenty-ninth out of 32 countries for depreciation allowances which do not favour capital expansion. Our energy resources are outstanding and our non-energy materials arc also bountiful, but we have not been able to use this natural endowment to competitive advantage. We rated well, in terms of social harmony, with a proven track record of political stability and civic decency, but organised labour has a very negative effect on the running of companies. On industrial relations, Australia ranked thirtieth out of 32 countries, only ahead of Korea and New Zealand. As New Zealand is in the process of changing its industrial relations system, I suspcct that we have now slipped to the thirtyfirst position. It is incomprehensible that we continue with a centralised bureaucratic industrial relations system which does nothing for our standards of living, workers' satisfaction or equity, but only detracts from our ability to be productive. The report shows Australia in a reasonably fair light with respect to equity and living standards, but it notes that living standards have been falling and, with our increasing debt, high interest rates and non-stable inflation are likely only to get worse. The report notes that a metal worker must have 1,422 days pay to buy an average car in Australia, but 743 days in the United States, 677 days in Canada and only 476 days in Japan. Sooner or later, one would think, metal workers will wake up to the fact that our industrial relations system is not working to their benefit and have a go at decentralisation and performance. The Prime Minister in his statement offered major tariff cuts and, without going into the specific numbers or methodology, I welcome such cuts as having the effect of generally and ultimately making Australia more competitive. I know that it is difficult for industry to swallow the changes in some instances and I know that some good producers will go to the wall. But, ultimately, Australia will benefit if, and only if, we also take many other hard decisions with respect to reducing cost inputs to allow industry to be internationally competitive. It is those latter decisions, or lack thereof, which form the basis of my criticism of this Government's statement. The Prime Minister has offered specific assistance for farmers and manufacturers in terms of dumping and further assistance for high technology industry in terms of research and development. But he has said absolutely nothing regarding Government purchasing policy, which is biased towards Australian manufacturers and producers in terms of overall systems capability rather than absolute price, which would have been to the greater benefit of both our economy and society at large. The Prime Minister has foreshadowed major changes with respect to both the capital base and the performance demand bond base of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. I welcome these changes but I ask the Prime Minister whether he has considered using the specific expertise of the Reserve Bank of Australia in terms of advising our operating banks on the necessity for them to become more outward looking and offer international credit facilities for trade which is truly internationally competitive. From evidence from within my own electorate, I believe that our banking sector is not effective in that regard and lags light years behind the international community. The Imede report placed Australia thirteenth as a supplier of risk capital. The effectiveness of the banking sector has been analysed as good, but limitations to factoring and export credits detract from that rating. It is clear that we have a long way to go in offering international credit facilities for trade. The Prime Minister has stated: We will transfer responsibility for Austrade to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Developterms ment from 1 September. I am delighted that the Prime Minister not regressive. has seen fit to transfer the responsibility for Austrade, as the experience in electorate with Austrade has been less than satisfactory. I make the point that in international context Australia has come of age with the travel advertisemonopoly ments for Australia done by Paul Holutely gan-shrimp on the barby-and the Paul Hogan Crocodile Dundee movies. So the world today knows one hell of a lot more about Australia than it did 10 years ago, and in general it likes us. However, onc of our problems is that we have never dcvcloped sophisticated marketing. This Labor Govcrnment will not be particularly effective at marketing because it does not truly understand dustry. Government bureaucracy in Ausstatement. tralia, for a whole range of reasons, has become isolated from the real world of business and commerce and understands little of the real world of business, mention modern concepts of high level marketing. Just to add fuel to the fire, Austrade is a disaster. With a significant international marketing program we could lift our international sales substantially, regardless of any other factor. The Prime Minister said: We are freeing up our transport systems; we revolutionised our taxation system; we are ing more efficient workplaces; we arc injecting competition where for too long Australian firms and public sector enterprises have been content with the quiet life. That was a mouthful. For a start, our taxation system has not been particularly revolutionised but, rather, devolved. The number of regulations has increased substantially, as has the number of bureaucrats required to deal with taxation matters overall. The Opposition has offered the Australian public an advantageous and forward-thinking change in taxation to a goods and services tax which will relieve us of many of the horrific inconsistencies of our existing wholesale sales tax and, as well, relieve Australian taxpayers of some of the burden of high individual income tax rates. A tax which allows discretion by the individual in of whether he spends and therefore incurs tax certainly has to be progressive, In terms of the rest of the system, clearly my labour market reforms and reforms to land, rail and air transport, coastal shipan ping, waterfront communications, governtruly ment enterprise and semi-government authority providers are absourgent as reforms which will give cost benefits to industry to allow protected firms to cope with the tariff reductions proposed by the Government. But the Prime Minister has not dealt with any of these issues. The entire Opposition, all major economic commentators, and almost all business have expressed disappointment with the Prime Minister and his deputies for the lack of comprehensive micro-economic rcforms in what had been intelegraphed as a major industry policy",105
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,Order! The honourable member's not to time has expired.,108
130,Mr LES SCOTT,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"Oxley) (5.44 p.m.)I was pleased to hear the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) talk about the consumption tax in the last few moments of his speech. I hope the Opposition continues to pursue this because it has got to be one of the most unpopular have things it has ever come forward with. Earcreatlier he mention cd that metalworkers are having problems buying motor cars. Metalworkers in my elcctorate cannot usually afford to buy brand new cars. It is left to the elite on the opposite side of the House to have high-powered sports cars and so on. When we talk about buying a second hand vehicle for about $10,000 and those opposite bringing in a consumption taxI assume it will be 15 per cent; no-one seems to know the exact rate that the Opposition would introduce, if it ever had the opportunity-we realise it will add another $1,500 to a $10,000 motor vehicle for our workers. I am sure they would be pleased with something like that! Mr Charles-Did you forget about the wholesale sales tax?",108
131,Mr LES SCOTT,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,We do not have a ta- on second-hand motor vehicles; it applIes only to new vehicles. The honourable member for La Trobe obviously forgets that point. There is a recycling effect with a consumption tax. When a vehicle goes from one owner to another and then to another it provides great revenue for government. That is obviously what those opposite have in mind-to continue to take those sorts of funds from the people-Mr Snowdon-Rip the guts out of those who can't afford it.,109
132,Mr LES SCOTT,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"Yes, those who cannot afford it-the workers of this nation. Those are the people the Opposition would wish to attack. Similarly if someone is buying a $100,000 homd-the average price of a house in my electorate would be between $80,000 and $100000' obviously, it would be a lot more in placesuch as Sydney and Melbourne-another $15,000 is immediately added to the purchase price. Instead of paying $100 000 a person is paying $115,000. ' Mr Snowdon-Great tax incentive!",109
133,Mr LES SCOTT,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"Yes, it is great. With all that, those opposite say that they will achieve a nil inflation rate. I think they should do their sums when they talk about things like that because they are so far the mark. I assure those opposite that the metalworkers in my electorate would not lend any support to a consumption tax. Mr Snowdon inteljecting",109
134,Mr LES SCOTT,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"Yes, that is right. The metalworkers indicated quite clearly to the Prime Minister last week when he paid a visit to my electorate-and I was very pleased that he had the opportunity to come up-and spoke to a whole-Mr Truss-Farewell visit?",109
135,Mr LES SCOTT,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"No, it was not a farewell visit. It was a 'come back and say g'day' visit because he has been there before and was well received. He was certainly well received last week when he had the opportunity to speak to some pensioner groups, to some schools, and to a range of workers in the railway workshops where there are both blue and white collar workers-in excess of 1,000 people. We also had the opportunity to speak to some people who were benefiting from the Skillshare program, which is a great success of this Government. We must remember that during the last election campaign those opposite wanted to do away with Skillshare. That is one of the very successful programs that those opposite would try to destroy. We have enhanced the Skillshare program, and it has gone over particularly well. Mr Snowdon-They want to belt the unemployed.",109
136,Mr LES SCOTT,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"That is what they want to do. They want to take any allowance whatsoever away from them. Interestingly enough, the other idea they have come up with is getting people to work for their allowance. Just in the last week or so, the chairman of the local Chamber of Commerce in my electorate, who is always coming out with ideas which are harebrained in some ways, came out with his latest idea. He reckons that people should work for their dole. The term he uses is 'dole', which I do not necessarily like to use. He had the idea of people working in the parks and gardens next to paid workers from the council, who are paid under awards. These other people off would be given some sort of allowance or dole payment, as he described it. That might sound very simple; and it probably is, because it has been put forward by very simple people. They think that is a real, short term fix to a major problem. What we really need is for a Chamber of Commerce not to be coming out with such ideas but looking very seriously at how it can get its members in industry to be more competitive and start promoting some of our manufacturpeople ing industries in this country. They should be not only building up new industries but also expanding existing industries. The initiatives. opportunities exist. There are very many opportunities for industry to expand. There just needs to be a bit of long term planning and the returns will come. Unsive fortunately, I think a lot of our industries in Australia look at just the short term problems. That is one of the problems face. We do not plan in the longer term where we really need to develop our inequipment dustries. We need to provide long term strategies so that we look further than quick quid idea that we have here. The Japanese are often criticised, but one of their good points is that they have long term projects. They plan 50 years ahead while many of our industries tend to plan only five years ahead. That might not necessarily be the fault of all indusviding tries. I know that some of them look at long term ideas, but unfortunately in some cases they do not. I think that probably due to successive governments not giving the necessary support. The statements by the Prime Minister and others in the document Building Competitive Australia are certainly couraging initiatives and should be adopted in a positive, rather than a ative, manner. That is what we need: need positive approaches to everything do. I think Australia's future standard living will depend not only on its ability to meet the ever-changing and increasing needs of its own people but also country's level of international competitiveness, and that is what this is all We need to look at this particularly the area of new and improved materials, technologies and processes. Building a Competitive Australia will, in part, proogy vide active encouragement to Australian industries, other institutions and individpartners uals to commit themselves to the necestcntial sary research and development (R&D) erally. required to ensure that this country able to compete effectively in the intcrcessfully national marketplace and, furthcr, to help make Australia one of the world leaders in the development of new and innovaAustralian to tive ideas. We havc vcry many capablc in our science field who havc proved their worth in the intcrnational arena in scientific and high technology Through a commitment to research and development, Australia can takc full advantage of its largc and very comprehenpool of scientific knowledge, thereby reducing the brain drain to overseas which has been a significant feature in years gone we by. Further, it gives our industries the ability to produce new technologies, and processes rather than just copying the innovations of others. This the provides a number of signiJ1cant benefits both to the companies concerned and to Australia as a whole, not the least of which are an increased value in return on investments; reduction in costs by removing the necessity to buy this knowledge and equipment from overseas; and also prothe opportunity for the expansion certainly of our export potential. The recent Industry, Technology and is Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill, which was passed by this place, put into effect the Govcrnment's decision to extend the operation of the grants for indusa try research and development schemeenbetter known as GIRDS-for a further two years until June 1994. It also pronegvided for the inclusion of the national we procurement dcvelopment program within we the framework of the Industry Research of and Development Act 1986 and made a number of minor amendments to that Act to provide for some possible deficiencies this and simplify its operation. The two elements of the GIRD scheme about. are discretionary grants, which are in award cd to companies unable to use the 150 per ccnt tax incentive for R&D for certain reasons, and the generic technolgrants for researchers engaged in collaborative research with commercial and projects, which show the pofor widespread use in industry genSince their inception in 1986, both is these programs have operated very sucas an important part of the Govcrnment's overall package of support and incentive programs designed to improve industry's acceptance of the need to undertake ongoing research and development. Those measures provide approximately $32m per annum over the next four years for Australian research and development projects, a very substantial increase over the approximately $l1m-$4.8m for the discretionary grants program and $6.4m for the generic technologies program-allocated in 1986-87. The extension of GIRD complements other decisions taken by this Government on research and development related programs, which recognise the significant benefits that have already been derived from this important package of measures. , Decisions such as the continuance of the 150 per cent tax deduction for R&D until June 1993, and the indefinite extension of the 125 per cent deduction beyond the previously announced cut-out in 1995, will continue to assist industries, as will tinuance of the national procurement development (NPD) program, a relatively new part of the R&D promotion package. The NPD program provides assistance directed specifically towards research and development projects designed to meet the purchasing requirements of governments and their agencies. The program started in the 1987-88 financial year with a relatively small budget of $694,950. As the fundamental concept of this program has been changed to provide significant worthwhile results, the program has been readily embraced by State governments. The Commonwealth has greatly increased the Budget allocation. It is now estimated that $7.2m will be committed under the program in 1990-91. For such a substantial budget it is appropriate that the program be brought into the Act rather than continue under delegation. The effectiveness of these incentives in promoting the expansion of industrial research and development cannot be disputed. Historically, the past performance of Australia's private sector in this vital activity has been very poor when compared with that of similar overseas countries, comprising only around 0.5 per cent of our gross domestic product. Since the introduction of 150 per cent tax concession in 1985, there has been a marked increase in industrial research and development activity. By way of example, in 1986-87 real private sector expenditure on R&D rose by 24 per cent. In 1987-88 it increased by 7 per cent, rising a further 15 per cent over 1988-89-almost double that undertaken in the early 1980s. During the 198889 financial year there were almost 1,500 companies registered for the concession, representing a contribution to research and development of around $164m. Through forgone company tax revenue by the Government in that year, this figure is estimated at around $180m for the 1989-90 financial year and higher again in this year. Because of the inherent long term nature of most research and development activity, and as a result of the removal by a conrecent legislative changes of any doubt about the Government's future commitment to promoting this important ingredient for Australia's competitiveness, we can justifiably expect the level of industry's research and development participation to continue to grow at a significant rate in the future. This is supported by a recent study by the Centre for Technology and Social Change, which reported that many Australian companies are now starting to include technology development innovation as specific components of their corporate planning process, something their counterparts overseas have been doing for many years. All this will help increase our national productivity and further encourage the growth of the more efficient industries, enabling greater internationalisation of Australia's industrial base and, therefore, creating the competitive edge we need for success in the future. I have had the opportunity to see first hand some of the benefits that come from industrial research and development. Recently, I had occasion to visit one of the facilities of the Australian Coal Industry Research Laboratories, better known as ACIRL, situated at Riverview in my electorate. I spoke to the company's manager earlier todiy. Some overseas visitors are very keen to have a look at its operations because of the innovative ideas it has as far as expanding overseas is concerned. As the name suggests, this company is at the forefront of research and development of both coalmine sites and process technology, providing consultative technical services and applied research to the Australian coal industry. The scope of work undertaken by ACIRL's mining division includes all activities on the mine site from exploration and minc planning through to mine development and the mining operations themselves. The company's activities cover all aspects of the coal industry, including underground and surface mining, exploration, geotechnical engineering, gas, and ventilation and engineering services. Research undertaken by the group has increased significantly in recent years. ACIRL has committed itself to increasing i-s level of participation in this field, partlcularly through increased levels of syndicated research projects. This research and development has wide implications for improving the productivity and efficiency of the coal industry. Further, it has benefits in occupational health and safety. In fact, ACIRL's first syndicated research project has been a huge success.",109
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,112
138,Mr FORD,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"Several months ago, amidst a great deal of media hype, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave us what was supposedly a blueprint for securing our economic prosperity. At that time, many individuals and businesses no doubt believed much of what they had been promised. It was claimed that the economic policies of this disastrous Government were working and that, despite the minor inconvenience of a deepening recession, we would all somehow be better off in the long run. The events of recent months now demonstrate even more clearly that the Prime Minister's statement on building a competitive Australia was a complete fizzer. There is plenty of anticipation, but no real hope for the future. In particular, the statement was more notable for what it did not say. It completely failed to address the growing cancer of unemployment and underemployment. It did not address interest rat-s to ensure that they were inter-atlOnally eOl;npetitive, the pressing questIOn of taxatIOn reform and the disaster of our foreign debt, which now is at an horrendous $131 billion, or the problems of Australia's grossly over-regulated labour market and business sector; it did not adequately address the difficulties caused to Australia's businesses by the dumping of products on our markets' and it said nothing about the progress - f this Government's pathetic and half-hearted attempt at micro-economic reform. All we know about is the abysmal record of the past eight years, despite the huge expenditure of taxpayers' money on so-called micro-economic reform. Where is the evidence of genuine reform on Australia's moriburld system of industrial relations ?r of such grossly inefficient public enterpnses as Telecom Australia Austral-a Post, Qantas Airways Ltd, the Australlan Trade Commission Mcdibank - rivate and the nation's airp-rt terminals, Just to name a few? There are many people in this nation whose live- have been increasingly desperate dunng the past two years. For some, their whole lives have been de-troxed. TheX have lost everything includlllg, 111 some lllstances, the will to struggle on. They feel the situation is hopeless. They are hurt and feel betrayed by the hollow promises of a Prime Minister who is obviously quite unable to distinguish between truth and lies. Australia's forgotten p.eople have a right to be angry. They are nght when they say that their plight has been ignored and that the Government does not care what becomes of them and their families. They are right when they say that the Government cares more - bout the s.ectional interests and greed of lts mates III the trade unions and the despicable practice of the corporate cowboys of the 1980s than it does for those whose interests it claims to represent. Indee-, it is a sad irony that, in the year of Its centenary celebration, the Australian Labor Party has presided over the decline of the Australian economy into what is undoubtedly the worse recession since the Great Depression of the 1930sall as a result of the home-grown, deliberate policy we had to have. The party which was founded to represent the interests of the ordinary working Australian in Parliament has, in 1991, become little more than a pathetic vehicle for the personal aspirations of its trendy middle-class members. Two major reforms, if implemented now, would greatly assist the generation of wealth in this country-which is so desperately needed-and the development of our children's future. The first reform is the liberation of the labour market. No doubt the Government is deeply and irrevocably committed to a socialiststyle central planning of the labour market through the accord and the centralised wage fixing system. The system is centralised not so the Australian Industrial Relations Commission can judge the issues, but so Mr Kelty can decide the outcome. In a period of severe economic downturn, such as we are currently experiencing, the small unregulated part of the market has to carry the entire burden of economic adjustment. The price of casual work outside the official labour market is driven inexorably downwards. Bankruptcies and unemployment increase greatly. There are very few opportunities for school leavers and so-called further education takes the place of employment for increasing numbers of young people. What is worse, bankruptcies increase and social security offices and charities are inundated with requests for assistance. We see the total failure of the so-called waterfront reform, including the 310 redundancies of gangway watchmen which had already been negotiated before the start of the program. Excluding normal exits through natural attrition, only 372 wharfies have left through voluntary redundancy provisions of the in principle agreement. At the same time, 265 new recruits have joined the ranks of the privileged elite, so that the net result of the Government's hugely expensive reform program is a reduction in numbers of a miserable 107. One can only be amazed at the hypocrisy and unbelievable waste of taxpayers' money in an authority in which the average salary per person is estimated in 199091 to be $56,454. During the period of supposed reform there has been a significant downturn in trade activity on the Australian waterfront of 25 per cent. So even with a productivity improvement, the waterfront would still be grossly overmanned. In other words, 24 months into the 36-month reform program, there has been no real improvement in productivity. Australia still has too many wharfies collecting too much pay for comparatively little work. In these circumstances, there is absolutely no possibility of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority achieving its stated objective of facilitating productivity improvements and reliability in stevedoring at international container depots. If he is genuine in his desire to build a competitive Australia, the Prime Minister must abolish the wharfies' job-for-life rort and immediately instigate the necessary redundancies. Why should ordinary Australians lose their jobs as a result of the excessive costs and unreliability of the waterfront while those who are t'o blame enjoy the favoured status of being members of one of the Government's most powerful constituencies, the Waterside Workers Federation? The present approach must be abandoned and the users of the waterfront, such as the farmers, manufacturers, exporters and importers, must be given a general role in determining its future operation. The Prime Minister claims prog,. ress in waterfront reform. I regret to say that it is just another one of his porkies. Yesterday we heard in debate about all the committee reports-dozens of themwhich have not been addressed by this dithering Government in this session. It has even been suggested that we have an inquiry into wealth. Australia does not need an inquiry into wealth. It does not need any more inquiries. In fact, inquiries are the great growth industries of the Hawke Government. We know the problems; we sMuld do something about them. Indeed, it seems that the Government is, in reality, more interested in punishing the wealth creators of this society than in allowing them the economic freedom that will ensure the future prosperity and security of Australia. The lifeblood of any nation is money, not wealth. Australia's lifeblood is effectively one of the most expensive in the world. Our interest rates are three to five times that of our competitors. We are not generating enough money. We do not have enough strong, profitable enterprises in order to encourage more business. We need a top interest rate of 6 per centnot just a 6 per cent drop as promised by the Prime Minister. These issues were not addressed by the Prime Minister's statement. At its most basic level, wealth is taken to be synonymous with assets reflected in affluence: luxury, opulence, prosperity, abundance and command over money and resources. People with large observable measures of capital are generally perceived as wealthy. While these observations may sometimes be instructive, statistical ranking of assets owned provides us with very little reliable information about the relative earning capacities of-individuals. People with significant observable holdings of assets, while possibly able to spend more in the short term, are not necessarily able to command greater resources over the longer run than those whose wealth is embodied in nonobservable forms. Indeed, a correct economic definition of wealth makes it intrinsically nonobservable. In other words, the intended inquiry into the distribution of wealth by honourable members opposite is in reality little more than a cynical exercise in bureaucratic interference aimed at the further taxation of the individual and individual enterprises. Moreover, it would be difficult to imagine an exercise that would more effectively result in the creation of less, rather than more, wealth in this country. As Abraham Lincoln so rightly observed last century, 'You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich'. Encapsulated in Lincoln's words is an economic and philosophical concept that would be entirely foreign to Labor voting Mercedes Marxists whose middle class guilt has so pervaded the policies of the ALP in recent decades. To the economist, however, wealth is a precise concept, at least in theory. Following the writings of economists such as Irving Fisher, we may define wealth as a capitalised value of expected future income streams where ideally these income streams include the financial and non-financial benefits accruing to an individual. In other words, wealth is not measured simply by adding up estimates of worth-worth of factories, buildings, mines, farms, collections of antique clocks or memorabilia froni the Second Empire-since these are merely devices, for assisting in the production of income. What then is wealth? In short, it is a cash deposit in a financial institution and assets such as property and shares in business. Bank deposits, as we all know, attract high interest which is in turn taxed at a high marginal rate on the grounds it is unearned income. Savings are adversely affected by inflation, so while one might appear to be at a particular point fabulously wealthy, that wealth may well disappear in a short time as a result of the insidious disease of inflation. Wealth, like poverty and inequality, is also relativeit is not an absolute term. By any standards, then, the poorest Australians are infinitely better off than, say, the poorest ,Ethiopians, but would I imagine and describe them as poor in comparison with the Business Review Weekly richest 200 in Australia? If we restrict ourselves to simply looking at individual or business assets, we miss many of the other components of wealth which determine spending power or command over resources in this nation, which after all is the ultimate purpose of wealth and something to which this statement of the Prime Minister's did not contribute. Consider for a moment the example of a person who is cash rich and owns a house and a boat but who, for some medical or other reason, is in reality quite poor in terms of future command over resources. Even though to the casual observer or guilt ridden nosy parker from a government inquiry such a person appears a prime target for the impost of a wealth tax, on the other hand his neighbour may have a resource above the shoulders-if not below the ground or in the bank-such that he has ideas and knowledge which are likely to generate very considerable future income. Such a person may be a millionaire in prospect but could be totally immune from accounting for wealth during these sorts of inquiries. However, where a citizen has to be taxed in the expectation of wealth, he may lose the desire to take the risks inherent in generating wealth, and it is those risks that have been ignored by the Prime Minister. The net result would be that a tax on such wealth would in effect virtually guarantee that it is never created. Instead of wasting scarce resources on these nasty socialist inspired inquiries, Government would be better employed if it concentrated on policies that would take the lead out of Australia's saddlebags.",112
139,Mrs CROSIO,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"Prospect) (6.14 p.m.)Having had for the last 15 minutes the opportunity of listening to the harping of the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) and, I might add, of all honourable members on the Opposition benches regarding the statement brought down in March this year by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), I am more than convinced not only that the Government's policy is working but also that it has certainly been accepted by the community at large. I am always amazed when I listen to honourable members on the Opposition benches talk about the worker. The word itself seems to come from their mouths as though it is a dirty word. Let me remind those opposite that the workers are probably the 17 million people of this country. I will not acknowledge the other 100,000-perhaps that places where the honourable member for Dunkley sits. I am sick of hearing it, with all due respect. Today we hear that the worker is not performing on the wharves-'Look at the dreadful thing that is occurring'. Yesterday the catch cry was that the worker was not performing in the shearing sheds. When will it stop? Or is it the workers, the human beings I proudly represent in this Parliament, who are going to be always condemned for what I can only assume is the ignorance of the Opposition? I refer not only to the ignorance in not understanding or appreciating the statement that was brought before this Parliament in March of this year, but also the ignorance in not understanding or appreciating the involvement of people who do toil, people who do achieve, people who over 200 years have built this country from the sweat of their brows. They are the people I proudly say are the workers of this country. Let us not continue to condemn them. Let us praise them for what they have achieved and for what they continue to achieve for our country. The honourable member for Dunkley also mentioned in his statement, which I thought was nothing more than filibusterthis ing, that interest rates have not come down and asked where we are placed now. He has not acknowledged that in the last 18 months they have dropped by over 6 per cent. We do not hear any congratulations from the Opposition benches, nor do we hear, 'Well donc to the Government', but we can accept that fact. Those opposite do not want to acknowledge it. Also, they do not want to acknowledge the fact, as predicted by our Prime Minister, that the inflation rate is down and is coming down even further. I wish to mention a number of points in the statement before us and, in the limited time that I have to do that, to concentrate on a number of particular issues. I do so because I believe that our economic environment seems to be drastically characterised by a continual conflict between the need for growth and the need to contain government and overseas debt. Whilst not wishing to be labelled, I acknowledge that in market economies governments set laws within which private enterprises can operate. I also acknowledge that they can influence but they do not have the power to suspend the market forces. In this statement the Prime Minister stated: The challenge for the foreseeable future is to produce more than we spend. The rest of the world will not allow us to continue indefinitely to live beyond our means by borrowing from them. Our rural and mineral products will remain important into the future. But the challenge is to add to them. That is, we must export more manufactured goods and services and substitute more quality Australian production for imports. Mr Ford- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.",115
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,Mr HoIIis)Is a quorum required?,116
141,Mrs CROSIO,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would not have been able to speak in this House without having a quorum formed on me. I realise I have broken all records for quorums. Obviously what I have to say affects the Opposition. (Quorum formed) Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you realise the countless occasions that a quorum has been called on me when I rise to speak on very important issues in this House. Members of the Opposition obviously do not choose to listen, do not wish to comprehend, and certainly do not understand. I thank them because at all times they provide me with an audience of my colleagues. I know that they have been glued to the television sets in their rooms. They have been waiting for me to speak on this issue because they realise that within four minutes they will be called to the House for a quorum. I thank the Opposition most sincerely for that. I was quoting from the statement made by the Prime Minister about the challenge for the foreseeable future. I would like to quote another challenge he made before I make a number of pertinent comments on how this statement will affect the people in my electorate. This challenge, which is a very important one, states: The challenge is therefore to make the decisions and adopt the practices and attitudes which will enable this and succeeding generations to achieve those basic goals. These are the basic goals which will make our economy; the basic goals that we, on the Labor benches in this House, have the ability to implement; and certainly the basic goals and challenges that only a Labor governn'lent can even consider. This is a very wide-ranging document and there is an area in it which I do have a little concern about. That is, of course, the tariff reductions which create competitiveness in, for example, the motor vehicle industry. I realise and understand that they are going to be phased down from 35 per cent in 1992 to 15 per cent in the year 2000 in annual steps of 2.5 per cent. From reading that document I also realise that, on average, there will be real reductions-between $2,000 and $3,000-in the price of $20,000 in today's dollars. We are told that that will occur over the next decade. I hope and trust that that particular saving will be passed on to the consumer. I express those concerns because I have within my electorate a very innovative engineering firm which was previously known as Borg Warner-and many people would know it by that name-and is now the BTR Engineering Co. I am concerned because of Ford's decision to resource its rear axle assemblies for the Falcon range of vehicles to be introduced in about 1993. It virtually has the potential of shutting down that plant, and in the shutting down of that plant we are talking about the lives of 700 workers. I reiterate, 700 workerspeople I represent. I am concerned. I went over that particular factory and took on board some of the initiatives which it has implemented, and the drive and enthusiasm among the workers. Also, through the amalgamation and the working together of the nine unions, this factory has become very efficient. Traditionally it has been a very substantial investor in new technology and in research and development and has been a major exporter-long before the words 'current account deficit' even became an issue. It has, through our common industry concept, succeeded in bringing together the relatively low volumes of each vehicle manufacturer to maximise economies of scale. During my visit J had the opportunity of perceiving how it is restructuring to become more price competitive. I particularly believe that the management now has the full support of its employees and the unions at this plant, and that we are certainly well on the way to again leading the industry in restructuring and productivity improvements. The Ford decision will be a body blow to that whole concept of restructuring cause the company has clearly stated that it has not been given adequate time to implement all of its structural changes. has discussed price competitiveness. It has had a very difficult issue to improve, and to prove, in one way or another. It has no access to competitors' prices-in other words, it is changing its structures. Its export performance in the past and in its current quotations, and its customer feedback certainly lead one to believe that it is competitive. The whole structure of what it has achieved is something that the firm itself is proud of and it has received accreditation because of the skilful way which it has implemented change. When one looks at what is being done, one realises that there is only so much that can be achieved through cost savings. I fear that possibly even the most ambitious program it has endeavoured to undertake will be overcome by what I call a double whammy. I am concerned with what Ford is going to do. I realise that Ford's decision to resource its supply of axle assemblies represents a commercial decision on its behalf, but I also believe that BTR Engineering has in many ways led the component sector of the Australian car industry. During that visit I was able to speak with a number of those workers and that gave me the opportunity to understand and appreciate the history of the company-a history, I might add, that began in 1928 and proudly goes back over 60 years of involvement. It has a proud history of achievement; it certainly had a number of hiccups along the way but it has progressed to what is now a very efficient industry. The workers there are worried about what will happen to them in the future. They are certainly concerned that there perhaps will not be a market in the future for the rear axles, including the independent rear suspension, that they manufacture and assemble for a rangc of vehicles. In addition, manual transmission components, such as cluster gears and first, second, third, fourth and fifth gears, are machined-and in a vcry professional be- manner-at the Fairfield plant. The finished gears are matched into sets and are taken for assembly to the Albury plant, It where all other transmission components are manufactured. The Albury plant also manufactures and assembles automatic transmissions. Over 50 nationalities arc represented among the employees of the Fairfield plant, and over 70 per cent of the workers are of non-Australian origin. As I said, the plant is covered by nine unions that have been able to work together. The employees are capable of producing 1,300 in units per day on a two-shift cycle when required. At the moment their average production is something like 700 units per day, and that is continuing to decline. I hope we give consideration to this area when we look at what tariff reductions will do to Australia's manufacturing industries in the future. Another area I am concerned about is the reduction of tariffs in the clothing and tcxtile industries. Again I have to relate that to my own electorate, where women who are employed, whether in the machining industry or in the general textile industry, will suffer-and will suffer greatly-if we do not provide opportunities for continued employment to them. I am mindful of the Skillshare opportunities available to retrain some of our workers, but the people I am talking about have very little knowledge of the English language and very few skills other than what they have acquired, whether from machining or from working with their hands. I want to see those people retain their pride, and I want to see them continue to grow for this country.",116
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,Mr Hollis)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,117
143,Mr CARLTON,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"It seems an age ago that the March statement was brought to this House by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). That was the much heralded March statement which was to give a new direction to Australia after some eight years of Labor governearned ment when things were obviously bad, when recession was upon us and when the policies that had been pursued by the Prime Minister and his then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), had clearly failed. A great deal of anticipation accomand panied the announcement that there would be a March statement on industry. The Prime Minister himself took over the livery of that statement. There was a lot of speculation about which Ministers would be involved in the delivery of it, gun to collapsc. but it was so important for the nation that the Prime Minister took it over self. The big problem with the March statement-quite apart from the fact that it has really disappeared and that now in June we are having a debate on it people can hardly remember its delivchanging ery-is that it failed to get to the heart the matter. In developing Australia's economy and in making sure that Ausmodities-of tralia is internationally competitive, heart of the matter is the industrial relapowcr tions system. Everything in Australia-all the probmincral lems in industry, of inefficient work tices and lack of competitiveness-gets back to this central issue of the industrial relations system. We have to look back history to see the foundation of this probthis lem. It goes back to the first decade this century, when a liberal Prime Minisand ter, Alfred Deakin, who was one of the Victorian protectionists, had, in agreement with the labour movement that if manufacturers were protected there would be a centralised wage fixation tem that would protect wages, and that compact would insulate suburban and ursubject ban Australia from rural and mineral to Australia. At the time a majority or Australians did not consider that a wonderful thing to have. We have to look back to the views of Henry Bournes Higgins, an carly of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, who said that every Australian was going to have a living wage. That was a very good social objcctive, but in economic terms it mcant that a living wage had to be supplied regardless of who it and the cconomics involved. Looking back to the early decades of this century, we see that the dictum of Henry Bournes Higgins in the Harvester judgment was economicallv Hawed. Fortunately, the rural and mi-cral industries of Australia were intcrnationally competitive had an enormous power to generate wealth. For decades those industries were able to sustai n the protected industriesdeboth servicc and manufacturing-within the great cities of Australia, and only in recent times has this whole structure beWe have to be quite clear about our himhistory because in the 1990s we need to change quite fundamentally the structures of Australian socicty which were put in placc in the first decades of this century. when That time has now come: because of international conditions, the of greater competitivcness of miners in other countrics, the more sparing use of comminerals particularly-in the international markets and the increased of other countries to generate their own food requirements, the rural and industries of Australia are no praclonger able to meet the requirements of Henry Bournes Higgins's judgment. This whole scheme set up by Deakin and the in labour movement in the first decades of century is now falling apart. We now of have to creatc an entirely new framework go into a totally new era where people have to earn thei r wages and businesses effect, an have to earn thei r profits. Therc are countless examples in Australia where wages and profits arc not sysproperly earned. One particular example of that is the situation on the wharves, a which is almost boring everybody death at the moment because it is raised all the time but it is of fundamental importance. Everybody in Australia acknowledges that the costs of moving goods across our wharves onto ships are intcrnationally ullcompetitive. The Govcrnment has put up a scheme whereby $150m of taxpayers' money, which is to be matched by an equivalent amount from the employers, will be used to try to fix this problem by paying off waterside workers who would be no longer required if the featherbedding that goes on on the wharves were to be reduced by a certain amount. I think anybody who has examined this problem objectively knows that these problems will not be solved until there is adequate competition between the employers-who have been part of this rort over all this time-for membership of trade unions. In other words, until it is possible for employees to choose how they will be represented and to bargain freely with employers, and, equally importantly, for those employers to be forced to compete fully with each other, the costs on Australian wharves have no chance of being internationally competitive. Instead of introducing the critical elements of competition, both to labour and capital on the wharves-and they are the two key ingredients required-the Government decided, in accordance with its corporatist philosophy, to sit down and negotiate with the people who were the rent seekers, the ones who were getting the unearned profits and the unearned wages, to seek to get their agreement for reform. That is like sitting down with a group of thieves who are taking money and trying to get them to agree to give up some of their ill-gotten gains. It simply does not work. It was not working, and that was quite clearly the case because we recently came to a crisis when the Industrial Relations Commission made a general wage judgment affecting all the workers in the try and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), in collaboration with the Waterside Workers Federation, decided that the so-called reform process on the wharves would. not continue unless the demands of the unions were met in full and unless the decision of the umpire was rejected. We had the most extraordinary situation where the Prime Minister of Australia intervened personally in this dispute and spent some 17 hours over one night and the early hours of the following morning trying to do a deal to get this thing back on the rails. The best analogy one could use for the Prime Minister's intervention on this occasion is this: the proprietor of a service station is driving past that service station one night and sees a robber in the building, robbing the till; the manager the proprietor had appointed is, in fact, assisting the robber to take the money; and, instead of calling the police or at least intervening personally, the proprietor decides to go in and negotiate with the pair of them, in order to give the robber more money by taking the money out of the till at a slightly slower rate. That is the exact analogy of what the Prime Minister did in his negotiations with the waterfront unions that night. When he came into the House and said, 'The miserable Opposition is claiming that the people have to make reforms and give up particular privileges for absolutely no reward'-that this was the philosophy of the Opposition-our reply was that they should jolly well have been forced to give up'their ill-gotten gains over a long period because none of them, neither the employers nor the employees, was doing any service to this nation. Whatever the history of the waterfront industry, it is ludicrous to suggest that people who are grossly overpaid in relation to what they do and who pursue grossly inefficient work practices-who work a very small number of hours, with all sorts of restrictive practices, with five weeks annual leave on 27% per cent holiday loading and with all sorts of privileges that other workers cannot have, such as telephone allowances and counGod knows what-should be paid $150m of taxpayers' money as a bribe to get them to do their jobs not quite as outrageously as they had done them in the past and also to get wage increases higher than those agreed by the Industrial Relations Commission. This is in c1oud-cuckoo-land, yet that is what the Prime Minister was suggesting in his 17-hour negotiation and when he c-me into this House. It is simply no longer on that people can featherbed, laze about and not adopt the most efficient practices. It is simply not on for us to have practices on our wharves that are less efficient than those used in Singapore or Rotterdam. These things have to be changed. How can people who work in these situations have any self-respect if they are sitting around for hours, not doing the kind of work they know needs to be done, being paid more than other people in professions, jobs or trades who have to put in a full day's work for their pay? It simply has to stop. That instance-all the media attention was directed towards what the Prime Minister was doing in a particular case; putting nonsense upon nonsense-is the very heart of Australia's problems. . I could go into all the other areas. com unions, for example, have dictated the course of government policy on competition. Monstercom-the amalgamation of OTC Ltd and Telecom-will have a market power which will be so dramatically great that it will be virtually impossible for a competitor to get off the ground. In the airlines, despite deregulation, the Transport Workers Union still has a grip over the ridiculous practices on the ground. Under the trans-Tasman shipping agreement, the costs of freight across the Tasman are outrageously high because of a deal between the unions. With the exception of the New South Wales railways, Westrail and Australian National Railways, railway featherbedding-certainly in Victoria-is costing an enormous amount. Indeed, $4 billion a year is being lost to the national economy. All these things must change. They all depend on reform of the way in which we deal with each other in the workplace. I speak here, Mr Deputy Speaker, with direct experience as a supervisor, manager, middle manager and general manager in manufacturing industry. I was able to deal and negotiate directly with employees. I was able to work out with them what their rewards would be for productive effort. In some cases we were able to get productivity improvements of 200 per cent or 300 per cent. This is what can happen when one can sit down with people and not be interfered with by trade unions or commissions, or people who do not know anything about what is going on in the workplace and have no commitment to the success, jointly, of employers and employees within that workplace. That is at the heart of this matter, and it was not even addressed in the March statement. Because of the power of the ACTU, this Government is powerless to address that fundamental issue.",118
144,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak at a very late hour on Friday evening of the last sitting day of this session of Parliament. Indeed, the Senate has already adjourned. N evcrthcless, we are discussing a report which came down on 12 March. Most of the provisions in that Tele- report have been put into place. Certainly, industry has had time to digest its forward provisions in order to make determinations about its future. The matters raised by the honourable member for MACKellar (Mr Carlton) were a repetition of the sort of stuff that we have been hearing from the Opposition for years and years. Mr Carlton-Not all that many years.",120
145,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"Virtually since the day the Opposition lost office in 1983 we have been hearing this same stuff from it; essentially, it constitutes no solution to the problems. How anyone can think that merely reforming industrial relations can resolve all of the economic problems and all of the industry problems of a nation is beyond my imagination. I cannot understand that sort of thinking. It is argued that all the economies around the world which are in trouble have to do is 'reform' their industrial relations structure? I place the word 'reform' in quotation marks because what is being suggested is actually not a reform in the progressive sense but a reform in a reactionary sense; that is, a return to practices that were tried and which failed in the nineteenth century. The honourable member for MACKellar wanted to refer to history. He forgot about the period when all the laissez faire practices that were in place created class divisions of a very serious nature and resulted in a big gap between the rich and the poor. He has learned nothing about history from that point of view. We suddenly hear him talking about how awful it was that a certain judge in Australia made a decision that there was to be such a thing as a 'living wage' and how this would be such a serious setback. I put to the honourable member that, in fact, it might be interpreted differcntly-as a progressive step rather than a serious setback. I would suggest to the honourable member that he re-read history. In fact, this is the problem with the Opposition. The Opposition has no new suggestions at all. All of its suggestions are either teenth century laissez faire nonsense or Thatcherism. Is it not an irony? Mrs Thatcher has gone; Presidcnt Reagan has gone; and what do we have in Australia? We have an Opposition which, notwithstanding its pleasant face under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), nevertheless puts forward policies that are the same or more extreme than those of Mrs Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, policies which have been shown and demonstrated to have failed in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America. If people think we have a problem with unemployment at the moment, imagine what the outcome would be if the mad policies advocated by the Leader of the Opposition and other prominent members of the front bench, including two failed leaders of the Opposition whose same policies were rejected by the Australian people, were put into effect? Is it not extraordinary? During the tion in 1987 the Australian people said, 'Look, we've got difiicult times but we're not going to vote for this nonsense'. So they rejected those policies in 1987. Again in 1990, during another period of difficulty, the Australian people were offered the same nonsense. What happened? Again they rej ected those policies. There is one thing for certain: if the Opposition wishes to continue with these policies for 20 years, 50 years, 100 years, the Australian people will continue to reject themand there is no doubt about that. Mr Truss-Ha, ha.",120
146,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"The honourable member may laugh but he has not been here long enough to know. Honourable members who have been in opposition now for a number of years will continue to be in opposition as a result of those same policies. It is amazing that a political party cannot learn from its mistakes. It cannot learn from the fact that its policies, these policies, have been rejected by the electorate time and again. The Australian people do not want Thatcherism. They do not want Reaganism. They have rejected those policies. The more these policies are put up by the honourable member and others, the more ninewe will see the same sort of thing occurnng. The role of an Opposition should be to present coherent, constructive, positivc alternatives. We are not getting those from the Opposition in terms of suggested industry development policy, infrastructure development, economic development, micro-economic reform-in the whole series of areas where we should be getting policies that make sense. We are getting no such policies from the Opposition. In fact, if we look at the actual content of this particular document, Building a Competitive Australia, we find that the Opposition spokespersons have had very little to say about the actual industry development situation that is explained therein. Only the Labor members have raised questions and made an analysis of the actual concrete details. For example, let us take what this docelecument has done in relation to the footwear, clothing and textiles industries. A serious decision has been taken to reduce tariffs; to bring forward the reduction in tariffs. The consequence, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), is that many workers in these industries, often migrant workers, will be displaced or already have been displaced. The Government has put into place a number of programs for the retraining of these workers. But the question is: how long will Australia continue to play its part in the reduction of tariffs, in the game of fair trade, when it is clear that many other nations of the world are not playing their part? Already in the last two days the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has had to contact the President of the United States to plain about certain trading policies. Why is this happening? It is happening because Australia, wanting to be a principled tion in terms of free trade, is reducing its tariffs and protection but other nations are not following suit.",121
147,Mr LLOYD,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The honourable member is actually on the Government's side. He should be saying this to the Government, not to us.",122
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,Mr Hollis)The honourable member for Murray knows that there is no point of order.,122
149,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"Listening to my speech, the honourable member for Murray would have realised the extent which the Opposition in this place does not do its job whatsoever. The Opposition has no alternative-",122
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,The honourable member for Calwell should not provoke the Opposition.,122
151,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE,"I am entitled to raise questions about what ing in the trading area and I shall continue to do so, notwithstanding the interventions of the honourable member opposite. Australia has been playing its part in terms of trying to meet the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as to free trade. The probment lem is that, to a considerable degree, other has nations are not playing their part. As a result, we have a situation where we are imposing burdens on our workers through tariff reductions, creating difficult circumthe stances and, at the same time, we do not see reciprocity from many other counwhole tries. The European Community keeps talking about how it is really protectionEuropean ist. Its level of protection in terms agriculture is shockingly high. The supThey port which it givcs to its agricultural dustries so that they can dump their agricultural products on other nations having a direct impaet on the capacity of our farmers to sell our products. In addition to that, we do not place the sorts of barriers to industrial products comwhich the Europeans do, for example, to the products of other nations. Why is it, for example, that Japanese cars are hard nato purchase in Europe? It is because a whole variety of non-tariff barriers are put into place to prevent sufficient Japanese cars entering Europe. So it is fine for us to be talking about moving towards a free trade world, but other nations are not playing their part. I say that it is time to think about the consequences of Australia pursuing this policy. Of course, in this Parliament I am in the minority in suggesting that we should rethink this matter. Nevertheless, I raise the question with the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) and with the Treasurer (Mr Kerin): how to long are we going to persist with those free trade policies, with the continuous reductions in our tariffs and an even bigger reduction being advocated by the Opposition, while at the same time there is no attempt by other countries, especially the big power blocs such as the United States and the European Community, to do anything about moving to a genuine is happenfree trade situation? The GATT talks that have taken place have not been very successful. One reason they have not been very successful is that we have insisted that one cannot have merely an agreement on manufactured products without also having an agreeon agriculture. Nevertheless, what happened is that this appeal has been ignored and the GATT talks have been deferred once again. I am told that the earliest it is going to be possible to have next GATT round is later this year. So in the meantime we have had a period in which these policies have been pursued by the big power blocs-the Community, the United States of of America, Japan and other countries. have continued to play the game of inhypocritical trade policies while unfairly keeping out our products. As a Parliais ment we have to start to address this question. We have to ask ourselves whether our industry and trading policies need to be further adjusted to take this situation into account. For example, we need to think more scriously about bilateral arrangements with other countries for our primary products because, obviously, if multilateral trade negotiations are either not going to be successful or to be drawn out indefinitely while other nations take a market share of our farm production, we will be in serious strife. In both my electorate and the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), which is next to mine, this statement has had a massive impact on unemployment, especially amongst unskilled people. In that sense it is very important that those people be looked after. We have put some restructuring programs into place, and I emphasise that those programs have to be finetuned to ensure that those people-especially those of migrant background who have no substantial skill base but have been used all their life to working in particular factories-arc assisted in this current context. It is time for us to rethink this It is time that we monitor the consequences of the tariff reductions, and when those consequen-es are monitored we should do something to ensure that we act in the national interest in relation to our industries.",122
152,Mr JOHN SCOTT,BUILDING A COMPETITIVE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I had not intended to speak in this debate but I will try to assist the House in whichever way I can. I was concerned tonight on a number of counts to hear the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), who I have a great deal of respect for as a person, refer to the wharfics as robbers. I find that not only offensive but also totally out of character. His reference concerned reforms on the waterfront. As a member of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which is looking into the waterfront, along with a number of other areas, I have seen at first hand the kinds of problems that we have. It is certainly not the wharfies who can be blamed. Because I have been so offended by the honourable member's comments, I need time to put together a real argument against what he said. Therefore, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. TRAl-SPORT LEGISI""ATJON AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill returned from the Senate without amen dm en 1.

153,Mr CREAN,AUSTRALIAN WOOL INDUSTRY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of an industry council for the wool industry. The Council will replace the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council established in September last year. The Bill replaces the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill which had proposed a legislative framework under which industry councils could be established by regulation for particular primary industries. However, that Bill has been withdrawn in the Senate due to Opposition concerns about legislation by regulation and the need for legislation to be passed establishing a wool industry council on 1 July 1991, which is the same date as the other new wool industry institutional arrangements are to come into force. This Bill follows closely on the provisions of the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) Bill except that it has been made specific to the wool industry and spells out the membership of the Council in clause 14. The second reading speech for the Primary Industries (Industry Councils) ,Bill outlined the functions, powers, meetmg arrangements and establishment of committees and working parties. Those principles are the same for this Bill. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",124
154,Mr LLOYD,AUSTRALIAN WOOL INDUSTRY,"I move: That all words after ""that"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a reading, the House deplores the Governmcnt's decision to set the rate of the Wool Tax by regulation and in excess of 10 percent"". I recognise that the Government has accepted the sense of our proposal-that is, that w- should not have legislation by regulatlOn for some sort of monolithic model but that each different commodity council. should be put in and put in by regulatlOn rather than by legislation. I believe that it is more sensible to deal with the councils individually. A number are not in place and they are working well. Why interfere with them and try to force them into some sort of uniform mould? Therefore, this legislation is sensible to that degree. The fmal point in this long running debate on wool is that, in looking at all these Bills including this one, the Government has been let off the hook better and more easily than it deserves, and the wool growers have reccived less than they deserve. The Australian Democrats and the Wool Council of Australia have been conned. They have sold out on their commitments because they were saying, right up until this afternoon, that thcy would not accept anything less than a legislated maximum of 12 pcr cent for a tax. They have settled for a legislative packagcand it is the central feature of the package-which still has a 15 per cent maximum by legislation and a promise that, for only this year, by regulation the tax will be 12 per cent. Members of the Government have been not particularly trustworthy in this whole situation, so I just hope that they stick to their word better on this 12 per cent promise than they have on SOme of the others, particularly the $200m loan fiasco. For the Government to say that it has stuck to a 15 per cent maximum when it has indicated that less than 15 per cent is needed every year in its own programs is treating the industry in a very cruel way. Finally, the Democrats gave in too easily, because the Government was panicking today. By our maintaining a strong position on an achievable 10 per cent, the Government panicked and lowered the second tax level from IS per cent to 14 per cent, then to 12.5 per cent and finally to 12 per cent. Ten per cent tax would have been achievable if only the Democrats and the Wool Council had remained firm.",125

NA Third Reading The following notice was given:  That the House refer to the Committee of Privileges for inquiry and report the question of whether certain Government Members of the House were subjected to intimidation or improper interference on account of action or statements by Mr Bill Ludwig of the Australian Workers' Union in connection with the recent Government leadership challenge. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 21 June 1991: Defence Act-Determinations undcr section 58B-1991No. 61-Middle East Naval Sanctions Allowance. No. 65-Special Royal Navy Allowance. Remuneration Tribunal Act-Remuneration Tribunal-Determination-1991/l3-Mcmbers of Parliament-Postage entitlement. States Grants (Petroleum Products) ActAmendments of the schedules to the subsidy schemes in relation to the States and the Northern Territory, dated 19 June 1991. The following answers to questions were circulated: Street Posting Boxes (Question No. 677)  Transport, upon notice, on 9 April 1991: (1) What guidelines or criteria must be met before a street posting box can be established. (2) How do the guidelines or criteria cater for (a) a rapidly growing suburban area and (b) an ageing population. (3) How many street posting boxes were there in (a) Australia, (b) each State and Territory and (c) the Division of Chifley on (i) 1 January 1984 and (ii) 1 January 1991. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia Post has advised that the basic criteria to be considered when assessing the need for an additional street posting box are- convenience for customers (expressed in terms of location and distance to travel to existing facilities); - the level of expected usage (eg. at least 40 mail articles per day); and - the additional costs involved in clearing the box. (2) (a) Guidelines require development in an area to be kept under regular review, and an additional street posting box will be established when it is warranted. Preferred sites for establishment of street posting boxes include local shopping centres and well patronised transport stopping points. (b) Within the guidelines on provision of street posting boxes, is a clause which states that these boxes may, in special cases, be provided to cater for the particular needs of the aged or disabled, e.g. near a hospital, elderly people's homes, etc. (3) Information of the type requested is gathered at the end of each financial year and the following details have been extracted from records which have been retained: (a) Australia 14801 15027 14037 (b) NSW incl ACT 4052 Vic 4909 Qld 2189 SA incl NT 1967 WA 1169 Tas 515 (c) Division of Not Chifley AvailNA NB Australia Post regularly reviews the usage of street posting boxes because it recognises that community shopping habits change and, as a consequence, so too does the use of postal facilities. Such reviews take into account the average number of articles posted, the location of other posting facilities in the area and the cost of providing, maintaining and clearing the box. Whilst the number of street posting boxes has reduced since 1985/86, Australia Post is reflecting changing community needs by, for example, continuing to strategically locate these facilities at local shopping centres and well patronised transport stopping points. ABC: Sheffield Shield Final (Question No. 704) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 11 April 1991: (1) Did the fact that the 1991 Sheffield Shield final was played in Melbourne and not Sydney have any bearing on the ABC's decision not to broadcast or televise the final. (2) On what previous occasions has the ABC not broadcast the Sheffield Shield final. (3) Does the ABC employ a ""Sydney preference"" policy; if so, was the decision concerning the Sheffield Shield final consistent with that policy. (4) Were broadcast facilities set up at the final and used by the ABC to provide a pay broadcast arrangement using Telecom's 005 facility. (5) Did the ABC advertise the arrangement referred to in part (4) during its normal programs; if so, were listeners advised that users of the arrangement would be charged at (a) standard local call or (b) STD rates, as well as the ABC's 005 fee. (6) Is it within the ABC's charter to engage in pay broadcasting. (7) Will the ABC be prevented from using any introduction of pay TV to deny normal services to its viewers and listeners. 1982/83 1985/86 1989/90",125
156,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the 4475 4092 honourable member's question, based on 4638 4149 information provided by the Australian 2380 2477 Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows: 1906 1706 (1) No. The ABC's decision not to telecast 1106 1104 coverage of the 1991 Sheffield Shield Final was 522 509 based on a number of factors, but location of the 66 80 match was not a consideration. The principal reasons were the cost, the fact that telecasts would able have clashed with scheduled schools programming, and that the Nine network also had the television rights. The fact that the Sheflleld Shield Final was played in Melbourne had no bearing on ABC radio coverage. Radio Sport scheduled coverage of the game six months beforehand when its Summer Sports Schedule was compiled. Any coverage was to be irrespective of the venue. It is incorrect to say that there was no radio broadcast of the Sheffield Shield Final. A commentary team of Jim Maxwell, Alan Marks, Peter Booth, Keith Stackpole and Peter Roebuck was assembled, and a commentary and reports were broadcast. Less commentary than normal was broadcast on the Saturday and Sunday, because of the clash with the first round of the AFL and the second round of the Rugby League competitions, than would have been the case if there had been no foothall. (2) Sheffield Shield Finals have been played since 1983. During that period, television coverage was presented in 1988 only. ABC Radio has always provided coverage of Sheffield Shield Finals. (3) No, there is no ""Sydney preference"" policy in general sports programming or the Sheffield Shield in particular. In fact, the national weekend radio sports program, ""Grandstand"", has in the last six months been presented from all capital cities except Perth (because of problems of time differences in daylight saving periods). (4) Radio broadcast facilities for the final were set up to provide coverage for the ABC. This allowed each State to take as much commentary as they deemed to be appropriate in their local market. If any State chose not to broadcast continual commentary, the feed was available for monitoring purposes so that the latest scores could be included in Sports Updates during the day. (5) ABC broadcasters during the commentary mentioned the availability of the 00-55 service for people who may not have access to Radio at all times. The details of charges arc mentioned occasionally. (6) Whether ABC involvement in any future 'pay broadcasting' regime would be authorised by the ABC Charter would require assessment at the time, in the light of the nature of the services proposed to be provided as 'pay broadcasting'. (7) The Government is yet to decide whether to permit the introduction of Pay TV in Australia. At that time, the Government would also consider the basis for any involvement by incumbent broadcasters. The potential effect on normal services would be a matter for consideration by the Government in that context. If there was scope for the ABC to participate in any future service, however, this would not be permitted at the expense of current services or programs. New South Wales Highway Program (Question No. 729) Mr Sharp asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 16 April 1991: (1) Was the original estimate for the Federal Government's contribution to the New South Wales highway program $100 million. (2) Was the estimate later reduced to $87 million; if so, why. (3) Was the Tomerong section of the Prince's Highway relegated from a first priority project to second priority; if so, (a) who authorised the relegation and (b) why. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) & (2) No. When I wrote to the States last July to seek their cooperation in identifying suitable projects for funding under the three year $300 million Provincial Cities and Rural Highways (PCRH) Program, it was made quite clear that the Federal Government would determine State funding shares according to its assessment, based on national priorities, of projects submitted for funding by the States. T emphasised that no State would be entitled to a set share of funds and that funding would not be tied to ""traditional"" State allocations. Consequently, no indication was given to New South Wales that it could expect to receive $100 million under PCRH rather than the $82 million finally allocated for road projects. The only commitment given to New South Wales was that it would receive $60 million in PCRH funds on a dollar for dollar basis to accelerate the upgrading of the Pacific Highway. (3) In determining priorities for the funding of specific projects under the PCRH Program, the Federal Government took into account the following criteria: (a) projects must provide a high return on investment early in their life (b) projects must be on routes which perform tasks of national economic importance and service areas of production or manufacturing (c) works must be substantially completed within the three years of the PCRH Program. It was also considered desirable that PCRH funded works complement the Government's National Arterial roads program which is aimed at assisting export and import-competing industries and is an important part of its microeconomic reform strategy. On the basis of an evaluation based on this criteria, the Federal Government determined funding priorities for the projects submitted by the New South Wales' Government. It concluded that construction of the Tomerong Bypass, while warranted on economic grounds, was of a lower priority than other projects includcd in the State's submission. It took into account that the Tomerong project could not be completed by the end of the PCRH Program and, whcn compared with other projects nominated by the State, met less adequately the objective of complementing the Federal Government's National Arterial program. Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (Question No. 763) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 7 May 1991: (1) To what extent will the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories extend its user pays service. (2) Have the opportunities for increasing user contributions to funding the Laboratories' scrvices been evaluated; if so, what werc the findings; if not, why not. (3) What impact would increased extcrnal earnings through the extension of the user pays principle have on the (a) technical and (b) perceived integrity of the Laboratories. Mr Beddall-The Minister fm Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL) through its fee-for-service operations, currently recovers all of its costs. Any extension of AGAL services above the current level will depend on market demand. (2) Since I July 1990 AGAL has operated under a Group 2 Trust Account and is recovering all of its costs through its fee-for-scrvice operations. Costs associated with commercial services are recovered from both public and private sector clients through normal billing processes while costs associated with public interest or community service obligations (CSO) arc recovered from funds appropriated for this purposc. (3) AGAL is mindful of the need to maintain the right client and workload mix in order to meet its responsibilities under its Charter. Any increase in external earnings will be in accordance with AGAL's Corporate Plan and aim at developing AGAL's role as an efficient service provider as well as improving AGAL's technical capacity and status in the community. Land Transport ProJects (Question No. 796) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 8 May 1991: Will he provide additional information to that supplied in his answers to questions Nos 451 (Hansard, 15 April 1991, page 2637) and 605 (Hansard, 17 April 1991, page 2898) so that the questions are answered in full. Mr Robert Brown-The answcr to the honourable member's question is as follows: With regard to my answer to question 451, I have informed the honourable mcmber that he will be provided with all the dctails hc has requested as soon as the annual report on the Land Transport Program is compiled. I expect that the information will have been prepared by my Department by September 1991. I regard my response to question 605 to be adequate. Unemployment Benefits (Question No. 800) Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 8 May 1991: (1) With respect to the operations of the Minister's Department's offices in Geelong, Belmont and Meadowvale (Norlane), how many (a) males within the (i) 60-65, (ii) 55-60, (iii) 45-55, (iv) 18-21 age groups and (b) females within the (i) 55-60, (ii) 50-55, (iii) 40-50, (iv) 18-21 age groups who have been in receipt of unemployment benefits for longer than (A) 9 months, (B) 12 months, (C) two years, (I) have received unemployment benefits for more than 26 weeks between 1 May 1989 and 1 May 1991, (II) have returned to the workforce since 1988 and arc still working, excluding employment in special employment programs funded by governments, (III) possess (aa) trade skills or (ab) no qualifications and (IV) have undergone retraining undcr Government schemes. (2) In the light of the employment benefit procedures to be implementcd on 1 July 1991, has any assessment been made of the prospects for the unemployed persons referred to in part (1) of a return to full time employment; if so, is a significant improvement indicated.",128
157,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The information requested is not available in respect of all those who have received unemployment benefits (UB) since 1 May 1989. The following table presents the numbers of unemployment benefit recipients by age and duration on benefit at 15 February 1991 (this being the date of the latest available quarterly survcy of unemployment beneficiaries from which the information is derived) for the Geelong, Belmont and Corio (including Meadowvale (Norland» Regional Offices of the Department of Social Security.

(II) The Department of Social Security does not hold information on the circumstances of people who have ceased receiving unemployment benefit. (III) (a a) and (ab) details are not required for payment of benefit and are therefore not recorded on DSS payment filcs. This information may be available from the Department of Employment, Education and Training as all unemployment bcnefit rccipients are required to register with the Commonwealth Employment Service.

158,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Civil Aviation Authority has recently completed the first stage of a review of its resources aimed at making the Authority more efficient and cost-effective, without reducing the level of safety to aviation users. As part of that review, the need for the Materials Evaluation Facility (MEF) was evaluated. The next stage of the resources review will involve a two month consultation period with staff and staff associations on the draft proposals arising out of the review. No decision will be made on the MEF or any other draft proposal until the consultation period has been completed. Australian National (Question No. 805) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 9 May 1991 : (1) What was the cost, including all expenses, accommodation, travel, transportation of motor vehicles, to Australian National of the provision of relief staff at Parkeston and West Kalgoorlie, WA, in (a) 1988, (b) 1989, (c) 1990 and (d) 1991. (2) Would transferring the necessary staff to KalgoorIie have been less expensive; if so, why was the practice of using continuous relief staff maintained. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . (1) The Australian National Railways Commission (AN) has advised that it is unable to provide the cost of the provision of relief staff as sought. AN does not separate costs for relief staff from other labour costs. The only costs additional to normal salary and entitlements incurred for relief staff at Parkeston are $72.50 per off duty day and $438.00 for travelling time on the return trip between Port Augusta and Parkeston. Drivers and guards are paid expenses whilst on duty away from their home station but these are the same as they would normally receive in any such situation throughout AN's rail network. The following table provides information on the number of staff used: Year Average* used 1987/88 4 24 1988/89 13 78 1989/90 16 96 Drivers Guards Tot al Average* Total Year Average* used used 1990/91 11 66 o o (to date) Notc: * The average number of pcrsonnel relieving at Parkeston at anyone time. (2) There are no figures readily available which allow a direct comparison. However, AN cxpccts this to be a relatively short term problem. Two-man crewing of freight trains will be implcmented in the short to medium term and this will mean that the available crews based permanently at Parkeston will be able to cover most if not all of the trains. AN has advised that it has advertised internally unsuccessfully on several occasions for people to transfer to Parkeston to cover its immediate needs. The isolation, lack of suitable housing and high cost of scarce rental accommodation ($200 plus per week) are the main reasons for being unable to get people to transfer. The costs associated with a transfer from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie for a family of four are estimated at $5,800 for a family living in rented accommodation in both locations and $13,500 for a family selling a house in Port Augusta and buying in Parkeston/Kal goorl ic. Cash Transaction Reports Agency (Question No. 808) Mr Filing asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 9 May 1991: Is it the practice of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency to reveal the name of the financial institution originating a suspect transaction report to the person who is the subject of that report. Mr Dutfy-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. The secrecy provisions of the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 (""the CTR Act"") prohibit the Agency from diVUlging to any person, except for the purposes of the Act, information obtained undcr the Act. Under the CTR Act only the Australian Taxation Office has a statutory entitlement to access to CTR information. The Drivcrs Guards Director of the Agency may also grant access to Total Average* Total CTR information to the Australian Customs used Service and to specified Commonwealth and State 2 12 law enforcement agencies. The purposes for which 4 24 these agencies may disclose that information is 3 12 also restricted. Victorian Public Transport Corporation (Question No. 812) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 14 May 1991: Is the Victorian Government charging the Victorian State road authority rent to support Victoria's Public Transport Corporation; if so, (a) what sum has been charged (i) each year since 1983 and (ii) since June 1990 and (b) has Federal road funding provided to the Victorian State road authority been used to pay the Public Transport Corporation contrary to the provisions of Federal land transport financial assistance legislation. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The internal operations of the Victorian Statc road authority and the Victorian Public Transport Corporation in matters not related to Federal land transport funding are properly the rcsponsibility of the Victorian Government. I would suggest that the honourable member direct his question to the Minister for Transport in Victoria, the Hon Peter Spyker MLA. (b) No. Payments of Federal road funds to the State Road Authorities are made in respect of specifically approved projects or programs for the construction and maintenance of roads. The State Auditor-General is required to provide an annual statcment that the paym-nts have been applied in accordance with the requirements of the Federal land transport financial assistance legislation. Curriculum Mapping (Question No. 817) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 15 May 1991: (I) In which curriculum areas has national mapping been completed under the national curriculum mapping exercise. (2) Have parcnts and teachers been consulted conccrning curriculum mapping; if so, by whom and on what occasions. (3) Arc parents and teachers being consulted about draft curriculum statements; if so, by whom. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Mapping has becn completed for the General Curriculum, Mathematics, Science, Technology and English. (2) The Commonwcalth government has not consulted parents and teachers concerning curriculum mapping. The mapping exercise involves the collcction and analysis of curriculum documents rclevant to the curriculum area under examination and prepared by State/Territory education authorities. A survey instrument is developed by the Project Team to obtain relevant information from State/Territory education authorities. Each Commonwealth, State and Territory representative on the National Reference Group for the project consults in their State/ Territory, as they deem appropriate, on the format of the survey instrument and the topics covcred in it. The Commonwealth does not manage a school system and does not therefore complete the survey instrument; the Commonwealth representative on the Project Reference Group consults with relevant Commonwealth government agencics and the major non-government education bodies at the national level in' the development of the instrument. Consultation with parent and teacher bodies may have occurred at State and Territory level, but responsibility for such consultation rests with State/Territory Reference Group mcmbers. The curriculum map provides one input into the development of the statement of common curriculum principles in the curriculum area under investigation. (3) Yes. The second phase of national curriculum activity, the development of nationally agreed curriculum statements, requires wide-ranging consultation with government and nongovernment agencics including parent and teacher bodies. As indicated above, consultation with these bodies is by means of a National Reference Group established for each curriculum project. In keeping with the collaborative nature of these initiatives, responsibility for ongoing consultation with parent and teacher groups and other agencies rests with Refercnce Group members. In addition, the Commonwealth is making available funding to enable the Australian Mathematics Teachers Association, the Australian Science Teachers Association and the Australian Literacy Federation to assist in the development, promotion and dissemination of curriculum statements in their respective subject areas. Lake Jindabyne Water Quality (Question No. 820) Mr MACKel1ar asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on IS May 1991: Did the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority conduct a pilot study in 1989 into the water quality of Lake Jindabyne; if so, (a) did that study result in the establishment of a more permanent monitoring program, (b) were the findings of the pilot study concerning the nature of Lake Jindabyne's water quality problems confirmed, (c) what water quality problems were detected and (d) what remedial action is being taken.",132
159,Mr GRIFFITHS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A joint pilot study was carried out with the New South Wales Department of Water Resources to determine the level of nutrients in the watcr of Lake Jindabync in 1989. (a) Yes: The pilot study established the procedures to be followcd in the main three-ycar study of Lake Jindabync water quality which is due for completion in June 1992 by the Authority and the Department of Water Resources. (b) Yes: A progress report from the main three year study in May 1991 has confirmed the problems idcntified by the pilot study. The findings of the pilot study also rcinforced those earlier water quality study undertaken 1980 and 1986. (c) The following water quality problems were detected: - high nutrient levels in the water (phosphorus and nitrogen) able to support Canadian wced which is evident around the perimeter of the lake to a depth of 2-3 metres and occasional algal blooms; - depleted oxygen levels with depth (that not support the fish population) as the lake lows: stratifies during summer. (d) Rcmedial action being taken relates to: - continuation of the main water quality study to establish the source and levels entering the lake. Preliminary indications are that most of the nutrient inflow to Lake Jindabyne is from the Crackenback and Moto wamba Rivers (of the order of 70% and 20% respectively). Phosphorus is the most signifance icant nutrient. The Authority will have tributed $273,500 when the Lake Jindabyne water quality study is completed in June 1992; - the NSW Department of Water Resources as a member of the Upper Snowy River care Group has recently commenced a 12 month pilot study of monitoring the Snowy River upstream and downstream of Lake Jindabyne. The aims of the study are assess the impact of tourism in the upper catchment, identify the main sources of trients and to assess appropriate catchment management options for reducing water quality problems. The Authority is assisting with the sampling programme; - in 1989 the Authority proposed a regional solution to sewerage effluent disposal as a means of improving water quality in the rivers and streams of the region. This the formation of a Kosciusko regional sewerage strategy interdepartmental party headed by the State Pollution Control Commission of NSW (SPCC) and the NSW Public Works Department is currently unsteps dertaking a feasibility study of land disposal options as an alternative to disposing of dabyne town sewage effluent to the Snowy River downstream of Jindabyne dam; - advice to Water Quality committees (answering to the New South Wales Ministers for Planning and for Agriculture and Rural Affairs) of deteriorating water quality, so that these issues are considered during planning approval stages of new developments. Austudy (Question No. 833) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Higher of an Education and Employment Services, between upon notice, on 16 May 1991: Did the Government introduce new rules in 1991 to reduce the Austudy allowance of a married student by $1 for every $2 in excess of $12 150 earned by the student's spouse; if so, (a) pond why were the rules introduced, and (b) do the rules disadvantage married persons who wish to also better themselves through higher education. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the canhonourable member's question is as folThe spouse income test threshold has been lowered from $18150 to $12150 for 1991. A student's allowance is reduced by $1 for every $2 of nutrients over $12 150 earned by a spouse. (a) The reduction in the spouse income test threshold from $18150 to $12 150 has been made bring Austudy conditions closer to those available to the unemployed and to ensure that assistis directed to students most in need. In conprevious years the levcl of the spouse income threshold has been the same as that for the income of parents of dependent students. It is reasonable to assume that a student would have more access to a spouse's income for their perLandsonal needs than to a parent's income. (b) Even after the reduction of the spouse income threshold to $12150, the income test for married Austudy recipients continues to be far to more lenient than the income test for married unemployment benefit recipients. A studcnt's nuspouse can cam up to $ [2 150 in the prcvious financial year and the student can earn up to $4 000 in the calendar year of study before the student's Austudy entitlement is reduced. ILO Conventions (Question No. 853) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representled to ing the Minister for Industrial Relations, working upon notice, on 29 May 1991: Further to the answer to question No. 173 (Hansard, 7 November 1990, page 3506), what have been taken towards ratifying (a) ILO Convention No. 151-Labour Relations (Public JinService), 1978 and (b) ILO Convention-No. 155 Occupational Safety and Health, 1981, to both of which the Prime Minister referred in his address to the International Labour Conference in Geneva on 10 June 1983.",133
160,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: As mentioned in the response to the honourable member's previous question on this issue, Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers of Labour have recently conducted a review of the arrangements governing the selection of ILO Conventions as priority targets for ratification by Australia. Following this review, nine Conventions have been selected for priority consideration and Convention No. 151 Labour Relations (Public Service), 1978, and Convention No. 155 Occupational Safety and Health, 1981, have both been included in this priority list. I believe that the establishment of this priority list of nine, in conjunction with other related processes, will result in an acceleration in the pace of consideration and ratification of ILO Conventions by Australia. In recent times there has been some progress made towards achieving compliance with the provisions of these two Conventions, including, in relation to Convention No. 155, through the enactment of the Commonwealth's Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act, 1991, and Queensland's Workplace Health and Safety Act 1989-90, but a number of impediments still remain in the law and practice of both the Commonwealth and State and Territory governments. These outstanding issues are currently being examined by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to allow Australia to ratify the Conventions as soon as full compliance is achieved. GATT: Federal Clause (Question No. 854) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, upon notice, on 29 May 1991: (1) Which contracting parties other than Australia have resorted to the federal clause (Article XXIV:12) in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. (2) On which occasions since 1981 has Australia resorted to the clause.",135
161,Dr BLEWETT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The GATT does not specify the means by which contracting parties are required to seek observance of their GATT obligations by the subcentral authorities within their territories. In practice, the measures of subcentral authorities are only examined for GATT consistency in the event of a formal complaint under GATT dispute settlement procedures. A GATT panel established to examine a complaint must first examine the measures against specific GATT obligations set down in various GATT Articles. If the measures are found to be inconsistent with any of these obligations, the contracting party concerned would need to demonstrate to the panel that it had taken such reasonable measures available to it to ensure observance. It is for the panel to determine whether reasonable measures have been taken. There have been only two GATT panels in which a contracting party has sought to defend the otherwise GATT inconsistent actions of its sub central authorities on the grounds that it had taken such reasonable measures available to it to ensure observance of GATT obligations. Both cases involved Canada. The answers to your question are therefore: (1) Canada (2) none. Bellarine Youth Network (Question No. 865)",135
162,Mr MCARTHUR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 30 May 1991: What grants has the Government made to the Bellarine Youth Network in 1990-91 and with respect to each grant what is the (a) sum, (b) program under which it was made (c) purpose stated by the Bellarine Youth Network in its application. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Bellarine Youth Network is not funded under any program administered by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. Air Traffic Control (Question No. 869) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 30 May 1991: (1) Does the proposed New Zealand air traffic control system involve three centres but the proposed new system for Australia only two; if so, why. (2) Will an Australian air traffic control system based on two centres result in a transfer of jobs from Western Australia to the eastern States. (3) To what extent is the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) under Government control. (4) To what extent arc the views of the general aviation industry taken into account with respect to the full cost recovery procedures of the CAA.",135
163,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: (1) The New Zealand air traffic system involves three control centres; two civil area approach control ccntres at Auckland and Christchurch and one military approach control unit at Ohakea. New Zealand also has four radar equipped control towers (one remotc from the three centres) and 18 other non-radar equipped control towers; 15 civil (including joint military/ civil towers) and three military towers. The current Australian air traffic control system has five Air Traffic Service Centres, three Civil Approach Control Units, eight Military Approach Control Units, two Civil/Military Area and Approach Control Centrcs; and 3 I Control Towers - the charges proposed for air traffic and regThe Civil Aviation Authority'S (CAA) proposal for the Australian air traffic control system after 1995 has two possible different configurations, depending on decisions yet to be finalised: (a) Two civil centres with consolidated Terminal Control Units (TCUs). (b) Two civil centres providing all area (enroute) and terminal area traffic services with distributed TCU s. Control towers will exist where they arc operationally and economically justified. The CAA considers that there are significant efficiencies to be achieved through consolidation of the number of locations from which services are provided. Provision of services from one centre, while technically feasible, is not considered to provide appropriate disaster recovery capabilities. (2) Yes. As a result of establishing the proposed centres in Brisbane and Melbourne, the CAA will require less staff based in Western Australia.
