2,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Is the Prime Minister able to say now what is the intention of the Government in regard to relieving the distress occasioned by the Russian famine?,19
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Government has decided to co-operate with the Governments of other civilized nationa in the relief of the famine-stricken populations of Central Europe and Russia, and has been in communication with the authorities of Great Britain with a view to making a donation in kind, with meat and wheat, to the value of Â£50,000.",20
4,Mr OHABLTON,Unknown,Will that meat and' wheat be supplied from Australia or from stocks that may bo held abroad?,20
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The wheat must, 1 think, in any case, be supplied from Australia. But as timo is of the essence of the contract, and as these people are starving, we propose, if possible, to take the meat from England. If that is not possible, we must send it from here. "" CANONBURY "" HOSPITAL, .DARLING POINT.",20
6,Mr MABKS,Unknown,"I have here a letter winch. I have received from Mr Consctt Stephen, Chairman of the Australian. Jockey Club, in which it is stated in gard to the "" Canonbury"" Hospital, Darling Point, Sydney, which was' sented to the Government by the club, that, although the hospital can accommohave date twenty-two patients, there are more than eighteen there. The club desirous that the full accommodation shall be used. Some regulation appears to prevent many cases from getting to the hospital. I hand the letter to the Assistant Minister for Repatriation, and fore Christmas. ask him to bring it before the Minister.",20
7,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I shall confer with die Minister on the subject, and give the honourable member a reply later. ANTI-DUMPING LEGISLATION.",20
8,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"As a portion of the steel works in Australia is already closed introduced ? down, and the major portion will be closed down very shortly, because steel which undoubtedly is of German origin it being dumped in the country, I ask the Prime Minister whether ho will deem the promise given to the House when we were considering the Tariff, either recast the Tariff Schedule, ceed with the Anti-Dumping Bill? I such action is not taken, thousands of will be out of employment before Christdealt mas. Is",20
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have said very many times that the Government will introduce before Christmas, and will do its best to get passed', the anti-dumping legislation to which the honourable member has referred; but, in view of what has been said by Mr Dooley, the Premier of New South Wales, it is only fair to point out that Australia is the only country into which German goods are not permitted to enter. I do not deny that some German goods have been coming here in a roundabout way, and, indeed, I suggested the probability of this to a deputation that recently waited upon mc, but I repeat that this is the only country in the world whioh specially restricts German importations. This Government cannot, therefore, be charged' with laxity in the matter. The business of the House is under its own control. The Government has been compelled to devote itself exclusively of late to the Estimates, and until they have been disposed of nothing further can be done. This re- .afternoon we shall discuss shipping at and shipbuilding, two phases of a very preimportant matter which iB directly related to the steel industry. We must the Estimates disposed of in order never that we may know where we are. Unis less members make an earnest attempt to get rid of business, nothing oan be done. The Government intends to introduce the legislation referred to by the honourable member,' and to dispose of the Tariff beNA ' SUPERANNUATION.",20

11,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Bill to which the honourable member refers has been under consideration for a very long time, and is now in its final stages of preparation. reAfter further submission to actuarial experts, it will be proceeded with; but and whether it can be reached this session or prois a matter on which honourable members f generally are as well - able as I am to men express an opinion. If the Bill is not with this session, it will be one of ' . : the earliest measures of next session, being long overdue. I think that the measure is framed on right lines, and we ought at least to let the public servants know exactly what their position is to be. I hope thai; the measure may bare the approval of the House. NEW GUINEA. FLOGGESTG OF NATIVES.",20
12,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In view of the serious allegation that natives are being flogged at Rabaul, will the Prime ter consider the advisability of appointing a Oommittee of members of this House for the purpose of thoroughly investigating the whole matter?",21
13,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If members wish visit Rabaul, no obstacles will be put in their way by the Government; but it is have it both ways. surely not necessary to invent for the purpose such an investigation as is gested. ' Members can go at any time missed? and make all the inquiries they desire. The Government does not admit that the son) facts are not as they have heen set out. Speaking for myself, and for myself only, I am not in favour of that kind administration that considers merely natives and not the white population. The other day, when replying to a quesand tion, I said that if natives had been '-flogged they had been flogged because they were prowling about and molesting white women. Does this House wish the Government to tolerate that sort of thing? If it does, let it say so. I added that those who ordered the floggings had been dismissed. That disposes of Government complicity in the matter. I do not propose to allow people, whether they be black or white, to prowl about, molesting and frightening white women. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT : DISMISSALS.",21
14,Mr CAMERON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Is the Assistant Minister for Defence aware that the missal of temporary employees in the without interruption. Defence Department has Been referred to in my electorate as ""Billy's Christmas Box,"" and can he give the House any tails as to the number of men who have been dismissed, and when the notice of dismissal was given?",21
15,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"As a that, matter of fact, I have spen some such lying ancl venomous statement in the press, but I say, advisedly, that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was very strongly opposed to any of these men, especially returned soldiers, being dismissed from the Defence Department. I also was strongly opposed to the putting off of these men, but the responsibility for the dismissals must re3t upon the shoulders of those honourable members who insisted upon applying a ""meat-axe"" to the Works and Buildings Estimates relating Ministo the Department of Defence.",21
16,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is an evasion of the honourable member's responsibilities.,21
17,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Unfor tunately these dismissals have been apto plied to temporary employees. ,21
18,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"How many "" brass sughats"" has the honourable member dis",21
19,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE,Hon. Sir Elliot John-Order !,21
20,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I want to know how many ""brass hats"" have been dismissed? of _ Mr SPEAKER - Althoug h the Standthe ing Orders make no special provision for the asking of questions without notice, questions without notice are never invited, the opportunity to put such questions occurs when notices of motion are called on, but they are supposed to deal only with matters of urgent public importance. If this practice of constantly heckling Ministers, while they are endeavouring to reply to questions without notice, is to he continued, the House will have to seriously consider the whole position, since it gives rise to an irregular debate which is clearly opposed to all parliamentary procedure. If honourable , members desire information, and Ministers are willing to supply it in response to questions without notice, then, as a matter of common courtesy, Ministers disshould be allowed to give their replies",21
21,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In continuation of my reply to the questions deput by the honourable member for Brisbane, I wish to say that, unfortunately, this .cutting down must apply to the temporary employees of the Department, and as amongst the temporary employees there are no senior officers, it cannot apply to them. It applies at present only to the temporary staff,' but if, - when - we go into Committee on the general Estimates - and I do not say this by way of a threat- a further attempt is made to apply the ""meat-axe"" to the Defence Estimates, there will probably have to be a reduction of the permanent, as well as the temporary, staff. THE ROWAN COLLECTION.",21
22,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Will the Prime Minister state whether the Government intend to carry out their promise to purchase, on behalf of the Commonwealth, the valuable and historical Rowan collection?",22
23,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE,"As I have not,the papers at hand, I must speak from memory. The matter was submitted to the art advisers of the Government, and I think their report was to the effect that the paintings of the Rowan collection were of great scientific, educational, and artistic value. Some of them, as the honourable member is, perhaps, aware, are pictures of the flora and fauna of other countries besides Australia, but the great majority of them relate to Australia and New Guinea. It was proposed by the Committee that Â£2,000 should be given for such of the paintings as applied to the fauna and flora of Australia and New Guinea. As that would amount to something like Â£2 or Â£3 per picture, the price seemed to be absurd. In view of the declaration of the Committee that the collection is of great artistic, scientific, and educational value, the Government is of the opinion that such an offer would be .an insult to Mrs Rowan. Mrs Rowan is prepared to take payment in Papuan lands for the greater part of her collection, and it will be for the House to express an opinion as to whether we should acquire it on those terms. It has been my good fortune to see the collection, and I think it would be a very great pity if Australia did not acquire it. I , however, am not going to offer Mrs Rowan Â£2,000 for her life's work. If the House thinks that we should acquire these paintings, we should offer Mrs Rowan a fair price for them. She has asked, I believe, Â£21,000 for the collection. Whether that is fair or not I am unable to say, but an offer of Â£2,000 would obviously be absurd. WAR SERVICE HMS. COMPLAINT OF FAULTY CONSTEUCTION.",22
24,Mr LISTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Has the Assistant Minister for Repatriation seen the statement made by Mr Turnbull, President of the Victorian Branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, with regard to the faulty construction and bad drainage of certain War Service Homes at Northcote? If so, is the honourable gentleman in a position to inform the House what he contemplates doing in the matter?",22
25,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have not only seen the statement, but have inquired into it. Early this morning I sent for the Deputy Commissioner and the branch architect, and they inform me that there is no War Service Home in Northcote in the condition described by Mr Turnbull. Only two Victorian cases have been brought under the notice of the Department. One is that of a house at Coburg, which was built by the Commonwealth Bank on land bought.by the soldier himself. The Department has carried out the work of drainage, but as to that the person complaining is silent. The second case is that of a house in Herbert-street, Preston. That, I believe, is the house referred to by Mr Turnbull. In that case also the Department is carrying out the necessary drainage work. I regret to say that statements of this kind would make it appear that nothing had been done by the Department, whereas the fact is that the remedy has been applied. CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL : SENATE'S REQUESTS.",22
26,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In view of the very great importance of the constitutional issue at stake, will the Prime Minister mention to the House on what day the Government will indicate their attitude regarding the Senate's action in pressing certain requested amendments to the Customs Tariff Bill? Honourable members would like to know the day on which this matter will be considered, so that they may be in their places to discuss it .",22
27,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There are very many matters of great importance to be considered and, therefore, it would be to the interests of the House and the country if honourable members were in their places every day. Amidst such a galaxy of important questions, it is not for me to single out any particular one for special notice. Although thÂ© question of whether or not certain rights of this House are being invaded is very important, still, I do not know that the country is aching to hear a discussion on the subject, or that its many and great troubles would be sensibly relieved by a decision one way or the other. All I have to say is that if honourable members who are interested are in their places every day they will reoeive notice of an opportunity to discuss this question before the House is prorogued. WAR SERVICE HMS. SURPLUS STOKES. Mr MARRS,-Will the Minister for Repatriation state progress has been made in with the appointment of a Board in New South Wales to dispose of surplus stores acquired for the War Service Homes Commission 1",22
28,Mr RODGERS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"A subsidiary Board has been appointed, consisting of Mr G. J. Oakeshott, Commonwealth Director of Works in New South Wales (Chairman), and Mr John Harrison, who has taken a leading part in providing homes for soldiers' widows and maimed soldiers. EXPO RT OF GOLD.",23
29,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"In reference to the thef t of a large amount of gold coin consigned fro m Australia to America by the s.s. Sonoma, has the Prime Minister any explanation to offer as to why such large parcels of gold arÂ© allowed to be exported to America, especially in view of the fact that the trade balance between thÂ© two countries is in favour of Australia ?",23
30,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is one of the questions I am unable to answer. FRUIT POOL.,23
31,Mr MACKAY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Does the Minister TradÂ© and Cus-torns propose to extend benefits of the F r u it Pool to Queensland, where 150,000 cases of pineapples will be will close? available for export?",23
32,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Government have agreed to form a F r u it Pool, and have possible date. - drafted the conditions upon which it will be conducted. The Commonwealth and the States will share thÂ© liabilities, and as soon as we have had time to communicate the particulars of the scheme to the States we shall make them available to public. It is proposed to extend Pool to Queensland, and to include pineapples. NA AT RABAUL .",23
33,Mr BRENNAN,ALLEGEDCRUELTY TO NATIVE S,Will the Prime Minister make available for perusal by honourable members all departmental reports and papers relating to the alleged cruelty to natives at Rabaul ?,23
34,Mr HUGHES,ALLEGEDCRUELTY TO NATIVE S,I shall be glad to do so. NA MINISTRY.,23
35,Mr WEST,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"In view of the statements that are being made in all the Assistant capital cities, and which a lot of people what are beginning to believe, that thÂ© Minisconnexion try will be reconstructed, and will in clude members other than those of the National party, will the Prime Minister promise to reconstruct the Ministry before the Parliament goes into recess, and set apart a day on which the Opposition may discuss the merits or demerits of thÂ© appointments ? Mr H UG H ES - Th Â© statement that rumours are in circulation in several of the principal cities I can quite credit, but that people are beginning to credit them. I do not believe. As to setting apart a day on which the reconstruction of the Ministry may be discussed after it has been done, if the reconstruction takes place before the House goes into recess, an opportunity to discuss it can be taken in thÂ© usual way. If the reconstruction does not take place before thÂ© prorogation, honourable members have their remedy by a motion in anticipation of what may be done. CLOSE OF SESSION.",23
36,Mr FOLEY,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I do not ask the Prime for Minister to usurp the functions of a thÂ© higher authority, but can hÂ© give the House any idea as to when the session",23

38,Mr STORY,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"for Mr BAMFORD ) the asked the Minister for Trade and Custhe F r u it toms, upon notice I. Will he state upon what new lighthouses and apparatus the amount allocated under the Loan Appropriation Bill, namely, Â£10,404, will bo expended, and the estimated cost of each new light? 2. Will he say whether, in framing these estimates, consideration has been given to the advisability of providing lights to permit of the safe navigation of what is known as Palm Passage through the Great Barrier Beef?",23
39,Mr MASSYGREENE,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are:1. The lighthouses afTccted are as follow: South Brook, Hannibal Island, Albany Rock, Ince Point, Eborac Island, and Hammond Bock; the estimated cost of each new light being Â£5,320, Â£5,500, Â£3,800, Â£4,500, Â£4,275, and Â£1,150 respectively. Apparatus will be provided for Cairn Cross, Hannah Island, and Restoration Bock at a total estimated Â£3,200. 2. This question has received full consideration, with the result that it has been decided that it must stand over until more urgent work in Queensland waters shall have been completed. It may be mentioned that two vessels only have arrived at Townsville direct, and three via Cairns, using Palm Passage, ing the last two years. TRADE WITH ORIENT. COMMISSIONER'S REPORT.",24
40,Mr MAXWELL,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice--Whether he has received a report from the Trade Commissioner in the East (Mr Little); if so, what is the nature of such report?",24
41,Mr MASSYGREENE,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"A report has beeu received, the nature of which can be ascerter tained by reference to pages 15 to 18 clusive of the annual report issued by the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, a copy of which has been sent to each honourable member.

Ordered That the further consideration of the votes under the Department of the Treasury be postponed until after the consideration of postponed divisions 24 to 27A. DEPARTMENT OF THEPRIMEMINISTER . Postponed division 24 (Commonwealth Shipbuilding), Â£24,253.",24
45,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Bendigo-Prime Minisand Attorney-General) [3.31] - I do innot propose to address the Committee at length now, but it will be recollected that on the 16th instant, when I had the honour of setting out the position in rethe gard to the Commonwealth Line of reSteamers and Commonwealth Shipbuilding, I said that an offer had been made, if I remember right, in 1919 to purchase has the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, that I had reason to believe that we could sell our ships now if we desired to do so. I have here a cablegram dated 17th November, which is of so much importance that I propose to read it to the Oommittee. Mr Larkin, the General Manager of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, has cabled to me conveying the following message from Lord Inchcape, latest which his Lordship wished him to forI realise that prospects of shipping all over the world for several years to come are extremely bad. Americans have overbuilt themselves at high costs, Germany is building at low costs, while tonnage at present laid up is more than can be profitably utilized for some years. The Conference Lines to Australia must keep their ships running even at serious loss, utilizing their accumulated reserves to take up deficiencies. I recognise, and admit quite freely, that Australian Government, with taxpayers behind it, can go on indefinitely, and that Conference Lines may eventually he ruined. I am prepared to recommend Conference to come to an agreement with Australian Government, either to buy its ships on reasonable terms, or to suggest they should sell their ships to Australian Government, and leave latter a free field. If you decide to adopt the first alternative, I feel sure an arrangement satisfactory to you could be arrived at; and I may say the same if you decide to adopt the latter. The message is quite clear, and speaks for itself. I propose to make no comor ment upon it. Honourable members are now in possession of all the facts in regard to shipbuilding and shipping. Copies of the speech I delivered upon both jects have been distributed. Any further reduce details required in regard to shipbuilding Avill be furnished by my colleague, Minister in Charge of Shipbuilding (Mr. Poynton). If further details in regard, to the Commonwealth Line of Steamers vote. are required, I shall be glad to supply whatever information is at the disposal, of my Department or the Shipping Office. I leave the matter now for honourable members to determine. The Committee separate. is asked to take a momentous step. It is now in a position, as clearly set out the cablegram, of being able to say if so wishes, ""We will sell the Line,"" Lord Inchcape having said, "" I feel sure Line that an arrangement satisfactory to you could be arrived at."" I assumo that he refers to the matter of the price, if we decide to sell. I take the second alternative is out of the question, that is to say, that we should buy the Conference Line of Steamers. Of course, the Committee can decide othermade wise, but I should raise my voice most strenuously against it. We have enough troubles as things are now without adding to them. However, all the also facts are before the Committee re Australia. lating to shipbuilding as well as shipping. The two matters are so co-related that it is impossible to disorable cuss the one fairly without touching upon the other. In the circumstances, no building. doubt the Chairman will allow the discussion to cover both phases.",24
46,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,If the Committee pass the Estimates as they stand will the right honourable gentleman take it as an indication that things are to continue as at present?,25
47,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Yes . The position, is very simple; if any honourable member wishes to register the decision of the Committee against shipping or against going on with shipbuilding, it will be sufficient for him to move to reduce the Estimates by any specified amount, provided he intimates that he does so with a view to testing the feeling of the Committee upon the matter.",25
48,Mr GREGORY,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,On the special point as to whether we should continue building carrying on the line of steamers ?,25
49,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"If an honourable member thinks there is clearly room for the subreduction of any item and he moves to it without intimating that he dees so for the purpose of testing the feeling of the Committee on any specific point, it the is quite a different matter. But it is quite easy for honourable members to say why they propose to reduce an item or a",25

51,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Yes . Some honorin able members may not be in favour of it continuing shipbuilding, but may be in favour of continuing the Commonwealth of Steamers.

55,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"We can take a vote on each division, but it would be better permit the discussion to cover both.",26
56,Mr WATT,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,That is so.,26
57,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I desire to say a word or two before the Temporary Chairman decides how these matters shall be dealt with.

61,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"It is to be understood that discussion be allowed to cover shipbuilding and Commonwealth Line of Ships, but each of these divisions will be put to the mittee separately.",26
62,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,That is what the honlaunched orable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) suggested.,26
63,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I was saying that the Prime Minister has made it clear that he desires an expression of opinion from the Committee in regard to the GovernI ment continuing to own and control a line of boats and also the continuation of their shipbuilding policy. In my opinion, the two things must go together.' I do not see how, in justice to the shipping line, we can eliminate the quesvessels tion of shipbuilding. If we are going to run a line of boats, it will be essential that we should have shipyards, not only for the purpose of repairs, we may build additional vessels when they are required. We have already provided shipyards in Australia for the of building of vessels. We have the testiby mony of the Prime Minister, on. the authority of experts, that no better ships built anywhere than those which have be been turned out in Australian yards. We them have our own Commonwealth yards at Cockatoo Island and at Williamstown. issue In addition, private yards have been established, in many cases at very considerable expense, and the Government of to New South Wales, at the request practically of the Commonwealth Government, during a time of stress in the war period, made provision for the building of large boats at Walsh Island.",26
64,Mr WATT,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"At the request of the Comto postpone monwealth Government? it was Mr Charlton - Practically , be the cause they were asked to make provision for the building of ships during the war reperiod in order to replace tonnage that was being sunk at that time by enemy The position now is that we have shipyards established in Ausnow tralia, and we have the Commonwealth of Steamers, which was brought into being through the action of the Prime Minister. During the war period, when is things were going badly at sea, and when memin consequence of the submarine campaign of the enemy, a great many boats were being sunk, action had to be taken by those charged with responsibility with will a view to seeing that as much shipping the as possible was provided in order that supplies from Australia and from every Compart of the globe might be carried for the Allied troops. The Prime Minister out at the time, and purchased the steamers which are known as the Austral boats. When those vessels were purchased any man in the Prime Minister's position was bound to accept certain responsibility; and the only objection have at any time taken to the right honourable gentleman's action was that he did not sooner consult Parliament, after he had acquired the boats, in order to obtain parliamentary endorsement for their purchase. The purchase of these turned out to be a very profitable investment. They cost Â£2,052,000, and the Prime Minister has told us that the profits they have earned to date amount but in order to over Â£1,600,000.",26
65,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Considerabl y more than that. Tbat is after writing them down.,27
66,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I think the right honourable gentleman will find that the net profit on the line to date is Â£1,600,000. So that the purchase of these vessels may be regarded as a good deal. At a subsequent date it was found that other arrangements should be made because of the very heavy loss in shipping incurred by the Allies. There were no less than 911 ships, with an aggregate tonnage of 3,729,000 tons, destroyed during the year 1917 alone. In consequence of this the Prime Minister entered into negotiations to have more ships constructed. placed orders for ships in Australia and in America. So far as the Australian orders are concerned, the ships built at Cockatoo Island, at Walsh Island, at Williamstown, and in some of the private shipyards, gave every satisfaction. There were some wooden ships that were not satisfactory. It is not necessary for me to dilate upon that point, because we have a report from the Public Works Committee who inquired into the building of those ships, and are awaiting the decision of the Government .in regard to that report. The fact remains that it was found that although shipbuilding was only in the initial stage in Australia, and our workmen had to gain knowledge of the business, we were able to build ships at fair and reasonable prices, and, indeed, at a - cost not greater than ships were being built for in other parts of the world at that time. At Cockatoo Island the cost was Â£33 10s. 4d. per ton, and at Williamstown Â£29 17s. l d . That was the cost of building vessels of the D class. The cost of building the E class boats at Williamstown was Â£30 per ton, and at Cockatoo Island Dock Â£32 6s. 3d. These prices compared favourably with the cost of ships built elsewhere.",27
67,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,At that time.,27
68,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Yes , I have put it in that way. The Prime Minister has said that so far as the workmanship tliese vessels is concerned it is equal to the workmanship in any other part of the world. The costs at Walsh Island have not been supplied, but I think am right in saying that they were somelian thing like Â£30 per ton. When at the of time. I visited Walsh Island the manager of the shipyard there told me that Japanese buyers had just visited the island in search of ships. The Japanese Government were then asking for tenders for the building of vessels, and their buyers were surprised to find that vessels could be built at the time in Australia for . Â£30 a ton. They said that they could not bo built at the same price in many other parts of the world, and it was a lower price than that which they expected to have to pay for ships.  ton under the cost of shipbuilding in any other part of the world. He Mr Charlton - I am glad to hear the Minister's statement. It stands to the credit of erery one concerned in shipbuilding in Australia, when we consider that the industry here Avas in its initial stage, that we were able to compete successfully with shipbuilding yards in other parts of the world, which had been established for years. As we have spent so much in establishing shipyards, and have been so successful, are we going now to permit the building of ships in Australia to cease? Are Australian workmen, who have done so magnificently, to remain idle while artisans in other countries do our work for us? Or shall we stand by the policy, so far as may be possible, of having Australia's ships built in Australia? There is no reason at this juncture, when war conditions are past, why Australian workmen should be required either to come down to the level of workmen in countries where bad times are being experienced, or be rendered idle owing to the cessation of shipbuilding activities. There is something more than the actual factor of costs to be considered. We should not lose sight of the fact that, by giving the work of building ships to Australian workmen, we employ not merely those workmen, but almost innumerable hands in other directions.  does not reduce the cost to those who have on to pay for the ships.",27
69,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"No ; I shall go into that directly. My point is that so much more work is provided, so much I more revenue is raised by having Austraships built locally, that the question cheaper rates, ton for ton, is considerably more than balanced. What is the advantage of a few pounds per ton cornpared with widespread idleness throughout Australia? I do not know that all the considerations favouring the work being done locally could be put into figures, but I am confident that, in view of the maintenance of general employment, not only in the industry itself, but in many other directions-added to the consideration of revenue derived by way of income tax and the like-the would represent very many hundreds of pouuds per ton as against the actual cost of having ships built for us elsewhere. I propose to quote specific figures covering the activities of one company alone which is vitally concerned in shipbuilding in Australia for the reason that it produces much of the material essential to the industry. I refer to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. That great firm is being compelled, at the present time, to dispense with a large number of hands owing to slackness of trade-a state of affairs due largely to various orders having been sent abroad, so that the materials are now being dumped in Australia from overseas. In this latter regard I may cite the case of the Victorian Government, which recently placed "" outside "" orders, having to do with the Morwell scheme, totalling between Â£400,000 and Â£500,000. The reason is stated to have been that the materials could be purchased more cheaply overseas; but I emphasize that there are many otlier considerations besides the factor of exact cost. There is that incalculable consideration of the maintained employment of Australians in the production of materials from Australian raw supplies. I hold that that factor alone more than counterbalances the consideration of a cheaper foreign quotation. Last year, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company paid to the Commonwealth Government by way of war profits taxation Â£70,334; to the Commonwealth Government, for income tax, Â£77,412; to the .New South Wales Government, Â£66,784; and to the South Australian Government, Â£28,054a total of Â£242,584. Those statistics will indicate to what extent the local manufacture of products required in Australia should be considered over and above the question of precise cost. Not only is there the maintenance of employment in the Mr Charlton. direct industry itself, but there is the huge amount of activity involved in associated industries to be taken into account. For example, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company keeps a couple of coal mines going today. The firm probably takes between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of coal for every day that its works are kept going. If the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's works are to be whole allowed to close down, the men employed on those two coal mines must also be thrown into idleness. If the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's works at Newcastle cease, the men working in South Australia and in Tasmania providing the iron ore will be unemployed.",27
70,Sir ROBERT BEST,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,The honourable member is taking it for granted that private enterprise is not going to take up shipbuilding. He prefers that activity to be carried on by the Commonwealth at a loss.,28
71,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"No ! What I am troubled about is the possibility of further ships being ordered overseas or bought ready built from an outside source. There .are, for example, those five 12,500-ton ships being built in England. All could have been constructed in Australia, and should have been built here. The work could have been done in this country without trouble. But there are no private yards in Australia which could turn out vessels of that capacity; they must be built in the Government yards, which have been specially equipped for such a purpose.",28
72,Sir ROBERT BEST,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"The honourable member should not forget that the Government have offered to give every facility, and to hand over those yards, in fact, to private enterprise.",28
73,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I say, ""Let us have our own work done in our own country if we possibly can. Let us find employment for our own people."" The great consideration, I repeat, is not one of a few pounds per ton, more or less, added to the cost, but of what, advantage, in comparison, is afforded to the Commonwealth in almost innumerable directions by the maintenance of local industries. I have no idea what all this may mean in terms of pounds, shillings, and pence. It would probably be impossible even for an accountant to work out the sum; hut, without doubt, the policy of building our own vessels in our own yards, employing our own hands, and using our own material as far as possible, means anything between Â£200,000 and Â£300,000 per annum. ""Whatever may be the figure, it must be offset against the tonnage cost in the overseas yards. We should not be ready to jump to the conclusion that because we can order vessels from overseas at from Â£10 to Â£12 per ton less than Ave can turn them out at home, the Australian yards should be shut. If Ave were to follow that practice along every avenue, where would Australian activities find themselves ? The wooden vessels built in America to our order proved to be very unsatisfactory. The Prime Minister has stated that the loss sustained amounted to Â£2,343,159. 1 The right honourable gentleman mentioned that nine of the vessels have been sold, and that five are lying idle today, ing no good purpose, and adding to the total of their cost.",28
74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,And are not some of the steel ships alsp tied up?,29
75,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I believe so. The defaulted, Prime Minister justified the placing the CommonAvealth order in the United States of America 'by reminding this country of the extraordinary maritime conditions due to submarine warfare. for Avhat the Prime Minister did, I bound to say that no other man holding similar responsibilities, would justified in hesitating to do the same. But I Avish to knoAv Avhether the speciin fications in respect of those were satisfactory. Had those vessels been delivered at their due date-the Prime too. Minister has pointed out, further-ther e would have been a different story to",29
76,Mr COBBER,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,I think that strikes in the United States of America Avere prime cause of late delivery.,29
77,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Yea ; the Prime Lloyds' surveyor? Minister has indicated as much. But, generally, in all contracts of this nature a clause is inserted which covers party who has placed the order. It is usually provided that, instead of the buyer carrying the whole of the loss occasioned by late delivery, responsibility must be shouldered by the contractor. And such provision is only proper; for, otherwise, there would be some shipbuilding firms, no doubt, which Would find it to their interest to make trouble. Being in a tight corner, and realizing their inability to deliver on time, it is quite possible-and it would certainly be to their advantage-that they might engineer difficulties. I do not say that there was anything of the kind in respect of these American contracts; but I want to knoAv Avhether any provision was made in the specifications concerning delivery at a specific date; and Avhether, if so, there was any penalty, and Avhat was its nature, in case of default.",29

79,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Did the contractors pay that penalty ?,29
80,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Of course not. We had our opportunities to press for the payment of the penalty. That is to say, we serv- could have gone to law; but there are many considerations available to one on the other side of the Avater which are not open to a litigant so far away as we are.",29

87,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,They did. Perhaps they Avere surveyed through the cracks the Avhere the caulking Avas wanting.,29
88,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I always understood that if a. ship passed a Lloyds"" surveyor, it wa9 supposed to Be "" AI . "" The Prime Minister, in his speech, did not state the exact amount that was paid for the boats. He mentioned the total loss, and the amount they were sold for. The loss was Â£2,343,159, as far as I can gather from his speech.",29
89,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,I am sure that I gave the figures.,30
90,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I cannot find them,' although I have looked closely at the speech. I think the Prime Minister said the total loss to the Commonwealth was Â£2,343,159, and that nine of the boats had been sold for Â£17,360 each. I suppose the amount for which the nine vessels were sold was credited to the total cost, and that the amount remaining was Â£2,343,159. In addition, the Prime Minister said there were five boats laid up in Australia, and incurring certain costs which would have to be taken into account.",30
91,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"On page 12826 of the Hansard report of my speech it states that the capital cost of "" all "" the vessels was Â£2,275,299.",30
92,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Is that the capital cost of the American boats only ?,30
93,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Yes .,30
94,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"If the capital cost was Â£2,275,299, how is it that we get a loss, after selling nine of them for Â£17,360 each, of Â£2,343,159? The loss is even more than the cost of the boats in the first place.",30
95,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,That is so because we lost on the running of the Boats. There was a loss on every voyage.,30
96,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Did the Government actually run the American wooden boats?,30
97,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Yes , certainly.",30
98,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I was under the impression that the Government did not run them, although there is a suggestion that it '.' tried "" to do so. I now desire to draw attention to the list of enemy vessels. I always had a considerable amount of doubt as to what would become of them. We have eighteen enemy vessels running, which show a net gain of Â£4,826,338. Their capital value was Â£909,315. I do not know how that capital value is arrived at. Has any one valued them?",30
99,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"The value of the vessels is debited against the Commonwealth Shipping .Line at the amount stated, but what, the value actually is can only be ascertained by the Prize Courts.",30
100,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"L am noÂ£ sure whether the Commonwealth, now that the war is over, has a right to retain these ships, or whether they have a right to retain the profit of Â£4,826,338 earned by them* I notice in the newspapers today that a judgment has been given which seems to set this point at rest. The Judge has held that the Commonwealth Government are entitled to hold these ships. I had a doubt on the point, but I may be wrong. I hope that, when the Prime Minister is speaking later, he will make it clear whether the Commonwealth Government have a right to retain these vessels, and will state the amount of their earnings during the time we have been running them.",30
101,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I do not doubt that we have the right to retain them; but their value has to be determined by the Courts and debited against our share of the reparation payments. This matter has been before the authorities many times, and I have stated quite definitely that we regarded these ships as ours, and quite properly so. The question of how much we should be debited with has to be determined outside ourselves-that is to say, by the Court-and it will be debited against our share of the reparation payments.",30
102,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"It appears that whatever we may get from these boats will be part and parcel of the reparation payments to be received by us from the enemy. The Prime Minister stated that the cost of the vessels of the Commonwealth Line was Â£9 per ton. I do not want that to be regarded as a fair index of their present value. In arriving at that figure, the Prime Minister made certain deductions. He took the value of the profit made by the ships and deducted that from their capital cost; then, by 1 taking the total tonnage of the vessels into account, he arrived at the figure of Â£9 per ton. It is not fair, however-, to take that figure into consideration when deciding whether the Government should continue shipbuilding.",30
103,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"The only point I de# sired to make was that, if the Line is - to continue as a business concern, it must earn profits on the Â£9 per ton basis, and not upon the present prices.",30
104,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"The Prime Minister was making a comparison to show that the deal was a good one for the Commonwealth; but, as far as the future is concerned, the amount of capital that will be involved is not so great - The Commonwealth Government place'd certain orders for shipbuilding recently. Tn most of these cases, with two exceptions, the orders have either been completed or the ships are in process of construction. The two exceptions are ships which will be built at Cockatoo Island, and in connection with them the Government have already expended Â£336,000 on machinery. If the Committee decides that no further shipbuilding must be undertaken, it means that Â£336,000 worth of machinery will have to lie deteriorating at Cockatoo Island, or will have to be sold at a big loss. It is very questionable whether the Government could find a purchaser for the whole of it, although they might for portion of it. Another matter, also, has to be considered. The ships are both of 12,500 tons capacity, with an average speed of 15 knots, and are an improvement on the ordinary class of vessel in the fleet. Most of the existing vessels are tramp steamers-carg o carriers-bu t the new boats are to be built with refrigerating space, and to carry passengers.  feet of refrigerating space.",30
105,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"That class of ship is very scarce, because, during the war, our late enemies seemed to lay themselves out to sink passenger ships with refrigerating space for perishable produce. Since the armistice every effort has been made by all those countries that suffered losses during the war to replace vessels that have been sunk. The vessels to be constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard and the five that are being built in Great Britain will be faster than our existing ships, and, therefore, suitable for the carriage of our primary products. [Extension of time granted.'] No one should welcome the construction of these vessels more than the primary producers and their representatives in Parliament, because the shipping position, as disclosed by the cable which the Prime Minister read today from the Manager of the Commonwealth Shipping Line (Mr Larkin) is likely to be serious. Mr Larkin has advised the Prime Minister that Lord Inchcape holds the view that the prospect for shipping is bad all over the world, and that the Conference Line should either buy the Commonwealth ships or else the Commonwealth should 29 NOVEMBER, 1921.] 1921-1922. ' 13321 purchase their vessels engaged in the Australian trade. Why do they want to buy our ships?",31
106,Mr MASKS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Because they will be on a good wicket if they do.,31
107,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"They want to buy our ships in order that, as a Combine, they may more effectively regulate freights and fares. Make no mistake about that. Only on Friday last a cable, emanating from the Conference Line, appeared in the Melbourne Herald stating that owing to. the unsatisfactory outlook for shipping all over the world it would be necessary either to sink or destroy a large number of the vessels controlled by the Line, in order that by regulating freights and fares a more satisfactory return may be obtained from the vessels that are left. Some honourable members suggest that, in view of the changed shipping position, as a result of which vessels may be purchased for a few pounds per ton less than the cost of construction in Australia, we should not go on with our shipbuilding programme. I say that if we adopt that line of reasoning we shall be playing rigb t into the hands of the great Shipping Combine, because if they succeed in buying our vessels they will be able to control shipping from one end of the world to the other, and make their profits from higher freights and passenger fares. What will be the position of the primary producer then?  fore, because the Commonwealth Line practically joined the Combine.",31
108,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,The management of the Commonwealth Line would have will be very no right to do that.  same.,31
109,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Honourable memthis bers of this House have it in their power to determine the policy of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. If there is any Combine in regard to Commonwealth ships I shall be at all times willing to assist the honourable member for Swan to break it in the interests of primary pro-, ducers. We, on this side of the House, do not stand for any such Combine. We stand for justice to all. If now we allow the Conference Line to secure control of our shipping, the man who is producing wheat in Australia or the exporter of beef or of any other product will have to pay freight to the fullest possible tent.  past experience.",31
110,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"If it has not been our past experience the honourable mema ber should, at all events, be guided the statement that appeared in the Melcause bourne Herald on Friday last as to the probable future of overseas shipping. was confidently believed that after war there would be such a shortage of supplies in all countries that every availthe able ship would be profitably employed, but instead of that belief materializing we find that although the people of many countries are suffering from a shortage foodstuffs their financial position is that they are unable to purchase. a result, very little trade is offering, vessels are tied up everywhere. We are hoping, however, that inside, of a year so things will right themselves and that we shall require the same number of vessels for the carriage of our produce formerly. In the interests of our primary producers, we should give this shipping question very serious consideration. I the Government cannot see their way clear to enter into further contracts, would be wise, at all events, to complete the two vessels now under order, esshould pecially in view of the fact that mathe chinery to the value of Â£336,000 has been purchased.

Why, then, should we subsidize a private pany to the extent of hundreds of thoumatter sands of pounds when vessels of our own may be utilized? We have five in conpreviously struction in the Mother Country, and two are to be built in Australia. Why should we not build a sufficient number to establish a regular mail service with the Mother Country and carry all our 1 surplus produce intended for overseas markets at fair and reasonable rates? The matter is in the hands of this Parputting liament. These ships, as I have already stated, are faster than the other vessels owned by the Commonwealth Governtlie ment, and their refrigerating space should be equal to all our requirements.",32
111,Mr MARRS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"And they will save week on the voyage between Australia and London, because they will not be delayed for coaling purposes. They will be oil fed.",32
112,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"The saving of time exis an important consideration from the primary producers' point of view. There is every reason why the construction of the vessels should be proceeded with, and I trust the Committee will favour such proposal, although it may not be acby ceptable to some honourable members, beso many vessels are at present idle. If honourable members will analyze the It position they will find that the vessels the which are held up are not of the type that we are constructing, and are not of class in which our primary products are being shipped. We would, therefore, be acting unwisely if we deleted the items in the Estimates in which provision is of made for ship construction, and consuch tinuing the operations of the CommonAs wealth Line. The vote in connection and with shipbuilding should be allowed to pass, and the Government given the right or to construct such ships as are required. We .may not find it necessary to build as more than the two which have already been authorized, but the Government would have the power, subject to the apf proval of Parliament, to construct further vessels if the circumstances should they demand it. The vote in connection with the Commonwealth Line of Steamers also be allowed to remain, because line is more essential now than, perhaps, it has ever been in its history. as The honourable member for Swan (Mr. stated by interjection that the Commonwealth steamers and those of the comConference Line had combined in the of freights. That is not so; but the honourable member must recollect that there has been a Shipping Combine which has been detrimental to the interests of the primary producers. In view of the evidence we have had today, including the cable which the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) submitted to the Committee, it is quite evident that those interested in the world's shipping are their heads together in an endeavour to control ocean traffic, and the only obstacle at present in their way is 1 Commonwealth Line of Steamers. Mr MCWILLIAMS:-It has not proved a an obstacle up to the present.",32
113,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Perhaps not; but it will. I rtsinember the honourable member stating by interjection that the vessels of the Commonwealth Line had not been competing with tliose of tke Combine, but had fallen in - with them. Honourable members on this side of the chamber are prepared to give every assistance to the Commonwealth Line if it is showing an adequate return for the money invested after setting aside a reasonable sum for depreciation. We do not wish the vessels of the Commonwealth Line to return handsome profits, but to carry our products to the other side of the world. I trust the Committee will be prepared to support both these items, because if they are passed, it will indicate that Parliament is in favour of the ship construction policy being continued, and the operations of the Commonwealth Line not being, interfered with.",32
114,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Franklin) [4.24-]. - I agree with the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and that of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) that this is an exceedingly important subject, and should be fully debated. It has to be admitted that there has been considerable muddling in connection with the construction of ships in the past. I was a member of the Royal Commission which inquired into Commonwealth shipbuilding generally, and I should admit at the outset that I . was pleased to learn that the work performed by Australian artisans was of the highest standard. That fact has never been challenged, and it is one which we should freely recognise. The whole procedure in connection with shipbuilding at Cockatoo Island would have been a screaming farce if it unfortunately had not been so costly, because of the fact that at least four Government Departments were interested in Cockatoo Island. Each Department had its own officers and regulations, which were very often in conflict, and which invariably resulted in chaos and increased the cost of the work. It is a wonder to me that the Superintending Manager succeeded in carrying out any work, considering the circumstances under which operations were conducted. One of the principal reasons for dissatisfaction was the absurd Shipping Tribunal, the decisions of which overrode Federal and' State awards, and which produced in some instances startling results. In some cases two first-class mechanics with equal capabilities would be receiving different rates of pay. One would be earning 18s. 6d. per day, while the one working under the conditions set up by the tribunal would be earning perhaps Â£ 3 10s. per day. There was also the absurdity that the unskilled labourer attached to the latter would be receiving 50s. a day, whilst the skilled artisan working beside him would be receiving 18s. a day.  ber, ought to be aware that on a ship costing Â£170,000 the additional cost so involved' would be only a little more than Â£800. Mr MCWILLIAMiS - That is not any justification for setting up an absurd tribunal, the decisions of which overrode Federal and State awards, and which created dissatisfaction among the workers.",33
115,Mr MAHONY,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"How could it override a State award when they do not apply to Commonwealth activities ? Mr MoWILLIAMS - The decisions of that tribunal overrode all awards. It was a special tribunal created by the Prime Minister to deal with this particular class of work, and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) must admit that its decisions were extraordinary in their results. The honourable member and others who were members of that Commission will admit that when witnesses appeared before the Commission and were asked certain questions they frequently replied, "" That is not in my Department. It is a matter for the Public Works Department."" Another witness would say, "" That is a matter for the Department of the Navy.""",33
116,Mr MARRS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"But that has all passed. Mr MoWILLIAMS - Yes, but it shows the absurdity of the position. Honourable members can readily understand the difficulties that would arise when operations were being conducted by three or four Departments under different Ministerial heads. The work was carried out in such a way that, approximately, 2,400 men were thrown out of work without any warning, and it was a disgraceful act on the part'of those who were responsible. A sum was voted by Parliament to cover the expenditure on ship construction for twelve months; but the amount was spent in about eight months.  had nothing to do with that.",33
117,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,If the Minister  he will find that it supports what I have said.,34
118,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Who was sponsible for it?,34
119,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Personally , I think the blame rested upon the shoulders of two or three. It was stated in.evidence that a member of the Naval Board visited the works and verbally intimated that operations should proceed. tions should not have been given in that way; but, in justice to that oflicer, it should be mentioned that there was a misunderstanding. A vicious principle was adopted in effect when the expenditure voted had been exceeded; money was taken out of a Trust Fund, and the trust account was charged with exorbitant overhead expenses when the ships had to be repaired.",34
120,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Who was sponsible for that?,34
121,Mr MCWILLIAM S,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,About four Ministers. There were four Ministerial Departments concerned.,34
122,Mr MARRS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,What is the use of going into that?,34
123,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,I am trying to show how the cost of these ships was r un up inordinately. I grant that the quality of the work done was first-class.,34
124,Mr MAHONY,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,The workmen did not have a fair chance.,34
125,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I agr*e with the honourable member for Dalley that the men did not have an opportunity of doing the work properly, because there were three or four Departments interfering with the ordinary procedure. glad that shipbuilding has now been placed under one Minister, who will have complete responsibility and also absolute authority.",34
126,Mr MAHONY,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Unfortunately , he has not; the matter is under the Prime Minister's Department.",34
127,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I understand, from the remarks made in this House some time ago by the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes)-and I think every member of the Committee, was exceedingly glad to hear them-that he has practically relinquished control in this matter, and that we shall now have one Minister responsible.",34
128,Mr MASSYGREENE,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,For a long time most of these matters have been only nominally under the Department of the Prime M i nister.,34
129,Mr ATKINSON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"But are they build0 ing boats more cheaply? re- Mr M o WILLIAMS - The disquieting aspect, to ,my mind, is that the Royal Commission could not get from a single officer the slightest indication that there would be any reduction in the cost of ship construction in future. The'evidence was not published, but it is available. The great Inchcape Combine governs Instruc- British shipping, and the Morgan Trust controls American shipping. Those two great Combines are practically working in unison, and it may be news to some honourable members to know that they own a very considerable portion of the shipping plying on the Australian 'coast today. For instance, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which bought out the Union Company, has joined the Inchcape Combine. The reUnion Company is in partnership with Huddafrt, Parker, and Company, and several of the other lines have been bought out, so it is exceedingly difficult now to find lines of steamers which are not in this Combine. My complaint is that the Commonwealth Line has not hitherto proved a check on the rates of freight charged between Great Britain and Australia.   plaint against the management, and is not a valid objection, to the principle ",34
130,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I remember recently reading a statement by Mr Larkin that it was not his intention to enter into a war of freights with the Conference Line. Information came to ,us I am the other daythat there was a prospect of certain freights being reduced. It was stated that one company was prepared to reduce freights, but that the others would not agree to do so, and the one that was prepared to make a reduction was not the Commonwealth Line.",34
131,Mr MASSYGREENE,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"To which company do you 2'efer? Mr MCWILLIAMS ' - The name was refused me, but I shall make an attempt to obtain it for the Minister.",34
132,Mr MASSYGREENE,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,I should like to have it . t,34
133,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I have mentioned previously that prior to the war the f r u it freight to Great Britain from Australia, including Tasmania., ran from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 9d. per case. While the war was in progress, the then M in ister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Jensen), after going closely into the figures and facts, permitted a charge of, I think, 3s. 6cL per case, which he said was a fair price. was when the insurance rates were high, owing to war risks. Now, with the war over, the charge has been increased to 8s. for a bushel case. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has repeatedly brought under notice the freight on meat. The cost of running ships must, of course, bo taken into consideration. I put a question, I think, to the Prime Minister some time ago, and he told the House that the cost of running a boat from Australia to England was now 285 per cent, higher than before the war. This Parliament must make a choice deliberately and quickly, unless the primary products of Australia are to be shut out of the world's markets. We must either reduce the cost of running ships and the cost of building them, or we must make a deliberate vote in order to meet the added .cost. We have already agreed to a. duty of 25 per cent, on vessels, and that increases the capital cost by one-fourth. Running costs having increased 285 per cent, as compared with the figures of seven years ago, we must either deal effectively with this serious situation, or Australia's primary products will not be able to reach, the markets of the world. Australia, is 12,000 miles from the Mother Country, and we have to compete with Canada, the United States of America, the Argentine, and Europe, from any one of which countries it is not half so far to Great Britain as it is fro m Australia.",34
134,Mr MAHONY,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Would it help *usi if we disposed of the Commonwealth Line and ceased to build ships?,35
135,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I am trying to put the case fairly and moderately. So far as thÂ© running of ships by the Government is concerned, I can see Scylla on the one hand and Charybdis on thÂ© other. The main justification for the Commonwealth acquiring a line of steamers at all was that it would prove a check on the'Combine, but the Commonwealth Line has failed in that respect.",35
136,Mr MASSYGREENE,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,I can assure the honourable member that it has not failed.,35
137,Mr GABB,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Why are these people willin g to buy our ship's if the Commonwealth Line is no check on them?,35
138,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"It is my deliberate opinion that, in regard to every line of freight, there is a gentleman's arrangement between the management of the Commonwealth Line in England ancl the management of the combined comThat panies.  serious thing to say.",35
139,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"It is a serious matter. The Prime Minister stated the other day that he would resolutely refuse to allow politics to be brought into the management of the Commonwealth Line. That would be a very good stunt if it were carried out, but it is not carried out. This is one of the recommendations of the Select Committee on the Seacarriage of Goods which investigated shipping matters some three years agoYour Committee has been advised that changes have been made in the agencies of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers dt Australian ports by the establishment of branch offices at various ports. Your Committee recommends that, wherever possible, this policy should be extended and the oversea agency taken out of the hands of firms who are also agents for privately-owned steam-ship companies. The management of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers enforces everywhere but in Hobart the very wholesome regulation that no one who is an agent for the steamers of the combined companies shall act as agent for the Commonwealth Line.",35
140,Mr ATKINSON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Who has the agency of the Commonwealth Line at Hobart?,35
141,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Sir Henry Jones and Company; the very firm that should not have it . Last year, that firm tried to crush out a local co-operative company in regard to a shipment of f r u it by a vessel for which it was agent, and that action in itself should have determined the Government that it must no longer represent the Commonwealth Line. It is, however, the only one of the agents for the combined steam-ship companies that has been allowed to retain the agency of the Commonwealth Line. I think it was the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) who moved the insertion in the report of the paragraph that I have read. The f i r m that I have named used its opportunities last year to the prejudice of a local cooperative company, and should not he allowed to retain the Commonwealth agency. It is malting a special charge for shipping arrangements which should not he allowed. I have spoken of this matter here before. The honourable member for ""Wakefield and others who were on the Committee know that the management of the Commonwealth Line expressed its disapproval of the arrangement. I was asked to advocate the handing over of the agency to a co-operative company, but I replied, "" No . There is a State-owned steam-ship company in Tasmania, and it should be the agent for the Commonwealth Line. If it were the agent, all who approached it would get a fair deal."" I differ from the Prime Minister on the subject of the wooden ships that were built for the Commonwealth. Those vessels failed, not because they were woodien, but because they were badly constructed. The pumps had to be used all the way to Australia on the first of the wooden vessels that* came here from America to keep her afloat.  vessel.",35
142,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"The statement applies to nearly all the wooden vessels built in America. One of them, when loading at Hobart, had to discontinue taking in cargo which was waiting for it, long before its hold space was fully occupied, because the water was pouring in between the top planks. The Prime Minister quoted me as having favoured the construction of wooden vessels, and it is because of that quotation that I am referring to the matter now. Immediately after the war broke out I advocated the construction locally of two Dieselengined fore and aft schooners of 1,000 tons, or a little more, each. The price was to be Â£25 per ton, and a builder was willing to bind himself under an enormous penalty to construct the vessels within twelve months. The - Government made a very great mistake in not haying those vessels built. No one complained when steamers were taken away from Australia to assist the Empire elsewhere in the conduct of the war; but the dearth of coastal shipping which resulted caused produce to rot, and timber to warp, everywhere in Tasmania.",36
143,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Where would you have got the Diesel engines?,36
144,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"-Pinlayson, of the Mersey, offered to supply them. M i . POYNTON - He got a contract, and did no good with it.",36
145,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"The Government refused to give him a contract for schooners, which he could have built, but gave him a contract for large steel steamships, which he could not build. If the wooden vessels which were . built in America had been honestly constructed",36
146,Mr FLEMING,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Hear , hear! HMS. Victory is still afloat.",36
147,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"To say that wooden vessels are not capable of good service is ridiculous. There are no finer ships anywhere than the six-masted schooners which come to Australia from ; the United States of America and Canada, but they - are vessels which have been honestly constructed. I have asked over and over again for the names of those responsible for the specifications of the wooden ships built for us, of those who drew up the contracts and perused them the on behalf of the Commonwealth, and of those responsible for the boats being taken over.",36
148,Mr ATKINSON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"We ought also to know 1 the names of those who overlooked the - work in America ? Mr MoWILLIAMS - T h | reason why those vessels are now being employed in the unprofitable business of barnaclefarming is that they were built of green oregon, and will not have a life of more than ten years from the date of launching. The Prime Minister has told us that it was useless to go to law about them, but in Fairplay of the 11th August this statement occursI t is reported in the American papers that an Arbitration Board has awarded the Patterson-MACDonald Shipbuilding Company of Seattle $1,028,458 in shipping claims against the Australian Commonwealth Government. The award has been submitted to the United States Court for approval. The claims grew out of the construction of nine 4,200-ton wooden ships by the company for the Australian Government, the original claim being for $1,114,944. The Commonwealth, in addition to what it has already paid for these rotten sieves, will have to pay Â£275,000 because of the faulty contract under which the vessels were built.",36
149,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"The Americans are in the same mess themselves. Mr MoWILLIAMS - Everythin g was corrupt. The vessels which were sent to Australia were fraudulently constructed, and were corruptly accepted on behalf of the Commonwealth. That may seem strong language to use, but the statement is true. The officers who came over on those boats will tell you that they were sieves, and that nothing ""but corruption would have accounted for them, having been passed. The fault was, not in constructing the vessels of wood, but in ing badly-constructed vessels to be passed off on us. These vessels have been built of green Douglas pine, known here as oregon, and their life, as I have said, not exceed ten years, and I doubt if it will reach eight years. One of the vessels had to be replanked from the deck-line up. This is not the fault of the Minister who is now in charge of shipping (Mr. Poynton), but it is the fault of tliose who drew up the contracts, and of those who supervised the work for the Commonwealth and took over the vessels on completion.",36
150,Mr FOWLER,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Is there no Ministerial responsibility in a matter of this kind? Mr MoWILLIAMS - I have ceased to look for Ministerial responsibility in this House. No one in this Ministry is responsible for anything. When the Sea-carriage of Goods Committee was taking evidence at Cockatoo Island, I understood that there was, roughly speaking, between Â£30,000 and Â£40,000 worth of material on hand.",37
151,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I accepted the figures of the Prime Ministei"".",37
152,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Did they include the whole of the machinery ? While we have warships, we must make provision for repairing them, and must keep employed the staff needed for that service. If the figures given by the honourable member are correct, there is about Â£250,000 worth of material at Cockatoo Island.",37
153,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,Thre e hundred and fifty thousand pounds' worth.,37
154,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"If we have on hand Â£350,000 worth of material for the construction of ships, then probably the best course would be to complete those now being built. I hope, however, that there will be a complete cessation of building a3 it is now being carried on by the Government, because a vessel is no sooner completed and ready to be put into commission than she has to be tied up for lack of cargo. The Prime Minister has said that there is something like 11,000,000 tons of shipping over ancl above the ordinary requirements of the world today, and that statement, according to my reading, is by no means exaggerated. [Extension of time granted.'] It is impossible for the Government to go on building ships at a cost very much in allowexcess of their actual value when launched unless we are to have a millstone tied for all time round the neck of Australian trade. The one object 'of will building our Tariff wall higher and higher is to put a stop to importations. If our ships have to depend for their revenue on only one-way cargo, and if , in addition, we are to have these increased capital costs, and an increase of 285 per cent, in running costs, it will be impossible for our primary produots to compete in the open markets.of the world. One of the great difficulties with which one is always confronted in reducing public expenditure is that it means to many loss of employment. Every department introduced creates vested interests. To set out on a policy of retrenchment, a man Should have no heart. No one desires to see men thrown out of employment; and it makes one's heart ache to learn that, because of the retrenchment already decided upon, 400 or 500 returned men have been thrown out of work. If the Government are to discontinue shipbuilding, thousands of men will be thrown out of employment. This Committee, however, must sooner or later face the position, and must cut down expenditure wherever it can reasonably do so. We cannot continue building ships at three times their value solely to create work. If the Commonwealth Line of Steamers is to be run in competition with other lines, the manager must be given a fair run. When giving evidence before the Committee appointed to inquire into the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, the Manager of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers said that he could not compete with the shipping of the world if in the construction of his ships his capital cost were overloaded. I know the Manager of the Commonwealth Line, and believe that the Goship- vernment have been exceedingly fortunate in securing his services. He served in a good school-h e was for years with the old Union Steam-ship Company-and knows the whole question of freightage from A to Z. He tells us deliberately that he cannot compete with private shipping companies if we overload his capital cost in the building of ships for.the Commonwealth Line as we are building them today.",37
155,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,It is impossible.,38
156,Mr MCWILLIAM S,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Quite so. If Committee makes up. its mind that the Commonwealth shipbuilding programme shall be continued under existing conditions, then unless the export of our primary products is to be utterly destroyed, we shall have to make such financial rangements as will enable that work to carried on. We cannot build up the capital cost of our ships, increase the running costs by 285 per cent., our primary products more than twice as far as the produce of other countries to be carried, unless we make special rangements to bridge the financial chasm. The Prime. Minister has asked that feeling of the Committee shall be tested. I think it should be. I therefore prosire pose to move That the proposed votefoereduced by Â£1 an instruction to the Government that Committee does not consider that shipbuilding should be continued under present conditions except where such large sums pended as would justify the completion of the work, That will give the Oommittee an opporto tunity .to deal fairly with the whole ject.",38
157,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"The honourable member's amendment will not serve the reable quired purpose. The policy of the vernment is not to continue shipbuilding except in regard to those vessels that are ment. already on the stocks, or for which material has been purchased'. Beyond that we do not propose to go. If the Comcan mittee wishes to go further, it must indithe cate the extent to which it desires us go. We do not need any such instruchowever, tion as the honourable member now proment poses that the Committee shall give us, since it embodies our actual policy.",38
158,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I think _ it would be wise to place such a decision on the records. The Prime Minister may not always be at the head of the Commonwealth Government. There be an election, or the right honourable gentleman may see fit to retire from his exalted position, so that it is just as well that an instruction of this kind should appear on the records. It has been laid down by a great parliamentary writer that it is most dangerous for a Parliament to be governed by the promises of Ministers.  member's amendment would tie the hands the - of many honourable members.

165,Sir ROBERT BEST,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Kooyong) [5.5]. - I do not think much is to be gained by referring at this stage to the shipbuilding and ship-purchasing operations will of the Government during the war period. Much to which we could have objected, and against which. I strongly protested as the time, was done; hut while the war was in progress emergent conditions were constantly arising, and the Government, and particularly the Prime - Minister, had to be left free to a large extent to do what they considered to be best for the proper defence of Australia. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has referred to the establishment of what was known as the Shipbuilding Tribunal, which managed in a very extraordinary way to settle the disputes which arose from time to time by practically conceding the demands made without any consideration for the Government. Whether the disputes were right or wrong, those who created them - the workmen immediately concernedwere the men in whose favour the decisions of the Tribunal were invariably given. Such a one-sided "" Heads I win, tails you lose,"" sort of Tribunal was no commendation to the Commonwealth shipbuilding policy. I am glad that the Government have intimated their determination to put an end to Commonwealth shipbuilding. That decision does not mean that the industry is not to be carried on in Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has indicated very clearly that he wants to offer every facility to the development of the shipbuilding industry by any private individual or firm that chooses to commence operations here. He has said that, as far as possible, the docks and machinery of the Government will be placed at the disposal of such people. In addition, the Government have deliberately imposed a duty of 25 per cent, to protect aud encourage the shipbuilding industry in Australia. If the industry is to be a profitable one, then the Government offer every facility for its development. If it is to be an unprofitable industry, that is a special reason why the Government should at once bring it to an end. If we are to continue the ownership^ of the existing Commonwealth Line of Steamers it may be necessary to some extent that we should at least have in the Commonwealth repairing yards, apart from those controlled by private enterprise. Assuming that we are going to continue, the ownership of the Commonwealth steamers, ship repairing yards must be available to the Government at any time. I applaud the decision of the Government. I am distinctly opposed to the continuation of the industry by the Government itself. The exigencies of the war have passed. The circumstances which might then have justified the Government in entering upon the industry no longer exist, and the time has arrived for us to survey the whole position, and to say how best we can get out of it. I admit that the sudden discharge of a great number of workmen must give rise to difficulties, and it must be left to some extent to the Government to make the change as gradual as possible, so that there will be no undue hardship.",38
166,Mr ATKINSON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,They must ease down the position.,39
167,Sir ROBERT BEST,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Quite so. Eor that reason the completion of those ships whose construction has been substantially advanced, may be justified, firstly, because we are committed to their construction, and, secondly, because of the unemployment problem which we cannot altogether disregard. But at the earliest possible moment an intimation should be given to the workmen in this industry that their occupation is gradually, but surely, coming to an end, I listened with interest to the speech upon shipping made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). It was skilfully prepared and delivered, and a goodprima facie case was made out. But I do not take it all at its face value, and certainly, from an accountancy stand-point, most of it could be readily challenged. The right honourable gentleman contended that we were not justified in debiting the Government enterprise with the loss of over Â£2,000,000 on the wooden ships, because that was essentially a loss due to going the war. There is, no doubt, much to be said in favour of that contention, but the right honourable gentleman surprised me very much when he sought to take this credit: ""Net earnings of ex-enemy vessels for whole period since they were seized, not counting saving to Commonwealth in carrying large numbers of soldiers, Â£4,066,266."" On the one hand he claimed that the loss on the wooden ships was a war loss and should not be debited, but on the other hand he claimed a credit of Â£4,066,266 in respect of the earnings of the ex-enemy ships, although they were equally incidental to the war.",39
168,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"If the eix-enemy ships are not to be taken into consideration, neither are the wooden ships, and so we are confined to the "" A u s t r a l "" ships, from which we made a profit of nearly Â£3,000,000.",40
169,Sir ROBERT BEST,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"That is the point I am making. We should not take into consideration either the losses on the wooden ships or the earnings by the exenemy ships, because they are a debit and a credit respectively to the war. Moreover, as the right honourable gentleman mentioned this afternoon, the Peace Treaty provides that all liabilities owing to. the Germans by Australians must be paid to the Australian Government, and, on the other hand, all moneys owing to Australians by Germans must be paid to the German Government.",40
170,Mr MASSYGREENE,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,I think the honourable member is in error. There is no liability on the Australian Government to pay anything to Germany.,40
171,Sir ROBERT BEST,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Money s owing to Australians by Germans must be paid by the Australian Government, and moneys owing by Australians to Germans must be paid by the German Government.",40
172,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,There is no liability on our part at all.,40
173,Mr MASSYGREENE,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,All these debts go through the clearing house.,40
174,Sir ROBERT BEST,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"What I have said represents the practical operation rf the arrangement made in the Peace Treaty. I am. not speaking of an individual liability on the part of the Government, but I am reminding the Committee that German assets which are collected here are liabilities for payment there out of debts owing to Australia; by this process a debtor and creditor account is established.",40
175,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"They are set off against our claims, but there is this to be said: We have got this money, and as to the other moneys owing, we are not so sure.",40
176,Sir ROBEST BEST,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"That is so. The operations of the ""Austral "" Line have been very satisfactory, and the right honourable gentleman is entitled to every congratulation there for. But, at the same time, when he claims a. credit of Â£3,000,000 in regard to that transaction, that claim can be allowed only by taking the remaining ships into credit at cost value, whereas, as a matter of fact, they are practically valueless at the present time.",40
177,Mr BRUCE,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,No .,40
178,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"We own those ships; we have paid the book value for them, and after writing ofE the whole capital cost, we have made a net gain of Â£1,669,387. If they are valueless, we still have the profit of Â£3,000,000.",40
179,Sir ROBERT BEST,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I do not think 1 that is strictly correct; but I turn now to another point. In the Budget speech, the Treasurer stated that the capital cost of ships purchased or constructed out of loan moneys, including ships in course of construction, was Â£7,137,328. Does that amount represent the actual cost of those ships to the Government or their present day value?",40
180,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,That is the amount we have actually paid or contracted to pay.,40
181,Sir ROBERT BEST,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I understand that the amount stated represents the cost, and that it is not today's value of the ships of the "" Austral"" Line that is included in that amount.",40
182,Mr HUGHES,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"It evidently includes the "" Austral"" ships at their book value. - Sir ROBERT BEST - The past operations of the "" Austral"" ships have been satisfactory, but shipbuilding cannot continue in Australia at the present price. It is perfectly clear that we have to reckon up the position at once, and bring the present operations to a termination as early as possible. At the same time, I am very anxious that every effort shall be made to continue the shipbuilding industry in Australia by private enterprise; that is the very object of the Tariff, and, I hope, of the Government. The future of the Shipping Line is a more difficult problem., and in regard to it one is hardly justified in coming to a hasty determination at the present moment. Possibly there may be some justification, for continuing to operate this Line for a time, but I am desirous that it should not be continued indefinitely. The Government should take an early opportunity of getting rid of this enterprise, because I am perfectly certain that it cannot be carried on by the Government as advantageously as it could be carried on by private enterprise. I do not approve of the cabled suggestion iby Lord Inchcape that the Commonwealth Line should be sold to the Conference Ring which he represents. There is no doubt that the influences of the "" Conference"" are very serious, but how far the small Line of ships owned by the Commonwealth has an effect upon the operations of the "" Conference"" is another matter. Indeed, I am of opinion that the influence of our small fleet is but negligible.  pose to buy our ships if they have influence?",40

185,Sir ROBERT BEST,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Of course; and, no doubt, it would be very satisfactory him to rid his enterprise of the influence of the Commonwealth ships, small though it be.

Those advantages do not show in pounds, shillings, ancl pence, and apparently they work. have been forgotten. I recollect a period during the war when it was impossible to import a ton of phosphatic rock because freights were not procurable by any Melbourne. means. For the benefit of the farming community, Commonwealth ships had to be diverted to that work, and they brought to Australia 123,000 tons of phosphatic rock. One ton of rock will break down into, at least, 2 tons of phosphates, so that that importation was equivalent to about 247,000 tons of phosphates. That represents nearly 5,000,000 cwts.; and, if we attempt to calculate the advantage of the use of that fertilizer to Australia, we get into very big figures indeed. Many millions of acres could not have been planted that year and in subsequent years-for Commonwealth ships are still carrying that phosphatic t for the fact that our ships were no available to be put on to that trade.",41

We forget that only a short while ago there was a coal famine in the southern parts of Australia, and when Inter-State vessels could not be obtained to carry coal from I Newcastle to the other States, great pressure was brought to bear in this to reHouse upon the Government to take the Commonwealth steamers off the overseas trade and employ them carrying coal in We transferred twenty-six of our vessels to that class of",41

Was that not to the benefit of the farmers?   member thinks it would have been better to let the wheat rot here? The Commonwealth Line of Steamers has been the means of keeping prices down.",41

In order to remove the impression some seem to have that Mr Farquhar, who is in charge of shipbuilding, is incompetent, I take this opportunity of placing that gentleman's qualifications record. He has had fifty years' experience in commercial and naval shipbuilding. As a boy he passed through the drawing office, and then the mould loft and yard. He then became, in turn, assistant draughtsman, chief draughtsman, naval architect, works manager, general manager, and director. For of thirteen years he was manager and director of the well-known firm of J. Samuel White and Company Limited, the of the Isle of Wight. He is a member of the Institute of Naval Architects. I of have a book with me which honourable members can peruse. It shows the class of naval ships turned out in works of be which he has had control. Some of the vessels have put up wonderful records. we had I think that this statement of Mr. Farquhar's qualifications as a naval will dispel any fear that he is not qualified to complete the unfinished vessels at Cockatoo Island. Provision is made on this year's Estimates for an expenditure of Â£3,000,000 upon ship construction. The bulk of this money will be spent on ships which are being constructed overseas. It is anticipated that the payment to Vickers Limited for the period will be Â£1,267,000. We hope that the vessels they have under construction will be practically completed during the twelve months. It is also anticipated that Â£900,000 will be paid this year to Beardmore's. These two amounts leave but a small balance for the construction of ships in Australia. These payments swell the Estimates for this year, but as a result of the completion of the vessels overseas this item for construction will practically disappear next year. In Australia there are three further vessels of the E type to be launched; two during December, and one in January next, which will leave only two others of that type still to be constructed out of the original contract; one by Poole and Steel, of Adelaide, and one at Williamstown, which is to be put together from material supplied by Walkers Limited, Queensland. At Cockatoo Island we have the material and a large portion of the engines for two 12,800-ton ships, which will provide about 350,000 cubic feet of refrigerated space.",42
190,Mr RILEY,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"I understand that all the on machinery for those vessels is nearly complete. *  of the machinery has been got ready. We have plates, girders, and ribs, and all the steel parts to the extent of 6,802 tons. There are 1,474 men employed on shipbuilding on Cockatoo Island, of whom 578 are at work on the Adelaide and 205 on the Mombah, while about 250 are engaged in completing machinery for the two 12,800-ton boats. There are in all about 3,000 men engaged in shipbuilding in Australia, including those employed by private firms. At one period during the war there were as many as 5,000 employed on this class of work. There is no country in the world that has greater need for encouraging shipbuilding than has Australia. As we increase our production so will our need for vessels in crease, no inatter what Government may be in power. The men we have employed upon this work of shipbuilding have proved themselves capable. The last vessel launched has shown a marked improvement upon those previously launched, but it is recognised by Lloyds' surveyors and others that the workmanship on the vessels built in Australia is quite equal to that which can be seen in vessels built elsewhere. No industry employs a greater variety of trades. We have distributed Â£1,337,000 in wages among thirty-three classes of tradesmen. These include ship draughtsmen, engine draughtsmen, accountants, clerks, time-keepers, watchmen, platers, riveters, caulkers, drillers, angle-iron smiths, iron workers' assistants, blacksmiths, shipwrights, joiners, cabinetmakers, painters, polishers, upholsterers, saw-millers, sheet-metal workers, electricians, riggers, general labourers, boilermakers, engine-fitters, machinists, ironfounders, brassfounders, coppersmiths, plumbers, brassfinishers, and fettlers. These are the men directly employed, but a glance at any shipbuilding yard will show at once how many other classes of people find employment as the result of shipbuilding. I have been associated with the Commonwealth Shipbuilding Department since its inception. In m y opinion it would be madness for Australia to close down its yards simply because of a little panic at the present time. I have recently taken over control of Cockatoo Island, where various reforms have been instituted, and I propose to show some of the results. .For one thing overhead charges have decreased from 133 per cent, when the Board took control to 35 per cent., including interest and depreciation.",42
191,Mr WATT,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"What is the explanation of that huge difference?  with the services of twelve foremen, thirty-six draughtsmen, one medical officer, one assistant shipyard manager, and three inspectors. We have abolished the twelve days' annual leave which the employees enjoyed. We have saved Â£10,000 by doing away with the f e r r y boat which formerly ran to the island. The annual charges have been reduced by Â£69,000.",43
192,Mr WATT,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Surely a reduction of overhead charges from 133 per cent, to 35 per cent, is not represented by a reduction of Â£69,000 in annual charges?  that my statement, is absolutely correct.",43

196,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,It is due to a large amount of plant being used only for special naval work.,43

201,Mr MAHONY,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,The Navy are not giving Cockatoo Island nearly all the work they should give that dockyard.,43
202,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"We are giving all the work that we can to Cockatoo Island.  work might come to us at Cockatoo Island from the Navy, but - we are getting the work done now on a basis that is very satisfactory.

Something has been said about the losses incurred in connection with wooden ships, and a quotation on the subject was made some little time ago from the publication Fair Play. I am going to quote also from Fair Play an extract from, a speech delivered by the Chairman of the American Shipping Board. He said, in the first place, that America lost Â£79,000,000- I am reducing the dollars to sterling-in her war shipping undertakings. He said, at the close of his speech that they lost no less than Â£65,000,000 on wooden ships. they talk about closing down?  on Government shipbuilding.  bers listen to this.statement by the Chairman of the American Shipping BoardIn other words, the Shipping Board is not disheartened. The very purpose, startling as these figures are, proves to us that with patience something can the done, and out of this wreck, like Phoenix from its ashes, a real American merchant marine can arise that will be worth all the penalties that we have suffered, and when prosperity comes to the world, that marine will be the greatest insurance that America will get its full share.",44
204,Mr BRUCE,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,When did he say that ?  quotation is taken from F a i r Play for the 4th August of this year. I make the quotation in order to show the spirit with which they are facing the position in America. Here we are cavilling over a few pounds.,44
205,Mr CHARLTON,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"Japa n is also giving every encouragement to shipbuilding.  connection with the cancelling of ships that we have a remarkable record in Australia. As soon as the Armistice was signed, I cancelled sixteen out of eighteen wooden ships being built in Australia, and those cancellations represented a total loss of something like Â£4 per ton per ship. In America at that time on the first 370 ships ordered their cancellations represented a loss of Â£14 14s. per ton. , W it h in the last nine months I arranged for the cancellation of three steel ships of the E type, and I was able to do that without a loss to the Commonwealth of a solitary penny. I made arrangements with Messrs. Poole and Steel to give up one of the ships ordered fromthem, and with Walkers Limited, of Maryborough, Queensland, to give up two ships. This was the more readily agreed to because of financial stress and the fact that the firms mentioned found it very difficult to finance their big undertakings. As I have said, the cancellation of these vessels has not cost this country one penny. I have no hesitation in saying that the men of Australia can build ships. There is no country in the world that is more favourably situated for shipbuilding. We But do have our own material. We are now getting on with our steel works, though it is true that locally-manufactured steel is somewhat dearer today than imported steel. If the arguments which have been memused against the shipbuilding industry were used against other Australian industries we should never attempt the establishment of any industry in this country. I venture to say that the shipbuilding in dustry stands above a ll the rest.  bers seem to be sorry that steel is getting cheap.

When I remember the cable which, we received today, and ponder upon the benevolence of those are trying to buy out our ships for purpose of assisting the primary proships ducers of this. country, I am amazed. Lord Inchcape represents between 7,000,000 and 8,000,000 tons of shipping. Â° If our ships were not interfering with ambitions, and were not putting some check on the conditions and freights which he would impose, do honourable members think that he would offer buy them?  native, that the Commonwealth Governunless ment should buy his ships.  answer to that proposal would be. hope that in all the circumstances shipbuilding enterprise will be kept tact, and will be continued. In time, we have work to go on with. All the steel plates required to finish ships under construction are here.",44
206,Mr EILEY,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"And paid for.  It would be madness to cease shipbuilding at this juncture. There is another phase of the question which is worthy of consideration. I venture to say that, if it were not for the shipbuilding industry, we should be paying hundreds of thousands of pounds by way of sustenance to returned soldiers. as During the time. I have had charge of is shipbuilding we have had from 2,000 to 2,500 men. employed, many of whom were returned soldiers. If shipbuildm ing had not been proceeded with, we shipwould have been called upon to pay sustenance to those returned soldiers, and, even if we do lose a little on the ships we build, our loss will be much less than the the amount we would lose by paying sustenance to returned soldiers, from which expenditure there would be no return at Mr Charlton. - What about the rewe get indirectly from the building  on given particulars of the quantity of wheat we have carried in our ships, and have mentioned the fact that millions of who acres of land had been kept under crop the as a result of the employment of our in - the transport of phosphatic rock to Australia. I mentioned, also*, the advantages gained in other indirect ways. I cannot understand any man objecting his to our continuing shipbuilding in a reasonable way, feeling our way as we go, and keeping the industry intact. There is a considerable number of men engaged in the industry now, and if we closed to down the business tomorrow, do honourable members think that we could turn 3,000 or 4,000 men now employed in the industry out of employment there was something else for them to do ? The men who object to the continuance of the industry would be the the first to demand thab the Government I should undertake relief works to provide our them with employment. They are not innow engaged on relief work, but on work the meanthat is useful to the country.",45
207,Mr BLAKELEY,RECONSTRUCTIO NOFTH E,"They . are not employed on sand shifting work, either.  I have every confidence, in all the circumstances, that the Committee will support the policy of the Government. are we monwealth before should three Mr. moment-th NA add continuance theissues Pleat, eCommittee toinvolved (Swan) i tthe by question shipbuilding, atin [5.53] - Ther ofthethÂ© question whether present Comande a third issue raised this afternoon as a result of the cable message which the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) read to the Committee, making an offer for the purchase of the Commonwealth Fleet with an alternative proposal that the Commonwealth Government should purchase the Australian section of the Inchcape vessels. I cannot say right away that under existing conditions I am entirely opposed to further shipbuilding by the Government in Australia. There are ships, the keels of which have been laid and upon which a considerable amount has been spent, and it might be a wise policy to complete them. At the same time, it might be a business proposition not to go on with them. Nevertheless, as we have commenced their construction, I may support the continuance of the work upon them until they are completed. The Prime Minister, in his speech on this matter, went into the early history of the Commonwealth Line transaction. He read many cablegrams and communications in connection therewith, and pointed out how he came to purchase the Austral Line. He referred also to the huge profits made by the Line after liquidating the capital account. showed that we have made up to Â£&,000,000 in profits by the transaction. I should like to say that while it is fortunate we did not make that loss, the profits which have been made indicate that the right honourable gentleman did a considerable amount of profiteering with the Line. The ships of the world were available, so far as they could have been made available in the light of warlike operations by sea. The right honourable gentleman placed the ships fie bought entirely in the hands of the Imperial Government, notwithstanding that he now claims that he bought the Line to shift Australia's produce, and to do so at cheaper rates.",45
208,Mr CORSES,PROWSE,"Whic h the Prime Minister did.  owes the primary producers those ships, because they bought them by their payment of high freights. But the fact is that, so soon as the Government got hold of those vessels, they joined the Combine. The Government bought them with a view apostle. to keeping rates down to a reasonable margin in the interests of - Australia's primary producers. That was what was said on the one hand, but the incontrovertible fact, on the other, is that the Government immediately joined the Combine which they had set out to fight. The result was that they made immense profits out of the ships, and the freights from Australia to the Old Country were such that the capital cost of the vessels was wiped out, leaving huge profits to be piled up.",46
209,Mr CORSER,PROWSE,"Australia n produce was carried by the Australian ships at far cheaper rates than other lines could have carried it for.  there is much difference between Lord Inchcape having complete control and of his having such special influence over the Commonwealth Line that the Government are forced to become members of the Combine. Much alarm has been raised by honourable members concerning what would happen if Australia were â He thrown back into the hands of the Combine as an outcome of the disposal of our fleet. I would remind honourable members of the state of affairs existing before the war. When we had no ships of our own in active competition, Australian wheat was conveyed to the Old Country at the rate of about lOd. per bushel. The Commonwealth Line charged freight rates running between 3s. 6d. and 4s. 6d. per bushel.",46
210,Mr RILEY,PROWSE,"And what was the price of the wheat sold in the Old Country?  has nothing to do with the matter. That the Australian vessels were so soon paid for demonstrates the fact that, not only did other people profiteer, but the Commonwealth Line also; and it is clear that the Australian shipping authorities have not acted differently from other similar concerns. Australia's greatest disadvantage lies in her distance from the world's markets.",46
211,Dr MALONEY,PROWSE,"And in dear bread, of which the honourable member is the Â«  six years, has got her bread at about one-third of the price which other_. countries have had to pay.",46
212,Dr MALONEY,PROWSE,"But there is no reason why the farmers should rob the mass of consumers now, as they have done for some time past.  some people are not amenable to reason. I repeat that Australia's great handicap is her distance from the world's markets. I can, of course, appreciate the attitude of honourable members who represent shipbuilding localities. They are engaged in special pleading, but I invite them to view the whole case in the broadest light. Australia is 12,000 miles away from the world's markets, and the most important consideration is to have Australian produce conveyed to those markets as cheaply as possible, in order to offset the handicap of distance. What will be the effect upon Australia, however, following upon the imposition of the 25 per cent, duties recently decided upon? The effect must be to increase the handicap of distance; Australia will be virtually 16,000 miles away from the heart of her markets. When the 25 per cent, duty has been levied upon shipping brought here to carry Australian produce, the outcome must inevitably be to add that percentage to the price of freights. In other words, Australia will have been removed another 25 per cent, of her present distance from the world's markets.",47
213,Mr MAHONY,PROWSE,"And 50 per cent, will be added to the price of bread.  presentatives of shipbuilding constituenin cies are specially pleading for the continuance of the industry in Australia. But, as one who will be called upon contribute to the payment for those vessels, trade ? I claim that I have a right to discuss the whole subject from every aspect. I conone locally owned. cede that there are other trades more or less closely associated with the shipbuilding industry; but I am concerned with the seaslong ships which have been delivered here to the vessel. carry Australian freight to Great Britain. If Australia were in a position to build ' ships so cheaply that they could afford carry freight at the same rates as the vessels of any other line, built in any other part of the world, I would be satisfied. But, if Australia cannot do so, why should there be complaints if the Combine can transport our produce more cheaply?",47
214,Mr COKSEB,PROWSE,What guarantee is there that the Combine will keep prices down?  freights were exceedingly reasonable.,47
215,Mr CORSER,PROWSE,"The present Combine did not exist then.  have no reason to expect that the Combine will take an undue advantage of or will adopt a different attitude towards Australia compared with our experience of former days. I would like the Prime Minister to explain how the imposition of a 25 per cent, duty will be covered except by way of increased freights. There can be no other way, unless the public is prepared to pay the difference involved, by way of a bonus. And, if that difference is added to the freight rates, the effect will be to remove Australia still further from the world's markets.",47
216,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROWSE,"The duty will not be levied upon any ship unless engaged in Australian waters. If a vessel simply comes here and goes away again, carrying our produce overseas, there will be no question of duty.  the overseas trade will be protected by a duty of 25 per cent. A vessel bought overseas, after a certain date which has been fixed, will be subject to a 25 per oent. duty. That 25 per cent., levied reupon a ship costing Â£500,000, will mean, fact, an imposition of Â£125,000.",47
217,Mr MASSYGREENE,PROWSE,Where does the honorto able member suggest that that ship will ,47

If ships could be built as cheaply locally as elsewhere there would be no objection to what is proposed. But, if the local cost is greater, freights are bound to be inflated; and that fact will represent a tremendous handicap. The Prime Minister pointed out what the Austral Line has done for the farmers. If that Line has done anything for the farmers, the farmers have paid for it . Por the conveyance of our superphosphates, for example, we paid exactly 50 per cent, more than before the war. And that was only a part of the profiteering enterprise of the Commonwealth Line.",47
219,Mr COBSEB,PROWSE,"Wage s and insurance and everything else went up, so that the Commonwealth l in e was bound to charge more.  been limited to 50 per cent., I would inclined to say that that margin was no more than fair. The Commonwealth tonnage and insulated space ? shipping authorities, however, were in fluenced by the Inchcape interests. Freights upon fertilizers imported to country were inflated far above pre-war rates.

Much stock would have been saved in New South Wales perished because fodder, which was availfor able in some of the States, could not be Australia. shipped in adequate quantities to drought-stricken areas. My main plaint is that the Commonwealth Line is ships here. only an appendage of the Inchcape interis ests of today. The Commonwealth vessels are having no effect upon the Combine. The Government has tried to cut in, market. while running in agreement with the Combine. There is an understanding with the Combine regarding rates. hope that, when the Committee has decided that the Government shall not build any more ships than .those for which the keels have been laid down, we shall then consider L o r d Inchcape's offer. I want to hear more about that offer; although it has been made, it is too indefinite in its present for m for the Committee to consider. The full nature of the offer ought to be disclosed. I take it that it is an alternative offer, and if Parliament and the people are sincere in a desire to have a fleet in Australia, here is an opportunity of having the trade to ourselves uninterruptedly. I am Opposed to Government control; I have seen enough of it recently, and the Australian taxpayers are paying enough for it , and will continue to pay for it . We have an opportunity to buy Lord Inchcape's section of the Australian Fleet, or, as an alternahad tive, he to buy our fleet. I want to be know what the terms of the offer are. Will Australia be guaranteed sufficient I think - the farmer will be more inclined to listen to those who are his friends than to those this who have other interests than his at heart.

In my opinion, i was extremely unwise to put a duty ships.",48
220,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"Flinders) [6.16] - Th question the Committee has to consider a very serious and a very momentous It involves a matter running into many millions of pounds, and I think we must all be somewhat diffident in approaching a subject upon which none of us is an sure. expert. Personally, I have tried to conmoney, sider it from the point of view, as far the Shipping Line is concerned, of a ber of a syndicate which was proposing to buy the ships from the Australian Government and to run them. Wc made it quite clear that this venture not going to be run politically. It is to be handed over to its own mana.gement and its own control, and it has to stand on its own bottom. For that reason seems to me that one has to look at the question exactly as if one were a member of a syndicate and proposing to buy. .the ships. Before dealing with the actual position, there are questions relating the past that I must refer to. During the war period Australia bought a line of ships, ran them, and made a profit out of them. There have been different views expressed in regard to that venture. For my own part, I am quite prepared to accept the action taken. I believe it was determining those questions. essential in the interests of Australia, at that time, that we should get our own ships. We are the farthest country away from the central markets of the world in Europe, and if , when the scarcity shipping became acute, we had not had our own ships, which we could direct selves, very little shipping would have come to these waters. I am certainly not going to rake up any of the contropossible versies relating to that matter. With regard to the wooden ships, I have no tention of going over that ground either. I believe that when they were bought the action of the' Government was wise and prudent, and I do not think we could have done anything else. With regard [533] to disposing of them, I have looked at that matter also, but I find it difficult to see obhow we could have got out of the trouble any quicker. The only point about which there may be something to say is the of contracts and the supervision of the building of the ships. That is, t at its worse, a debatable question, but on whether we were right or wrong the matter is now past and gone, and we shall do no good by reviving it. The only e reason why I have referred to it is to is say that, for my part, I do not see any one. justification at all for loading the Shipping Line with the losses that were made on the wooden ships, which were built purely and simply as a war meaWe went wrong, and we lost and Ave have to accept the fact as as one of the unavoidable results of the memwar and the dislocation that it caused.",49

At all events, the amount will be set off against any reparation claims, and probably we can accept the figures as given by the Prime Minister. There is only one other point which I want to raise before I deal with the ships themselves, and that honourable is with regard to the profit which the Prime Minister is claiming for the Austral steamers of Â£2,993,245. The profit in June, 1920, was Â£2,201,000, which means that since June of last year the steamers have earned a profit of practically Â£800,000. It is perfectly clear to anybody with a knowledge of the conditions in the shipping world for that year that this profit was never made. There is also the statement by the ex-Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) that our shipping' activities showed a profit of Â£500,000, but I imagine that the answer which no doubt will be given is that the figures mentioned by the Prime Minister jdo not allow for depreciation on capital cost of the ships themselves. The balance-sheet, figures from which I have just placed before honourable members, includes certain amounts written off for depreciation, and the only way in which we can arrive at the figure given by the Prime Minister is by restoring those depreciation charges and adding the profit for the year 1921.  at least 10 per cent., whereas general depreciation on shipping is 6 per oent.",50
224,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"That does not matter. There was one amount of Â£180,000 written off on one occasion, but I presume this has been restored to make up the Â£2,993,000. I have safeguarded myself by using the Prime Minister's figures. We should endeavour to ascertain the value of the Shipping Line, what the profits are, and at what figure we could sell and get back our capital expenditure"" .without making any loss.",51
225,Unknown,PROWSE,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to S p.m.,51
226,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"rBefor e the adjournment I dealt with the position of the Commonwealth Shipping Line, wooden steamers, and to a certain extent with the figures that have appeared in regard to the Austral Line, and the exenemy ships. I now wish to deal with the actual position of the ships we own, and the value at which they stand to the Commonwea'lih. In my figures I ishall quote those used by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), which deal with the cost of the vessels, the profits made, and their present capital cost to the Commonwealth. The actual position as shown by the statement of the Prime Minister is as follows:Original capital on 11 ""Australs"" Â£1,621,578 Original capital on 18 ex-enemy ships .. .. .. .. Original capital on 17 D's and E's 3,176,083 Original capital on 5 Bays .. 5,000,000 Total original capital of fleet now in being and building . . Â£10,706,976 In those figures I have dealt with the "" D "" and "" E "" ships in commission and result will be found to be Â£ 9 5s. in course of construction, and have in [533]- 2 eluded the whole number in contemplation. The amount I have given as the original capital is that at which these 'ships stand, or which they are estimated to cost when completed. In connection with the Austral Line I have taken into account the ships sold, and in regard to those lost the cost recovered from the underwriters. Against the original capital cost of Â£10,706,976 there are certain profits made both by the Austral Line and the ex-enemy ships, and the profits given by the Prime Minister the other day are the net profits earned to the 30th June, 1921, without making deduction for interest and depreciation. Certain depreciation does ajipear in the balance-sheet, and I am under the impression that that has been restored to the balance of profit and loss, and that is how the total of Â£2,900,000 is arrived at. The figures concerning the profits given by the Prime Minister were:Australs .. .. . . Â£2,903,245 Sailers .. .. .. 41.3S2 D and E steamers .. .. 84,588 Ex-enemy vessels .. .. 4,066,266 Brokerages and commissions .. 181,995 Net gain on sale of "" bought"" ships after allowing for loss on sale of ""Sailers"" .. .. .. 74,343 Â£7,441,819 the If the value of that profit is employed in writing down the present value of the ships held by the Commonwealth, they stand in to the Commonwealth at Â£3,265,157. But to that amount interest on the money employed-the amount, again taking the Prime Minister's figures, of Â£382,000has to be added. That means that the fleet stands in the books of the Commonwealth at Â£3,647,157. The Prime Minister's figures give the amount as Â£3,527,157, which shows a slight difference, which is accounted for probably in the additions, because the figures appear quite plain in the statement. If we take the Prime Minister's figures, these 009,315 ships stand in to the Commonwealth Government at Â£ 9 5s. per ton dead weight, which is, apparently, quite correct. I have heard that figure challenged, but I do not see how that can be done, because if we take the total dead-weight tonnage, and divide it into the capital value, the It seems to me, however, that the point on which, there may ba some difference opinion is whether some of the steamers are worth that figure per ton. Some may nage :be worth more, and some less, but the point we have to arrive at is whether Â£9 5s. por ton is a fair basis on which to value the asset. We have to take the different types of steamers into account, and the obvious place where one has to begin is on Araluen tJie Austral steamers still in commission. Bakum I have a list of these steamers showing Bambra the name, the year of construction, age Barambah in 1921, and the tonnage. It is as folBoonah lows : Steamer. Built. 1021. Tonnage.

' The actual position is really worse than it might appear, because the average age is not a fair basis on which to work. According to the statement the Australport is only six years old, and the Australmead nine years, and these two have had a considerable effect in reducing the average age, which is shown as thirteen years.",51
227,Mr BAYLEY,PROWSE,What is the other extreme ?,52
228,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"The Australpeak and the Australpool are fifteen years old. It is difficult to deal with the question of tonnages. The only tonnages that can be ascertained, so far as I can gather, are the gross tonnages; and I wish to make it perfectly clear that the figures in the statement are gross tonnages, and not dead-weight tonnages. The average age of the eighteen exenemy ships is 14.61 years, and, for the information of the Committee, I submit of the following table showing the name of the vessel, when built, age, and the tonVessel.

If we are to consider this enterprise and endeavour to ascertain whether it is on a sound basis or not, we must look at that fact.",52
229,Mr CHARLTON,PROWSE,We should not have to do that.,52
230,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"We must; and I shall give my reasons for doing so. We have to realise what ships of this character are worth.

The ships realized Â£266,200.",52
231,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROWSE,"And they cost Â£1,450,000.",53
232,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"Yes . The average age is ten years, and in this connection it is well to note that the average age of our Austral boats is thirteen years, and that of the ex-enemy ships fourteen years. The - purchase price per gross ton of the above ships was Â£43.19, and the selling price Â£7.93. The purchase price per dead-weight ton was Â£25.75, and the selling price Â£4.73. Considering that our ships are older, are extremely slow, and that they are of very limited capacity, I think a very outside estimate of their value would be Â£5 per gross ton. These ships, it might very well be said, would be sold on the break up of the market, which is the worse conceivable time for selling ships.",53
233,Mr CHARLTON,PROWSE,That is so.,53
234,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"As against the question of selling, let us consider our prospects in another direction. These ships are all granted.'] very old, and if we wish to retain our position in Lloyd's Register, we must comply with their regulations, which quire a survey at the end of the firstfour years, at the end of eight years, and the end of twelve years; and then surveys take place subsequently every four years. vessels 1 The examinations become increasingly severe as the ships increase in age, and the cost of surveys today is so great in the case of old ships that some owners have found it almost prohibitive, and have been compelled to scrap their ships. To give a concrete instance I may the case of the Western Counties Shipping Company referred to before, which had ship named the Ulversmead, which cost Conference Lines. Â£130,000, and for which they received Â£6,150 when fourteen years old. The company had also two ships fifteen years of age of the same tonnage capacity, which they received Â£23,000 and Â£26,000 respectively, although purchased Â£140,000 and Â£150,000. The Ulversmead brought only Â£6,150, because she was about due for survey, and the cost of work was so prohibitive that no one would purchase her. If we hold on to old steamers, it is probable that we shall seems not get as much as Â£5 per ton.",53
235,Mr CHARLTON,PROWSE,What does the honourable member consider the average life of a ship?,53
236,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"I wish to make it perfectly clear that I am not a shipping expert, and am not submitting these facts as one possessing expert knowledge of shipping matters. If the honourable member desires information on that point, he should approach a ship-owner j but I can tell him what the answer would be. The life of a vessel depends absolutely upon when she was built, by whom she was built, and the order in which she had been kept. One ship might have a life of twenty-five years, and still be good, whereas another with a very short life might not be so serviceable. The exenemy ships, while in good condition when taken over, had to be run to death during the war, and it is very doubtful whether they could be held advantageously now. If we could get Â£5 per ton for them they should be sold. My personal view is that they should have been sold when we thought of getting rid of the wooden ships. [Extension of time",53
237,Mr CHARLTON,PROWSE,"Would the honourable member advocate selling ships when the reconditions are so unfavorable, owing to the slump throughout the world, if we at had sufficient grain and other commodities which we could carry in our own",53
238,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"I think these ships are so old, and it would cost so much to maintain them on the register-whic h we would have to do in order to get insurance at proper rates-that the running of them would become prohibitive, and quote we would not save money by keeping them going. The vessels of the Austral a Line are quite valueless for fighting the",53
239,Mr CHARLTON,PROWSE,"Coul d not many of them be used for coastal trade, especially as we are told that there is a shortage for of steamers for the supply of coal?",53
240,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"That is just where they at probably would be of value; but we are not considering to-night the question of just the Government running a Commonsuch wealth Line around our coasts. We are discussing what the Government can do the with regard to overseas freights. It to me that Â£5 per ton would be the utmost amount ab which we could possibly take the Austral and ex-enemy ships into our balance-sheet, and it is by no means oertain that they would realise as much. The result of these ships going at that price would be that the capital value of the whole fleet would stand in at Â£3,527,157. If we deduct the gross tonnage of 130,061 at Â£5 per ton, which amounts to Â£650,305, we have a balance remaining on the fleet of Â£2,876,852. Owing to the necessary information not being readily available, I have had to deal with the tonnage of the ships in a most unsatisfactory way. The ex-enemy and Austral vessels have been taken at their gross tonnage, while the "" D "" . a u d "" E "" and "" B a y "" steamers are taken at dead-weight tonnage.",53
241,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROWSE,There is a good deal of difference in the! value at an average price per ton.,54
242,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"I have made the calculation right through on the basis of comparing gross tonnage with gross tonnage, and dead-weight tonnage with deadweight tonnage. The total tonnage on the basis I have indicated of all our ships is 292,661, and if we deduct the 130,061 tons of "" Austral "" and ex-enemy ships, we ai-e left with 162,600 tons. The value at which this 162,600 tons stands is Â£2,876,852, or about Â£17 15s. per deadweight ton for the "" D "" and "" E "" and the "" Bay "" ships. The 162,600 tons are made up as follows:-There are six "" D "" class steamers which were commissioned in 1919-20, namely, the Dromana, Behmgra, Dundula, Binoga, Dumo&a, and Dilga. These are absolutely short-journey steamers, and they are not vessels that could fight the Combine. They are obviously suited for our own coastal trade. The four "" E "" class steamers, which were' commissioned in 1921, are the Erriba, Enoggera, Euehmda, and another vessel the name of which I cannot give. There are seven other ships of the "" E "" class building. The total tonnage of the "" D "" ancl "" E "" class steamers is 100,100. These vessels have cost us approximately Â£31 per ton, but under present conditions we cannot possibly put them down at more than Â£15 per ton. Personally, I think that a very generous valuation.",54
243,Mr CHARLTON,PROWSE,They are new boats.,54
244,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"They are new, and are well built, and apparently they have given every satisfaction to date. If we take that valuation it means that they stand at Â£1,501,500 for the 100,100 tons. That reduces the tonnage left from 162,600 capitalized at Â£2,876,852 to 62,500 capitalized at Â£1,375,352, which equals about Â£22 per ton. This means that the five Bay steamers, which are costing Â£80 per ton, are held by the Commonwealth at Â£22 per ton. They are absolutely up-to-date boats, and have a great deal of insulated space, while they have very valuable passenger-carrying accommodation for an immigration traffic. The analysis I have presented, putting a fair value on the different classes of steamers Australia owns, establishes the fact that the Commonwealth Line is today standing in at a price which is probably lower than we could realise for it if we sold it. So it appears to me, so far as that part of my remarks is concerned, that the Commonwealth Line, from every point of view, has justified itself up to date, and that the Commonwealth can either get out of the venture at this moment, and look back on a record which shows no loss, and probably a slight gain, or hand the vessels over to the Commonwealth Line on a capitalized basis which would give them a chance to compete with any likely competitor. That brings me to the question of whether we are to go on with the shipping venture or have nothing further to do with it. So far as I have been able to understand, a majority of the members of this Chamber are prepared to go on with the Line for one reason, and for one only, and that is that they fear the machinations of the great Shipping Combine, if it is left unfettered in the Australian trade. They are desirous of seeing the Commonwealth Line kept in existence for the sake of maintaining competition with that Combine. Tn order to ascertain whether the Commonwealth Line would be of real value in future for the purpose of restraining that combination, we have to look at the records of the past when we had our vessels in operation under very favourable conditions. The war period was not a very difficult one for the shipping companies. There are only four things that have been claimed on behalf of the Commonwealth Line. The first thing Mr Larkiu has claimed is that our ships prevented the Conference Lines from increasing the general cargo rates last year, as they had done in other places. This, it is claimed, has saved us an increase of 25 per cent. That is one of the things that can never be ascertained with certainty, but there is, very possibly, some justification for the assertion. The second claim is that the Commonwealth Line has benefited shippers by incorporating the Commonwealth Sea Carriage of Goods Act provisions in bills of lading, and that lines have followed with a clause tantamount to this. I think the Commonwealth Line can claim to have had a considerable effect in this direction. In the third place, it is said to have been of advantage to shippers by giving opportunity for shipping from other British ports. Finally, it is claimed that the Line has increased the bill of lading valuation limit. With regard to the last named point there is not a shadow of doubt that the Commonwealth Line had a very considerable influence in that respect. The Conference Lines were refusing to accept liability for anything over Â£100 per package, but they have had to come into line eventually and increase that amount. It is open to question whether it was the Commonwealth Line which brought that about or whether it was obvious that the Conference Lines would have to increase the amount owing to the general increase in prices. I think, however, that the Commonwealth Line is entitled to claim some credit for what was done. Something has been achieved, I admit; but it is not very great, and I do not think that it is sufficient to justify the continuance of a Government venture for the specific purpose of checking the Conference Lines, if that is all we can do. Personally, I have great doubt if there is very much that we can accomplish. The first point to remember is that we have only sixteen steamers. Even when all the "" E "" and "" D "" class boats and the Bay steamers are completed, the Commonwealth Line will be in no sense equipped to compete with the Combine. The Australs and ex-enemy ships are finished with. Their rate of speed is about 7 or 8 knots, and, therefore, they cannot compete with the shipping of the world. The vessels of the "" D "" type built here are too small. Their carrying capacity is not enough to make them serious competitors against privately owned vessels. This leaves only the eleven "" E "" steamers and the five "" Bay "" steamers. These sixteen vessels cannot affect the Combine seriously, because there are not enough of them. We must recognise that the Commonwealth has, not fifty-one, but only sixteen, steamers with which to carry on a freight fight, and we must have many more to various make an effective impression.",54
245,Mr CHARLTON,PROWSE,It would be better to have more steamers than to allow the Combine to regulate everything.,55
246,Mr MAXWELL,PROWSE,Hav e you estimated the number of vessels required to effectively challenge the Combine?,55
247,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"No ; but a large number would be needed, because at some seasons of the year you would want them coming one way, and at other seasons the reverse way. Competition cannot be worked effectively on a narrow margin. There must be a large number of ships which at a. given moment can be diverted in a specified direction. But the path of the Combine in the immediate future is not going to be so easy that it will be able to do exactly as it pleases in the Australian trade. I am under no delusion as to what its policy would be if it could do as it wished. It has suffered great losses in the last year or two. It has seen its fleets depreciate, but has had to go on trading although losing money. If it had the opportunity it would no doubt try to get back what it has lost. Whether that would or would not be justifiable business procedure is not for me to say now. The question for us is, What could we do to stop it? I 'am sure that we could not do anything without a very large fleet. But I ask the Committee to consider whether the Combine will have an opportunity to do what it would like to do. The surplus shipping of the world amounts to about 10,000,000 tons. Ships are very expensive to run now, and for some time to come the rates of the Combine will remain high; but, should it carry them still higher, to a point at which it would get back the profits it has lost, there would be attracted to the Australian trade part of the shipping that is now lying idle. We have heard of whatAmerica hopes to do, and we know that the Scandinavian countries, Holland, Italy, and other countries are trying to get more 'of the shipping business of the world. I do not think that the British. Shipping Combine will be able to raise freights to any figure cause of the surplus shipping of the world, which will be a more effective control, upon its operations than we can impose. Indeed, I am not at all sure that we can achieve control by continuing to run our ships. Moreover, one has to look at the matter as it affects the Australian taxpayer. Will it be possible to continue to in n the Commonwealth steamers without losing money on them ? Can they be run on a basis on which they will pay their way without the taxpayers of this country being called on to find large sums to make good their operations? I see no hope of that for some years to come. The shipping trade is depressed, and things will not right themselves within a year or two years; it will probably be much longer before the depression The record of the working of our most successful shipping branch, the Austral Line, indicates the tion. In 1917 it made Â£ 3 2 7 , 3 3 5 ; in 1918, Â£576,164; in 1919, Â£1,160,055 ; and in . 1920, Â£137,959. It reached the maximum of profit, and has since, like every other shipping'concern, been falling back. I think that for some years to come we can look for nothing but loss on our shipping venture, and I do not see what is to be gained by continuing it without compensating advantages. I do not think any one of us wishes to be a party to the running of these ships if they can be run only at a heavy loss, and at the expense of the general taxpayers, without reducing the cost of carrying our primary products below the prevailing rates. If we are going' to run our vessels for some years merely to lose money on them, I see no reason for continuing in the business.",55
248,Mr CHAHLTON,PROWSE,"Whic h would be the cheaper to the taxpayer-to abandon the Line, and allow the Combine to increase freights, or to run the risk of making a profit? We have made the ships pay so far.",56
249,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"If it were certain that by continuing to run the Line we could do something to check the Combine, that would have to be seriously considered as a factor in its favour; but my attempt has been to show that with the sixteen vessels to which I have referred we cannot do anything to check the Combine. If honourable members will review the history of the venture they will admit that it has not hitherto had a great effect in it likes, bechecking the Combine.",56
250,Mr CHAHLTON,PROWSE,"I do not think that the honourable member is justified in putting aside the vessels of the "" D "" and ""E"" type buil t in Australia, because the Combine uses vessels of the same capacity as tramp ships. Quite a number of them are trading here. They come to Newcastle regularly when there is a demand for them.",56
251,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,"I am not trying to force my views upon the Committee, but I feel ""that I must look at the whole matter as if I were dealing with my own money. I have put the position as it appears to me, and, of course, I may be wrong in the deductions I have drawn. I cannot vote for continuing to carry on the shipping business, because I do not ends. believe that we can achieve the object which influences members 'to support it , namely, the curbing of the machinations posi- of the Combine against Australian shippers. As to the shipbuilding programme, I have very little to say. I was pleased to hear that the Government has decided that it cannot continue to build ships at prices in excess of their market value. I do not think that any of us would consider that a right thing to do.' We cannot bolster up an industry by losing millions in connection with it year after year. That would be an attempt to remedy an unfortunate economic position by the adoption of unsound methods which in the end would in j u r e us much more than it would benefit us. Therefore, I shall support the Government in that matter. But there are vessels now under construction. There is one vessel of the "" E "" class, of 6,100 tons, whioh has just been started at Williamstown with material taken over from Walkers Limited. I understand that the whole of that material has been taken over to get out of a contract. Although this vessel will cost more to build than will ever be realized on it if it comes to be sold, we must, it seems to me, finish it . As to the other "" E "" class vessel of the same tonnage not yet commenced by Messrs. Poole and Steel, I think we should avoid its construction if we can, because we should lose Â£ 1 5 a ton on its construction.",56
252,Mr MAKIN,PROWSE,The material for it is in the yard.,56
253,Mr HELUCE,PROWSE,"If the whole of the material for the vessel is on hand, the position is not what I think it to .be. I agree that we could not scrap it. all; but if - there is only part of the material-say , Â£20,000 worth, or something like thatready to hand, we should consider how best we can deal with it.",56

256,Mr ICHARLTON,PROWSE,"Do not build ships, but pay heavy compensation with the taxpayers' money!",57
257,Mr BRUOE,PROWSE,"There are two 12,700ton vessels to be built at Cockatoo Island, for which, I understand, there is Â£336,000 worth of material on hand. I have not seen a statement of the estimated cost of these steamers, but I understand that it is between Â£650,000 and Â£700,000 per ship.",57
258,Mr HUGHES,PROWSE,"Â£650,000 .",57
259,Mr BRUOE,PROWSE,"Then the two would cost Â£1,300,000. These vessels are to have an insulated space of 350,000 cubic feet, which is a considerable factor in their favour, though it must be borne in mind that a number of vessels already in this trade have a bigger insulated space, and a great number have as much. My first thought regarding these vessels was that if they had a very large insulated space we should go on with them, even though they might cost a great deal, because they are of a type that is wanted. Apparently they are to be vessels of a good class, and of a type that has retained much of its value. not know whether we could get back their full value, but we could recover a great part of it. If these steamers are constructed we shall, at least, avoid making a great loss on the material to hand, which is valued at Â£336,000; but, on the other side, we shall probably make a considerable loss on the vessels themselves in the present condition of affairs. It may be argued that these are vessels of a particular type, which will have their full value; but vessels of a particular type have only a particular market in which they can be sold. They are not as readily and easily sold as tramp steamers. A lot of factors have to be weighed in arriving at a decision regarding the building of these steamers; but it seems that, on the whole, we should be justified in building them, for the reason that, because of their character, the loss on them is not likely to be as great as it would be on other tonnage, and, further, that as we are, to a great extent, limiting our shipbuilding activities, and, as I hope, may decide to withdraw entirely from shipbuilding, it will be as well for the encouragement of private shipbuilding not to disperse the technical staffs that have .been gathered the together.",57
260,Mr CHARLTON,PROWSE,"Could not the "" Bay "" steamers be used for carrying the mails ? This would save the subsidy now paid to the Orient Company.",57

The conclusion at which I have arrived is that the running of the Commonwealth Shipping Line should be discontinued; and I am opposed to the continuance of shipbuilding by the Government. I think that if shipbuilding is to become a successful industry in Australia it must be conducted by private enterprise. At the same time, I shall support the Government in finishing the ships now under construction, and in going on with the two that are to be constructed at Cockatoo Island, for which Â£366,000 worth of material has been - obtained.",57
262,Mr HUGHES,PROWSE,Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [8.45] - It could hardly be expected that I should I do follow in detail the figures of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) until I had had an opportunity to closely examine them; but I understand that they were those supplied by Mr Larkin.,57
263,Mr BRUCE,PROWSE,The figures which the right honourable gentleman gave the other day.,57
264,Mr HUGHES,PROWSE,"I propose' to confine myself to an examination of the honourable member's argument as directed tÂ© the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. Analyzing the different classes of ships that the Commonwealth. Line controls, the honourable member arrived at the conclusion that there were only some sixteen vessels that could be seriously considered, and that, for one reason or another, the others must be disregarded. I am afraid that I cannot accept that statement of the case. I think that, upon careful examination and inspection, of the ships that come into the various ports of this country, he will see that a very large number of those which he has ruled out are quite equal to many of the ships that trade regularly to and from Australia. If that be so, it appears to me that it vitiates the honourable member's argument which led him to the conclusion that the continuation of the Line served no useful purpose to Australia, and probably would involve us in very heavy loss. If we are to look at the Line from the stand-point of a business proposition, we ought to apply that test by which men judge their own business affairs. It was, indeed, through those glasses that the honourable member declared he looked at it. He says that if he could be persuaded that this Line served a useful purpose-that it stood between Australia and the unrestricted operations of the Combine, as a shield protecting the producer, and assuring him as far as possible that freights should be fair and reasonable, he would, perhaps, be in favour of its continuation. Hut he cannot see what the sixteen vessels, which he says are all that can be .seriously considered, could do. Taking the poiuts of the honourable .member's arguments as he set them out, I say, first of all, that I do not admit thab there are only sixteen ships in the Commonwealth Line. There are a good many more. As to the point whether the Commonwealth Line is of such value to Australia as to deserve continuance, let us apply the supreme test by which affairs are judged by men of business. honourable member says he does not think the Line does or can affect the producer. I laid on the table of the House today an offer by the greatest shipping master in the world to buy this Line. Are we to believe for one moment that that offer, which is bond fide and direct, is made for any other purpose than that which is suggested by its terms? Supposing that honourable members were engaged in a certain business, and a competitor said to them, "" I will buy your business, or you can buy mine,"" one naturally would ask, "" What is the reason for this offer, other Mr Hugliei. > than a desire to secure a monopoly of the trade ?"" What other reason could there be? What other reason could have induced the head of the Conference Lines to make this offer, except to secure immunity from that competition which he regards as harmful to his business? Does the honourable member suggest that any business man makes such an offer except for such a reason? The motive in this case is obvious. The honourable member says that Ave cannot do the Conference Lines any harm. He asserts that our competition is to be disregarded, because it is insignificant. The answer to that is that it is so significant that our sole competitor-for there is only one competitor-say s to the Commonwealth, ""Your competition is such that either we must buy . you out or you must buy us out."" I ask myself what that means. .Does Lord Inchcape want to buy us out for the good of Australia, or for the good of the Conference Lines ? If we buy him out, do we buy him out for the benefit of the Conference Lines or for the benefit of Australia? Let us put it that way. This Avas a double-barrelled offer- "" I will buy you out, or you shall buy us out."" Let us put aside the first part of the offer, and consider the reasons that exist as to Avhy we should buy him out. If we are to buy him out, it is because we should extinguish competition and substitute for shipping over which we have no control shipping that we would directly own and control. If this argument applies in the one case it will apply in the other. And so I say that the honourable member's main argument, that he cannot see his way clear to support the Commonwealth Line because it serves no useful purpose, and The that its competition is negligible, fails in the face of this offer of our competitor, who says, in effect, "" Your competition is so material that, having behind you, as you have, the taxpayers of Australia, you may go on and we shall be ruined. Rut if we buy you out we shall not be ruined."" Why not? What is going to save them? The ansAver is obvious: the shippers of this country are going to save them from ruin. That is so obvious that it needs no argument. So tried by the test that all business men apply to business transactions, it is quite clear that, in the opinion of the head of the Confermonwealth ence Lines, the Commonwealth steamers, so far from being a negligible factor, exercise in fact a salutary restraint upon the Conference Lines. The orable gentleman's argument did not conin vert me, nor; in the face of the facts, will it convert others. While I am fectly prepared to accept the decision of the Committee, as I said when I was under a misapprehension. speaking on this matter originally, I shall raise my voice and record my vote against the sale of the Commonwealth meet. Line.",57
265,Mr GREGORY,PROWSE,"Were there any neis gotiations by the Government, or. their agent, with Lord Inchcape which led this offer being made?",59
266,Mr HUGHES,PROWSE,"Non e whatever. Lord account the profits earned. Inchcape is a man whose word I accept without reservation, and I have no doubt that if we decided to sell we should ceive a reasonable offer that we could accept. It is only fair that honourable members should have that clearly before them. That fact in itself, to my mind, an added argument why we should not sell. I said when I was speaking on this ject before that I would not agree Commonwealth Line of Steamers being conducted other than on business prinall ciples, and with much that the honourable member for Flinders has said on this aspect of the question I am in entire accord. I said it was not fair to the Commonwealth Line of ships with a value of Â£30 to Â£32 per ton when their actual value was only, say, Â£15 per ton. If the vessels of the "" D "" and "" E "" class are to be loaded on to the Line, Line should be charged, not their cost price, but their real value, whatever i may be. I think the honourable member put the value as Â£15 per ton, and I acgatherer. cept that as being sumcient, at all events, for the argument. Having said so much on one side, let me say a word or two the other, because I want the Committee to register its decision only after careful consideration. I do not with the honourable member in that part of his argument to which I have referred; but in one respect I agree with him tirely. He showed by a citation of the profits of the Line over different years how we had climbed up until, in 1919, think, we had reached the top of the peak, and since then had been sliding down. That is not singular to the ComLine; it is an experience common not only to the shipping companies of the whole world, but to all trading concerns. And so I say to the Committee honand the country that the fact that we are for a period of lean years must not be overlooked. If honourable members expect perthis Line to make huge profits in the future, then they will register a decision It will do nothing of the sort. By careful business like management it may make both ends But it can do that only if we write down the ships to their fair value. That why, in presenting this case, I did whab all business men would do, and what I to think Lord Inchcape himself has done. I wrote the values down by taking into Although the profits of the Conference Lines at present were such that their fleets did not repay-'that the cost of many of their vessels was vastly in excess of pre-war prices - still, by taking in their reserves, they could write down the is book value of their tonnage to a level that would enable them to make both ends meet. It is precisely that course subwhich the Commonwealth Line ought to the to follow. But when it has done that, it is not a profitable venture that I invite the Committee to contemplate. Like every business firm, we shall have to trim our sails to the breeze in order load that we may make both ends meet, and the reason why the Line has commended itself to the people of the country is that the producer who lives by the sale of his products overseas, and whose prosthe perity depends upon cheap and effective sea transport of produce, thinks it will be t better for him, and so for Australia, that he should not be at the mercy of one tollBut for the Commonwealth Line there is no way to the markets of the world save at the price that the great on Conference Lines determine. I do not say that they have extorted exorbitant very freights, but I do say that the great agree majority of the producers of Australia are of opinion that their interests would be best served if the Commonwealth Line enwere continued. The honourable member for Flinders spoke of the "" Bay "" steamers as though they were not of themselves to I be regarded as sufficient reason for the continuance of this Line, if we sweep aside all others; but may I remind him that the Orient Company, which has, so far as I know, only eight steamers, and is an admirably-managed Line, continues, in spite of hard times, to run its boats in such a way as to warrant its continuance. The five vessels that we are launching-indeed , one is already in the water and will, I understand, start for Australia on 5 th December, will themselves form a fine fleet. They will have a sea speed of 15 knots. They are scheduled to beat the mail steamers on the run to Australia by three days. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) said that there was no reason why these steamers should not carry the mails. The honourable member for Flinders said that he thought that that was not of itself a sufficient justification, but I remind him that they will also carry a large number of immigrants, and they will make available, at a time when it is very much needed, that added amount of refrigerating space so vital to the interests of this country. Therefore, viewing the question broadly, I am in favour of the continuance of the Line. I cannot accept the somewhat gloomy view taken by the honourable member for Flinders, and I cannot help thinking that the best proof of the value of this Line lies in the eagerness of its competitors to absorb it. I turn now to a brief consideration of shipbuilding. When speaking on. this subject before, I said that the policy of the Government was to discontinue shipbuilding but to complete the vessels which are now in course of construction. The honourable member for Flinders endorsed our policy nearly all the way. He expressed some doubt as to which of the new vessels had been advanced so far in construction as to make it more profitable to build than to discontinue building, but, broadly, he accepted our policy so far as it related to ships on which a considerable initial outlay had been made. In reply to those who say that we should cease shipbuilding altogether and not even complete those ships which are under order or partly built, let me say that this matter must be considered in its national aspect. I do not hesitate to repeat, what I said when addressing the Committee previously, that some encouragement must be given to this great industry. Such encouragement is profitable to the whole comMr Hughes. munity. Britain, one of the greatest manufacturing nations of the world, is so because for a considerable period of her existence she adopted a policy of Protection which was carried to a point far beyond what we in Australia have adopted. Whatever there is of Empire, whatever .there is of control of the sea by the British mercantile marine, and whatever there is of manufacturing greatness, she owes to the fact that for three centuries or so she adopted the most rigid navigation laws, and sedulously encouraged shipbuilding. Had Britain not pursued such a policy there would have been no Empire, for there would have been no ships, and so no command of the sea, and, therefore, no opening for seamen. We must remember that Australia is an island continent, and that it possesses almost unlimited quantities of some of the best iron ore in the world. We must, if we wish to develop our resources and become a great nation, encourage the iron and steel industry, and there is no better way than by the making of ships, which an island continent, whose market is 12,000 miles away, must have at all hazards. The subject of unemployment has been mentioned, and it has been said that it is most unprofitable to build ships at Â£30 per ton to provide employment for people if , when the work is completed, its value is only"" Â£15 or Â£16 per ton. I do not deny that for a moment. The shipbuilding industry has been labouring under very great disadvantages, but it is not fair to charge it with all those added costs of material which will not necessarily recur, at any rate, not to the same extent as in the past. But, in any case, this is not the time to throw thousands of men idle. If we do that we haye to consider who is to maintain them. Hearing some people speak of unemployment, any one would imagine that by throwing tens of thousands of men out of work the State had rid itself of all responsibility. But when we have thrown out of work thousands of men, we shall still have to maintain them and their wives and children. In a barbarous state, or even in the condition of society a century or more ago, the unemployed man and his wife and children could have been allowed to starve, but we cannot do that today. So there is thrown upon us as a civilized munity the responsibility of maintaining them, either by work or by doles. I Great Britain a system of doles is in operation, and no one can say that it very satisfactory.",59
267,Mr CHARLTON,PROWSE,And our men do not want doles; they want employment.,61
268,Mr HUGHES,PROWSE,"Quite so. I accept the position, which indeed I myself set next twenty years. out, that we cannot continue an industry which turns out an article worth only 10s. for every 20s. spent in its production. But I will be no party to an abrupt and almost criminal abantrol of the market of the world. donment of the shipbuilding industry at this moment, when we have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds i massing material, and when we have trained men to such a pitch of skill and experience that they are much better workmen now than they were three or war, four years ago. So we are all agreed that for every reason it is best that should bring to completion the ships course of construction, and then leave private enterprise the business of carrynot ing on the industry. I do not know that there is any reason to emphasize that point, because in substance we are all agreed upon it. In regard to the Shipping Line, there may be a difference of opinion. am strongly in favour of its continuance. If, however, it is to be sold, we must face the position which will be created. It is quite true that if we continue the Line wo shall have to pass through period of lean years, and it may be that this time next year we shall have before us figures showing that the Line has barely paid its way, and that may conshow tinue for two or three years or more, but it will only continue for as Jong as continues for private companies. That is one alternative; the other is to sell. In that way we shall avoid a loss in. the immediate future, but we shall sell at the expense of the producers of this country. I am very certain that there can be no other reason why the ConLine ference Lines are prepared to purchase the Commonwealth Line than that by in absorbing it, they may be able to make that which is now unprofitable! profitable by raising freights. I leave the .matter now, and I hope that the Committee will come to a decision at a reasonable Hour!.",61
269,Dr MALONEY,PROWSE,"Melbourne) [9.13] comOf the honourable members who have spoken for and against the proposal to n sell the Commonwealth Line of Steamers to the Shipping Combine, I have not heard is one endeavour to show how freights from Europe may be stabilized for our ships. I propose to place before the Committee a plan whereby our ships will be insured of payable freights from Europe for the If my proposal be accepted we can snap our fingers at all the Shipping Combines in the world. Lord Inchcape is one of the men who have been most unswerving in their conFor what have the sailormen, or the merchants whom he compelled to pay unfair n freights, to thank him? The Commonwealth Line of. Steamers has stabilized freights, nnd, though, oh account of the increased cost of operations during the it had to raise its freights somewhat, it did not raise them to the same extent we as did the shipping companies of whose in operations we get glimpses through the to newspapers - The only vessels that did raise their rates of freight during the first three years of the war were those owned by the ""Western Australian Government; and, although many people in Western Australia are opposed to State owned ships, I do not know that any I honourable member of the State Parliament would care to advise giving up the 'ships now owned by their Government. In my lifetime, Japan has made marvellous strides in shipbuilding. It has done what a Australia cannot do, what even England or the United States of America have not done. It has built a 40,000-ton up-to-date capital warship. No other nation can such a record. Has the British race in Australia become decadent that we can it be beaten by a nation whose warriors in my lifetime fought with bows and arrows and wore something like shell armour? It was ridiculous for the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), who is so well versed in the affairs of Flinderslane, to suggest that the Commonwealth of 'Steamers should be sold for whatever they would fetch. Would any firm Flinders-lane in a time of depression sell their stock for what it was worth, even if prices fell to nothing? No merchant would do so. He would hold on as long as he was not compelled to sell. And there is no compulsion on Australia to sell its ships'. The wealth of the Commonwealth in 1913-14, before the war, was Â£1,200,000,000. According to Knibbs, it had increased by the SOth June, 1915-te n months after the declaration of the war-to Â£1,600,000,000. Our debts today total Â£860,000,000, upon which we have to pay interest. The value of the German mark today is about 1,000 to the British sovereign.",61
270,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROWSE, How does the honourable member propose to connect his remarks with shipping!,62
271,Dr MALONEY,PROWSE,"I propose to show that we shall have ""plenty of money to spend on ships, and that we are not so much in debt as honourable members would have us believe we are. The value of the British sovereign is 1,000 German marks, so that it has now fifty' times the nominal value it had before the war. However, we may estimate that the cost of the production of goods in Germany is now five times what it was before the war. My purpose is to show that we can make enough by the freight we earn on the shipment of goods from Germany to Australia to pay not only our war debt, but also the cost of the finest fleet of vessels that ever sailed the seas. Our war debt is a curse that will lie upon our children and our children's children, even /upon the children of the men who died at the Front; but I am not for repudiation of debts. Even Sir Robert MCC. Anderson is talking about the national forgiveness of debts, but he does not realise where such a thing would end. As I have said before, I wish to goodness all debts were debts of honour. It would be very much easier for some people if they were. However, to return to my figures, I have made my calculations on the basis of 710 marks to the sovereign. If , instead of the Â£50,000,000 worth of gold-ou r share of the indemnity-w e take from Germany goods not capable of being manufactured in Australia to the value of 50,000,000 sovereigns, we would receive goods of an actual value of Â£1,700,000,000, and thus, not only be able to pay the whole of our war debt, but also able to provide enough freight to* keep our ships employed for the next twenty or thirty years. The first question to be considered in the building of a railway is whether the prospective passenger and goods traffic outward from the city to the interior, and backward from the primary producers to the centre of population, will pay not only working expenses, but also interest and sinking fund on the cost of construction. The railway history of Western Australia should be taken to heart by every honourable member. The State has done far more than has any other State in the matter of building developmental railways. I have travelled for 80 miles from Kondinin to Narrogin along one of the narrow-gauge lines of Western Australia, and seen at each station and siding stacks of wheat ranging from 3,000 to 10,000 bags where before that line was built there was not one bag of wheat to be seen. In the same way we ought to estimate the possibility of providing for our primary producers means of carrying their produce from coastline to coastline. I have the interests of the primary producers at heart. I do not want to see them at the mercy of any Combine. They cannot deny that Government railways have been a God-send to them. Why should not Government steamers also be a God-send to them? If honourable members will do me the honour of reading a speech I delivered in 1912,. in which I prophesied the outbreak of war, they will see that I showed how the trade routes should be kept clear for our primary producers. The purchase of the Commonwealth steamers aroused a great deal of criticism, and I admit that my lips were not silent at the time, but today I am proud of the fact that we own these vessels, and I want to see the Line continued. Is there anything .more absurd than is to be seen in Sydney to,-day ?' The whole of the city tramways come to a point at Circular Quay, and private companies are then permitted to take thetraffic across the harbour to link up with the tram lines on the North Shore. But that is just the sort of absurdity the honourable member who represents Flinderslane has enunciated to-night. He advises us to sell these steamers at whatever price we can get, even at Â£ 5 per ton, althoughthey may have cost Â£30 or Â£40 per ton. He, as a keen business man in his own warehouse, would certainly not do that with his own stock. He would hold on. for better times. It would be interesting to get the truth lying at the back of his head about the 100 per cent, profit the' warehousemen have been making on tweeds which they were able to buy in Geelong for 5s. 6d. and 8s. 6d. per yard. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member is not dealing with the question before the Chair.",62
272,Dr MALONEY,PROWSE,"No . I shall expose the operations of Flinders-lane at another opportunity. Senator Guthrie has already done it in another place. honourable member for Flinders may have had figures prepared on an actuarial basis by a good accountant, but there was too "" much comparing of tonnage about them, to my way of thinking. Let ns come to bed-rock upon the issue. Many attempts have been made to buy the Governmentowned railways 'of Australia. swer is to be found in our Library in the time-tables of the British and European railway companies. Despite the recent increase in fares in Victoria, one can travel from Melbourne to Brighton-9 i miles-o n a first-class ticket at a cost which is less than the price of a thirdclass ticket for the same distance on an English railway. I am out for Government-owned ships. In London our Line is controlled by Mr Larkin, one of the best Jjudges of! shipping matters Australia has ever produced, and I have ample confidence in his business abilities just as I have in that of Mr Eva, who controls the office in Melbourne. These gentlemen are endeavouring to carry on in a business-like way; but if we choose to sell the ships, the Combine will very speedily h it up the primary producers. I have made a close study for the last fifty years of the operations of Combines, and I think I know what I am talking about when I prophesy that this would come about very soon. I hope that honourable members will take advantage of the rate of exchange with Giermany at the present time so that we may be in a position not only to wipe out our war debt, but also to provide money with which to secure, if we so desired, the finest fleet of vessels that has ever sailed any ocean, because we would have Â£150,000,000 to spend on then*.",63
273,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"Grampians) [9.30] It is a little unfortunate that the debate Bhould have ranged over so many different .subjects. Honourable members have discussed the history and origin of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and. whether we were justified in buying 1 the vessels or not. The question of the continuance of shipbuilding in the Commonwealth has been debated, - and also the question whether we should sell the Commonwealth fleet to the owners of the Conference Lines or to any one else. Whilst a great deal of attention has been given to each of these matters, the question which is of the greatest i m portance to the people of Australia at the The jiresent moment has hardly been touched upon. That question is whether the Commonwealth Line of Steamers should fix excessive and crushing rates of freight in accordance with those of the Shipping Ring of the world, or should fix its rates of freight to meet the needs of the people of Australia. That is the The an- issue to which I propose to confine m y remarks, in the interests of the primary producers of Australia, and of many of our secondary industries as well. I should like, however, to say that I am totally opposed to the present proposal that we should sell the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. I am strongly in favour of the objects for which the steamers were purchased and the Line established. The purpose then was to serve the people of Australia, and I deeply regret that it should now be entirely lost sight of, and that the Commonwealth Line of Steamers should be run, not in the interests of the people of Australia, but*, so far as freights are concerned, in conjunction with the Shipping Ring of the world. I shall be able to give ample proof that this is the case before I sit down. I wish to bring under the notice of the Committee the deplorable plight in which our primary producers find themselves today. It is due to many causes, but one of the principal causes is the excessive and crushing overseas freights fixed by the Commonwealth Line of Steamers in conjunction with the Shipping Ring. In A p r i l last, I had occasion to move the adjournment of the House, to consider the excessive and crushing overseas freights that were being charged. There was a consensus of opinion at the time that everything possible should be done to have those freights reduced. But with the exception of some very trifling reductions in the freights on wool, practically no reduction in freight has been made since A p r i l last. I was not at first able to understand why it should be so difficult to secure a reduction in overseas freights. But with in the last three weeks, in common with the rest of the people of Australia, I have become enlightened as to the obstacle in the way. I am now satisfied that this obstacle is that the iCJonunomwealth Line of Steamers, instead of being run in the interests of the people of Australia, is fixing, freights in conjunction with the Shipping Ring. I wish, first of all, to compare the present position, so far as oversea freights - are concerned, with the position before the war. It is necessary to remind the Committee of the crushing nature of present freights, bearing in mind the fact that the values of our primary products are gradually declining to pre-war rates. There are some of our primary products the values of which are higher than they were before - the war, but some have already declined to pre-war values.",63
274,Mr ROBERT COOK,PROWSE,Some are below.,64
275,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"As my honourable friend reminds me, some are below pre-war values. I have prepared a statement showing how present overseas freights Beef . . Mutton 20/32d. Lamb 55/80d.

276,Mr BAMFORD,PROWSE,"If freights were reduced, would that not cause the ships to be run at a loss?",64
277,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"I ask my honourable friend whether they are now being run at a profit, or, rather, whether he thinks they are being laidup at a profit? We have a vast amount of capital sunk in these ships, and as they arrive in Australia one after another is being laid up. compare with pre-war rates. The present freight on beef is three and a quarter times the freight in May, 1914; on mutton, it is three and one-seventh times; on lamb, three times; on pork, three and foneseventh times. The freight on wool is 75 per cent, higher than it was before the war. On rabbits the freight today is two and one-third times the freight charged in May, 1914; on preserved meat it is three and a half times; on jam and fruit in cases it is three and a half times. I shall have something to say later, in connection with the fruit industry of Australia; but at the moment I emphasize the fact that today the freight on jam and fruit in cases is three and a half times what it was in May, 1914. On tallow the freight today is three and a half times the freight in 1914, on hides it is three and one-third times, on sheepskins three times, on leather, the product of a very important secondary industry, it is three times, and on basils-tanne d sheepskins*-the freight today is four times what it was before the war.

278,Mr BAMFORD,PROWSE,"I wished to know, as the honourable member belongs to the Economy party, whether he considers that a reduction of freights would be economical.",64
279,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"Yes ; I can fully justify my claim that the present excessive freights should be reduced from the point of view of that true form of economy which considers the interests of the whole of the people of the Commonfreight wealth. It is not a sound economic policy to keep ships idle by demanding excessive freights and to thus restrict duction of foodstuffs and other goods needed by the world. At present, owing to the excessive freights charged, are being laid up all over the world. I have some quite recent figures given high authority, Sir Frederick Lewis, carried. chairman of Furness, Whithy, and Co., at the annual meeting of the company. He made the statement that out of a total of 54,217,000 tons gross shipping, there is, eliminating wooden vessels, 11,703,000 more gross tons afloat than in 1914, and there is laid up in the world's ports that 10,000,000 tons gross. According latest information, the tonnage of ship.ping laid up is being increased; and know 'that the Commonwealth steamers are being laid up as they arrive in Australia. It is quite true that the Auswould. tralian Wheat Board was able to charter one of our ships to carry wheat to the bane other side of the world, but only one, far as I can ascertain. The are that our steamers, as they arrive, will be laid up. '",64
280,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROWSE,I believe that some more of our steamers are going to take wheat.,65
281,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,I hope they are. I see no reason why any sane people are killing business. should prevent those steamers being tered by the Australian Wheat Board reasonable rates of freight for the transa'manufacturer port of our wheat.,65
282,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROWSE,"They ought take our wheat, even at bare cost.",65

284,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"I do not suggest, that ship-owners are now making excessive profits.",65
285,Mr MAXWELL,PROWSE,"They cannot carry on stock. at lower rates, according to the honourable member.",65
286,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"This I cannot admit. It does not follow that the ships would not make profits if reduced rates of were charged. They can only make profits at all by carrying goods. They cannot make profits if they are laid proup. I suggest that the Shipping Ring is still determined to impose high freights, and the result is that one-fifth of the ships shipping of the world is laid up.",65
287,Mr MAXWELL,PROWSE,I understood that it by a was because there were no goods to be,65
288,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,I totally disagree with the contention that there are no goods to be carried; but if excessive charges are made in connection with any business that business falls away. I say the excessive rates of freight that are at present being charged are killing to the business and destroying trade. we Mr BAMFORD - Would lower freights help the meat industry at present?,65
289,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,Unquestionabl y they,65
290,Mr BAMFORD,PROWSE,I saw from the BrisCourier a few days ago that Queensso land meat is now being offered at 3d. per prospects lb. less than Argentine meat.,65
291,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"There are various grades of beef and .mutton, and I am not quite sure that the honourable member's information is correct. I say that one of the results.of the excessive ocean freights at present charged is that they The only way in charwhich a man can revive his business is at to meet the needs of his customers. Lf finds that he cannot sell his goods at the prices he has fixed, he to must endeavour to meet his customers, and, by lowering his prices, induce them",65
292,Mr CORSER,PROWSE,"Not at a loss. JOWETT - It all depends whether loss which he will sustain by lowering his prices will be greater than the loss which he must suffer if he is not able to When a trader realizes that his goods are priced so high that he cannot sell them, he has to cut his prices to get rid of his over-priced stock.",65
293,Mr CORSER,PROWSE,"But not the whole of his Freights are the whole of the stock in a vessel, and if they are cut too low it must be laid up.",65
294,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"Apparentl y that is the position which has been reached in consequence, not of low freights, but in consequence of the very high ocean freights which are charged today. say this because one>fifth of the tonnage of the world is at present laid up. If trade continues as at present, there is no doubt that more steamers will be laid up. There is only one way in which oversea trade can be revived, and that is by making it profitable for people to ship their goods. The .Shipping Ring, however, seems determined to keep up high rates of freight. The natural result of this is to prevent people shipping their goods.",65
295,Mr MAXWELL,PROWSE,"But the honourable member contends that high freights do not mean excessive profits. What would be the effect, on the profits of shipping, of a reduction of freights ?",66
296,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"The first effect might be that the ships would make some losses, but every onei n business must take that risk at times to attract custom. If all the ship-owners of the world are determined that they will not run their vessels except at a present profit, and if the rates which they are at present charging are so high that the public will not, because they cannot, pay them, the result must be an end to trade.",66
297,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROWSE,There have been periodical slumps in which only a very few of the shipping companies have continued to pay ^dividends.,66
298,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"That is so. The only way out of such a difficulty is for the shipping interests to reduce freights and so encourage trade once more. There 'is not less material in the world to be transported overseas than there was at the height of the boom period; but the decisive fact is that it does not pay to ship many goods owing to excessive freight rates. The short-sighted and superficial view may be taken that it pays the shipping interests to insist upon high freight charges, even though the effect be to reduce the volume of business. But the sound view is that one of the most effective means by which the trade of the world can recover is by ship-owners deciding to charge such freights as will encourage business; that is to say, to charge such prices as will make it worthwhile for producers to consign their goods.",66
299,Mr MAXWELL,PROWSE,O r such as will pay the ship-owners to run their vessels.,66
300,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"It may not pay them to continue to run under present conditions, in which, owing to. the rates existI ing, the public are discouraged from consigning their produce. It is not common sense to maintain excessive charges on the ground that it will not pay to run ships at lower rates.",66
301,Mr MARRS,PROWSE,"I understand that the fact of the Commonwealth Shipping Line being in existence will bring about a reduction of freights, as from the 1st January next, upon fruit exported from Aus",66
302,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"That , I think, is the direct outcome of pressure",66
303,Mr MARRS,PROWSE,B y the Commonwealth Line.,66
304,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"If such a reduction of freight comes about as from the new year it will be due to the agitation of primary producers and their representatives, who have demanded lower rates.",66
305,Mr MARRS,PROWSE,And to the pressure of the Commonwealth Line upon the Combine.,66
306,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"Yes ; and the pressure put upon the Commonwealth Line, owing to the realization that the Australian people will no longer endure the Commonwealth Line being part of the Shipping Ring, so assisting to maintain high freights.  Line has been working with the Combine to maintain high freights, why does the Combine wish to buy out the Commonwealth Line?",66
307,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"The Prime Minister furnished the answer to that question. T,he right honourable gentleman indicated his belief that the object of the owners of the Conference Lines was to secure complete control of the shipping of this part of the world, and to prervent the Commonwealth Line from competing with the interests: of the Combine in the future.",66
308,Mr CORSER,PROWSE,As it does now.,66
309,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,No ; the Commonwealth Line does not now compete with the Combine in the matter of freight. But the purpose of the owners of the' Conference Lines in seeking to buy the Commonwealth Line is probably ito prevent it from competing with the Conference ships in the future. It is true that the Commonwealth Line has not been competing with the Shipping Ring; but surely it is equally obvious that these gentlemen in London have been fully advised of the tread of public opinion in Australia and of the pressure of that opinion upon the Commonwealth 'Government management. They have seen that the people of this country will no longer perm it Commonwealth vessels to remain part of the Ring.,66
310,Mr MAKKS,PROWSE,"In other words, Lord Inchcape has heard of the Country party.",67
311,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"If he has not, he cannot be as well advised of what is going on as I credit him with being. to the determined efforts of the Country party that the prospects of a reduction in freights are more hopeful. That party has placed the position before every producer in Australia. It has pointed out that the Commonwealth Line, for a very long time, has served the in terests, not of the people, but of the Shipping Ring. Alive to the significance of the change in public opinion, it is natural that the Ring should be anxious to purchase the Commonwealth vessels, so taking care that their management shall not break away and endeavour to reduce freights. The question has been raised to what extent, if any, excessive rates have discouraged or destroyed trade. I have received a statement fro m a responsible representative of the fruit-growers of Tasmania. My correspondent is one of the highest authorities upon the subject matter generally. He saysThrough high freights and shortage of shipping last season (1921), Tasmanian apple growers had to leave in their orchards tens of thousands of bushels of fruit to rot on the trees and in the orchards. It is estimated on the very best and reliable authority that over 1,000,000 bushels could have 'been shipped to overseas markets last year, whereas only about 580,000 cases were consigned. This is practically a loss of, approximately, Â£500,000 to Tasmanian growers alone. Think of this great loss .to that State and the Commonwealth in the way of revenue from income tax. I desire to give further facts concerning the extent to which excessive freights have discouraged the shipment of goods and produce and so tended' to destroy trade. The following was issued to its clients by a firm of stock and station agents in Melbourne:With the big supplies of lamb indicated ahead for the next month, which is being offered to the public at reduced prices, the prospects are not likely to improve. Therefore, in view of the abundance of feed, an owner cannot lose anything iby holding back cattle. A few days ago a deputation of authorities in the meat trade waited upon the State shipping Premier of Victoria to discuss the heavy reduction in values of meat.",67
312,Mr CONSIDINE,PROWSE,Was that deputation from the Meat R in g !,67
313,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"There is no Meat Ring in Australia. Prom a Melbourne paper of 12th November I extract the following: The deputation pointed out that, owing to It is due the congestion in Great Britain and the low market price ruling for stock, it was advisable that producers should not forward stock intended for export to meat works until a recovery in price bad taken place, or a substantial reduction in freights had occurred. I wish to give another instance from one of the best authorities",67
314,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROWSE," The honourable member's time has expired. Proposed vote agreed to. Postponed division 25 (Commonwealth Goveniment Line of Steamers), Â£46,200.",67
315,Mr GREGORY,PROWSE,"Dampier) [ 1 0 . 2 ] - I have not the slightest desire to delay the Committee, but I want to get a vote on the question of the continuance of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. The matter has been discussed at very great length by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), and there may be others who wish to put their views before the Committee. I have no desire in that direction, nor do I wish to traverse the arguments of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) in his reply to the honourable member for Flinders other than to say that I cannot agree with his contention in reference to the offer that was suggested. I feel quite satisfied that the offer was made in good f a it h , and, in my opinion, if accepted, would result in advantage to the people of Australia. I think the Government would be wise to get r i d of the shipping business. I have no f a it h in Government interference in commerce, and I have had many years of experience in connection with Government trading concerns.  member's statement could be applied to the Australian railways.",67
316,Mr GREGORY,PROWSE,"It does apply to Government-owned railways to a large extent. If the honourable member can show me one railway system in Australia that is a paying concern I will withdraw.. I do not think my amendment will be carried, but I want to make my position clear. I want to get a promise from the Government that if they carry on these commercial concerns in the future they will give the fullest information to Parliament as speedily as possible after the end of the financial year. Even those honourable members who favour Government trading should support such a proposal. Surely if a concern is not being worked properly the sooner the facts are disclosed the better, so that criticism may be directed at the fault with a view to remedying it. I have in my hand a report of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. This Board supplies the people of Victoria with a f u ll account of its operations. I do not ask the Government to furnish a report as full as this one, but Parliament ought to have a fair and square balance-sheet, with full details of the year's operations, as soon as possible after the end of each financial year. Por years past I have been asking for a balance-sheet of the Small Arms Pactory, at Lithgow, I offered to bet Â£50, and to give the money to charities, if my statement was not correct that rifles made at Lithgow cost over Â£11 each, after it had been guaranteed that they were being made for Â£3 19s. Statement after statement was made, in this House that the Pactory was a paying concern, but the Government declined to state what the rifles were costing, because, they said, it would be giving undesirable information to outside persons. Now we find that the rifles are costing over Â£16 each. Surely it would have been a good thing to have had that information much earlier. If the Government are going to continue conducting commercial undertakings, Parliament is justified in demanding that full and complete balance sheets should be presented at the earliest possible moment. I move That a reduction of Â£1 be made in the first item-genera l Manager, Â£3,000-as an intimation to the Government that the continuation of the Commonwealth shipping service is not advisable. I am not going to discuss the matter further. We have had plenty of talk, and honourable members have made up their minds on the question.",67
317,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"Grampians) [10.7] I am sorry to have to detain the ComThe mittee a little longer, but this is a matter retained of vital importance to every primary producer in Australia. I want to emphasize the importance of a Commonwealth Line of Steamers breaking away from the Shipping Ring and being allowed to fix their own rates of freight.",68
318,Mr GROOM,PROWSE,The amendment is in favour of discontinuing the Commonwealth Line.,68
319,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"'As I am not in favour of discontinuing the Commonwealth Line, I feel justified in making a few remarks. Amendment negatived.",68
320,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"Grampians) [10.9] Some members of the Committee are evidently not anxious to hear further argument on this question; but representing, as I do, a constituency of primary producers, I feel it my duty to put the case for them against the Shipping Ring of the world. I must, as they say in the marriage service, speak now or for ever hold my peace. When this item has been passed there will be no other opportunity, short of moving a vote of want of confidence in the Government, of discussing the question. Therefore, I consider that at this juncture the question should be fully debated by every member of the Committee who has any views on the subject at all. I intend to put the case for the primary producers, not only against the Shipping Ring, but, incidentally, against the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. I have no desire to see the Commonwealth Line discontinued or sold. The question has been raised as to what extent the present excessive rates have discouraged the trade of Australia, and to what extent a reduction of freights would encourage it. I have a statement from one of the best authorities in the meat trade of Australia with regard to the position in Queensland. He saysOne of the results of the excessive rates of freight is that during the season now closingone of the best ever known-ver y large numbers of fat cattle, instead of being killed in 1921, have been left on their pastures. It is estimated that in Queensland alone from 100.000 to 200,000 more cattle would have been killed had prices been reasonable and ocean' freights lower. These cattle are now on their pastures, and it may be that many of them wil/ not .become fat again. cattle, instead of being killed, were upon, or sent back to, their pastures; and, if a dry season comes, many of them will never go to market again. When cattle once get fat, that is the time, and the only time, to sell and kill them. If the season passes they fall away, by natural processes, and it takes a long time to fatten them again, if ever they do fatten again. - Mr CORSER - Whil e the honourable gentleman advocates that the Commonwealth steamers should not be tied up because they are losing money, he also eays that the stations are to tie up their cattle.",68
321,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"I do not advocate that. I regret it deeply. I think it is most deplorable that any one should have ibeen advised or induced to keep cattle back because exporters are 'hoping for lower freights and better prices in future. The honourable member must know that I would not advocate such a preposterous thing. Here is another letter which I think should interest the honourable member for Wide Bay. It relates to hides, aud is dated from a station near Clermont :I bave not sent a hide lo the market lately. The last lot I sent showed no profit after deducting commission and carriage. I have also a letter from a. firm of Brisbane wool-brokers, dated 4th October, whose comments should interest the honourable member for Wide Bay: The pelts of earlier consignments skins treated on account of the company's stations and clients were pickled and returned .to store with very unsatisfactory results, there was not sumcient demand to warrant this expense. Consequently all pelts have since been, destroyed. Even with the recently improved tone, fellmongers are still finding inexpedient to pickle any but the choicest butchers' skins. I have already shown that hides and leather are paying about three times the freight charged prior to that basil made out of these pelts is at present paying four times pre-war rates. I could quote many other instances, all gested that course of action. proving conclusively that the present cessive ocean freights are destroying our export trade. An important way, in opinion, and in the opinion of almost every man in Australia who understands product ? the position, to recover our lost trade in primary products overseas is to take aotion as will bring about a substantial reduction i u these freights.",69
322,Mr BAMFORD,PROWSE,Would a reduction enable the exporters to market hides and pelts ?,69
323,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"A reduction in, freights, together with a reduction in other forms of transport and distribution, would materially help. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford), who, I know, has been a keen student of economics for a long time, knows perfectly well that the real trouble in the world today is to be found in the high costs of production, transport, and distribution. But for this undesirable state of affairs the trade of the world would be going on as it was prior to the war. I am amazed that any honourable member should defend the present system of control by a monopoly as against free and open competition. The Commonwealth Line of Steamers should be freed from the domination of any Shipping Eing. Freights should be settled hy competition and a revival in trade encouraged. Mr ATKINSON,-Does not the Commonwealth Line pay higher wages than the Conference Lines?",69
324,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,I do not think that ka3 any bearing on this question at all ,69
325,Mr ATKINSON,PROWSE,"Yes , it has. How can they give reduced freights if they pay of sheephigher wages?",69
326,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"I am not prepared to as discuss that question at the moment. Of course, it is easier for any man in business to become a partner in some great monopoly than for him to face competition it with his fellows. Hence, probably, the desire of the management to remain iti the Shipping Ring.",69
327,Mr CONSIDINE,PROWSE,"The honourable member does not want cheap freight at the the war, and expense of low wages.",69
328,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,I have neiver sugI want excheap freights .to restore our trade.,69
329,Mr FOLEY,PROWSE,If hides were tanned in my Australia would there not bo a better opportunity to export the manufactured,69
330,Mr JOWETT,PROWSE,"I am deeply grateful such to the honourable member for the suggestion, because it happens that .one of the organizations that approached me and asked me to move in the direction of securing a reduction of ocean freights, is the body representative of the master tanners of Australia. If the present excessive freights on leather were reduced, the tanners in Australia would be better able to find a market for their leather abroad. I do not desire to labour this question. I shall conclude by stating that the primary producers are in favour of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers reducing freights and thus being run in the interests of the whole of the people of Australia.
