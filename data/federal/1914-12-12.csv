That matter, however, is at an end. When I called him order the honourable member was prothey ceeding to address to me a question which I had refused to allow him to place the business-paper. I cannot him to do that. If he considers should not have disallowed the placing of his question on the notice-paper then it is for him to test my decision by papers. means of a specific motion. The honourable member sought to place on the name of the newspaper? notice-paper a question which was not in his own handwriting, and which had cupied evidently been supplied to him.

59,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,OFFIC E OF MINISTER OF,Yes .,8
60,Mr SPEAKER,OFFIC E OF MINISTER OF,"Then I shall ask the Clerk to read the correspondence relating of to the exclusion of representatives of the press from the press gallery. In the the first place, let me explain that two representatives of th© press engaged in reporting the proceedings of Parliament enjoy today exactly the same privi that have always been accorded them in this House. Afc one time they exto ceeded the privileges extended to themabused them to some extent-and their attention had to be drawn to that on fact. On Tuesday last it was brought permit under my notice that a document headed that I "" The Lousy L is t "" was posted up in a room in this building allotted to the representatives of one of the big news",8

I considered that this list, which was posted on a cupboard A rgus room in this building, a grave breach of parliamentary I removed it, and going to the room occupied by representatives of the Age found there a list headed, "" The House Committee,"" on which the names of the House Committee appeared. Its appearance there may have been a mere coincidence. when we went to the Inter-State room we found the same list of members under the heading, "" The Honor with certain other remarks which, for the moment, 1"" cannot recall. This, to my mind, clearly showed that concerted action had been taken by certain gentlemen, to whom various privileges have been accorded in this Parliament, with the object of insulting members of a Committee elected by this Parliament, therefore felt it my duty to take prompt action. I brought the matter under the notice of the President of the who, like myself, was very indignant, and we decided that these rooms should not be occupied until full, complete, ample apology had been made by the newspapers whom these men represented. The President and I also communicated with the Inter-State press representatives, but the chairman of the Inter-State gallery committee seemed to regard the matter lightly, and replied in a very flippant latter, in which he appeared to treat the whole thing as a When, however, this gentleman that we regarded the matter seriously, he sent a second and third letter, the last of which was accepted as satisfactory.

I must say, on behalf of the Age and the in the Argus, that both those newspapers took constituted privilege. the matteivery seriously, and made a full and complete apology, as honourable members will see from the correspondence.

Speaker, directing my attention to a list members posted in the room set apart for staff of the Argus at Parliament House. I have great difficulty in believing that any member of our staff would be guilty piling such a list, or of posting it in the room, and I have not been able, time that has elapsed since I received your communication, to make any inquiry into the matter. I can assure you, however, person or persons who are proved to be guilty of this proceeding will be severely dealt with if it be found that they are members of our staff. 1 assume in the meantime that some one in The Editor of the Age, our service did post the list, since the evidence points to that conclusion, and, therefore, I have to offer to you and to Mr Speaker, on behalf of this office, a full apology for an replv:act so utterly contrary to good taste and to the wishes of the proprietors of the Argus.

I have not been able to [63]- 3 complete my inquiries into the matter, but so far as I have been able to ascertain the facts, I regret to have to admit, that some member of our staff has been guilty of the action of which you very justly complain.

The document found in the of Age room has not the offensive heading which the appears on the other document.

In discussing among ourselves drawal of certain privileges formerly granted to us in Parliament, pressmen generally had decided to try and ascertain from individual members of the House Committee the reasons 'for action which we regarded as reflecting on us personally. As the personnel of the Committee was not well known, and members of the staff had on several occasions asked me who they were, I prepared the list and posted it. Mr Schuler, Editor. On receipt of this letter from the editor of the Age we addressed to him a further letter in the following terms:SIR, Adverting to our letter the subject of a notice posted in the room allotted to your staff at Parliament House, and DEAR SIR , your reply thereto, we are of opinion that the explanation tendered is unsatisfactory, in of the fact that a somewhat similar notice vulgar and scurrilous terms was also posted in the room occupied by members of the Argus staff, and a further notice in the Inter-State press room, indicating there was concerted action taken by pressmen generally at ParliaHouse Committee. ment House, and that the notice was posted with the same intention and purpose as those in the other rooms.

The following reply was received from Mr . Peters:Melbourne, 9th December, 1914. The President and the Speaker of the Federal Parliament. DEAR SIRS, In reply to your communication of December 9, I have to say that I was previously unaware of what was posted in the Argus and the Age rooms. I rarely visit those parts of the House. It is a fact that in the Inter-State .room a list of members of the House Committee was posted on the wall. As soon as I saw it I endeavoured to tear it off. But as it was .stuck too tightly to remove more than a part I pasted a blank sheet over it . When this sheet was removed I pasted another with a request that it should not be interfered with. It was not afterwards touched by any member of the Inter-State Press. I think the action was - merely a prank of one of the young fellows who bave access to the room. Youthful effer-vescence takes curious forms sometimes, and often acts irresponsibly without"" intending to be harmful. Perhaps it is the result of an undeveloped artistic sense, a fact not uncommon en este valle de lagrimas. The fact that the notice was at once pasted over, and was, therefore, cancelled and repudiated in the only method that was conveniently possible should, I submit, be accepted as a clear indication that there was no intention by the room to transgress any rules of the House. At the same itime I admit that there was an indiscretion by whomever it was committed, and I wish to express regret that it 'should have occurred. I am, dear sirs, Chairman of Gallery Committee. That letter was not considered satisfactory,  Melbourne, 10th December, 1914. The President and the Speaker, The Federal Parliament House. DEAR SIRS, In reply to your letter of yesterday rect that there was a notice posted in the Inter-State Pressroom containing the names of the members of the House Committee. I at onee endeavoured to remove it , but found it was pasted too tightly on the wall. Accordingly I covered it with a blank sheet of paper. This was removed. I placed another with a request that it should not be interfered with. This request was observed. I wish to express my regret that the notice was posted at all, and to say that the indiscretion was one that I am sure will not be repeated. I am, sirs, That letter was not considered satisfactory, and  Commonwealth of Australia. The President and the Speaker, Federal Parliament. DEAR SIR, Supplementing my letter of today, I wish to add that as Chairman of the Gallery Committee I unreservedly apologise for the incident to which it relates, and express my regret that a breach of parliamentary decorum sbould have heen committed in the Inter-State Pressroom. I am, dear sirs, To this the President replied as follows:- . The Senate, Melbourne, l l t h December, 1914. DEAR SIR, I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, conveying on behalf _ of the Gallery Committee an apology in connection with the appearance on the walls of the Inter-State Pressroom of a notice which it was considered constituted a breach of the privileges accorded to press representatives at Parliament House. In accepting the apology_ I desire to record my satisfaction at the closing of an incident which I am sure has been Bistasteful to all parties concerned, and further to express a hope that in the future harmonious relations may continue between members of Parliament _ and press representatives whose work necessitates their attendance at Parliament House.

70,Mr SPEAKER,OFFIC E OF MINISTER OF,"A member of the press may go to the Library and ask the Librarian for any book he requires. Honourable members understand that the Commonwealth is acquiring some very valuable works and documents, some of which it is not considered wise to allow even members of Parliament to handle. If honourable members were permitted to handle these works as they please, the Library would be in a very bad way in a short time.",13
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OFFIC E OF MINISTER OF,Why? reflecting on all of us.,13
72,Mr SPEAKER,OFFIC E OF MINISTER OF,"If honourable members will permit me, I should now like to refer to the matter more full y so that the position may be thoroughly understood. In the Library are bound files of newspapers, some of which go back for a considerable number of years, and it has been found that some of these have been cut. That being so, it has been considered necessary to take very drastic action. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear ,",13
73,Mr SPEAKER,OFFIC E OF MINISTER OF,"I do not wish to attribute that action to members of the press, because I have not the remotest idea of when, how, or by whom it was done. As to the members of the press, I wish to say clearly and distinctly that they enjoy the same privileges now that were granted to them by this Parliament fourteen years ago. Those privileges, however, must not be abused. short time ago I had to take action in consequence of finding that the corridors were turned into a smoking saloon. This I resented, and the practice waa put a stop to after ample apology had been made by those offending. The Parliamentary gardens are set apart for the use of members. If members of the press are allowed to have the use of the gardens it is not possible for members to there hold private conversations, or play their games amongst themselves if they desire to do so. If strangers are permitted the use of the gardens along with honourable members, matters, which were never in tended to be public, may get abroad. Some members of the press seemed to take complete control, or, at any rate, to go beyond th© privileges originally granted. The House Committee unanimously agreed that this practice should be discontinued, and that only certain privileges should be granted. since been given to that decision by the President. One word more in connection with the Library. In that Library we are building up a very valuable collection of books- a collection which every honourable member should cherish and endeavour to guard to the fullest possible extent. Y e t , as a fact, it has been found that honourable members themselves take books from that Library which are sometimes returned either marked, or with passagesunderlined or erased. It is quite a common thing for works of reference to be This is returned with all sorts of marks in them. Manifestly that sort of thing ought not to be permitted. But the difficulty is to find a means of stopping it . It is a very bad practice that books should b© thus marked, and I trust that in future honourable members will discontinue it . So far as the Library is concerned, certain regulations hav© been framed by the Committee for our guidance. It is quite a common thing for honourable members to obtain books from the Library and to hand them over to pressmen or to other hear ! persons to take away. I have actually witnessed this sort of conduct myself. Now, the Library has not been established for that purpose, and u n t i l the Hous© decides that it has, neither the Library Committee nor I intend to sanction it . It will thus be seen that honourable members themselves are to a large extent blamable in this connection. Now that the matter has been brought before the Only a House- a circumstance which I very much regret and which I did my best to prevent- I trust that honourable members will assist the House Committee to carry out their duties in the way in which it was intended they should be carried out-. It has frequently happened that new magazines have disappeared from the table of the Library for two or three weeks, and in the interim fresh magazines have had to be purchased. Then again, it has been found that press representatives are often in the Library when honourable members go there to discuss matters of which they do not desir© the public to be informed. In these circumstances the Library Committee have resolved that, whilst the press representatives shall b© afforded every opportunity to obtain any works of reference which they may desire to consult, thos© works must be secured only after direct application has been mad© to the Librarian. Effect has Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I am very much obliged to you, sir, for having cleared this matter up. So far as I am concerned, the explanation which has just been given is perfectly satisfactory.",13

REPORT BY SIRMAURI CE FITZMAURICE . Sir JOHN"" FORREST asked the Assistant Minister, representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. As Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice has already reported in regard - to the dredging of the channels tlirough Parmelia and Success Bank, in order to enable ships to enter the western naval base at Cockburn Sound, and the ordering of suitable dredgers, in the following terms:Having in view the large quantity of material to be dredged, I recommend, on the ground of economy, that it is desirable to obtain special dredgers for this work. It will be necessary for tliese channels to bo available by the date when the base can accommodate ships, and I estimate that it will be five years before such partial completion will enable them to be used. I estimate that it will take at least fifteen months to obtain the necessary dredgers, and these dredgers will occupy something less than four years to complete the channels. I recommend three suction hopperdredgers with 2,000 tons hopper capacity, and one bucket hopper dredger, as the minimum plant requisite for economical working. The suction dredgers are to work at the banks, while the bucket dredger will work near the base, except when required to assist the suction dredges with any difficult material on the outside banks. The estimated cost of the dredgers is £370,000 built in Great Britain and delivered at Fremantlewhat reasou is there for delay in at once ordering these dredger3? 2. Will he place on the table the report and plans and specifications of the works at Cockburn Sound which have been supplied by Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice? 8. Is it intended to construct the works in the manner and in accordance with the specifications recommended by Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice? 4. What is the total extent of cost of the works recommended by Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice? 5. Is it still proposed to pay for these works from revenue?",14
83,Mr JENSEK,OFFIC E OF MINISTER OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. Plans and specifications of two suction dredges are being obtained from Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice with a view to seeing wliether they can be built in Australia. The bucket dredger is available in Australia. 2, 3, 4. and 5. The report and plans have only reached the Government this week.

90,Mr FISHER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They are all absolutely necessary. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I know that they are necessary. All Bills introduced for the next hundred years will be necessary, but their urgency is another matter. We are supposed to be sitting over the week-end in order to clear up our work, and get away early next week, yet the Government are filling the notice-paper fuller than ever. We are expected on Saturday morning to clear off the remnants of the business of the session, yet there are twenty items of Government business on the notice-paper. How can the Prime Minister expect that these measures will receive the slightest consideration if the House is to rise on the date mentioned ? I do not know what we are going to do. I suggest that the Prime Minister should go through the list of measures, and jettison some for which there is no urgency, and which can wait u n t i l next year. I admit that there may be some urgency in regard to the Bills he is seeking to introduce today, but there is no urgency in regard to many of the measures on the notice-paper.

On the contrary, every disposition has been shown to expedite business the Government have put before the House, even though some honourable members of the Opposition have been strongly opposed to many of the matters embodied in the measures submitted.

In my opinion it would be an attitude of cowardice on the part of the Government to pledge the country's credit to such an excessive extent that it would be weakened. It would show that the Government had no backbone. . We might as well say that we could fight our way with a proxy.

People may be able to meet burdens for a little time which they would be altogether unable to bear for a lengthened period. The Prime Minister is making a great mistake in trying to impose upon the country a burden of this kind for an indefinite period. The action at present being taken by the Government bears out what I have previously said I believe that if no war at all had occurred these burdens would have been imposed upon the people who will have to bear them, by the Government and the party they represent, as a matter of policy and in furtherance of their desire to destroy the land-owners of the country.

This ; is equivalent to about 4s. 8d. to 4s. 9d., and as it would cost at least Is. per bushel to bring it here the price f landed in Australia would be at least 5s. 9d., plus duty, which is about the price ruling in the Australian market today.

In the Sydney Morning Herald of the 16th July, this year, the Prime Minister is reported as follows: The policy of the Labour party has been and is along the lines of the New Protection. Since our appeal to the electors for power to give effect to that policy bas been twice The other refused, and recognizing that many industries cannot exist, much less prosper, without effective Protection, we pledge ourselves, if returned to power to amend the Tariff during the first session of the new Parliament to give effective Protection to Australian industries. This is the first time in the twelve years of Federation that the fiscal incidence could in any way help the wheat indust r y of Australia, and it is the very time chosen by the Government to "" close down "" on their protective policy. If any action were designed to convert the great rural population of Australia into Pree Traders, it is the action of the present Protectionist Government. my lot to represent a country and I candidly admit that amongst the farmers there are many with Free Trade leanings. I have appealed farmers to patriotically stand behind the policy of Protection, but amongst many arguments I have advanced, I have never contended that a duty on wheat could help them very much. say, is the one occasion in the past twelve years when the farmers had an opportunity to reap some advantage from the policy of Protection, and the ment have decided to deprive them of that advantage. Assuming figures quoted by the Minister are right, I have to express my sympathy those who are compelled to pay high prices for foodstuffs, for high prices, no doubt, impose hardship on many poor families. But bread, which has been called the "" staff of life,"" is not one of the household commodities that is most costly. I suppose that the increase in the price of wheat would not more than Is. per week to an average family of four persons. Taking it that there are 7,000,000 bushels of wheat in Australia, this means depriving the farmers of a profit amounting to £1,500,000. Perhaps I ought not to use the word "" profit,"" but more appropriately word ""return,"" because there is no profit in wheat this year farmer that I know. According the Minister, tliere is a shortage of 7,000,000 bushels; and of any Government in emergency as this, is to arrange for the free admission of that quantity. proposed to deprive drought-stricken farmers of £1,500,000 in order to provide a cheap loaf, not only for those in necessitous circumstances, but for all in the Commonwealth, rich and poor-Ministers of the Crown, members of and members of trusts and The Government might have the States, as they have done in financial matters, and. acting as the agent for the States and for the people generally, purchased abroad the necessary bushels of wheat, and secured its free admission into Australia. rangement would not in any way have affected the profits of the stricken growers of the bushels raised in this country, but would Afr.

I think the Minister of Trade and Customs spoke with a clear to those knowledge to the contrary, if it is parliamentary to say so, when he told us the that the action of the Government was to prevent profits being made by speculators or large holders of wheat. It is well This, as I known that, some seven or eight weeks ago, the Victorian Government fixed the price of wheat at 4s. 9d. a bushel, and wehad it on the statement of the Premier Govern- of Victoria, and of the Commission thab investigated the matter, that approxithat the mately one-third of the supply was held by speculators or grain merchants, onewith third by the flour-millers, and one-third! by the farmers.",24
208,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That was last season's crop.,25
209,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Quite so; how could any but last season's crop be affected under that investigation? Then we have the evidence of a Commission that when represent they were appealed to under the operation of the Victorian fixation law, the holders of wheat outside the millers and farmers delivered over their supplies to the trade in order that those supplies might be converted into a cheap loaf, if such a thing was produced. the",25
210,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think that they for any did deliver over their wheat. to Mr Rodgers - We have the evidence of the Commission on that point. I the duty pass now to the question of the harvest such an for the coming season. Does the Minister mean to suggest, in view of the excited It is state of the wheat market not only in Australia, but in every other part of the world, that speculative purchases have been made here ? His silence indicates his belief that no such operations have taken place on the new crop. As Parliament, a matter of fact, the position is combines. that the wheat from the present consulted harvest is held by the farmers, except so far as the crop has been acquired by legal enactment on the part of certain States. We now have the interesting in 7,000,000 formation to hand that the farmers of New South Wales, in defiance of the law. Such an ar- of that State, are carting their wheat across the Victorian border, and stacking drought- it there. 30,000,000 Mr RICHARD FOSTER - And selling it .",25
211,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes .,25
212,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I believe that both statements are correct-that the farmers of New South Wales are both stacking and selling their wheat in Victoria.,26
213,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A few minutes ago the Minister representing the Minister of Defence interjected that the desire of the Government was to provide cheap seed wheat for the farmers. 1 do not know whetlier the Minister of Trade and Customs will endorse that statement.,26
214,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that our action will have the effect of making seed wheatcheaper.,26
215,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Le t me tell the Minister that at least two States have already acquired sufficient seed wheat to satisfy the needs of those who are not in a position to purchase it . The Victorian Government have secured seed wheat for farmers in necessitous circumstances at 4s. 9d. per bushel, and the South Australian Government bave taken similar action. The proposal of the Minister of Trade and Customs represents about the last straw, so far as direct taxation of the laud-holders of the Commonwealth is concerned. I would not be very much surprised if an absolute uprising took place in the country against the action of the Government. I congratulate some Ministers upon having taken off the mask, though I sympathize with those honourable members who represent farming constituencies^-the honourable member for Indi for example.  able member look after himself.",26

217,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am here by the vote of the small farmers. I am anxious that the honourable member should spend a holiday among his farming constituents endeavouring to explain away the action of the liresent Government.,26
218,Mr LAIRD SMIITH,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He will send a few copies of the speech that he livered yesterday.,26
219,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have already shown how this proposal will affect the farmer. Tl will deprive him, at the very least, the benefit of a protection of about l l per bushel. If there be anything in declared fiscal policy of the Ministry, they desire to establish Australian dustries, do they imagine that the agricultural industry will be stimulated by this proposal?",26
220,Mr TUDOH,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not think that it will be injured by it . I do not believe it will mean that one acre less will be cultivated.,26
221,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,For the time being there may not be. But the action of the Government in depriving the farmers of a protection of ahout Is. per bushel upon their wheat will undoubtedly recoil on the industry.,26
222,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member need not worry about that.,26
223,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am referring, not to the political aspect of the matter, but to the effect of this proposal upon the farming industry. However, it is quite idle to bump one's head against a stone wall by representing to the Government the necessity which exists for relieving the agricultural community of taxation. Every day the Ministry are adding to the farmer's burden, so that eventually they must k ill the "" goose that lays the golden egg."" While we are doing our best to attract immigrants to the Commonwealth, this beautiful advertisement goes for t h to the world that the Government have removed from this industry the only protection which it enjoyed, for the purpose of providing a cheap loaf for many of those who are well able to pay for it . Seeing that there is a shortage of wheat in Australia this year to the extent of 7,000,000 bushels, surely the proper course for the Government to have taken was to meet that deficiency, not hy imposing further disabilities upon the farmer, but by spreading it over the entire community. Instead of doing that they are endeavouring to strangle an industry which, in the present disastrous year, is unable to pay its own way.",26
224,Mr GROOM,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Darling Downs) [2.5SJ. - The Minister of Trade and Customs is seeking to introduce an entirely new printhem ciple in the Tariff administration of the deCommonwealth. He will recollect that when the first Tariff was submitted to this' Parliament we were suffering from a drought which extended over the whole of of Austi'alia with the exception, probably, of j d . Western Australia. On that occasion the the House strongly expressed the view that to if recognise cases of individual hardship in in - times of emergency would give' rise to many difficulties, and deprive certain sections of the community of T a r i ff benefits which they would otherwise enjoy. What is the position today? Drought prevails throughout the land. We are bound to he faced throughout the Commonwealth with a shortage of wheat and a shortage of money. To whom do the Government propose to extend relief? They will not suspend the operation of certain duties to benefit the farming population, but, in stead, they propose to levy heavy burdens upon them, and to sweep away the only measure of protection which they have hitherto enjoyed. In the Minister's own constituency there are hat mills, which are to receive an increased grant of protection, so that the farmers will have to pay more for their hats, whilst heing themselves deprived of all protection. Only the other day the honourable member for Brisbane advocated the suspension of certain duties, but his proposal was absolutely scouted hy the Ministry. At times tliere are dry seasons in Queensland, as there are in other parts of the world. If sugar grown in Queensland does not supply the whole of the requirements of the Australian market, does the Minister propose to reduce the sugar duties? Yet that is what this new principle really means. By passing this proposal we are laying down a new precedent for futureTariff matters, that if any industry, owing to certain local calamities, is not aWo to supply the whole of the Australian market, the Customs duty protecting that industry must be removed, and we are to have free imports from abroad, which can be sold at a lower rate in order to compete witli the article produced in Australia under extraordinary conditions. I ask the Minister to hold his hand.",26
225,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; the thing is there, and it is going to remain.",27
226,Mr GROOM,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I ask the Minister to realise what he is doing. He has not given us a satisfactory explanation of his action. I believe that his proposal is simply pandering to the city populations, already highly protected by other duties. In fact, I believe that this is what the Minister intends. The result of his action will be highly disappointing to the primary producers who have always willingly taken their share of the cost incidental to the protectionof Australian industries generally. Many of theprimary producers are pronounced Protectionists, because they realise the valueof Protection to them in many ways, but the present action will come as a great disappointment to them. I am sorry that the Minister has not had a l it t l e of the spirit of the late C. C. Kingston, who was faced with a similar position, for then we would not have had this appalling blunder, which is introducing a principle that goes further than the honourable member intends.",27
227,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Brisbane) [3.3] I have a clear recollection of the ridicule with which the Minister and some honourable members greeted an amendment that I proposed the other day to the Customs Bill . . But what I proposed, and which the Minister then ridiculed, he now adopts.",27
228,Mr BOYD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,You must have' convinced him.,27
229,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think so. The logic of facts must have convinced him. I pointed out that there was likely to be a shortage of wheat which would warrant our giving the Minister power to suspend duties affecting tha necessaries of life, and I took up the clear and unequivocal stand that if thero should be a shortage in the production of the necessaries of life in Australia we should not burden the people by the im position of duties on importations.",27
230,Sir JOHN FOEEEST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,W h at about sugar? That is in the same position.,27
231,Mr GROOM,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would you apply your principle to tools of trade?,27
232,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall come to that. My proposition was that in time of war things necessary for the sustenance of the people should not be loaded with Customs duties, but I was laughed at. ",27
233,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member for Maranoa in one of his vivid deliverances at that time,27
234,Mr THOMAS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He made a "" y e s - n o"" speech. Mr FINLAYSON"" - He made a rather clever speech in trying to support me.  no Minister should have the right to alter the Tariff at his own sweet will .",27
235,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"My mistake was in proposing that the Minister should have the power. I should have proposed to give the power to the Governor in Council, as Ministers are now suggesting in the motion before the Committee. The honourable member for Barrier was the only honourable member who had the courage of his Free Trade convictions. In reply to the interjections of the honourable members for Swan and Darling Downs concerning the duty on sugar and other things, the only logical deduction of their contention, if it is pushed to its proper conclusion, is that the limitation of the production of any article immediately establishes an argument in favour of having no Customs duty upon it . As a matter of fact, in Australia, there is in the dried f r u it industry at dura a deliberate method of limiting production in order to keep up the price of the article produced. There are certain goods for which the public pay the wholesale rate of 4 i d . per lb., but which the producers admit, on sworn evidence, can be produced at a profit at 3d. per lb.",27
236,Mr SAMPSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I challenge that statement.,28
237,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The truth of my statement is to be found in the evidence taken by the F r u it Commission. In answer to a question as to the price at which f r u it could be profitably produced, the reply of a witness was that it could be produced profitably at 3d.",28
238,Mr SAMPSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member is probably speaking of the price at which f r u it can be delivered at the packing house, and not of the finished article ready for the market.",28
239,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am speaking of the actual price the grower requires. This admission shows how an article that might, and ought to be, a regular useful diet of the people is being manipulated in order to secure high prices. According to the argument of the honourable member for Darling Downs, when pushed to its logical conclusion, ail that would be necessary to establish a case for the abolition of the Customs duty would be the limitation of production rendering importation necessary. What the Government intend to do, and what we desire, is the encouragement of the production of sufficient goods in Australia for our own requirements, obviating the necessity for any importations. How does that position affect the matter of wheat supply ? We are faced with a shortage of wheat, a commodity which is absolutely necessary for the health and welfare of the people. The people must have bread, but, unfortunately, the farmers of Australia, owing to unfortuitous circumstances, have not been able to produce sufficient wheat for our requirements, and therefore we have no option but to import. Even if we retain the duty, importations will not be prevented, and the question for us to consider is whether we should make the wheat we import for the purpose of making it into bread as cheap as possible, or whether we should maintain it at a fictitious value in order to benefit a few wheat speculators. No class in the community is more deserving of the most severe strictures and most unlimited castigation M i l - than men who manipulate the foodstuffs. I have no sympathy with the man who, for his own private gain or personal advantage, manipulates the necessaries of life, and secures monetary gain, while other people starve.",28
240,Mr SHARPE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is the worse form of fraud.,28
241,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And , particularly when it is organized, it is the most corrupt form of robbery. If times were normal the Minister would need to have very strong reasons for his proposal, and if this were a permanent arrangement, I would oppose his motion.",28
242,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is not proposed as a permanent arrangement.,28
243,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The only justification for the proposal is that it is to cover an immediate and temporary difficulty. I am glad that the Minister states that it is not a permanent arrangement, because I realise that the wheat-growers, so long as they provide for the requirements of the people, are entiiled to protection.  effective for the farmer when we have a crisis such as that now existing.",28
244,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If conditions, were normal, and there were not a state of war in existence, and a consequent unfortunate excess of unemployment, therewould be no justification for this proposal, even if we were short of wheat. But we are faced with the position that there are thousands of people out of work, and less able today than they have been for the last twenty years to pay extra for food, and this is the very time when opportunity is given for a remission of duties on goods which we are not able toproduce locally, in order to give assistanceto our people.  will this duty give the people per head ?",28
245,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is not the question. This is the assistance we are able to give them. Whether it be sufficient or not, or whether it is the right method or not, is not the argument. This is one way which we have immediately available to us whereby we may cheapen the food supplies of the people.",29
246,Mr BOYD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,As soon as the country gets into difficulties we have to turn to f ree trade.,29
247,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The country is not in difficulties because there happens to be a shortage of wheat, but a situation has arisen which can be met by this remedy, which is the only one immediately available to us.",29
248,Mr BOYD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What inducement is there to the farmer to increase his production if he is to be deprived of protection ? Mr .FINLAYSON - The honourable member for Henty has repeated a statement, which has been made previously in this discussion, that there is no encouragement to the farmer to go in for increased wheat growing, but the statement of the Minister that this is only a temporary expedient shows that the remission of this duty does not remove the inducement to the farmer to utilize an increased area for wheat growing.",29
249,Mr FLEMING,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But you still make the farmer pay more for his bags.,29
250,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is a matter to be dealt with when we come to it . I am prepared to make conditions as easy as possible for the primary producers. Every man of us, no matter what he represents, or what his occupation in life may be, knows that when the primary producers are doing well, we are all doing well, aud when the primary producer is not doing well, none of us is doing well. It is all nonsense to say that one man or another man, or one party or another party, is opposed to assisting and,., protecting the primary producers. this side are just as anxious to assist the primary producers as are the members on the Opposition side, and I deprecate all this talk about the party in power being opposed to the man on the land. The primary producer is entitled to protection as much as any other man in the community, but there is nothing in this proposal of the Minister that is going to have the slightest effect, legally or logically, in hindering the farmer from planting out areas of wheat. Even if extensive areas were planted today, it would be months before there could be a harvest, and we could get any benefit from the sowing, and during that time the present abnormal conditions, which haye necessitated the action of the M i nister, might have disappeared.",29
251,Mr BOYD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And the present Protectionist Minister would put back the duty for the benefit of the farmers.,29
252,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should think he would. If that were not so, there is nothing in the argument of honourable members opposite who are objecting to the removal of the duty as being a step which is detrimental to the farmers. I m mediately the present difficulty vanishes the duty ought to be re-imposed, and if it is not sufficient we ought to increase it in order to give the farmers adequate protection against any possible competi 1 tion from foreign-grown wheat. I only rose to emphasize the fact that the principle I was advocating in this House a fortnight ago is now accepted, and I hope that later on, when we are dealing with the Tariff, and I have the honour of again submitting a suggestion on similar lines, honourable members on both sides of the House who approve of the remission of the duty on wheat will not forget that special circumstances demand special remedies, and that there ought to be a reserve power with the Minister to deal with extraordinary conditions such as prevail at the present time.",29
253,Mr SAMPSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wimmera) [3.16] The burden of the argument of the honourable member for Brisbane is that when there is a shortage, and prices rise high enough to enable the wheat duty to operate, we should strike it off, but we should re-impose it when there is a big production, low prices, and a surplus for export. That is to say, that the wheat grower must be protected through the Customs when Protection cannot be of We on any use to him, and when the duty is of any use we must strike it off. I quite appreciate that in the present circumstances, with the shortage of wheat, the existence of a state of war, and the prevalence of drought;-althoug h the war is the least influence in connection with the price of wheat - there is a very strong inducement to the Minister of the day to take extraordinary means in order to deal with an extraordinary situation. At the same time, I think that the Protectionist farmer will be given very scant courage in the growing of wheat, and also in his general support; of a Protectionist policy, if he comes to the conclusion that the duties, which he believes might sometimes be protective and might have a steadying influence on prices, are to be struck off every time there is a shortage. The present position of the Protectionist farmer, as far as I , a representative of a farming district ancl a supporter of a Protectionist policy, can ascertain, is that he believes that the primary products of the soil should receive protection alongside with the production of the secondary in dustries. I recognise that even a Protectionist wheat-grower knows perfectly well that the wheat duty is not immediately operative, that it operates only in extraordinary times of drought and shortage - But there is a fundamental principle underlying the whole policy, and he believes that there is a possibility of the duty on wheat steadying the prices in certain seasons of heavy production elsewhere. We know that a protective duty is not i m posed for the purpose of giving immediate Protection in times of normal production and importation, but one of the most valuable phases of the Protectionist policy is that it prevents dumping in certain seasons when there is a surplus. The farmer, therefore, knows that there is a steadying influence exercised by the duty on wheat, and he has loyally supported Protection as a national policy. I am satisfied, however, that for some considerable time the farmer in the wheat growing districts has looked upon the policy of Protection in respect of the secondary industries as a policy which is inducing centralization throughout Australia -116 believes that that policy has had the effect of centralizing in large factories most of the manufacturing industries of the Commonwealth.",29
254,Mr FENTON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What do you mean by secondary industries?,30
255,Mr SAMPSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The manufacturing industries. The primary producer raises the raw material, aud the secondary phase of the production is its conversion by the manufacturers into the finished article. The one is a primary producer, the other a secondary producer, but both are equally valuable units of the community. I am not attacking the tionist principle at all, but pointing out that for a considerable time there has been a belief on the part of wheat-growers that the tendency of the Protectionist policy has heen to centralize a large number of factories in the towns, and that such aggregation has had the effect of enormously helping the Labour policy of the Commonwealth. There is no doubt that that feeling has been growing for a considerable time amongst a number of sound Protectionist farmers. The farmer who is a Protectionist believes that the Protectionist policy should operate all round. I ask the Minister Avhether this was the only way in which he could do something to relieve the situation? Although I introduced a deputation to the Minister some time ago, and have asked him several questions on the subject here, I have refrained from asking him to suspend the duties on fodder. In Australia we grow something like 3,250,000 tons of hay per year, and consume the whole of that quantity. It is estimated that in Victoria this year there will he a shortage of full y 40 per cent. If that is the case all over Australia, probably the shortage will be 1,000,000 tons. Fodder for cattle is absolutely essential to the putting in of more wheat for next season. In my district, which, I may say, is the largest wheat-growing constituency in this State, 90 per cent, of my constituents will have to buy seed wheat, and,, as an immediate expedient, I am not prepared to say that they may not welcome the suspension of the wheat duty. Somefarmers will welcome the proposal as a means of getting seed wheat a little morecheaply than otherwise they could do. I can understand that the position is an acute one.  would come from the suspension of the fodder duties.",30
256,Mr SAMPSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . The Minister, having suspended the duty on wheat, should have suspended the fodder duties,, because fodder is as essential as. seed wheat to the putting of large areas under wheat for next year. The position of the Minister is an inconsistent one. I am prepared, and have been prepared as a P r o tectionist, to support the Protectionist Protecpolicy and to retain the duty on wheat in existing circumstances, because I believetliat fundamentally it is dangerous to interfere with and render unstable that which people believe to be a stable policy. If this course is to be taken in the case wheat because there happens to be a temporary shortage, why should it not be taken all round? Why should not the Minister suspend the duty on every commodity of which there is proved to be a shortage in the community? The reason for the very large importations of most of the goods we use is that we do not manufacture a sufficiency or do not manufacture the goods at all. If there is a shortage in any one of these lines, is there not a justification, assuming that the article has reached a famine price, as sometimes occurs, for a section of the community immediately representing that particular interest to ask the Minister to suspend the duty in order that the goods may be cheapened to the community? If able members are going to suspend the duties, oven on extraordinary occasions, in order to bring down the prices of commodities, they will completely undermine and upset the Protectionist policy of the Commonwealth. That, it seems to me, would be a very dangerous thing to do. So far a large section of the farmers, as we all know from the return of Protectionist members to this House, have loyally supported the Protectionist policy. I might divide my wheat-growers into two classes; one believes in having no wheat duty, but he says that consistently with that position there shall be no duty on agricultural machinery or any other 'product which the farmer uses. The Protectionist farmer is not able to state that, generally speaking, the duty on wheat is an effective duty, but he says that it is part of the policy df the Commonwealth, which he loyally supports, and might have a steadying influence on prices. That it can exercise a material influence on prices we know is not true, because we export more wheat than we consume. If the exportation^ of wheat is not to continue, wheat growing will cease to be an industry. As wheat is an exportable product, the. duty on the article is generally inoperative. I am very sorry to think that in present circumstances the Government have seen fit to propose taxes to be levied almost wholly on the lands of the community. I am not going to speak of the particular Mr Sampson. kinds of lands on which taxation is to be levied, but most of the new taxation is to be raised directly from the soil. On the of other hand, the Government have imposed a revenue duty on cornsacks, the raw material of the farmer, and immediately following that imposition he is singled out in connection with the wheat duty as the individual whose protection is to be disturbed, because there is a shortage of wheat in the Commonwealth. Possibly the action of the Minister may meet with the general approval of the community. I believe that it would have been possible for the States to have managed this business better, and probably if they had managed the business it would not have been necessary for the House to take any action. I am not referring to any particular State. The principle which has heen introduced by the Minister is one honor- which might work very badly in the building up of the general policy of Protection. In present circumstances, I regret very much the proposal of the Minister, although it will serve the wheat growers in my electorate who have to buy seed wheat. The proposal will he welcomed by those persons to some extent, and the consumer will - welcome it as a means of securing to him a cheaper loaf, but viewed from the Protectionist standpoint it introduces a dangerous principle. Having once decided to suspend the duty on wlieat during the period of the present drought, the Minister should, in order to be consistent, have suspended the fodder duties in order that the farmers might have an equally necessary commodity to secure the cultivation of a larger area next year. Erom whichever stand-point it is regarded, the proposal is certainly a blow aimed, at the established Protectionist policy of the country. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON"" (Lang) [3.28] - I must confess that I am not in agreement with some of my colleagues on this side in regard to the attitude of the Minister on this particular question. I , as a consumer, and speaking on behalf of other consumers, welcome the proposal. My only regret is that it does not go quite far enough. The Minister has stated that this year there will be a shortage of 7,000,000 bushels in the quantity of wheat, necessary for home consumption. I think that some action of this kind should he taken, because we shall need to import wheat in order to make up that deficiency and prevent the price of bread from going up.",30
257,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that that is a f a estimate.,32
258,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This action will tend to prevent the price of bread from being unduly increased, which is a great consideration to the masses of the people. We must have regard rather to the interests of the community as a whole than to those of any section, whether they be primary producers or manufacturers. Any action that can be taken to prevent the cornering of foodstuffs should be taken by whatever Government may be in power. Such action will always have my cordial support. The cornering or attempted cornering of the people's staple food supplies I regard as a crime against the community at large. I urge the Minister to go further. I am entirely in agreement with those who hold that the primary producers should not he subjected to unnecessary disabilities. One of the disabilities that have been imposed on the farmers is the duty on cornsacks; that duty has been objected to by representatives of the - farming community. The farmers object to it because it requires them to pay more for the cornsacks which they have to use. further handicap upon the farming in dustry is the duties on agricultural i m plements and machinery, and upon other things required for farming operations. I should like the Minister to recognise that the farmer needs encouragement. That-encouragement can best be given by removing taxation from the machinery, implements and material that he visestaxes which now add materially to the cost of farming. The honourable member for Wimmera has pointed out that the farmer himself will benefit by the free importation of wheat, because at the present time there is a shortage of seed wheat for the next sowing. Seed wheat will be cheaper now that the duty on wheat has been removed than it would have been had the duty remained in operation. That will be a. decided gain to farmers who have to purchase seed wheat. The normal market price of wheat, however, is not likely to he affected, because the cost of freight and in surance is in itself a considerable protection against undue competition from abroad, enabling tile locally produced wheat to compete successfully against the imported wheat. As a consumer, and speaking on behalf of consumers, I am i r glad that action has been taken which will prevent the price of bread from being unduly increased. I welcome any steps that may be taken, especially in a time of drought and of war, to prevent the inflation of the prices of the necessaries of life. There are some who can afford to pay higher prices, but the majority who are wage-earners cannot bear a heavier burden than that which is now imposed on them. The purchasing power of their earnings has been materially reduced by the imposition of duties on the many articles which they have to purchase to meet their daily needs. A tax which would increase thebread b i ll of a f a m i l y by Is. per week would he a very serious thing to most wage-earners.",32
259,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I mean Is. per week per family.,32
260,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Eve n an increase of Is. per week per family would be a most serious matter for most housewives, who have to consider caref u l l y the parcelling out of every pennv of their weekly house-money. Anything tending to alleviate the condition of the A community at large will have my support. ^Neither the farmers nor any other section of the community should benefit at the expense of the community at large.",32
261,Mr SAMPSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But why single out the farmer for the imposition of disabilities? Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON - I do not think that he should be so singled out,, but that a similar course of action should be taken regarding the things the farmer needs in the prosecution of his industry. The Minister has pointed out that the price of bread would have risen to almost a prohibitive figure if he had not taken the action which he has taken. The farmers would be the last men in the world to wish to bring about such a state of things as would arise from the excessive dearness of bread. As it is, they will not be affected adversely. On the showing of the honourable member for Wimmera, they will still be able to command good prices for their wheat, because the demand is greater than the supply, and they will he able to buy seed wheat, not at the prices now prevailing, but at the cheaper rates which will result from the removal of the duties. Mr KING O'MALLEY [3.38] - I seriously object to the declaration that the removal of duties means the reduction of prices. As a Protectionist, I hold that the imposition of duties does not increase prices, but that it regulates the circulation of commodities. Wheat is not much dearer here, according to the Minister's statement, than it is in Chicago.",32
262,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is nearly 2s. a bushel dearer.,33
263,Mr KING OMALLEY,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is because the Chicago wheat corner has burst, and Patten is away in Europe, and cannot gefc back from the war area. If he were back, wheat would go up to 7s. or 8s. a bushel. We Protectionists hold that Protection does not increase prices, but that it enables the local community to produce commodities to replace importations.  we asking for an alteration of the Constitution fco enable us to distribute the profits ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Thes e alterations of the Constitution are going to bring about the millennium. I see her coming with white wings and spiritual robes, but it will take years for her to get here. Protection is a fundamental Australiau policy. It is the current that circulates through the national"" veins. When Mr Wilson was elected President of the United States of America he pro]?osed to' create the most prosperous nation - on earth by reducing the American Tariff duties. He did reduce the duties, and in the United States of America today there are 15,000,000 of people out of work, the exports of the country are valued at £18,000,000 less than the exports of the year before, and the value of the imports has increased by some £30,000,000 or £40,000,000. I do not believe that taking the duty off wheat will reduce the price.",33
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What are the Government doing it for then ?,33
265,Mr KING OMALLEY,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,My honourable friend should remember that the members of the Labour party fight in masses like the German army.,33
266,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Do they?,33
267,Mr KING OMALLEY,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , and so - do their opponents. The people generally are under the impression that the removal of a duty will reduce the price of (Darwin) an article. I protest against the suggestion that the removal of duties has a tendency to reduce the price of the dutiable articles. That is not so where we have proper Protection, and not a ""shandygaff"" Protection; where we have real Protection, and not a compromise of expediency with the devil, where the devil always wins.",33
268,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Protectio n is the devil anyhow!,33
269,Mr KING OMALLEY,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , it is Christianity. Under Protection we can establish local factories and great national institutions and organizations. I understand that the Minister of Trade and Customs proposes merely the temporary suspension of the duty on wheat, to meet the present crisis. The crisis covers a multitude of sins. Our farmers have to contend against insects, drought, and other visitations, and they have comparatively poor crops in the best seasons. The wheat average of Australia in the best seasons is only \ 1 \ bushels, whilst the average in Germany is 33 bushels to the acre. The oat crop of Australia averages only 21 bushels to the acre, whilst the average is 44 bushels in Germany and Prance. We have further to consider the high rates of interest which the Australian farmer must pay. I doubt whether there is one farmer in Australia who has been able to secure an overdraft at less than 6 per cent.",33
270,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In South Australia a farmer can secure a loan on mortgage for 4^ per cent, from the State Savings Bank.",33
271,Mr KING OMALLEY,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That may be so; but what does it amount to when he. pays the lawyer for making out the transfer ?,33
272,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Lawyer s are not employed for the purpose. In South Australia the authorities of the Savings Bank charge nothing for the transfers.,33
273,Mr KING OMALLEY,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That makes a difference; but what has the farmer to pay for stamp duty ?,33
274,Mr SAMPSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is not very big. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Whateve r it is it goes to increase the interest rate. Then, if the farmer wants £500, he must take it all at once, aud may have to lose interest on £40 0 of it for a year.",33
275,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He can get the money as he requires it .,33
276,Mr KING OMALLEY,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But lie cannot get it as he wants it at 4^ per cent. I have been in this business too long not to know that. In Germany or France a farmer can get inoney at 3^ to 4 per cent, on the overdraft, or Scotch credit system. Honourable members should not forget that in Australia today our public and private debt amounts to the sum of £700,000,000. The farmers of Australia have to produce £35,000,000 for interest every year. The land and the farmers are the national sources of the wealth of Australia. We might burn down our big cities, but if. we keep our farmers on their farms they will later build greater than any we have in Australia today, but burn out our farmers, and we city men must stew in our own gravy. What we should do is to make it as easy as possible for our farmers to cultivate the soil. We should give them every encouragement. When we are dealing with the Commonwealth Bank Bill , I shall have something to say about cheap money.",34
277,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wakefield) [3.46] - I thoroughly agree with the action of the Government, but I do not think they have adopted the simplest method to give effect to their desire. It would have been quite as effective if the Minister of Trade and Customs had merely proposed a suspension rather than the repeal of the duty on wheat. The Minister has intimated that it is not the intention of the Government that the proposed repeal of the duty shall be permanent, but there will be considerable anxiety in the community as to when the duty repealed will again be imposed.",34
278,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What is the value of it except in a drought year ?,34
279,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall deal with that in a moment. I should like the Minister of Trade and Customs to give the Committee an assurance that the repeal of the duty on wheat is intended only to operate from the present time to the beginning of the next harvest in October or November of next year.,34
280,Mr TTJDOB,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I said definitely when submitting the proposal that it was to deal with the present extreme position, and that the Government would re-impose the duty when considering the Tariff soon after A p r i l next.",34
281,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am obliged to the Minister for his reply, which is, so far, satisfactory; but I sliould like to know why his consideration in this regard did not extend to the duty on fodder as well as to the duty on wheat. In connection with the outlook for next seeding time, the difficulty in providing fodder will be quite as pressing as the difficulty in providing seed wheat.",34
282,Mr SAMPSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And there is a bigger proportion of shortage in the production of fodder.,34
283,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is so. There are districts in South Australia that have suffered more or less severely from the drought, but there is still in those districts an abundance of wheat for seed and for flour, although scarcely any cities fodder in hand and no herbage in the paddocks with which to face the coming winter. One phase of the great trouble, in South Australia more particularly, is that, during the summer and autumn, farmers within the rainfall area, where drought conditions hitherto have been comparatively unknown, will suffer more severely from want of herbage in the paddocks than from shortness of wheat. Mv. VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Then let us take off the fodder duties now,",34
284,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I can only recall two occasions, during an experience extending over thirty years, when a duty on wheat has been of any value to the farmers.",34
285,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then why did the honourable member suggest just now that this duty should be restored ?,34
286,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Because I have no authority, as a representative of the wheat-growers i u my State, to deal with this question. The conditions are exceptional. Two causes are contributing to the very high price of wheat. In the first place, the price of wheat existing today is at a liigher point than it would have reached but for the European war; whilst the second consideration, and one' nearer home, is the existence of a drought which has deprived more than one-half of the wheat-growers of South Australia, at all events, of any result from thei r labours during the past year. It will leave most of these wheat-growers without any seed wheat for next year's crop.' Those who are in the happy position of holding wheat do not desire to obtain an exorbitant price- a price higher than has been reached in Australia during the last 40 years-at the expense of their more unfortunate fellow farmers who haveneither wheat nor fodder.",34
287,Mr RODGEHS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable member know one farmer who, notwithstanding the high price of wheat, w i ll make, this year, the cost of production?",35
288,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know from painful experience that what the honourable member suggests is right. But the farmer is a man with a big heart, who would far rather have a quarter loaf than enjoy a big loaf while his neighbours and fellow farmers in different parts of the Commonwealth were without any bread at all. This is not only a humane, but a business-like proposition, because, in the interests of Australia and the Empire as a whole, we all desire to see under wheat next year the largest area ever cultivated in Australia. I wish to express my appreciation of the penitence displayed by the Minister of Trade and Customs in this act of grace. His conscience has been pricked very considerably in regard to the imposition of the duty on cornsacks, and in this, his latest proposal, he is trying, as far as possible, to undo that injustice. The honourable member suggested, a few moments ago, that the duty on cornsacks was not a matter of much importance to the farmers, since they would have very little wheat to put in the sacks. But that explanation serves only to aggravate his offence. Cornsacks are imported to meet the conditions of an average season, and not with a drought in contemplation.",35
289,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then they must be here already.,35
290,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is another point. In ordinary circumstances we could have snapped our fingers at the Minister and his duty on cornsacks, because the sacks would have been imported and distributed amongst the farmers before the new Tariff schedule was submitted. But the special war conditions prevailing so interfered with shipping that the first consignment of cornsacks arrived here, I am informed, only a few days ago. They have not been cleared, and they will be subject to a revenue duty, which is certainly unjustifiable from every point of view. The impost on cornsacks has to be borne despite the fact that cornsacks today cost nearly twice as much as they did two years ago, the price of jute having practically doubled. The farmers, or some one representing the farmers, will have to pay the duty, aud carry these cornsacks over to next season, plus the duty and twelve months' interest. Farmers, therefore, will be very heavily h it . If the Government had power to withdraw any portion of the Tariff schedule, I should ask them very earnestly, in the interests of justice and good business, to withdraw that relating to the duty on cornsacks. That, however, cannot be done. I shall not be at all surprised, however, if at a very early date the Government are not approached by at least one or more of the State Governments and asked to extend what they have already done in this particular direction by suspending the duties on fodder.",35
291,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3"". 581-- I recognise that this subject opens up a wide field of discussion, but whilst the Government do not desire to stifle debate, I appeal to honourable members to curtail their remarks as much as possible, otherwise we shall be unable to adjourn for the holidays within the time originally proposed. Mr JOSE PH COOK (Parramatta) [3.59] - I wish to support the appeal made by the Minister of Trade and Customs. This debate has made it apparent that while honourable members opposite, as the honourable member for Darwin suggests, fight in close formation, we on this side of the House do not. It seems to me that the Minister of Trade and Customs, in submitting this proposal, has split up my party. I have formed the conclusion this afternoon that . honourable members are Protectionists when we are going to gain something, and that we are all Free Traders when we think we are going to lose something.",35
292,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That has not been the position of the farmers, for they have been standing loyally by the Protectionist policy.",35
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then I shall say no more.,35
294,Mr GROOM,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Provided it is understood that no one else will speak.,35
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Speakin g seriously, I think that we ought to terminate this debate. I strongly resent the attitude of the Government over this matter. There was a definite understanding that we were to clear off the business on the notice-paper, but the Prime Minister is loading it up all the time.",35
296,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This resolution is not loading it up any more than an item in the Tariff does.,36
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The day has gone now, we are no "" forrarder,"" and there is all this work still to be done. Since nothing can be done with this item now any more than with any other item now. in the Tariff, we had better postpone discussion for the time being, and get on with some of the other business.",36
298,Mr CARR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Macquarie) I want to combat the assumption on the part of honourable members opposite, - of some honourable members on this side, that it is inconsistent for a Protectionist to advocate the removal of the duty wheat, or that the Protectionist theory is entirely exploded because it becomes necessary or advisable to remove a duty. Protection as a principle is not challenged, although the Leader of the Opposition says it is. We conserve our market's for our own products when we know that we can supply our requirements, but when it is obvious that through no f a u l t of the country, or of the people in it , we cannot - do so, surely common sense dictates that we should meet the situation. Some one has said that consistency is the doctrine - of fools, and it is time that some people recognised the truth underlying the saying. When our own production is in excess of our requirements, the price of the commodity is immediately levelled by the world's price, and, conversely, when our - own requirements are not supplied in ternally, the incoming commodities are regulated by the Tariff, and therefore the prices of all our supplies within the T a r i ff barrier are raised accordingly. We do not want this. No Protectionist is anxious for high prices. We want to conserve our markets for ourselves, and when this is done effectively there is no abuse possible. Provided that competit i o n is possible, it is immediately generated. Our desire is that the competition shall he encouraged, and that the advantages of a Tariff shall not be abused. It is for that reason that we have asked for greater powers, but that opens up another question. I am rather interested in the socialistic suggestion of the honourable member for Wannon that the Government should go on to the market like the State Governments, and buy what is - considered to be the auanfcifcv of wheat required - That shortage cannot be definitely ascertained. I am averse to the Federal Government doing that in any case. The State Government are doing quite enough in that direction. All that the Commonwealth Government can do to meet the situation is what they are doing Wheat is not on a par with our its ordinary manufactures at all, because, whenever, in the case of manufactures, we are fallin g short in our supplies, or the price is exorbitant, it is due to the [4.2] - operations of men or combinations of men-action s that are to be deprecated and and are capable of being dealt with. The present situation, however, is not due to men at all ; it is an act of Providence, on and we are justified in meeting it .",36
299,Sir JOHJST FORREST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Swan) [4.6]. - I regret that this proposal has been introduced, because it seems to me to be contrary to the principles that have been followed, at any rate by Protectionists. It seems to be altogether opposed to the actions and speeches of the Minister of Trade and Customs ever since he entered this House. I always thought he was an ultra-Protectionist, and almost a prohibitionist, but I am afraid that his ideas are circumscribed by what is going on in Victoria, and that he forms his judgment from what he sees immediately around him. I fear that he does not take a wide view of the whole question. The Government of Victoria are quite alive to local interests, but the honourable member has admitted that he has not consulted any of the people or Governments of the States, and has acted "" off his own hat."" That might be very well if his knowledge - was sufficient, but he certainly requires some justification for his action in taking away the only protection that there is for the primary producer-the farmerwhile at the same time placing additional burdens upon him. The T a r i ff already proposes to tax his sacks and bags, machinery and implements, to the extent of about £170,000 a year, and if there is anything to be gained by the farmer by means of protection against the world, it is now to he taken away from him. Such an attitude cannot be consistent. The Government say in effect, "" Tax the farmer more, and take away from him any advantage that he might otherwise gain. At a time when the revenue is fallin g increase the expenditure. Make the expenditure as ""large as possible, and finish up w j th a deficit""- a thing we have never done before. I may say that it is taxation which we would never have introduced. I put it forward as an argument for what it is worth, that if the late Government had remained in office, we should never have brought in these terrible duties and additional taxes against the producing interests. If the Minister of Trade and Customs says it is obligatory, it is so only from his point of view, and would not have been obligatory on our part. I remember that during the drought of 1901-2, and also in 1907, there were tremendous importations of agricultural produce.",36
300,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think we ported in 1907. Sir JOHN"" FORREST - At any rate it was desired to make hay and chaff free at the time because stock were starving. I voted against complying with the request, although most of those sitting with me at that time on the cross-benches voted the other way, I noticed that the lionorable member and most of his colleagues voted against taking the duty off on that occasion, although it was known that stock were starving, and there were tremendous importations ot hay, chaff, wheat, and other things.",37
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I thin k that every drought they all voted solidly for their consistency. against taking off the duties.,37
302,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This is a new attitude of theirs altogether, and I not think the Minister has given us sufnumber ficient reason for his action.",37

304,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is no he reason why I should not say what I think about it . The honourable member is going age. in an entirely opposite direction f r o that which he has followed on former occasions. I should not object to the admission of wheat free of duty if it was £ 6 or £ 7 a ton. really necessary, hut the duty should not be taken off in this way without saying how long the suspension is to last.  did say that.",37

306,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But the necessity for the suspension may not last so long. This seems to be the last straw in the penalization of those who are the backbone of the country-the producers from the soil. I do not know what has come over the Minister, who seems to he acting in a way diametrically opposed to his previous speeches and actions.",37
307,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Did you not want to tax tea and kerosene?,37
308,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honorim- ahle member has tea and kerosene on the brain. He only opposes duties on them because he thinks they are unpopular. He is always trying to see how the cat is going to jump before he takes action. I am saying nothing about tea and kerosene, nor do I see why the honourable member should make that interjection. All I am saying is that the Minister has been inconsistent. The Government are doing now only what they have done ever since they came into power; they are placing extra burdens on the land-owners and producers of the soil.  during sorry I cannot commend the Government Some six weeks ago I asked the Minister of Trade and Customs to remove the fodder duties in view of the terrible drought. This I did! do in deference to the wishes of a great of my pastoralist, constituents, who themselves have forwarded a petition to Parliament. At that time nobody could on possibly judge what the crop was to be, but we are now told ""by the Minister that has made inquiries from the various States, and found that there is no shortThis is a strange statement, in m view of the fact-though , of course, it may be a coincidence-that the ruling price of chaff for some weeks has been Graziers and sheep farmers sliould certainly receive some relief at the present time.

W hy not put a tax on the general community? - one class? Those producers who are asked to give away £1,350,000 are also - called upon to pay an extra £1,100,000 in land taxation, £147,000 in connection with their cornsacks, and £28,000 in duty on their machinery. .seen that they are called upon to pay £1,275,000 in taxation, in addition to the reduction of their income by £1,350,000. Mr Knibbs puts the average - consumption per head of wheat, for bread purposes, at 5J or 6 bushels, <so - that the retention of the duty means to each individual about 6s. per annum, - or a saving in the cost of living of l j d . or l i d . per week - In the face of these figures, honourable members opposite are telling the people of Australia that their policy will result in making ""bread cheap. How many unemployed are there? If there were 70,000 unemployed, who would be called upon to pay l ^ d . per week, let the Government provide that sum from general taxatiou, and not place the whole burden on the farmers, who, with full benefit of their profit, will be able to pay good wages. Of course this matter does not affect, - so far as I can see, a single member from New South Wales, simply because Mr . Holman and the Labour party in that State have commandeered the whole of the wheat, and fixed the price at 5s. Further, to prevent any wheat coming - into Victoria from New South Wales, they have, T understand, instructed the Railway Commissioners not to allow - farmers to send any across the border. But what is the result? Numbers of farmers, who happen to live near the border, are carting their own wlieat over, - and I do not see why those who are dependent on the railways should have their position prejudiced in this way. My impression was that under Federation trade was to be absolutely free amongst the States; but, in view of the embargo placed on wheat by the New South Wales Government, it is high time the matter was looked into. If the duty is to be taken off, let there be an absolutely free exchange of wheat, so that b in g the producers of New South Wales may enjoy the same rights and privileges as the producers in California and other parts of the world.",37

Here is a M i nister who claims to be the chief priest and apostle of Protection in this country. It will be Mr TUDOR - I never made such a claim at any time in my life. The honourable member ought to read the Age!",38
310,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At any rate, the honourable gentleman claims to be a Protectionist.",38
311,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I grant that.,38
312,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the Minister for one moment maintain that his action today is calculated to support the Protectionist policy? No one knows better than he that the only time the wheat duty can possibly be operative is when there is a shortage; and the other primary products are in exactly the same position. There is, for instance, a duty on butter ; and I ask the Minister whether he proposes to remove that duty the next time there is a shortage in that commodity, and we have to fall back on imports from New Zealand and elsewhere ?",38
313,Mr FENTON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But we are exporting butter.,38
314,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And we are exporting wheat in most seasons.,38
315,Mr FENTON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not this year.,38
316,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Exactly ; but the time will come when we shall experience a drought in the dairying districts of Australia, when there will be a shortage of butter, and wlien we shall be obliged to import that commodity. Will the M in ister take the same action then that he is taking now ?",38
317,Mr TUDOR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are experiencing the best butter season that we have ever experienced.,38
318,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I kuow that. .But the Minister is evading my question. When a shortage of butter occurs in this country, will he be prepared to suspend the duty upon that commodity? Similarly, when a shortage occurs in sugar in Australia, will he take action to remove the duty upon that article?",38
319,Mr WEST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"""No.",39
320,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why not?,39
321,Mr WEST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Because outside of Australia sugar is produced by black labour.,39
322,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Outsid e of Australia, is not wheat produced by black labour? I venture to say that if any wheat be imported into the Commonwealth this year it will be imported from countries which, employ black labour.",39
323,Mr WEST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not from Canada.,39
324,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We shall not import any wheat from Canada. Possibly we may get a little from India, and probably we shall get some from the Argentine. I repeat that the only wheat which we are likely to import this year will probably have been grown by black labour. In these circumstances, the proposal cf the Government amounts to an absolute denial of those principles for which they profess to stand. I admit chat Lt will be a popular move amongst the gieat majority of the people. Though the advantage to be gained is one which is more apparent than real-because , as the honourable member for Calare has pointed out, the actual amount involved is but small in the aggregate-the Government proposal will be very popular amongst the great majority of the community. But is it a fair thing for a Government whose members have taken their stand on the policy of Protection to turn round on the very first occasion that that policy would hit their supporters in very least degree, and do that which absolutely opposed to their principles?",39
325,Mr WEST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is not the honourable memposition ber going to stand to his friends ? I,39
326,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course the honorphases able memher is. His interjection has pressed the whole policy of the Labour party. They will stand to their friends and swallow their principles on every occasion that there are votes at stake. When we look at their financial proposals we are bound to admit that their aim is to crush the primary producer by every possible means. Look at the duty which they have imposed upon cornsacks. The only man who is hit by the Tariff is primary producer. The attitude of the Government is a repudiation of the prinimport ciples for which they avowedly stand, and a denial of the policy upon which they were returned to office. I hope that in future country voters will know how to treat men who profess to represent the farming classes, but who turn down their interests on every conceivable occasion.",39
327,Mr FENTON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Maribyrnong) [4.26]. - I am one of those who do not believe in suspending a Protective policy on every occasion. But I believe that the circumstances of today are quite exceptional. If it were not for the absolute promise of the Minister that the suspension of the duty upon wheat will he only of a temporary character, I am certain that a large number of honourable members upon . this side of the Chamber would not support his proposal. In 1902 we had the iowest wheat yield ever recorded in Australia, the harvest realizing only 12,37S,000 bushels. On the 12th December of that year the price of wheat ranged from 5s. 4W. to 5s. 6d. per bushel, and the price of flour from £12 to £12 5s. per ton. On 12th Deceiirber of the present year, when we have an assured yield of over 25,000,000 bushels- I admit that there is a difference in our population-the price of wheat stands at 6s. 9d. per bushel and the price of flour at £14 per ton. What is the reason for the difference which is disclosed in these figures? Even if the duty upon wheat he suspended, I believe that the farmer this year will receive a3 much, if not more, for his grain than he received in 1902.  the very glad to hear the figures quoted by is the honourable member for Maribyrnoug, because it is only by instituting comparisons that we are enabled to appreciate the that we occupy today. I intend am. to place before the Committee one or two of this question, not because I exanticipate that my remarks will have any effect on the Minister, but because I desire him to obtain a fuller grip of the position from the stand-point of the producers than he appears to have at present. As the honourable member for Maribyrnong has pointed out, on the occasion of the last drought of a serious character experienced in Australia- I refer to the year 1902-3-the wheat yield of the Comthe monwealth amounted to about 12,000,(00 bushels. It was then found necessary to for food and other purposes no less than 10,000,000 bushels of wheat. But, although an effort was made in this Chamber to suspend the duty upon wheat, that effort failed, and the quantity of wheat imported did not have a very large effect upon the price of the loaf. During the present year we have, I presume, an assured wheat harvest of something like 25,000,000 bushels, and it is assumed that, in order to meet the requirements of our population, we shall be obliged to i m port 7,000,000 bushels from overseas. The ratio of difference between our population in 1902-3 and that in 1914-15 is not commensurate with the difference between the present crop in sight, and that harvested in 1902-3; but the point I wish to make is that the grower in 1902-3 waa under the domination of the world's market, whereas today he is not under that domination, for the simple reason that only a few months ago the Minister of Trade and Customs saw fit to put an embargo on the export of wheat, in spite of our having more than twice the harvest that we had in 1902-3. This embargo against the export of wheat practically means that the whole of Australia's wheat crop is retained in Australia for the purposes of Australia. The removal of the import duty will subject that wheat to a certain extent to competition with wheat grown by black labour, as pointed out very properly by the honourable member for Richmond. We are too credulous and hopeful if we think that we can get wheat from Canada. That Dominion is practically committed to supply all its surplus to the United Kingdom. Last year the United Kingdom had a shortage of 50,000,000 bushels, although we contributed 18,000,000 bushels, and to which countries in Europe that are today out of action contributed many million bushels. Russia will not allow wheat to be exported because it requires its wheat crop for its own use, and as Austria, Hungary, and some parts of France are in a similar position, Great Britain must look largely for its supply to Canada. What it cannot obtain from that source it will probably get from A r - alphabet 'of farming. gentine and India, while the removal of our import duty on wheat will mean that some of our shortage of 7,000,000 bushels will be grown by black labour in Indi thus is Labour wisdom justified of her children. To disturb the political equilibrium that the farmer has been [64] led to believe exists regarding his calling is not a proper thing to do. The farmers as a class have been truly f a it h f u l to the basic principle of our Federation-that there should be Inter-State Free Trade with some modicum of Protection against the outside world-ye t at the only time that this i m post on wheat can be at all effective, t h at is when there is a shortage in the wheat supply of Australia, it is proposed to take away that modicum of Protection. Therefore, .1 say that, in the circumstances, the inducement for the farmer to remain f a it h f u l and loyal to his political creed is fco be severely shaken.",39
328,Mr WEST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A r e you a Protectionist?  tectionist.,40
329,Mr WEST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Whaf c sort of a thing is that?  stand that the honourable member does not know what a moderate Protectionist is. He does not understand many things. When we have a Protectionist Tariff which will induce men to enter upon occupations, if these men become i m bued with the idea that the protection afforded to them is to last only so long as it is not effective, they will probably suffer a serious disturbance of their political faith. I do not know how those honourable members on the other side of the Chamber, who represent constituencies containing large numbers of primary producers, can reconcile their position as members of a party which proposes to remove the duty on wheat. When they go before their constituents, they will have some ugly questions to answer, seeing that tlieir party propose fco do this, while at the same time they place a tax on the very bags that the primary producers have practically to give away with their wheat. The honourable member for East Sydney interjects freely. I like to hear city bushmen arguing about matters of which they know nothing. I take the liberty of questioning whether the honourable member understands the If he did, he would not display the inability his in terjections give evidence of. If we wish to raise a big question among the primarya : producers of Australia, let this motion go through without protest, and we shall soon be satisfied as to what the result will be from the wheat farmer's point of view.  [4.36] - I may be permitted in a fewwords to say something in protest against the action of the Government which has"" one .direct object, and that is the infliction of further penalties and hardships upon the primary, producers' from the soil by a Government which proposes-to put increased Customs duties on - sacks, woolpacks, and agricultural machinery to the tune of £173,779} and to increasetheland tax by £1,240,000, making a total of £1,413,779 extra taxation to be paid directly by the primary producers. The import duty of Is. 6d. per-100 lbs. on wheat is of no value to the wheat grower when there is sufficient wheat grown in Australia for Australian requirements and wheat is at a reasonable price. But immediately there is an opportunity for the wheat-grower to get a somewhat betterprice for his wheat the duty is to be taken off, and he is to be deprived of something to which he is entitled, and to run the risk of having wheat imported and sold against him, as our friends say, in order to give the consumers a cheaper loaf. Let us look at the duties that will have to be borne by the farmers under the new Tariff. They include potato bags, woolpacks, and cornsacks, £ 1 4 4 , 8 9 0; chaffcutters, £ 4 , 9 3 6 ; harvesters, £ 2 , 5 0 8 ; mowers, reapers, and binders, £7,297, and other agricultural £14,148, or a total of £173,779. admitted on all sides that the country can get along without cities, and that if the country did not exist the people in the cities would melt in their own f at. How can we expect to induce people to deprive themselves of certain conveniences possessed by people in the cities, and go out and. populate our far-back countiy, when directly the opportunity presents itself the Government in power are prepared to penalize them by inflicting on them extra taxation on the machinery they use, and the bags they must have for their produce, and at the same time to h it them in another way by taking the duty off imported wheat.  other duties later on.  shall not deal with them now, but merely enter my protest against the action which the Government have taken. Although, perhaps, members on the Government side States. are not going to deal with this Tariff on p a r t y lines, I ask that each individual member-will view this question from the stand-point of fairness, equity, j and justice, and if members do that I am perfectly sure they will see that these imposts are unreasonable and will inflict a great hardship on the man outback, who, at the present time, is very sorely pressed by drought and other adversities.",40

I shall be able to. justify my attitude on. this question before my constituents. But if , on the contrary, I am mistaken, I . shall be much more satisfied,, in the circumstances, to be obliged to retire to my farm, than I should be if , in a moment of supreme t r i a l such as the present, I were led aside by. any of the huckstering., arguments I have had to listen to. today. What is the position at the present moment ? Though the figures are not clear,- yet, by their aid, supplemented by my own practical knowledgeas a wheat-grower, I believe that more than one-half of the. actual wheat-growers throughout the Commonwealth will be purchasers of wheat for flour and seed. We know, too, that-the war may last indefinitely, and that freights and. insurance may rise. We machinery, know that even upon the most, extrava^ It is gant estimate of. the harvest we shall have a. shortage of from . 10,000,000 to 12,000,000 bushels of wheat, the i m portation of which will be essential for the welfare of people who are non-producers and, also for the wheat growers. On. account - of the limitations of the Constitution, the action which would be best for the Commonwealth to take at this moment of peril, is not possible; that is, to treat the wheat supply of the continent as we would treat the food supplies of a beleaguered city, by taking full possession of it and making the Commonwealth, responsible for the balance. I believe that that position is not now possible of attainment by the Commonwealth. But the Government have taken the only possible means open to them for the purpose of protecting the whole community. I",41
331,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Government could do what you suggest as agents for the,41
332,Mr LYNCH,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member sought to make us helieve, with that lamblike simplicity which is supposed to be characteristic of the farmer, that there is nothing wrong with ""the present laws of distribution; but we know that unless some action is taken to prevent wholesale robbery under the 'present imperfect system of distribution, there will be absolute starvation amongst a big portion of our people, and, in addition, spoliation and robbery of a large number of the wheat growers. That is the position as it appeals to me. Those honourable members who talk about the removal of the fodder duties being of equal importance with the removal of the wheat duties are misconceiving the position. There is no analogy between the two duties. Every hour of rain and every change of conditions may help to solve the problem of food supply for stock, and even in the last resort, if we are faced with the alternative of whether stock or human beings shall die, we shall have little difficulty in apportioning our sympathy. It is also true that by using those portions of our fertile continent which are not afflicted by drought, and making the best of the conditions in those portions which are afflicted, by the growing of other crops, we can do much more to alleviate the difficulty in regard to feed for stock than we could by any interference with the fodder duty. The difficulty 'in that respect is not a great one; I am a staunch Protectionist who is not willing to subvert his principles for any exigency except one of pre-eminent importance. The exigency of today is one of pre-eminent importance, and if,"" as I believe, it is a situation that can never arise again in our lifetime, or, I hope, in the history of the world, we cannot reasonably cavil at extraordinary action to do the best thing possible in a set of disastrous circumstances. As I apprehend the situation, what the Government are doing is this: The wheat supply being short, we are going to provide means by which the exploiters of the present false system of distribution will be compelled to loosen the ropes they have put round the necks of the community, because, for the time being, our ports wil l be open to wheat from oversea. At the same time we shall see that the principle of Protection is observed so far as to insure that . the wheat-growers will not be affected in the future. Surely, when we take the [64]- 2 only means by which we can protect all parties we are not doing anything which is not justifiable upon the highest prin ciples. Those people who think they can make political capital by indicting us before the farming constituencies will find that they are reckoning without their host. The vast majority of the wheat produced in New South Wales is produced by share-farmers, who have much bigger grievances in connection with the initia l stages of production and distribution than may he brought about by the cause we are now discussing. As I have mentioned on a previous occasion, if those persons who are so vociferous in their professions of a desire to benefit the working farmer, would display a little more energy and intelligence in attempting to solve the problem of setting reproductive labour free, we should have something to be grateful for . It is not their business in the hour of trial and trouble, when extraordinary circumstances are forced upon us, to try to indict us on principles and on evidence which would be relevant in ordinary circumstances, but which are entirely out of Court at present.  fanners as heavily as it will h it anybody.",42
333,Mr LYNCH,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It will h it very few of the share farmers. I heard one honourable member say that he did nOt know one wheat farmer who would make a profit on' the year's operations. I know many such, and' I am sorry to say that the vast majority df this class will not make a profit this year, hut will be sure of a loss. The system which' I hope to see instituted, and which in the various States we will claim the aid of these gentlemen to institute and maintain, will bring about a state of things by which, working on a system of averages, we shall be able to provide for bad years out of good years. I employ a few share farmers too. I would prefer to make up the difference out of my own pocket than to support a proposal which would enable a very few farmers who have some wheat to exploit the general public, and to f ill the coffers of speculators under our absurd system of distribution. I could easily' show honourable members, if I wished to take up time, why Protectionists have no delusions about this matter. Although we believe that Protection - can and does accelerate production, it can in no wise secure equitable distribution. That is why we support new Protection and State interference, or what our opponents call State Socialism. It is very easy to show that in such a highly protected country as the United States of America, although wealth has been developed to an extraordinary degree by the imposition and maintenance of a Protectionist policy, its distribution has become a scandal as well as a danger to the whole world. ""We are told, on evidence put forward by a late member of the House, Mr. Thomas Brown, in a paper he read some time ago, that in the United States of America nine men control £600,000,000. The Labour party is out all over the world for the purpose of providing by effective Protection-and it will never be effective until we are able to institute the new Protection- a system which will not only secure the greatest possible result for labour applied under scientific principles of production, with every aid that can be devised by the community or the individual, but also a system which will insure its legitimate, fair, and equitable distribution amongst the people who created it.",42
334,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why do you not set up in business on these lines?,43
335,Mr LYNCH,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable gentleman knows perfectly well that individual action is utterly incapable of opposing the forces which scientific swindling has developed in this age, and for that reason we want to introduce this system. In Australia we have not the power now. In the extraordinary circumstances which are apparent to all, the Commonwealth Government are doing the best possible thing- I do not say that it is the best thing-and we hope by the institution and maintenance of this truer and better system with regard to production and distribution to obviate the necessity of even our principles being subverted in a moment of exigency such as the one we are going through now. The men who claim to speak in the name of the working farmer, as I have pointed out before, are never heard where he is being robbed and despoiled. I was corrected for stating that a man can put in and take out a crop, without including the cost of seed and the manure, for £1 an acre, farmers 1 and the honourable gentleman, at one time Premier of an adjoining State, who contradicted me, said that the statement is an obvious absurdity. Nine shillings an acre, he said, is the cost of the seed to put in the crop, and he put down the price of the bags to hold the crop at 2s. I can honestly say that for the twenty-five years I have been growing wheat, the bulk of the seed, being produced on the farm on special plots, has not cost me 3s. a bushel, and if it did not take 7s. or 8s. to provide the bags to hold each 9s. worth of seed sown, the bulk of us would have been in the poorhouse. This only goes to show that a man who says that 9s. worth of ordinary or average seed wheat, when harvested, will go into 2s. worth of bags knows nothing about the question. That is the class of man we have safeguarding the farming interests in the State and Federal Parliaments, and voicing the grievances of the farmers. If I had the time, and honourable members cared to listen, I could tell them that on the Stock Boards on the local governing bodies, where I sat for years, and even on the Land Boards, whose presiding officers are some of the ablest men in Australia, the conditions which are brought about through absurd laws would simply appal practical men, and it is little wonder that we have men of intelligence and capacity flocking from the country to the cities. These are grievances apparent to the every-day eye of a practical man, but I have never heard them challenged by the gentlemen who, for the purpose of making a little political capital, try lo indict certain action as being against the interests of the farmers. In the Labour movement we represent the legitimate farmer who works with his own hands. What justification is there for attempting to conduct an industry in a wholesale way under a system of expensive idlers when any man of ordinary intelligence may, with application and perseverance, become a fairly successful farmer? Why do we require a system which really means that we have quite a number of expensive people who never do a day's work, but who farm the farmer, and claim to voice his interests and support him in every possible way?",43
336,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Did you not tell us a the little while ago that you had share,43
337,Mr LYNCH,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"My own relatives are share farming now, since I have come into the more unprofitable avenue of production, the Federal Parliament, where I quite realise that a man may be killed more effectively than he can be when he is working on a farm in the open air. Considering the position in which Australia finds herself, considering the danger that even the supplies which are now possible may be shut off during the next four or six months- I hope that it will not be so-ha s not the one practical action which is possible to give relief and to provide security been taken by the Government?  wheat!",43
338,Mr LYNCH,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The British Empire, of which the honourable member is so proud, and in support of which we often hear his eloquent voice, never questions whether it is black, brown, or brindle that guards it . I recollect the days when the party which he supports were dominant in my State. When I went out as a working reaper, I found ten Chinamen placed in a paddock to work with a party of white men. Whatever little troubles their industrial conscience might make is, of course, entirely due to their association, even though distant, with the party opposite, and not with that of which I have the honour to he a member. Notwithstanding the protest of the honourable gentleman who claims to be a representative of a section of the farmers, which undoubtedly he is-the misguided And benighted section which the majority of us were compelled to leave, and which I left in 1901, when we found that any hope of instituting a true system of land tenure that would put and maintain in the forefront the interests of the genuine land-user as against the speculator, was absolutely visionary, and must be given up- I have very much pleasure, though I regret the circumstances, in acknowledging myself as a supporter of what has been done by the Government.

I do not think that it is necessary to traverse now the ground that was covered when the principal Act was under discussion in this Chamber. The present proposal increases the rate of the land tax, but the underlying principle is unchanged. As there is an exemption of £5,000 unimproved value, it is clear that a considerable estate may be held by any person free of taxation. On all taxable estates the tax is to increase uniformly until the taxable value is in excess of £75,000, when it culminates in a flat rate of 9d. in the £1.",44
340,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Instea d of 6d. ?,44
341,Mr FISHER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . It cannot be denied that the tax is a heavy one, but, as I do not wish members to misunderstand my position- I speak for myself in particular- I say that I believe unimproved land values taxation to be sound in principle from top to bottom.",44
342,Mr RODOEBS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If you commence at the beginning, without an unimproved value exemption of £5,000.",44
343,Mr FISHER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There are good reasons for an exemption of £5,000 unimproved value in the case of a Commonwealth tax. In the first place, a taxable margin is left, of which the States may take advantage if they think it necessary. The tax, apart from the revenue that it brings in, helps to break up large estates. There are countries-w e are at war with one of them-whic h take care that a large part of the unearned increment, as it is called, shall be returned to the State in the shape of revenue. Unearned increment arises from the united efforts of all the members of the community. It is not due to the exertions of the owner of the land to which it applies.",44
344,Mr SAMTSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,In the case of broad acres that is a fallacious argument.,44
345,Mr FISHER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The statement is true in respect of both broad acres and small areas. So far as town property is concerned, the tax is sound, because such property, even more than country land, increases in value with the increase o£ settlement and the development of industry. Unearned increment is incidental to the prosperity of a country, and the efforts of every citizen contribute to it. The wealth that is produced from land in city or country by the efforts of any individual remains the property of that individual. It is only the unearned increment, which is incidental to the efforts of the whole community, and not to his efforts alone, that is taxed under this measure. As I have said, the tax tends to the breaking up of large estates, which must be beneficial to the country. No State in the Union will benefit more by this than the State of Victoria.  the land tax proposals of the Government?",44
346,Mr FISHER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , the Attorney General advises me that he is of opinion that no further machinery is necessary.  some idea of the formula which will be applied to leaseholds.",45

348,Mr FISHER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is proposed only to tax the economic value as against the rent at any particular period.,45
349,Mr GROOM,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Has the right honourable gentleman any tables to show how that is to be done ?,45
350,Mr FISHER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have not the tables in my possession at the present time.  when the principal Act'was 'under consideration, that leaseholds should not be taxed. I wish to know how it is proposed by this 'Bill to alter that decision.",45
351,Mr FISHER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is held that the economic value of leases can be taxed under this measure in just the same way as the 'unimproved value of freeholds.  holds were omitted from the principal Act, and they are not included in .this Bill.",45
352,Mr FISHER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am afraid that honourable members are raising a point which, as a layman, I am not called upon to decide. It will be seen that the principle of the tax is not materially altered. It is intended to cover the economic value of leaseholds, apart from the rent, and an exemption from taxation of the economic value in the case of leaseholds up tb £5,000 is provided for in the same way that the unimproved value of freeholds up to £5,000 is exempt from taxation.",45
353,Mr GROOM,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the value of a leasehold is under £5,000, it will not be taxed?",45
354,Mr FISHER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; it cannot be taxed under this proposal. If the difference between the rental value and the economic value of a leasehold at the time the assessment is made is only £5,000, or under that amount, no tax upon it can be demanded under this Bill.  Minister propose to arrive at that?",45
355,Mr FISHER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It will be quite a. simple matter under the formula.,45
356,Mr GROOM,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Has the right honourable gentleman any figures to show what revenue is expected from this source?,45
357,Mr FISHER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have, of course, in such a matter to take the opinion of the Commissioner of Land Tax, and he estimates that the return will be something like £500,000.",45

363,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This Bill doea not mention leaseholds.,46

365,Mr ATKINSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wilmot ) [5.15] It seems to me that the present is a most inopportune time for the introduction of such a Bill as this. The taxation it proposes will press heavily upon a very few people, and at a time which may be regarded as probably the worse in the history of the agricultural and pastoral in dustries of the Commonwealth. Many holders of land at the present time are in i i precarious position, and especially those who have large holdings, which they cannot readily sell, and who are obliged to - spend a lot of money, in ' feeding their Starving stock. We have been led to believe that the measure was introduced - primarily to raise funds to carry on the war. Australia, in . common with other parts of the Empire, has made a splendid - effort. The people of every section of the community have tried to do their best to raise the funds necessary to carry on the struggle, and it seems to me to be a great mistake on the part of the Government to interfere with the fine spirit which has ""been displayed in this connection by the introduction of a measure with so sectional an aim. A measure for the imposition of an income tax which would hear - equitably upon all sections of the commun it y would have been a far more statesman-like proposal at the present time. ""While great hardship must, in the first place, be borne underthis measure hy .men on the land, its effect will be to place them in such a position that they will he unable to give other persons employment, and so the measure will probably bring about the unemployment of a great, number of persons throughout the Common-: wealth. Many of those who will be - called upon to pay this tax will be unable - to pay it . It will , in some cases, practically mean the confiscation of their properties. Many holders of land have been unable to pay the existing tax from moneys to their credit in ordinary years. In some instances people have had to borrow to pay the tax.",46
366,Mr FENTON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What about section 66 of the principal Act?,46
367,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The answer to that question is in the estimate which has been put before us.,46
368,Mr ATKINSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honorablo member for Maribyrnong refers me to a section of the principal Act under which the Land Tax Commissioner, and other persons forming a Board, may grant release from the tax in certain cases, but I am a f r a id that the section will not be found wide enough to cover many hard cases that w i ll arise under this. Bill . The Commissioner will have to administer the Act strictly, and if he does so many hard cases are sure to arise in connection with which he may ""be unable to see his way to grant a release under section 66 of the principal Act. If , as we are informed, it is expected that this measure will result in the raising of a revenue of £1,000,000 over and above the revenue raised by the existing land tax, there can be very few exemptions permitted. A bargain will have to be driven home hard in every instance if the Treasurer's estimate is to be realized.",46
369,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And that estimate is made when a drought is on.,46
370,Mr ATKINSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; it has been made at a time when we are in the midst of a serious drought. The original Land Tax Act was passed at a time when the Commonwealth was enjoying unprecedented prosperity and when landholders, therefore, if hard pressed, could sell their land without difficulty. Many people, no doubt, if they did not actually sell their estates, at least divided them amongst their families so as to reduce the incidence of the tax. In the more favoured parts of Australia, such, as the western district of Victoria; the Mount Gambier district in South Australia, the north-west coast of. Tasmania, and. certain parts of. Queensland, there are lands for which it is possible, no doubt, to find a good market even at the present time. Such lands can be sold in small areas, and there is generally a demand for it . But in other parts of the Commonwealth land is not nearly so saleable today as it is under ordinary conditions. Land which might realise £ 3 0 an acre in a normal season, if forced on the market at the present time, might not realise more than £ 2 0 per acre. That would be a very serious loss to small holders who were forced to sell. Many of these-rich areas are held in small sections, and their unimproved value, therefore, come within the scope of the Act. the position is different in respect of large estates such as those in the Western Riverina, which may he of the unimproved value of £100,000. On some of these estates there may be heavy mortgages in respect of which no relief can be secured from the payment of interest, notwithstanding that drought prevail. The owners, who are thoroughly familiar with all the work relating sheep-farming, have a gross income of , perhaps, £4,000 or £5,000 a year; but, after paying interest and providing for other outgoings, their net profit is not more than £1,000 or £1,500 a year. The taxation payable under the principal Act on such an estate would amount to something like £1,000 per annum, and so would mop up nearly the whole The Government now come along with a Bill to superimpose upon that tax a further levy of £500 or more on such estates, so that the owners will practically be made insolvent. The whole value of the equity of redemption in their must go beyond their control. this extra tax many of them will have to borrow. That should not be required of them; but men so situated will not, in my opinion, be covered by section 66 of the principal Act. The member for Maranoa is well aware that many large land-owners, even in normal circumstances, sometimes find it difficult to make a reasonably good living. These men are going to be hit very heavily. It is most unfortunate that this Bill should have been introduced just at a time when the people are beginning to realise more and more how each member of the community is dependent upon the other. will destroy to a great extent the good spirit which has been manifested the outbreak of the war and which certainly ought to prevail. also is going to be hit very heavily by this proposal. Very few people turn their attention to the land they know that if they do they will be called upon to bear these heavy It is hardly fair on the part of the Government to bring down these land tax proposals at a time when we are supposed to be engaged in dealing only with non-contentious legislation. It was generally understood that this would be a non-party session; but in this Bill we see an attempt on the part of the GoMr Atkinson. does not vernment to give legislative effect to one But of the planks of their platform. At a time when we ought to be discussing only non-contentious measures, the Government are taking an unfair advantage of the Opposition. We know, however, that it has been decided in another place that this legislation shall be carried, so that we can do no more than enter our conditions protest against it . It seems to me that this is not what might reasonably have to been expected of the Government and the Caucus at the present juncture. The verdict, however, is practically a foregone conclusion, and nothing I might say would be likely to affect in any way the votes about to be cast by honourable members opposite. At the same time. I regard it as the duty of the Opposition to enter an emphatic protest against this profit. legislation and to back up that protest by their votes as soon as the opportunity offers. The Opposition have told the Government more than once that they are prepared to assist them in carrying any fair and reasonable proposal to find land the revenue necessary to meet the war To pay expenditure.",46
371,Sir JOHN PORREST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But the Treasurer says that this is not a war tax ; that it has nothing to do with the war.,47
372,Mr ATKINSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then that makes honourable my objection all the stronger. To my mind, this is an attempt on the part of the Government to sneak in a part of their policy. It is most unfair. I hope even now that the Government will consent to amend this Bil l so as to bring it more into line with the principle embodied in section 66 of the original Act . If that be not done, then the Commissioner will find that he has not sufficient It power to enable him to deal with many cases of real hardship that are likely to since be brought before him. I fear that I make this appeal to deaf ears, for the Production Treasurer seems to be bent upon raising an additional £1,000,000 of revenue by will this means. As long as that is his in when tention very little relief can be given to the land-owners, and unless we make imposts. specific provision for the granting of relief in cases pf real hardship this legislation will do irretrievable in j u r y . A tax of 9d. in the £ 1 is outrageous. According to the ordinary canons, a tax should he imposed, in the first place, to raise revenue, and this tax might perhaps he justifiable on that ground during t i e present crisis, but it is not justifiable in ordinary circumstances. Assuming that the net return from a pastoral proposition is 5 per cent - I do not suppose that it averages more than 3 per cent, in Australia under present conditions- a tax of 9d. in the f l practically takes three-quarters of the owner's net profit. That is one tax alone, but the States have to come in with their land taxes. There are municipal rates to pay, and other outgoings to meet. This, therefore, is not taxation, but a confiscatory levy, and few pastoral propositions in Australia can stand it. The man who wants to sell his property will have to take £30,000 or £40,000 less for it than he thought the market price would be a little while ago. That is not the way to encourage men to take up land, nor is it fair to those who have undertaken pastoral propositions. The only justification there could be for it would be a policy by which the Government was to take over all the land. That is one way to nationalize land, but it is a very unjust way. It is simply filching the land from the man who owns it by reducing its value. If the Government want to take a man's land from him, they, above all others, should be prepared to do the fair and honest thing. Let them pay the owner a fair amount for the acquisition of the land. That is the way the States do it. If they want a man's land they have it fairly assessed, and he has the right to put the matter to arbitration. The State then pays him what the arbitrators consider to be the fair value. The Commonwealth Parliament, on the other hand, simply lowers the value of the land until the Government can take it over at a very low price. That is not fair, and is certainly not what the general body of the people want. They like a fair deal, but this is not a fair deal, and yet we are coming to it very fast. If this tax is not put on for war purposes, it must be put on as part and parcel of the programme of certain persons who meet periodically in Australia to draw up a platform which our honourable friends opposite have to accept and put through this Parliament as soon as they can. Ho outside pressure was brought to bear upon the Government or the Caucus, that I am aware of, to do this thing, nor am I aware that any pressure was brought to bear upon them even. by their own supporters in Parliament or by those who frame their platform for them from time to time. The Government have made a serious mistake, and we on this side of the House should indicate plainly that we do not countenance it. I am here to do my best to assist the Government in any attempt they make to do what is fair by the whole community. We are all in this, and the result of the struggle in which we are very engaged means as much to the poorest as to the richest man in the community. While every section of the community is doing its best to assist the Empire with men and money, the National Government, who should foster that fine spirit, do instead something which will strike a vital blow at it. That is a serious mistake to make at such a time as this.  asked the Prime Minister, when he moved the second reading of the Bill, if it included leaseholds. He said he was assured by the Attorney-General that it did, but on examining the Bill I find that all that it repeals is the schedule in the original Act, substituting for it a new schedule embodying higher rates. Section 29 of the original Act, which this Bill, on the face of it, does not repeal, clearly exempts certain Crown leases from taxation in this languageNotwithstanding anything in the last two preceding sectionswhich deal with private leaseholdsthe owner of a leasehold estate under the laws of a State relating to the alienation or occupation of Crown lands, or relating to mining, not being a perpetual lease without revaluation, or a lease with a right of purchase, shall not be liable to assessment or taxation in respect of the estate. That, I think, is as it should be.",47

I am speaking of Grown leases in particular. In South Australia there are gold leases, oil leases, salt leases, and others, all under the Crown. There are also pastoral leases for twenty-one years on which the improvements are forfeited, and, at the end of the term, become the property of the Crown, and fourteen-year leases, with the right of re-valuation.",49

381,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As the Land Tax Assessment Act stands at present, the proposed taxes do not fall on leaseholds held from the Crown, other than those covered by section 29 of the ActBut it is proposed to make such amendments of the Land Tax Assessment Act as will enable the taxation proposed by not this measure to fall on Crown leases other to be than those referred to. As to the kind of leases which it is proposed to cover by taxation, and the manner in which; I the value of those leases is to be ascertained, there is necessarily no'line of distinction to he drawn between one kind of Minislease and another, excepting that which the circumstances impose. It is obviously inexpedient and futile to atthen tempt to tax a lease the value of which would not pay. for the cost of-valuation. No other kindof distinction wilt be drawn. Whether' the lease be pastoral, occupation, or any other kind, it is proposed that the new scheme of shall cover them. The basis of the value upon which the assessment is to be affects made will be the economic value whatever that is, and that value is to be ascertained in precisely the same way as pay the economic value of a freehold.",49
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That , I suppose, is the economic value, less the amount paicf",49
383,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall state in detail I conceive to be the basis. It is to ascertain what the value is,, the first, by asking the lessee to declare it,, and, secondly, by checking that valuationof in the usual way by valuators employed by the Department. In our opinion, the be taxable value of a lease rests on thisfoundation-it is that difference, if any,, which exists between the capitalized rent 1 a now paid by the lessee to the State and comply the capitalized true economic rent, whatever that is. TEat is to say,, if, on a fair valuation, a lease is worth,, say, £1,000 a year, and assuming, as is done by the Department, that the capital"" down. value is based upon a twenty-two years and a half rental value, it follows that the lease is worth £22,500. If the lessee is paying £1,000 per annum there will be no taxable estate in that lease on which the tax can f all ; but if the lessee is not paying a full economic rent, there will be a taxable value not covered by the rent paid to the .Crown.",49
384,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What about the value of the improvements?,50
385,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The improvements are certainly not included in the value, but are deducted exactly as they are from the Malue of a freehold estate. tain circumstances improvements may still further decrease the value upon which assessment is made. that I hold an improvement lease from the Crown in South Australia, and it is held under the condition that I pay 4d. or 6d. per acre, or 6d. per mile, per annum; that I clear a certain amount of scrub within a specified time, and that I fence it and do certain other things. Those are the conditions under which I hold that lease from the Crown. are in lieu of, or partly in lieu of, rent. The same position arises under section 28 of the principal Act in regard to leases from private owners. That section providesWhere onerous conditions for constructing buildings, works, or other improvements upon the land, or spendiug money thereon,_ aro imposed upon the lessee, the Commissioner may assess the amount (if any) which ought, for the purposes of this section, to be added to the value of the rent in respect thereof, and the value of tile rent Bhall be deemed to be increased by that amount accordingly. In a case where the rental is, say, 6d. per acre, but, in addition, the lessee has to clear so much scrub, or do so much fencing, or put certain improvements upon the land, the fulfilment of those conditions is regarded as part of the rent, arid consequently will diminish the taxable value upon which the proposed tax will fall.",50
386,Mr GREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That remark applies to improvements to be made in the future, but what about improvements which have already been effected ?",50
387,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The improvements which have already been made will nob affect the value of the lease; the economic value of the lease will not be in creased by virtue of these improvements at all , because this is a tax upon the unimproved value of that, lease.",50
388,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But how does the honourable gentleman arrive at the economic value of a lease and still allow for i m provements ?,50
389,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member might just as well ask me how I arrive at the present value of a freehold estate upon which improvements have been made. I do so by a valuation of the thing as it stands, by deducting the value of the improvements, by a computation of the period which the lease has yet to run , by considering the amount of rent, capitalizing it , and estimating what is a fair In cereconomic rent, capitalizing that, and then taxing the difference, if any. The procedure is a little complicated when stated Suppose in that way, but in practice it will be found to work smoothly enough. I wish to point out that improvements put on a lease are not to be considered in any way as part of the value of the lease. They are to be deducted from its value so that the ' proposed tax will fall upon the value of the lease, less the value of the improvements whatever they may be. These But I was dealing with those improvements which have yet to be made because they are not in the nature of rent.  pastoral lessee who has twenty-one years to run, who is paying a rental of j£,l per mile, and who erects a vermin-proof fence upon his holding, on which he has to pay a rate of £ 1 a mile per annum. Would the improvement which is represented by that fence be considered as rental ?",50
390,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable mem- ber's question reminds me of the one put to an applicant for a master's certificate for the British Mercantile Marine. He was asked, "" There is a vessel sailing up the Thames, .she is of 10,000 tons burden, she is a turbine steamer drawing 21 feet aft, what is the name of her captain?"" I will state the position in general terms, but I do not hope to apply general principles'to every concrete case which may be brought up. Where a lease is held upon condition that, during the term of that lease, or any portion thereof, certain things must be done, and these conditions are in the nature of rent, then they will be so considered in estimating the value of that lease. And this is quite fair, for they may be as much rent as is the payment of 'the actual amount per acre or per mile, as the case may be.",50
391,Sir JOHN FOKEEST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The improvements are made for the lessee's own advantage.,51
392,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But at the expiration of the lease the Crown gets the whole of those improvements.,51
393,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not always.,51
394,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Sometime s it does. In an improvement lease, one of the conditions upon which the lessee holds it is that he will effect certain improvements.",51
395,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In Western Australia, he gets the freehold.",51
396,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is quite a different matter. Where a lease is held upon the condition that improvements vest in the lessee, they are not in the nature of rent, because the lessee will mately get the benefit of them. But I call all these leases, which, in my own State, are designated improvement leases.",51
397,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They are conditional purchases in Western Australia.,51
398,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know whether the right honourable member is aware that conditional purchases so-called, which are really conditional leases, are now taxable under the section of the Land Tax Assessment Act, which readsNotwithstanding anything in the last two preceding sections, the owner of a leasehold estate, under the laws of a State, relating to the alienation or occupation of Crown lands, or relating to mining (not being a perpetual lease without revaluation, or a lease with a right of purchase) shall not be liable to assessment or taxation in respect of the estate. Where there is a right of purchase, or - where the land ultimately falls in as a freehold, it is now taxable. Where a lease is held upon the performance of certain covenants, and subject to the performance of these, the ownership vesting in the lessee, it is to all intents and purposes a conditional purchase within the meaning of this section. But I was speaking of a different class of lease altogether. If a man holds a lease; if , under'the terms of that lease, he is required to make certain improvements, and if the lease contains a condition that upon its expiry the improvements shall vest in the lessee, then in such a case their capitalized value will not be deducted from the value of the lease. But where the carrying out of improvements is regarded as one of the conditions upon which a man holds a lease, and where, upon the expiration of his lease, they vest in the Crown, and they are in the nature of rent, their capitalized value will be deducted from the value of the lease. Where an improvement is effected by the lessee, either under the terms of his lease or otherwise, and those improvements, under the conditions of his lease, are vested in him, so that he may dispose of them when he disposes of his lease, the value of the improvements will not be deducted from the value of the lease, because, under the terms of the lease, he is already entitled to those improvements and to a * f a ir value for tliem when he transfers. The value of a lease may be determined by arriving at the difference between the rent paid by the lessee to the Crown and u l t ithe economic annual value, whatever it is, and that value is to be ascertained in the same way as the value of a freehold is ascertained. It is based on the called departmental tables, which provide for 4£ per cent, per annum, which is considered as a fair return for capital invested in such circumstances. In other words, 22^ years' annual rental equals the capital value. Now let me say a word as to the class of leases likely to be taxed. A great many leases will not, in the very nature of the case, be taxable, among them the overwhelming majority of mineral leases. The precise value of a mineral lease for the purposes of the proposed amending Bill will depend on circumstances. Usually a reasonable rent is paid. Sometimes it is quite as high as the economic rent. In some cases the Crown reserves surface rights, and in all mineral leases there is a reservation of all silver and gold found thereon. These reservations naturally decrease the value of a lease for the purposes of land taxation.",51
399,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What about goldmining leases?,51
400,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should certainly say that, in the majority of cases, goldmining leases would not be taxable.",51
401,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Eve n if they are paying big dividends?,51
402,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The question of whether they pay large dividends has nothing to do with the point. The question is, whether they pay an economic rent to the community.",51
403,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Thei r productive value would determine the economic rent. The ground has no value apart from the gold it produces.,51
404,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No doubt due regard must be paid to the value of the output, but this is not the only factor in determining value. The value of land of a similar kind must be considered. The amount of land available for mining for precious metals is necessarily limited, and it follows that if we give to A a certain right to mine upon a piece of land we limit the right of every other member of the community by so much, and we therefore say to A that he must pay to the community an equivalent amount for the exclusive right he does not share with the rest of the community.",52
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In other words, you tax the output of the mine.",52
406,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Broadly , no doubt, output should be one of the material factors, but not be the only factor in determining the value of a mining lease. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Would not a royalty on the output be the better method ?",52
407,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Possibly .,52
408,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The tax will really be a tax on dividends.,52
409,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The tax will fall on a lease whether it is being used to the best advantage or not. Let me put the matter in this way: If there are alongside one another two pieces of land, one of which produces 30 bushels of wheat to the acre, and the other with precisely the same kind of soil produces nothing of any value, a man may come along, and say that the second piece of land is worth £20 an acre, and the fact that the piece of land alongside and many other areas close by have been able to produce large quantities of wheat will fix that piece of land as wheat growing land, and affect its value, although it has not produced anything approaching 30 bushels to the acre. In regard to mining, however, the situation is a little different, but the same principle applies. We cannot regard production as the only factor in determining value. I shall not push the matter any further, because all that we wish to lay down is the general principle, and this, I suggest, is sound. In the absence of data, the amount of revenue likely to be derived from taxing leaseholds cannot be fairly estimated, but the principle of taxing leaseholds is absolutely sound. We tax a man on the value of the land that he holds, and for which he does not pay a fair equivalent. He is taxed on that value for which he does not pay, a value which belongs to the people, and which derives its value from the community, as does the value of freehold land.",52
410,Mr MANIFOLD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Corangamite) [6.8]. - We have heard two explanations of the Bill, one from the Prime Minister, and one from the Attorney-General. I noticed that the explanation given by the Attorney-General was more pointedly addressed to the honourable member for Grey, but that honourable member found that the explanation was so abundantly clear that he did not consider it necessary to remain in the Chamber. I am sure that when the Attorney-General bludgeoned this measure through Caucus he must have made himself considerably clearer, especially in regard to the taxation of leaseholds, than he has done to the House. This is a new class of taxation. I am sure honourable members, after listening to the explanations of Ministers, must be perfectly clear as to how the value of leaseholds is to bo arrived at, and as to the rates leaseholders will have to pay, and practically as to what the tax will amount to. For instance, the Prime Minister told us that the Bill now before us contains all that is necessary in order to carry out the taxation proposals, not only in regard to freehold land, but also in regard to leasehold, but we have now had an explanation from the Attorney-General, that, except in regard to the rate of the tax, this Bill does not affect leaseholds, and that a new Bill will have to be introduced to deal with them. This is a very important point, which will affect a considerable number of taxpayers throughout the Commonwealth. We have been told by the Attorney-General that there will be a number of leaseholders in the Commonwealth who will not pay any taxation at all. What I desire to know is, whether this is to be classed as one assessment or two assessments. Are there to be two taxes, one for leasehold and another for freehold, or are the two to be put together? If the two are put together, I will vouch for it that there will not be one leaseholder in the Commonwealth who will not be chased by the Commissioner. The authorities will find out that a man owns a certain block of land in Melbourne, and that he is carrying on an enterprise somewhere else, as many men 'do. A civil servant may have a small orchard at Dandenongj or have some speculation in Queensland, and to say that the leaseholder will not be taxed because his leasehold will not be worth taxing is all humbug. They will find out that a man owns certain property in another portion of the Commonwealth, and he will be hunted to death like every owner is hunted at the present time. Honourable members say that they know what every leaseholder will have to pay, I can honestly say that I do not know what any leaseholder has to pay by way of land tax. .We are told that the economic value of the property is to be taken, that the fair rental value will be estimated, and then if improvements are made under certain conditions, a deduction for them will be allowed. If the improvements are made under other conditions, the deduction will not be allowed. Take the case of pastoral properties in Queensland. Many of those properties were assessed only two or three years ago by the Government of Queensland, and I presume that that Government will not allow the holders to continue to rent the properties at an absurdly low rental. They have brought the rental up and up until they have reached what they consider a fair figure, taking into consideration the loss which the holders suffered in the past. Many of the people who put money into properties in Queensland would only get their capital back today if they sold out. Do honourable members think that the Government of Queensland have not assessed those properties at a fair value ? What is the position of countries on which the holders have had to go in for artesian bores? Take an estate, the saleable value of which I will assume to he £100,000. It has, say, 60,000 sheep on it today. As the sheep are worth £60,000, the value of the property will be £40,000. Then there would be fences and buildings, and perhaps four or five bores, which may have cost on the average £3,000 or £4,000 each. What is to be the taxable value of that property? people on that land have in the past suffered to a very considerable extent, and the price at which they could sell today would return to them practically only their capital. Now I turn to the Mr Manifold. increase as regards rates. The Prime Minister's manifesto, and his supporter when they were going about the country, said that any new taxation would be taken from those best able to bear it. Apparently these landholders are the people whom the Government consider best able to bear the taxation, the people who are endeavouring to keep their stock alive and to carry on their properties. Many people who went in for those large properties in the drought areas havebecome involved to a considerable extent. Probably, in many cases, these people are on the verge of ruin. Numbers of their stock have died, and they are not able to get any more money with which to attempt to keep, the remainder of the stock alive, but.the taxable value of. their properties may be £200,000 or £300,000.",52
411,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Has the capital value of their land decreased ?,53
412,Mr MANIFOLD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The capital value, on the basis of the selling value, of many of those places today is absolutely nil.",53
413,Mr WEBSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Can you tell me where those places are?,53
414,Mr MANIFOLD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know plenty of properties, the selling value of which would be nil if they were placed on the market. Those places are mortgaged to a considerable extent, and the owners are not in a position to pay taxation. Under section 66 they may go begging to the Commissioner for a remission of the tax, but that is all they can do. What is in the Attorney-General's mind is that the valuer for the Land Tax Commissioner will, on seeing the drought conditions existing on these properties, reduce the unimproved value to a very considerable extent. Mighty good care will be taken that the valuers do not go to tliose properties while the drought is continuing. Another factor that has an important influence upon the land tax is the very high unimproved value that is placed on property.",53
415,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable member suggest that the value put on two years ago is necessarily the value today? The Mr MANIFOLD - In many cases the value put on two years ago is the value today. There are, of course, cases in which the value has gone up, but in other portions of the Commonwealth there are very many instances of the value having decreased.",53
416,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,If the value has gone down the tax will go down with it .,54
417,Mr MANIFOLD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; after one has been able to get the land tax valuer to in spect the property the tax will go down. Let me refer to the plains land of this State, which I know as well, perhaps, as any .member of the House. The arable land there was saleable, and, perhaps, is saleable today, at £6 10s. or £7 per acre. Near by, just over a ridge| is stony country, which it is impossible to crop, and the valuer says that if the arable land is worth £ 6 10s., this other land adjacent to it must be worth £ 5 . Does any honourable member say that it is fair to put on land that will carry a sheep to the acre an unimproved value of £ 5 ? That is the way in which the valuations have been made. What is the land-holder to do if he objects to the land valuation? He has to go before the Court, and fight his case with all the witnesses he can get, and then comes the Land Tax Commissioner'with his valuers, and says, "" I . know a man who will buy the property at a certain price; therefore, that must be the value of the property."" The assessments have been very unfair indeed, and the mode of objecting to the assessment is also unfair, and involves the taxpayer in enormous expense. In a few cases 'the unimproved value has been successfully disputed before the Court, but what has that settled? Nothing at all, because the Commissioner shelters himself behind these words, "" Y o u r case is not similar."" Therefore if any other land-holder wants redress, he too has to go to Court. In this way the Land Tax Commissioner can defeat every application for a review of the assessment. As regards the rate, there have been many arguments to show that this tax really does not fall heavily on the small It will f all very heavily indeed upon those who have large holdings. I am one of the lucky individuals, as I do not own very much land in the Commonwealth. I was fortunate enough to own a property, which I endeavoured to develop and put to the best possible use, in the localities where land could be sold. But if there had been no settlement I would have been landed in exactly the same position as those who went out into western 'Queensland, 'New South Wales, and the northern portions of Australia. The land tax does not affect the holders of good land in the Commonwealth to anything like the same extent as it affects those men who are stranded with properties which are not fit for closer settlement. The people who are doing their very best to develop the Commonwealth will be h it particularly by the land tax. I hold, and have always held, that if there is land which is f it for closer settlement, and it is situated in a locality where closer settlement would be advantageous, and where men could establish comfortable homes, and make a fair living, it is the duty of everybody to put that land under closer settlement. It does not matter whether the land is put under leasehold or under freehold, though I consider it is very much better for men to work their farms on the freehold system. In order to get at the few people who persist in holding land in these particular localities - the Attorney-General mentioned the State of Victoria-the Government propose to saddle the whole of the people of the Commonwealth with a very excessive tax indeed. A tax of 9d. in the -£1 on the unimproved value means practically ruination to a. good many persons. It is, of course, idle to argue the point. I recognise that one is only wasting breath in speaking. This matter has been settled. It was settled some years ago, and it has been settled again in this Parliament. We iknow perfectly well what we have to expect. Men know today that if they continue to hold land in large areas it is .the intention of the party on the otlier side, if a tax of 9d. in the £ 1 will not break up the estates, to increase the tax to Is. That is practically what it all comes to. I issue a note of warning 'to those who continue to hold large estates, that honourable gentlemen on the other side have not any individual. excuse. They have not said that it is a war tax. It will be imposed permanently. The only alteration which it is possible honourable members on the other >side contemplate is to make the tax heavier than it has been if they get the opportunity.",54
418,Mr LIVINGSTON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Barker) [6.25] I am ODe of those who, like the last speaker, know a little about the landholders in Australia. When I looked at this innocent little Bill , which was put before the House this afternoon without information of any sort, I was surprised. The honourable member for Grey tried to get some information first from the Prime Minister and then from the Attorney-General. He has had a great deal to do with land in South Australia, and therefore he knows exactly the position of original land-holders. Deputy Speaker also knows a great deal about the lands of Australia, and he is aware that today the land-holders are hard pressed in all parts of the Commonwealth. If anything is likely to take the heart out of these people it will be au extra tax on land. Once we take the individuality out of men or stop them from making improvements the value of the land disappears. We know that since the imposition of the Federal land tax the value of land has decreased in a great many places in the Commonwealth. I am aware that the value of land has gone down owing to the drought and the war. I do not like to say too much on this subject, but I think that in Australia, especially in this Parliament, men do injury to the country by pointing out the great disadvantages to which the land-holders are subject, and in that way help to destroy the value of the land. The Attorney-General has stated that it is intended to tax all Crown leases. Hitherto such leases have heen frei; of land taxation. This proposal will hit every Crown lessee in Australia. does not matter whether a man is a large or small holder. If we hit a large holder he will not make improvements ou the soil, and therefore there will be no employment for people. If holders do not improve the lands there will be no value in them. It is idle for any man to say that you can take the unimproved value of the lands. What have the great lessees done in Queensland and New South Wales? By putting down artesian bores, erecting wire-netting fences, and making improvements they have really made the value of the land. This taxation will take the heart out of the landholders. We shall not get capitalists to go out into the back country to improve the land if they find that directly it is improved the Federal Treasurer will come along with a proposal for a heavy tax. A holding is subject, first, to a local tax, next to a district tax, and then to a Federal tax. The present Government seek to tax people both wben they are on the land, and when Mr Livingston. they are in the land. If this proposal is enacted there will be absolutely no incentive to a man to take up a piece of land and improve it as the pioneers did in the old days. This iniquitous legislation will not give any Tho man the benefit of the exercise of his brain and energy, and the value of his property. The honourable member for Grey, no doubt, will point out directly that the Government are taking power to tax all kinds of leases. In South Australia we have perpetual leases, gold leases, salt leases, and oil leases. I hope that before very long we shall hear of the holders of some oil leases paying a very large dividend. In South Australia, shortly, we shall see the first bore started in Australia for oil.",54
419,Unknown,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. Mr LIVINGSTON"" - The Attorney General said this afternoon that the lessees will be asked to declare the valuo of their leaseholds, but that in a great many cases will be an extremely difficult thing to do. Many leaseholds today have very little value.",55
420,Mr FLEMING,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Thei r value could be set down at nil. "" Mr LIVINGSTON - Yes. The value of land varies at different periods. It The Government have made a mistake in stirring up a discussion on land values at this time. Whenever anything bad is said of Australia, it is cabled across the world, and our credit is damaged, but when anything good is said it gets no publication. I noticed that when travelling in the Old Country three years ago. The existence of a drought or the occurrence of a flood would be cabled Home, but nothing was said about the mighty good season that some places were getting. In my district it would be impossible for a stranger to properly estimate the value of the land. Many properties there have been so improved that persons who knew them five years ago would not know them now had they been away in the interval. We have had a lot of battles on the subject of land value taxation, and now the whole question is to be opened up again. We were led to believe that the Government intended to impose taxation to meet the cost of the war, but no one can say that the land tax is incidental to the war. Our unfortunate land-holders have been at war with the elements quite long enough, and now they must be at war with the Commonwealth land tax valuers. I know of land ih New South Wales not far from my own district which a few years ago was merely a rabbit warren, but an enterprising man took it up, fenced it with wire-netting, made dams and put down bores, and today the property is a valuable one. Do you think that that sort of thing will be done if the more land is imnroved the. more it is taxed. It is to be remembered that when enterprise is checked it is the working man who suffers most.",55
421,Mr CABB,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is not pronosed to tax improvements. Mr LIVINGSTON"" - Without improvements the land of which I speak, aud much other land, would have no value. The working man is made to nay even when taxation is imposed on city property. The merchants whose land is taxed passes on the tax to the smaller trader, and he again passes it on to his customers by adding a little to the prices of the articles which he sells to them. At the present time land in many parts of Australia is worth nothing. Some of our best country has suffered more of late than it ever suffered before during the last sixty years. On the other hand, happily for the Commonwealth, there are parts of Queensland and New South Wales where the season was never better than it is this year. What Governments should do in Australia is to develop the country by extending railways through it, so that stock may be shifted more easily in time of drought. Droughts can be largely provided against by the building of railways to allow stock to be easily moved, and by the sinking of bores and the conservation of water. The honourable member for Balaclava said the other day that it is in times of prosperity that one should spend. I say that it is in times of prosperity that one should save. In South Australia the Government always puts a little aside in good times, and I am proud to say that this year it is in a position to postpone the payment of its rents for twelve months, thus giving consideration to the Crown lessees in respect of the losses which they have suffered by reason of the drought. I should not object to the taxation if it were war taxation, because every man in the community, rich or poor, should be only too pleased to do what he can to help the Empire in its hour of need. A great deal more will be lost by the imposition of this land tax than will be gained in revenue. It will create a disturbance which is to be deprecated. An army of inspectors will be needed to travel over the country valuing leaseholds. At the present time most of the lessees have no money with which to pay a land tax. The next taxation that will be proposed will be income taxation, and then the Commonwealth Government will have imposed all the taxation that it is within its power to impose. It would not be so bad if the holders of land had money with which to pay the tax. All estates under the value of £5,000 are exempt from taxation, but returns have to be made in respect of estates worth £3,000 or more. It must be remembered that the holder of land cannot rely unon getting a certain return from it every year. To-day a good part of our wool is stored in sheds, unsold. How could the owners of that wool pay the tax. The produce of land has to be sold in the open markets of the world. The Govei'nment, therefore, should be careful not to harass the land-holder, particularly the lease-holder. The Postmaster-General knows what struggles land-holders have made during the last twenty years to settle themselves on the land. Many of them today, although they have worked hard, are walking about without a shilling in their pocket. They deserve the greatest consideration from the Parliament of this country, and I hope they will get it. The Government, in this measure, propose the imposition of an extra .absentee tax. There is a very great deal in this little Bill, though it has not required very much printing to give it expression. In the first schedule to the Bill provision is made for the rate of the land tax when the owner is not an absentee in these terms:For so much of the taxable value as does not exceed £75,000, the rate of tax per pound sterling shall be One penny and one-fifteen thousandth of one penny where the taxable value is One pound sterling, and shall increase uniformly with each increase of One pound sterling in the taxable value by One-fifteen thousandth of one penny. For every pound sterling of taxable value in excess of £75,000 the rate of tax shall b« Ninepence. The rate of tax for so much of the taxable value as does not exceed £7 5,000 may be calculated from the following formula:R = rate of tax in pence per pound sterling. V == taxable value in pounds sterling. R = J 1H \_ 15,000",56
422,Mr CAKE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What does that mean?,57
423,Mr LIVINGSTON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It means a tax of 9d. in the £ 1 , and men on the land could not pay such a tax and make a living . Provision is made in the second schedule in these terms for the rate of tax ""when an owner is an absentee:For so much of the taxable value as does not exceed £5,000, the rate of tax per pound sterling shall be One penny. For so much of the taxable value as exceeds £5,000, but does not exceed £80,000, the rate of tax per pound sterling shall be Twopence and one-fifteen thousandth of one penny where the excess is One pound sterling, and shall increase uniformly with each increase of One pound sterling of the taxable value by One-fifteen thousandth of one penny. .For every pound sterling of taxable value in. excess of £80,000 the rate of tax shall be Tenpence. The rate of tax for so much of the taxable value as exceeds £5,000, and does not exceed £80,000, may be calculated - by the following formula:R = rate of tax in pence per pound sterling. E - excess of taxable value over £5,000 in pounds sterling. r E R = J 2 -| [ 15,000 That is simply ridiculous. A man is called an absentee because he removes from one part of the Britis h Dominions to another. W hy not permit men to go to Great B r it a in or to any of the Britis h Possessions and live there for a little time without penalizing them ? desire to stay away from this country for only two or three years. People in the Old Land will refuse to send money to Australia for investment when they know they will be required to pay an absentee tax. No such tax is levied in Canada or in Argentina. The Governments of those countries are glad to welcome capital for investment. Fortunately, in Australia today we are able to borrow money, and I am very pleased that the Prime Minister has been able to borrow £18,000,000 for division amongst the Australian States. The right honourable gentleman secures all the credit for obtaining this money, but the credit is really due to the Australian people who, by their t h r if t and industry, and the way in which they have worked their land,, have been able to send so much produce to the Old Country.",57
424,Mr BOYD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There are many men drawing big revenues from this country who > pence."" have never seen Australia. J Mr LIVINGSTON - That is so, and they are today being taxed as absentees. They have put a lot of money into in vestments in Australia.",57
425,Mr BOYD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but they take it outi again.",57
426,Mr LIVINGSTON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I would ask the honourable member for Henty where he thinks the £18,000,000 of loan money is coming from? We shall get it from men on the other side of the world. Men are prepared to lend money to the Government because it will not be taxed, but 'they will not lend it to private in dividuals when they .know it .will be subject to taxation. It is not very easy toinduce people .to invest capital in Australia today. Where hundreds of pounds are being invested here, thousands of pounds are being invested in other countries. So long as we continue to pass this kind of legislation in Australia, we shall find ourselves lagging behind the other countries of the world. What we require is population, capital, and confidence in the country. When capital is flowing into the country and is being 1 expended upon reproductive works, we > pence."" have a contented and industrious people. J Tbis kind of legislation will , in my opinion, bring about more discontent than some honourable members anticipate at the present time. The Government hope that it will help them, but they will find that, on the contrary, it will injur e them. I understood that we were to have They may nothing submitted this session that we - could fight about. I expected that it would be unnecessary for me to say anything, and that we would go through the work of the session on friendly terms. I think the Government would, be well advised not to proceed f u r ther with this legislation u n t i l Parliament meets after the special adjournment. Probably things will be better then, there may be hope of a better season in the dry country, and the war will probably be at an end. I pray that it will be at an end. This special war tax will not then be required. I am proud that today Australia probably stands higher in the estimation of the people of the world than she ever did before. This country is looked upon as the freest and best country on the face of the earth. What we want to do is to keep Australia the freest and best country on the face of the earth. That can only be done by careful management of its affairs, and it cannot be done by the imposition of iniquitous taxation. We want to in troduce population and capital into Australia to develop it . Australia has an extraordinary opportunity today, which we should hasten to take advantage of. We have great quantities of raw material stacked in our woolsheds, and we should open our arms to the people of Belgium and other lands to come here and start factories, in order that we may use our raw materials in this country instead of sending them away to other countries to be manufactured. We have, a chance now to make great progress, and I hope that the Prime Minister, the Government, and every member of this House will ' do their level best to embrace the present opportunity the like of which may never be ours again. Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON (Lang) [ 8 . 1 8 ] - I recognise that a protest from this side against any kind of legislation introduced at the present time must be largely futile. Opposed as we may be to the measures submitted by those who are in occupation of the Treasury bench, we know that they have the numbers in both Houses, that they can carry any legislation they please, and we can do nothing to stop them. They have a body that meets upstairs, and decides in main what legislation shall be passed through both Houses of this Parliament. The most that we in Opposition can pect to do is to briefly state our views and record our protests. not attempt anything in the direction of obstructing business, as we reI cognise that the Government have the big order 162? battalions behind them, and are entitled to say that they have the mandate of country also. The people will suffer, but they voted for the Party which we told ment : them would, if returned, make them suffer. I am in full agreement with the principle of land value taxation. hold that land is theproper and natural source from which the governmental penses of the country should be-derived, At the same time, I hold that that tion should not be superimposed upon other systems of taxation, but that it should be substituted for. indirect taxation. Unfortunately, the Government, and' the party they represent, pile on taxation, not only on land values, but on every other conceivable thing that they can tax. There will shortly be nothing further left for them to tax. I do not wish to interrupt the general debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bill , but if no one else desires to speak I propose to move That the following words be added :"" Provided that concurrently wilh the imposition of the additional tax on land values under this Act there shall be a corresponding reduction of taxation to a. like amount - on the tools and implements, of husbandry, and all necessaries of life, and particularly - on the food and clothing of the people."" I regard land values taxation as a just and proper means of raising revenue to provide for. the expense of governing the community,; but I hold that it should take the place of other taxes, and should not be supplementary to them. It is for that reason that I have always advocated the principle that indirect taxation, especially taxation through the Customs, on the food, clothing, and other necessaries of the people, should be abolished and revenue from taxation on land values substituted for such imposts. I hope that my amendment will be accepted.",57
427,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member propose to add these words to the motion ?,58

433,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Richmond) [8.27] - I do not propose to speak at any length, there are one or two phases of this Bill to dition. which I should like to direct attention. I have very little doubt that honourable very heavy. members of the Labour party, in bringing forward this legislation at the present said. time, simply desire to carry out their professed policy of endeavouring little little to take away the value in land altomade out. gether fro m those who hold it today. to the justice or injustice of such a position, I do not intend to say more than a few words. The Prime Minister, in i troducing this Bill , declared that a tax on the unimproved value of land was fair, and that, inasmuch as that value was Land Tax Commissioner. created by the community it should be returned to the community. Whilst admits that, to a certain extent, which we term the unimproved value of land has been created by the community, it cannot be denied that, with"" a few exyour ceptions, all those who hold that unimvalue today have paid for it i u l t h cash. It must be obvious that if this policy is to be carried out to the bitter matter end it will not be very long before the whole value will have gone. There is already heavy State taxation in one form or another on the unimproved value of land.",59
434,Mr FENTON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Ne w South Wales has only the municipal tax on unimproved,59
435,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable meminto ber were as well acquainted as I am with the history of land taxation in New South esWales, he would know that what is called to be the shire tax took the place of the old to this land tax that was imposed by the New in ComSouth Wales Parliament.",59
436,Mr FENTON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But we have a municipal in tax and a State tax in Victoria. Landowners here have three taxes to pay.,59
437,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As a matter of fact the shire tax in many parts of New South is Wales is so heavy that it exceeds conalso in siderably the amount of the municipal in Victoria, plus the State land tax. I can assure the honourable member that such in the case of land with which I am connected the result of shire taxation as taking the place of the old land tax has an increase of 700 per cent, in the of the tax. That will give honin orable members some idea of the rate which land taxation has reached in some The honourable member for Indi , speaking on another motion with regard to this measure, endeavoured to show that the in but creased tax was a very insignificant adI will admit that in the lower grades of the tax the increase is not ",59
438,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But it is considerby ably heavier than the honourable member I have not the figures with As me, bufc those which I had from the proLand Tax Commissioner showed that the increase was about four times as much as n - the honourable member stated last night.  quoted last night were verified by the",59

If he had gone on he would have totally disproved the point he was trying to make.  £30,000. - Mr MASSYGREENE - But the honourable member was very careful to leave off there. I shall show that the higher gradations have everything to do with the lower. This proposal imposes a very heavy burden upon the land-holders, beever cause, when we get into estates of £80,000 and £90,000 value, we find that the additional impost means taxing away the whole capital value of one-fifth of the property, that is on a 5 per cent, basis, without considering the old tax at all.",60
441,Mr FENTON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If it means the burstyear, ing up of large estates, will not that be benefit ?",60
442,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It must be evident to honourable members that, with the heavy taxation now existing, the tional fcax, taking away a considerable portion of the value of the land, musfc necessarily reduce the value.",60
443,Mr BRENNAN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not admit that that is the general tendency offchistax.,60
444,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member say that the imposition of the tax does not decrease the value of land?,60
445,Mr BRENNAN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Possibl y of that parthe ticular land, but not the value of land generally.",60
446,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable member mean to say that we can reduce the value of an estate of 100,000 acres on one side of a wire fence without affecting the value of smaller properties on the other side of the fence?",60
447,Mr BRENNAN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; but in the subtoralist division of that 100,000 acres, and other big estates, the settlement involved creates a more prosperous community, and sets off the reduction in the of the land.",60
448,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member means that ultimately the value the land will rise?,60
449,Mr BRENNAN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , ultimately it",60
450,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not want to enter into an argument on that point. When honourable members opposite were campaigning in the country advocating the land tax one of their chief arguments for its imposition was that it would bring down the price of land. Now they tell us it is going to raise land in value. If they put this additional burden upon the to land-owners it will hit the very men whom I believe honourable members opposite desire to help. I know of my own knowledge that the spreading of the news of the imposition of the fresh land tax has thrown on the labour market a considerably greater number of unemployed. If there was a time in our history when we should try to encourage those who have the means to employ labour, it is now. Yet honourable members opposite have chosen this time of stress and trial to strike a staggering blow at men who are, in many cases, struggling to carry on, not with what they are earning this but falling back upon their capital a resources, and to rub their very noses in the dust. The result is that a man who was prepared to spend a little money in fencing or boring, will decide not to addispend money on improvements.",60
451,Mr BRENNAN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Non e of those improvements will be touched by the tax.,60
452,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course not, but the man will not make them, and he will not employ labour. A land-owner who now employs ten hands will decide that he the cannot afford to employ, perhaps, more than six, and will promptly dispense with services of the other four. The Treasurer anticipates raising by this means an additional £1,000,000 from the 15,000 men who pay the tax today, and this additional impost will lead to the dismissal of, perhaps, 30,000 men. It is simply an arithmetical proposition. In circumstances of the kind the first thing a man does is to retrench. More than one pashas told me, since it was proposed to increase the land tax, that it meant serious retrenchment for them. That is the only possible way in which they can value carry on under existing conditions.",60
453,Mr WEBSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Migh t it not mean an of additional effort to got a greater amount of produce from the land 1,60
454,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wit h pastoral properties, such as most of these are, land taxation does not, as a general rule j lead f> more production, but to less. While it may ultimately lead in some instances to the subdivision of property^ it will be recognised that in a country like Australia there is only a limited amount of land which, under existing conditions, it is possible to deal with in that way. I ask any man with practical knowledge what is the good of cutting up land for wheat-growing 40 to 60 miles away from a railway? Everybody knows that it is utterly impossible to profitably grow wheat under such conditions. No doubt a vast number of estates in close proximity to railway lines have already been cut up, and are producing as much as they probably would otherwise.",61
455,Mr WEBSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I know that many properties have been made more productive since the imposition of the graduated land tax.,61
456,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That may be-so where the land is in close proximity to a railway, and where, in some instances, men have gone in for wheat-growing; but as there is very little likelihood of the price of meat falling in the .future, I venture to say that we shall find a good deal of former wheat country being devoted to the raising of meat.",61
457,Mr WEBSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But if men reverted to raising meat instead of wheat, would that not mean only for a season or two?",61
458,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think it an would, on the average. I should now like to say a few words in regard to the leasesale, hold question. I endeavoured to follow ent prices. the Attorney-General very closely when he was speaking on the second reading, but I am yet in a difficulty as to the thod by which lie proposes to determine himself. what he calls the "" economic value "" of a lease. So far as I can see, the result of the method he suggests will be that there will be no tax collectable on any lease Australia. If we deduct the value of the improvements, and then capitalize whatcompensation ever may be the Crown rent, the taxable economic rental value of a lease will be practically nothing. What, in most cases, gives a lease its rental value, over and above the Crown rent, is the improvepayable ments on it-that is what gives it an economic rental value over and above rental value paid to the Crown ",61
459,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Where the improvements are vested in the lessee, so that if he sells the lease he has the right to the value of the improvements, that value will not be deducted from the value of the lease.",61
460,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That seems to me to set up quite an invidious position as between the leaseholder and the freeholder. Surely if the rental value arises from the value of the improvements which are put on the land, whether those improvements belong to the lessee or revert to the Crown, they still form a portion of the value that the improvements give to the land. Just as the improvements on a freehold property add to the value of land, so improvements on a leasehold add to the rental value of that land. Whether the improvements ultimately revert to the Crown or not, I fail to understand how they can be considered in the unimproved value which should be taxable under an unimproved, land tax. Surely they are part of the improvements, and not part of the unimproved land value.",61
461,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Of course they are not; I admit that freely.,61
462,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Tak e two leases side by side, on one of which the improvements revert to the Crown, while on the other they are vested in the lessee. In the latter casethe improvements 'are the lessee's property, and', when the lease expires, the Crown has to compensate him for them. Supposing both the leases had equal period to run, and the lessees were at the same time to put them up for they would, I submit, obtain differThe man whose improvement reverted to the Crown would not get as much for his lease as would the meman who had the improvements vested in",61
463,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is so.,61
464,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In both cases the capital of the leaseholders have been inin vested in the improvements, and in both cases it seems to me they are entitled to or allowance in regard to the improvements when it is sought to arrive at the unimproved value of the land. I utterly fail to see how improvements, for which there would be a rental in the event of a lessee sub-letting, can for a single moment be thought the of as belonging properly to the unimproved value of the land.",61
465,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They cannot be the unimproved value.,62
466,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is not the principle the taxation of unimproved values?,62
467,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes .,62
468,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The only time, it seems to me, that it is possible for Government to impose the tax is in the event of the rent paid by the lessee to the is not taxable. Crown amounting to less than the land would be let for on its true unimproved wanted to get at. value. For the sake of argument, let us take a property which is let to a lessee say, Is. an acre, while what the Attorneyand General calls the ""economic v a l u e "" is an acre. It seems to me that the difference is what is rightly taxable. But if a spends on the property £10,000 in i m provements, and brings land, which perly sliould be let at Is., up ""to a rental value of 2s., I cannot see why, whether the improvements ultimately revert to against the proposal. the Crown or not, we should call that difference the unimproved value, and tax liim upon it .",62
469,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No r would we.,62
470,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I certainly undermight stood the Attorney-General to say, when he was speaking upon the motion for the second .reading of the Bill when he interjected just now, that if ing. a lessee put additional improvements liis land, and in regard to which the Crown has, at the expiration of the lease, to compensate the lessee, whatever additional rent they represented would form a portion of the value which he low. proposes to tax under this Bill .",62
471,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What I said did not of that description. apply to such cases at all. Let me trate what I said. Suppose that fair annual rental of a lease is Is. acre, we say to the lessee, "" We intend to charge you 6d. per acre, and you must clear scrub each year equivalent to another 6d. per acre."" The two charges would make up the rent which an was payable to the Crown by the lessee.",62
472,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is right.,62
473,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Therefore , the value the work which a lessee does must be counted as part of the rental which he pays, and must therefore be deducted from the taxable value of his holding.",62
474,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That point is not i dispute. Where improvements have to disappointing. be made as part of the rent payable by cupy any further time. a lessee, there must necessarily be a deingly duction. But I contend that it not matter under what conditions i mprovements are effected which raise the rental value of a .lease, the value of those improvements must - necessarily form part of the exemption.",62
475,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I agree with that. the Whatever can be fairl y said to be distinguishable from the unimproved value,62
476,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is what I If that plan be fol lowed, I venture to say that by the time at, the leaseholds of Australia are valuedthe operation will occupy a long 2s. time, and prove very costly-it will be found that the difference between the man rental paid to - the Crown and the true - rental value will be such that we shall probe on the debit side of the ledger.",62
477,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I hope not. That is the sole argument which can be used,62
478,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In a great many cases I venture to say that if the stock were taken off leases, and those leases were put up for sale-eve n though they be fairly well improved- a bi d both would not be forthcoming. Certainly that remark applies to a period of and drought such as we are now experiencTlie only time that a bid which on would amount to anything for taxation purposes, would be obtainable for an unoccupied lease, would be when that lease had a very long term to run , and when the market for stock happened to be very In such circumstances a man might pay a fair premium for a lease But under any illusother conditions I doubt whether we the should get a bid at all. I would sugper gest to the Attorney-General that before proceeding any farther in the direction of taxing leaseholds he should go very thoroughly into the whole subject.",62
479,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Before we meet again attempt will be made to ascertain the values of leaseholds, and we shall then be able to discuss the matter upon theof basis on which it really stands.",62

481,Mr BRENNAN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member has just proved that it is not a burden at all.,63
482,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have been talking of leaseholds in regard to which the Assessment Bill has not yet been introduced. The Bill with which we are now dealing relates only to freeholds, or to such leases as come under section 29 of the principal Act.",63
483,Mr BRENNAN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I beg the honourable member's pardon.,63
484,Mr MASSYGREENE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I regret that at a time when one would expect the Government to keep as far as possible from party politics, they have chosen to impose what I regard as a vindictive tax upon the landholders of the country. So far as urban lands are concerned, the city propertyholders will simply pass on the tax. Who pays the land tax on the magnificent block of buildings occupied by Anthony Hordern in Sydney? Certainly the firm does not pay it. It puts an additional halfpenny upon this article and an extra penny upon that, so that the consumer pays it all the time. It is not the city land-holders who will pay this tax. But the impost will hit the workers of Australia so far as it applies to our When it comes to broad acres outside our metropolitan areas, I admit that the landholder will have to pay it. But here again I venture to say that it will fall very heavily on the workers, and will add materially to our growing army of unemployed.",63
485,Mr GLYNN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Angas) [8.58] - Upon this question of valuation, and also upon the merit of taxing leaseholders, I desire to say a few words. The Attorney General has said that the method of estimating theunimproved value of leases which will be adopted-and , personally, I think it is the correct method-wil l be to take as the capital unimproved value of any lease the difference between the actual rental, minus improvements, that is being paid, and the true rental, or, as i loquially called, the economical rental of the land. That is doubtless the true method of taxing lessees, assuming that the policy of taxing them is a sound one. But in taxing any estate one has to consider a great many facts, especially when there are two jurisdictions to be put into actual operation. Let us take the position in Queensland. There the pastoral lessees under the Crown, near the Northern Territory, pay about 5s. l$d. per square mile as rent, but they pay a total rental of 12s. 9d. per square mile for a good area of that country, in the shape of, without rent, betterment taxes and rates which they are charged for the public service given by the construction of railways, and in outlining a policy for the Northern Territory I pointed that out. Assuming that the basis of the tax on leaseholds is to be the difference between the actual rental, which is about 5s. l j d . , and the economic rental, which might be 12s. or 14s., is it fair to levy a tax on that difference, considering that already Queensland is getting it in the shape of rates and betterment taxes ?",63
486,Mr HUGHES,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the Crown in Queensland tax leaseholds?,63
487,Mr GLYNN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It does in one way. I pointed out, on page 8 of the outline of policy for the Northern Territory, the great difference in the rent paid in the Northern Territory and Queensland for practically the same class of country. I showed that, even taking the same estate cities. extending from Queensland into the Northern Territory, the annual rental paid in the Northern Territory was Is. 6d. per square mile, while Queensland charged 5s. l^d. per square mile; but I also pointed out that in Queensland the total obligations were 12s. 9d. per square mile, because the leaseholders have to pay local rates and betterment taxes which are based on the assumption that developmental railways give a corresponding advance to the value of the area under lease. In these circumstances, if the State estimates are correctly made, the Crown in Queensland is already taking or taxing the difference between the actual rental paid and the economical rental, and the Queensland lessees are the class of leaseholders who will be largely taxed by the Commonwealth taxation of leaset is colholds. We must not view this new form of taxation in a prejudiced, or abstract, way; we must look at the actual facts and see to what extent we should tax leaseholds under the varying conditions with which we have to deal. The States should certainly ""tax the unimproved sale value of leaseholds, but there is another difficulty in the fact that in a great many cases the annual rental is fixed at a low figure in order to induce settlement. I am speaking now of a matter quite apart from the consideration that must be given to the existence of onerous covenants in a lease as provided for in section 28 of our Assessment Act. Land may be leased at an annual rental of 6d. per acre, though its true rental should be Is. an acre, but there may be onerous covenants such as building covenants, and, in assessing what the actual rent is, we must take into account, not only the cash payment of 6d., but the value of the onerous covenants. the other hand, the Act does not allow for betterment taxes or local rates, which in no sense can be regarded as onerous covenants attaching to a lease. Before leaving the question of the Northern Territory, there is another matter upon which I would like to say something. The Government had, very properly, in view a large policy of systematic development, not only by connecting Queensland and the Northern Territory, but also by extending, without delay, the railway northwards from Oodnadatta through the Macdonnell ranges. As a matter of fact, a survey of the best route from Oodnadatta through Alice Springs is, I think, now being made on instructions issued by the last Government. This railway is to be built right through the centre of the continent, and, when Queensland is ready, connexions will be made from about Newcastle Waters on the central line with the southern part of that State, and thereby with New South Wales. However, as we cannot build these lines unless we get from the lessees in the Territory and others benefited something like a reasonable return for the public advantages given by their construction, in the outline of policy I provided that if we were driven to it there would be a possibility of taxing what might be regarded as the difference between what is the true and what ought to be a reasonable rental. We get Is. and Is. 6d. a square mile for land which in Western Australia, no better in quality and in the same geographical area, fetches 6s. 3d. per square mile. I maintain that the States, or in the case of the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth, must consider certain factors which are disregarded in the taxation of lessees by our existing law. The last Labour Government passed aD Ordinance under which the first 5,000 allotments of agricultural land were to be free of all rent for twenty-one years, or during the lives of the lessees, b ut on the principle laid down in the Bill to be brought in , as no deduction could be made for onerous covenants, the full economic rent of these leases would be assessed in defiance of the Ordinance giving the land free of rent. But why was the land to be given free of rent? In order to induce settlement, and not because of certain covenants having to be fulfilled on the On leases. I had to deal with this matter in a d r a f t Crown Lands Bill , which, had we been in power, I would have introduced into the House, and I took some of these conditions into account in respect to a possible policy of taxing the leases in the Northern Territory. The reason for fixing low rentals in the case of pioneers who go out to our dry pastoral areas, and for allowing them to take up their holdings free from the burden of covenants, is that they take tremendous risks in the task of developing the outskirts of our practically unsettled areas.",63
488,Mr THOMAS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The £5,000 exemption would exclude all those leaseholders you mention.",64
489,Mr GLYNN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It may, or may not. I am not laying much stress on the burdeu that will be imposed on the lessees of the first 5,000 allotments under the Ordinance of 1912 in the Northern Territory, though, perhaps, in a few years' time the economic rental may be much higher, and the covenants may be harder. I think M ill says that a principle is best tested by an extreme case of its application. The rent of pastoral leases is fixed at a comparatively low figure in Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia, in order to induce men to go out and develop difficult areas. Experience has not enabled us as yet to arrive at any fixity of periodicity for droughts, and the possibilities are that in the first year of his enterprise, a man may be h it by a drought, and thus the rent is fixed at a very low figure for considerations that our assessment law, as it now stands, cannot take into account. I think that the lessee is regarded in most cases as the owner of tlte fee simple, but lie bas the right of recourse against those who were liable j prior to him, either as leaseholders' or as the owners of the reversion, so that,' though he may have to pay down the whole of the tax at once, he has recourse against these others to the extent of their proportionate liability. That might work hardship in some caseswhere the others were not'liable. For instance, in section 27'of the Land Tax Assessment Act. reference is made to section 13, under which certain lands, such as those held by charities, are exempt from taxation. If those lands were leased, and the lessee had to pay the whole of the taxation, unless we make provision in our Act, he would have no recourse against the reversioner, that is the holder of the fee simple, because under section 13 he is not liable for anything. As the result, of the criticism by honourable members on this side-and I think we did cure a goodmany of the imperfections that appeared in the Bill-provision was made in tion 27 to cover such a case as that. But the position as - it is now is that, if the lessee under the Crown has to pay under the circumstances I have mentioned, the Crown is not liable. We cannot tax the Crown in the States, and it is the Crown in the States who is the reversioner of this land. Therefore, unless we make other provision, or it is covered by section 13, the lessees whom we now drag into the net oftaxation will have to pay the whole of the tax without recourse to the reversioner, who is the Crown. I mention these instances to' indicate that these provisions tend' to encompass difficulties, the bearing of at least, of which does not seem to have been entertained by those who were responsible for framing the measure. Take now the case of mining: Suppose thetaxreached, such Crown lessees as'the' companies-holding the mines at Broken Hill. Nothing appeals more to people than to say, ""Why should not these big shareholders living in Germany and England be taxed?"" No doubt it is difficult to keep our minds clear of these biassing conceptions in connection with mining; because it will be often said that the men drawing the dividends from the mines today were not the original prospectors or discoverers, and the moment that is said the last word of human wisMr Glynn. dom is accepted as having been uttered. But let us look at the actual position. It is said, whether fallaciously or not I am not prepared to say, that every ounce of gold won from the earth costs more than its value. Perhaps that is a paradox only fit for one who is not an Irishman. However, I always regard that remark as meaning that there are so few prizes in prospecting over the big areas of Australia, that unless we hold out the inducement of a very big reward to enterprise and patience-[becaus e labour not having capital has to be patient arid selfdenying, whilst capital requires only the money-w e will never, without large State expenditure, have our. mines, unknown at present, but actually in existence, discovered and subsequently developed.. Therefore, unless we hold out prospects of rewards such as come from, the big mines of Broken Hill, we shall never have the mining industry developed. sec- Then, why should we bring in a tax which is based on the assumption that the holders of those mines possess-something to which they are not entitled? If we bring in a severe tax, in the form of either a royalty or a tax oh the unimproved sale value of the mine, we may be ignoring such, considerations as those to which I have drawn attention. As I have said, I am not opposed to taxation on the unimproved value of land, whether it be held on lease or in freehold, but I see in connection with Crown leases that there are difficulties; which I hope the Minister will not overlook, and amongst the greatest are those of. which I gave an example in 'what I some, saidabout Queensland -.",64
490,Mr CARR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Macquarie) [9.15] Members of the Opposition seem to have over-reached themselves in the captiousness of their criticism of these taxation measures. Everything is wrong in connection with the Government proposals for raising money. We are told that we ought not to have introduced the Tariff in order to raise money; that is an outrage. We are told that the death duties are something, unheard of, and will de1 prive the widows and orphans of their just dues, although we know that the duties will be so adjusted as to avoid anything like an unfair imposition. Then it is said that we ought not to issue paper money, which also is courting disaster and fooling with a delicate question; that it is a matter we do not understand, our action is 'liable to result disastrously to the country. It was said by one honourable member that the amended land tax is a vindictive imposition, which is being barren desert. used for the purpose of squaring political accounts. Then we are told that we should not take the tax off bread by retile moving the wheat duty. That, too, is wrong, although it is designed to help those very interests which the Opposition profess to be so concerned ahout. The Government have gone so far as to tax the luxuries of the working man by putdeveloped ting an increased duty on beer and they tobacco. That, I consider, is as far can justly go; it is not fair to tax the man's daily bread. But nothing we can is do will meet with the approval of the land Opposition. As to the question we now discussing, I am essentially a land taxer, and I helieve that ethically there is no tax as just in its incidence as Everybody today is acquainted with basic principles of it. I recognise, and the Government have wisely recognised, that, although people are not entitled wealth they did not create, yet the State is not justified in taking it in full, cause of the many vested interests that have grown up with it. Therefore, only a very moderate proportion of that wealth will be taken from ""the holders. The honmate orable member for Wilmot referred to this Bill as being likely to frighten people the land, and to prevent settlement, when land is heavily loaded by taxation in this way, but the honourable member for to ""Corangamite told us that he had been so The fortunate, in regard to the operation the tax in the past, as to be in a position to sell his land. In view of that statelord ment, it does not look as if the contention of the honourable member for Wilmot has much in it. We know, of course, that creasing the burden on the big estates on. means the creation of small estates, and only so far as the burden on the big estates is maintained, have the little estates chance to multiply. The Leader of the acceptable to the people. Opposition argued that production is only factor in determining these values. The honourable memher ignored the prea sence of the people.",65
491,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I was speaking then of gold leases only.,66
492,Mr CARE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Even in regard to them and the honourable member's remark can hardly be accepted as axiomatic.,66
493,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But for its production, Broken Hill would be merely a",66
494,Mr CARR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , in that way. On tha other hand, it does not matter how feran area may be, if it is remote from a centre of population its productiveness can be very small. The same may be said, in a lesser degree of course, of our minerals. In the Northern Territory, there are some minerals which might be if we ran a railway there, but are not being developed because they as we are inaccessible. The propinquity of poor people is a very important factor, and it just as essential as the fertility of the itself. The passing on of this land tax was the last point which the honourable are member for Richmond made. He said that taxes are invariably passed on; that the Anthony Horderns and others in'this this. country would make the working man the pay-the working man whom we have not considered to such an extent as to decline to tax his luxuries, anyhow. So far as to the land tax is concerned, the passing-on process is one which is least possible of beaccomplishment. For the time being, perhaps, the owners of certain site-values, which by usage the people frequent most, will be able to pass on the tax; but the ultiresult of a land tax, as we all know who have observed its incidence, is that off it gradually brings into use land which formerly was not in use-lan d which some exclusive holder would not permit people use, or which was .just a little remote, tax led to the properties being cut up and sold, and other centres of popuof lation have grown up. We know that by this means' the extra pressure of the landhas been eased in that people have had as fresh outlets new areas where they could settle and establish businesses. So in that ultimately the tax is not passed The process can only be temporary. It is a peculiar form of taxation in that regard.' From any point of view a this measure, above all others, should be What is the the use of honourable members opposite talking about the country being stricken with drought, and a war being upon us, as a reason for not imposing such a tax as - this one ? Have we not all to make some sacrifice 1 . Has not even - the working man to make a sacrifice? Do we not reach him tlirough the operation of the Tariff ?",66
495,Mr FLEMING,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Prime Minister has told us that this is not a war tax but a permanent tax.,67
496,Mr CARR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not care what has been said in that respect. Every tax today is a war tax, more or less. Bless my soul, the Opposition say that we must not do this, and that we must not do that, and then they tell us that we may borrow. Borrowing, it seems, is the only thing which we may do, but our opponents know very well that we cannot borrow. The only chance we had of getting any money was in the for m of a war loan distinctly stated, and that has euabled us to assist the State Governments. Any other form of borrowing is not possible. When we seek to use our own credit they deny us the right to do that, calling it folly and describing it as the financing of fiddlers, and so forth . It is time, I think, that the Opposition allowed to the Government a little latitude.",67
497,Mr RODGEHS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Propos e an income tax, and we will help, you to pass it .",67
498,Mr CARR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable membei may speak for himself. But I venture to say that if we were to propose to levy an income tax we would hear his leader and every second man in the Opposition opposing the proposal. Is it seriously suggested that we should put on an income tax at this time ?,67
499,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes .,67
500,Mr CARR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We are seeking an equitable distribution of the added burden which we have to bear. We have to bear it as much because there is a drought as because there is a war, and in adjusting the incidence of taxation we are seeking to establish an equitable basis. The Tariff will reach the rank and file. If a contribution has to be made to the revenue it must come from where wealth is concentrated, whether it is a time of drought or of war.",67
501,Mr RODGERS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How much are going to collect from the Shipping Combine under this tax ?,67
502,Mr CARR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The tax is not aimed at the Shipping Combine. I have no doubt that if the Government were to bring in a measure to deal with that in justice, the honourable member, amongst others, would denounce it as an outrageous interference with private enterprise. I know very well what these baits mean. This proposal, however, has nothing to do with the Shipping Combine, which will be dealt with in due course. If it is to be dealt with by this Parliament it will be done by the Government now in power, and I shall have some remarks to make about these matters when the Tariff is being considered. We are doing only a fair thing by the people of Australia in asking them to contribute according to their capacity at this juncture in our history. We must get money from ourselves in some wayby using our own credit, by issuing notes, as we cannot borrow, and by taxation, indirect and direct. As regards indirect taxation, we are adopting the easiest form to the people, and as regards direct taxation, we are adopting the easiest equitable form which can be conceived of, and, in doing so, we are not attempting to tax the whole of the wealth of people. We are taxing wealth after the poorer people have been passed over, and then in due proportion, as the aggregation of estates is disclosed. In respect to the leasehold question, I agree to a great extent with what has been said, namely, that the results from the imposition of the tax are not likely to be very great. It will probably be discovered that the tax is not worth collecting. I do not know whether it is or not. But I do know that many a leasehold proposition is better than many a freehold proposition. At the same time, I admit that there is many a leasehold which is not worth picking up. I also admit that today there is not much in many of the leaseholds. In assessing land values a wise assessor takes due cognisance of the fact that the seasons are not always good, and, according to the location of the land, the rainfall, and so forth , the value is fixed. So it is in regard to big leaseholds, many of which it will be found are now paying all they are worth. you Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [9.29] - I was glad indeed to hear the honourable member for Macquarie make the statements he did. I want to ask him a question again if he would not think it an impertinence on my part. As he had so very little to say in favour of a tax on leasehold land, I would like to ask him, just between ourselves, whether he voted for this proposal in Caucus.",67

528,Mr CABB,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No ; only where we thought it advisable.,69
529,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"You have taxed him in this way, that way, and the other way.",69
530,Mr CABR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I said that we had not spared his luxuries.,69
531,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is tobacco a luxury ?,69
532,Mr CABB,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; and beer, too.",69
533,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should like to hear the opinion of the working man on the subject. I am glad to have the admission of my honourable friend that the great function of his party in this time of stress and dearth of employment is to tax the working man wherever they can. Many thanks for that admission. statement on thia side is that the taxation which you are imposing will bring more disabilities upon the working man. We are - not here to plead for the wealthy, as we have been charged with doing. We say that the effect of the tax will be to impose further disabilities on the working man in.this time of stress.",69
534,Mr WEBSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,-The honourable member for Corangamite did not say that.  the tax was a class tax.,69
535,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does theionor^ able member for Indi say that it is 'not ? powder dry. Will any member opposite say that it is not? The Attorney-General has stated that it is a class tax. He has said, have a right to go to this class and tax it . "" Was it wrong for the honourable member for Corangamite to say what the - Attorney-General has said ?",69
536,Mr WEBSTER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,-No ; but the right orable member did not always say that.,69
537,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have not said anything different. I say that you cannot tax a class without indirectly and ultimately taxing people outside it.,69
538,Mr BURNS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The right honourable member did not always say that - firm,69
539,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am sure that the honourable member for Macquarie will admit that what I am saying is good economics. This is class taxation. ,69
540,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . Certain forms of taxation affect every citizen in proportion to hia ability to pay. The Bill excludes whole classes who, perhaps, are better able to bear taxation than those on whom it is imposed.",69
541,Mr CABB,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The right honourable member says that the tax will be passed on to the working man.,69
542,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am not talking about the working man now. I say that you are exempting whole classes who are better able to pay thia tax than are those upon whom it is being imposed.,69
543,Mr SHARPE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who are they?,69
544,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The trusts that the honourable member is such 3 champion of.,69
545,Mr JENSEN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then there are trusts?,69
546,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,All I have to say about them is that honourable members opposite have been mighty silent about the trusts since they have gone over to the other side in this chamber. The Why is it ? Why is not the honourable member for Oxley cutting slices of beef every day now as he used to do?,69
547,Mr SHARPE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is plenty of time. It is coming good.,69
548,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In the meantime, let the fact be recorded that when the members of the Labour party sat on this side last session, up to the very day the session ended they made the welkin ring about trusts, and now 'for three solid months we 'have never heard them mention the word.",69
549,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,'We are - keeping our,69
550,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Was it wet when my honourable friends were over "" We here? We know-that it was fizzing the whole of the time.",69
551,Mr JENSEN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We intend to-submit the referenda questions again. - Mr. JOSEPH - COOK - I suppose that honmy honourable'friends will - be happy when they do that. - I do not think they will get from this taxation anything like the revenue they think they will derive from it. ,69
552,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is - my opinion, and I am glad to have the confirmation of the Government Whip, because he knows something about this matter. The honourable member who last resumed his seat referred to one aspect df land taxation, but he got away from the point as soon as he stated it, without attempting to controvert what was said on this side. Referring to the question of the passing on of the land tax in cities, I say that it is inevitable that a class tax like this must be passed on in the cities. It cannot be wise. What is happening in Sydney today ?",69
553,Mr CARR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The city is spreading out because of the land tax.,70
554,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does that prevent the tax upon city properties being passed on?,70
555,Mr CABB,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , it does, and the honourable gentleman knows it quite well.",70
556,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know quite well that a class tax such as this is; which is not generally levied, must be passed on, can be passed on, and is passed on. Here is a proof of what I say. In the city of Sydney there is the Mutual Life Company of New York, at Martin-place. This company is paying today in taxation of one kind and another £2,100 per annum.",70
557,Mr CABB,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And rents have not gone up in their building.,70
558,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am not saying whether rents have gone up or not.,70
559,Mr CARR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How else would the taxation be passed on?,70
560,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I want to know who is paying this taxation. Surely the people who pay the taxation are the people who get it passed on. Hundreds of people will have to pay this tax, and not a single big rich land-holder. will affect a corporation of many small men, many of whom are workingmen, and who are insuring their very existence - These are the people who-have to pay this taxation.",70
561,Mr ARCHIBALD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They would have to pay it in rent, if they did not pay it in Mr. JOSEPH COOK:-Her e are the more facts staring honourable members in the face.",70
562,Mr ARCHIBALD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,If they did not plunder them in taxes they would in rent.,70
563,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I see. Then it is the tenant who has' to-pay this tion?,70
564,Mr ABCHIBALD,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I admit that it is ings. the tenant who does pay it in most instances.,70
565,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is my point. I say that the tenant pays tax in rent, and in his turn he, of course, tries to pass the tax on. If honourable members willnot listen to this kind reasoning, I have anotherfact under their notice. What has their taxation brought them to in Sydney? It has other- brought them to the rag town of their own Labour Government:. That is the way this taxation is expressing itself just now. It is makings the - people live in; rag tents.  in Australia who has lived in a rag tent.",70
566,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but is that my honourable-friend's ideal?  something better.",70
567,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Exactly . My honourable friend is giving the people something when he knows they should have something very much better.,70
568,Mr CABB,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is due to the war, the drought, and unemployment.",70
569,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They say quite the contrary over in Sydney.,70
570,Mr JENSEN,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member forDarwin wanted to live in a tent in the parliamentary gardens.,70
571,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am glad to hear my honourable friends on the opposite side saying, as they are doing now, that it is not so bad a thing for men to have to live in tents.  in one before another fortnight is over.",70
572,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But is that It the ideal of the great Labour party of Australia ? ,70
573,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"To make the people live in calico tents?  all in tents. That is - better, than paying rent. If the Honourable member would go to Western Queensland he would see people living in tents than in houses..",70
574,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Well , we are living and learning. According to my honourable friends opposite, from good brick houses to. calico tents is progress.  taxaare spending their money on their holdings instead of building beautiful dwell",70
575,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We are surely getting on when we hear our honourable friends boasting, as the result of four the years of Labour government, that the people' are living in - calico tents.",70
576,Mr SHARPE,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why did not the honorof able gentleman's friends turn them out to bring at the last State elections?,70
577,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Because they could not. That is plain enough for the honourable member. My honourable friends have an ineradicable idea in their minds that if they can w in at an election, that is the best proof that everything they are doing is right. They have only that one test. Those who get the biggest number of votes must of necessity be on the right side.",71
578,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Order I I ask the honourable gentleman to confine himself to the Bill .,71
579,Mr FINLAYSON,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Vox populi vox dei.,71
580,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is any amount of the "" vox "" about my honourable friends, but there is not much "" d e i "" about them. Here are some more instances of the effects of this taxation in Sydney. They are taken from the taxation returns. Farmer and Son, of Pitt-street, Sydney, pay altogether in taxes £6,800 a year.",71
581,Mr CARR,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Fro m what paper is the honourable member quoting?,71
582,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is a return published by Mr Tom Henley, M . L . A . , of Sydney. All his figures are taken from returns furnished by the people concerned. If a man obtains a return of taxation from the City Council, wil l the honourable member dispute it ? he learns from the Taxation Office the amount of taxation paid, will the honourable member question his figures? What is the meaning of this?",71
583,Mr HIGGS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We desire to know where this document can be obtained. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I shall obtain a copy for each honourable member opposite. This statement was published in the morning newspapers of Sydney. This is the way in which the figures relating to eighteen city properties work outTo make the position, whioh is a serious one, more understandable, I have tabulated the lowest, fixed taxable outgoings on eighteen city properties in Martin-place and Moore-street, and others near the General Post Office. The calculation includes the now super tax proposed for this year by the Holman Government. It will be noticed that the property I referred to as paying £1,600 a year land tax pays in rates and taxes £4,058 per annum for the 78-ft. frontage, or £52 0s. 8d. per foot frontage per annum. Out of every £1 rent paid, 10s. 3d. goes in rates and taxes; the real landlord gets 9s. 9d., and out of that must come bad debts, agents' commissions, & c, and if he buys materials for repairs he pays again s 25 per cent. Customs duty on locks, paints, &c. It is clear, therefore, what is required to reduce the present admittedly high rent charges is a political surgeon or statesman who, recognising the real cause of the evil, will cut off from the produce of property the extraneous growths of taxation which bave wrongly fastened themselves on to rents. And so on. He furnishes the whole table of rates. That taxation is made up as f o l l o w s : - "" W at e r rates, 6 d . """,71
584,Mr HIGGS,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would the honourable member speak of a water rate as a tax ?,71
585,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ADELAIDE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , not in the sense that it is penal. I am talking of what goes out of the rent-of what the working man has to pay. The list is as followsNA PBOPEBTIES. Amount in £1 on the assessed annual value. £ s. d. Water rate ... ... ... 0 0 ft Sewerage rate ... ... ... 0 0 9} City rate ... ... ... 0 1 9 City land tax ... ... ... 0 1 6J Federal land tax ... ... 0 3 6 Income tax ... ... ... 0 1 7 Total 0 9 8 Thus the landlord gets 10s. 4d. of each £1 of the assessed annual value and the tax gatherer 9s. 8d.",71
586,Mr CARR,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,Ye t offices are being erected all over Sydney. If,71
587,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,I do not dispute that. My point is that a lot of this taxation is borne by the working man.,71
588,Mr CARR,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,Offic e rents in Sydney have not gone up I d . They are below normal today.,71
589,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,This is the first time that I have heard that rents in Sydney are below normal.,71
590,Mr CARR,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"I spoke of office rents. - Mr JOSE PH COOK - But , in discussing rentals, we cannot speak of office rents alone. We must take the parity of them.",71
591,Mr BURNS,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,The right honourable member was referring to taxation paid on office buildings.,71
592,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"I was referring to taxation that has to be paid by the working men of Sydney. They pay it , not directly on city properties, but directly on their own properties.",71
593,Mr CARR,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"If it comes to that, the working man pays everything.",71
594,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"I say that the bulk of this taxation will filter through to the working man. TJnder the plea of trying to tax some one else, the Government, as the honourable member for Macquarie told us so eloquently just now, are really taxing the working man all round.",71
595,Mr ARCHIBALD,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,The right honourable member said just now that this was a class tax-that it was not a tax on the working man.,72
596,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,I said that it was a class tax as proposed; and I repeat that the working man ultimately has to pay a goodly section of it .,72
597,Mr JENSEN,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,Does not the right honourable member think it time that we legislated to stop this passing on of everything to the working man ?,72
598,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"The Labour party have heen in office for nearly four years. ""What have they done for the working man?",72
599,Mr BURNS,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,We are going to carry our referenda proposals.,72
600,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"The State Labour party of New South Wales has also been in office for nearly four years, but the cost of living is still going up, and honourable members opposite can do nothing to stop it . They have now, of course, the referenda in view.",72
601,Mr JENSEN,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"The right honourable member told the people that we were taxing every family to the extent of so many pounds per annum, but when he was in ofiice he did not remove any taxation.",72
602,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,The honourable gentleman knows that we could do nothing. But when we found that we could not carry our proposals we did not cling to office like some of his friends have done; we went out.,72
603,Mr JENSEN,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,The right honourable member is now taxing our energy.,72
604,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"Judgin g by appearances, the honourable member's energy will stand much pressure. shall not attempt to compete with him in the matter of exhaustion, because he has a great handicap in his favour. Honourable members opposite admit that the pastoralists and other big landowners of this country are passing through a very rough time just now.",72
605,Mr LAIRD SMITH,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"How does the hontaxation proposal. orable member account for the fact that 17,000 persons in Australia enjoy between them an income of £70,000,000 a year? [65]",72
606,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,I can only say that some of the large land-owners are obtaining no revenue from their holdings today. It is idle to quibble. I am dealing now only with the opportuneness of the time chosen for this further impost. There is this to be said in regard to this tax : that when you get up to 9d. in the £ 1 you have only another 3d. to take to have the whole unimproved value of the land.,72
607,Mr CARR,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,On a limited quantity only.,72
608,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"What does the honourable member mean ? I am taking the ordinary assessable taxation, which is a 5 per cent, basis always. On that basis the Government have now annexed 75 per cent, of the value of the land. Is that right ?",72
609,Mr CARE,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"No , it does not apply all round.",72
610,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"I did not say it did. I said it averaged round, taking the basis at 5 per cent., which is the basis on which all municipal operations are conducted. Although we are suffering from drought, the Government say that clause 66 of the Bill will give the Minister plenty of opportunities for affording relief to anybody who is stricken. The worth of that statement may be gauged by a simple reference to the estimate of receipts. The Treasurer says that in stead of giving the taxpayers relief, he is going to get another £1,100,000 out of them.",72
611,Mr FENTON,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,You say you do not believe you will get the money from the tax?,72
612,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,Surely the honourable member does not think that the o Treasurer's estimate is wrong ?,72
613,Mr FENTON,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,I do; I do not think he will get that amount.,72
614,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"Then had not I the honourable member better help us to revise the whole thing? If the Government are not going to get the amount named, their estimate is all wrong. The Prime Minister says he will , and the Attorney General says they will. I should like to ask another question, but, of course, there is no Minister in the chamber who can give me any information on this They taxed the people but they will not even stay in the House to give information upon their own proposals. Had the Government anv expert testimony as to the opportuneness of imposing this tax and its probable yield ?",72
615,Mr CARR,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,There is Mr MCKay.,73
616,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,I should like to know if Mr MCKay recommended this form of taxation just now.,73
617,Mr FENTON,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,It is not his to do it . Mr JOSE PH COOK - Perhaps not; but the Minister might tell us. Does the honourable member mean to say that Mr . MCKa y has not reported on this matter to the Treasurer ? No Minister with a grain of sense would introduce taxation of this kind without consulting his experts. I guarantee that the Minister of Customs did not introduce the Tariff without consulting the experts in his Department about it .,73
618,Mr JENSEN,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,He is an expert himself - on the Tariff. Mr JOSE PH COOK - So I should judge from the look of the Tariff and the criticisms I have already heard from his own side of the House. I should very much like to know if Mr MCK a y has recommended this form of tax.,73
619,Mr TUDOR,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"Is not that a matter of policy, and altogether aoart from the recommendation of officials ?",73
620,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,Of course it is.,73
621,Mr WEBSTER,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,Mr MCK a y is not responsible for the proposal.,73
622,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"I know he is not. If we knew that expert opinion was behind this tax, and that this was regarded *by the experts as an opportune time to /have another cut at the land-owners, it might help its passage through this House - and the bigger the term the more rea",73
623,Mr JENSEN,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,That is a matter for the Government. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I know it is.,73
624,Mr JENSEN,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"Then what is the game? Mr JOSE PH COOK - The Treasurer tells us across the .table the estimated yield of the tax, and the anticipated movements of trade, on the authority of men in his Department. He is responsible, and he is the first to in for m the House and the country what his experts tell him regarding these matters. "" Mr JENSEN - The Treasurer has given you the estimated yield, and he gets that information from the proper source.",73
625,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"But I should be very much interested to know what Mr MCKay's opinion is as to the i m position of the tax itself at this particular time. Clause 66 says that the taxpayer may get relief, but the extent to which the Government propose to relieve him is to increase the total amount to be collected by £1,100,000 . There does not seem to be very much prospect of relief there. business There is another point. The Government cannot get a penny from leaseholds in any case without first of all impugning and condemning the management of the public estate by the public officials of the State, because the tax on leaseholds is based on an assumed difference between the economic value and the amount of the economic value collected by the State in the shape of rent. The Government cannot get a penny without first proclaiming to the world that the State officials are not doing their duty in expressing the economic value in the State rents.",73
626,Mr WEBSTER,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,Do you not think the State would very quickly attend to the matter afterwards ?,73
627,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,That is the point I was going to put. The State can prevent the Commonwealth getting a penny of that taxation by simply accepting the Commonwealth valuation and taking it out in rent?,73
628,Mr MAHON,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"How could a State do that with leases running over t h i r t y or fort y years? Mr JOSE PH COOK - It cannot be done with very big leases, and the honourable member reminds me of another point. All these big leaseholds that r un over a term of years son there is for assessing the value over a big term-ar e simply rewards to induce men to go on that particular kind of land. What are the forty-two-year leases in the western division of New South Wales but a reward to induoe people to take up land which had become valueless to the State ?",73
629,Mr CABB,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,A lot of them were in the land scandals.,73
630,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,Does the honourable member say that the Commissioners for the Western District are doing something unfair ?,73
631,Mr CARR,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"I do not. I spoke of the forty-two-year leases. Mr JOSE PH COOK - So did I , and they have been granted to the present holders by three independent Commissioners. Mr Hugh Langwell is one of them. He is an old Labour man, and a very good man, too. The Commissioners have fixed these forty-two years' leases. Why? Because the land had become absolutely valueless, and to bring it back to a valuable condition these long leases were offered as rewards to tempt men to go upon it .",73
632,Mr WEBSTER,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,The rents of the lessees are reduced as their improvements are in creased.,74
633,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,They are reduced to a fair economic rental.,74
634,Mr WEBSTER,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"The western leases contain a condition that, if the lessees effect certain improvements to the satisfaction of the Board, the Board will reduce their rents.",74
635,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"That posed to be a fair condition in that district. My point is that whatever is being done is, in the judgment of these three men, the best thing that can be done for the State. That heing so, and the Commissioners having said to the people of New South Wales, ""That is as much as you ought to get from these lessees,"" has Mr MCKay or the Prime Minister a right to endeavour to get more from Take the case of other ordinary Let us assume that a ten years' lease has been granted. All these pastoral leases are averaged over a term so that the bad years may be taken into account with the good years. Many a man today enters into a lease which it would not pay him to accept if it extended over only four or five years, but he enters into it because he hopes to get something out of it during the last four or five years of its currency. If , under this Bill, at the end of , say, six years, when his property is beginning to return him something, we are going to tax the economic rental of that man's lease, we shall be doing him a gross injustice. do not see how it is possible to avoid constant trouble, seeing that these two landlords will be assessing these leases at different values, and gathering taxation from them. The proper thing to do is to leave this question of leasehold to the people who own the land, and who have sovereign rights over it in the different States. If a leaseholder is not paying his fair share, in principle he is just as [65>-2 much entitled to be taxed as is the landowner. But I am dealing with the question of equity in the ascertainment of those values. There is bound to be a conflict in every case between the State valuer and the Federal valuer. Mr Webster. - I rise to a point of order. Is the honourable member in order in discussing the question of the taxation of leaseholds under this Bill , seeing that there is nothing in the measure dealing with leaseholds?",74
636,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,Why did not the Minister explain it?,74
637,Mr WEBSTER,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"I take it that if the honourable member is permitted to discuss leaseholds when there is no proposal in the Bill relating to leaseholds, we shall be able to traverse the whole ground again at a later stage. is sup- Mr DEPUTY - SPEAKE R - I followed the remarks of the right honourable member very closely, and if he had gone outside the scope of the Bill I should have called him to order.",74
638,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"I know that it is idle to discuss this matter. The fiat has gone forth, and in criticising the measure I recognise that we are only butting our heads against a stone wall. B ut it is them? a fair thing to discuss the difficulties leases. which will arise in connection with this novel for m of taxation under which it is proposed to set up two landlords to assess two values on the same estate, and to extract different amounts from it in the way of taxation. That, I submit, can only lead to absolute confusion, to friction between the Federal and State officials, and to trouble in every shape and for m . What the lessee will do between these two stools I do not pretend to know. This legislation is based upon an absolute condemnation of what is being done in the management of the public estate by the State officials, because under the leaseI hold provisions of the Bill the Government will not he able to obtain one penny of taxation u n t i l they have proclaimed to the world that those ofncials have not asduplicate sessed the rentals of leases upon their economic value. What those officials are not taking for the State, the Government declare that they intend to take for the Federation. If tliere could be any greater condemnation of State officials, I should like to know what it is. j \\",74
639,Mr BRENNAN,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,The tax may based on the economic value of the leases.,75
640,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,But it is stated that it will be levied upon the economic value spread over the term of the leases. In many cases-as I have already pointed out-reward s are offered to men to tempt them to go and reclaim land for the State.,75
641,Mr BRENNAN,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,Yes .,75
642,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"If the State has entered into a contract with those men, and has said to them, "" If you will go and reclaim these waste lands for a certain number of years we will give you a certain reward,"" surely we have no right to break into that contractual relationship between tenant and landlord-the landlord being the State Government, and operating through its State ofncials. Consequently this Bill is based upon the principle that before we can get a penny tax under it we have to condemn the present management of State lands by State officials and the control of it by the State Government. I do not desire to occupy the time of the House at any further length, but I felt it my duty to point out this very grave defect in regard to the proposed taxation of leaseholds.",75
643,Mr RIOHARDFOSTER,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"Wakefield) [10.19] - I must apologize to honourable members for trespassing upon their time at such a late hour on Saturday evening, hut this is a matter of such supreme importance to the great producing interests of the country that I feel I must make some observations upon the principle of the Bill which is now before us. measure is a direct attack on the landholders and the primary producers of the Commonwealth. It is a distinctly class tax, with no scientific or sound economic basis. It clearly trespasses on the preserves of the State Governments, attempting, as it does, to interfere with the public administration, in those various States, of the lands of the Crown, particularly in regard to Crown leases. This tax is superimposed on existing State taxation. Wlien the original Commonwealth Land Tax Bill was introduced in 1910, honourable members opposite justified the legislation on the ground that in some of the States the Parliaments had failed to i m pose proper taxation. That justification not be cannot hold good today, particularly in view of the heavy taxation imposed by this National Parliament in that original Act. This legislation strikes at the very root of the question of the cost of l i v in g; because anything that hampers primary production must operate in the direction of increasing that cost. As to the incidence of the taxation, it has been explained that, in so far as it relates to city properties, it may be passed on; and I can give one illustration of this. The first progressive land taxation passed in any Australian Parliament was introduced in South Australia by the Government of which the late Mr Kingston was the head. At that time Mr Kingston was attorney in Australia for one of the richest absentees who held property there, and Mr Kingston, as representing that gentleman, made a provision in all future leases that any taxation should be paid by the tenant, in addition to the rent.",75
644,Mr BRENNAN,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,That is illegal under the Commonwealth Act.,75
645,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"That was done in South Australia, and has continued ever since. I believe in land taxation that is reasonable and just; and I should like to draw attention to the example set by the democratic people of New Zealand, who were the first to i m pose heavy land taxation of a progressive character. Next to that of the Commonwealth, the taxation there is the heaviest, being, perhaps, double that of any other community in the southern world ; but the same Parliament that imposed this heavy progressive taxation, also proThe vided that the produce from land shoidd be exempt from income tax. This exemption placed the land-holders there in just about as good a position as the landholders in some of the States where no land tax prevailed. I do not intend to dwell on the question of freehold taxation more than to repeat what has already been stated, that when the 9d. scale is reached, it means 75 per cent, of the capitalized value of the estate, and another 25 per cent, means the whole lot. This kind of unjustifiable taxation is not equalled! elsewhere in any part of the world, and by driving capital out of land investment, it does infinitely more harm, twenty times over, than it can possibly do good. This taxation is not only cruel and unjust in its incidence, but in many individual cases it means absolute ruin and disaster.",75
646,Mr BURNS,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,How many people bas it ruined ?,76
647,Mr RICHARD FOSTEE,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"We bave no righ t to ruin anybody-n o right to be unjust to any person. When the original Land Tax Bill was introduced here, sworn declarations were received from the representatives of the owners of estates in the Eiverina district, showing that every penny of profit would be swallowed up by the tax; and these declarations were 'foilowed by requests that the Prime Minister would send a Government official to examine the returns and balance-sheets, which it was hold would clearly and unanswerably support the statement. However, ray intention to-night is to deal more particularly with the new phase of this legislation, which includes in its operation Crown leases of well nigh every kind. Eirst, there are the pastoral leases; and, judging by the remarks of the At torney-General, in moving the second reading, it is the intention of the Government to take every penny between what is now collected by the States in the way of rental, and what the Commonwealth taxing officer considers the present economic value of each property. This is a very uncertain quantity. It may be a generous limit. It may be available today, but in twelve months' time may disappear altogether, along with a good deal more of the value. In tliese circumstances the incidence of this taxation will be quite unreliable as a permanent source of revenue for the Treasurer. On a pastoral property in South Australia, on which three years ago 105,000 sheep were put through the shearing-shed, this year less than 25,000 have been shorn, and they have had to be followed all over the run of 2,000 square miles, and the wool taken off them wherever they happened to be found. That is the present condition of one estate in South Australia, which some years ago would give a clear annual revenue of £25,000 to £30,000. In the interests of the development of the in terior of the country, where climatic disadvantages have to be faced, and where the pastoralists have to contend with the ravages of wild dogs, foxes, and rabbits involving enormous expense in the erection of vermin-proof fencing, costing annually in many instances double the whole of the rent collected by the Crown, is it wise to look for the last penny of available taxation from settlers upon country of this character? The taxation proposed is trenching on the prerogative of the State Crown Lands Departments, because if there should be a margin between the rent now collected and levied over a given term, and the value that may exist in a normal or a prosperous season, it ought to be regarded as the property of the State, and not as the property of the National Parliament. Mr "" RODGEBS - And if the States secure this margin their action will defeat the object of the Federal tax.",76
648,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,LIST OF RATES PAID FOR EIGHTEEN CITY,"Of course it will. I am amazed that such a proposal, so far as pastoral leases are concerned, should - have secured a passage through Caucus, seeing that among honourable members opposite there are not only honourable members representing pastoral areas, but also honourable members with a close and practical knowledge of the conditions attaching to the occupation of these big areas. State Governments and State Crown Lands Departments have had anxious times in dealing with the vexed pastoral problems, and the result of their experience, extending over the last thirty or forty years, has been that the rental of a lease, even without taking into account added taxation, is a secondary consideration, and that the primary consideration is to secure continuous occupation and the carrying out of improvements of a permanent character. Improvements such as subdivision and water conservation represent, possibly, more than half the value of the whole estate, and the carrying capacity of a lease is proportionate to the capital wisely invested in carrying out these permanent improvements. The exaction of heavy contributions to the public revenue from estates that have to experience so many disabilities, climatic and otherwise, that no legislation can abolish, is a most suicidal policy. In the late 80's and the early 90's there was a fallacy in South Australia that the squatter was robbing the people of the grass, and as tliere was a popular clamour to penalize him, when the 1888 leases fell in , provision was made by which the State was to exact a much heavier rental. Under this well-meaning but ill-advised administration the 1888 leases when they fell in were submitted at public to the highest bidders. Just at that time the seasons were fairly good, and Sir Jenkin Coles, who was then Commissioner of Crown Lands, thought that he had scored the best bit of business that had been done in land administration South Australia by getting very rents at auction for these pastoral estates. Men who had been in the out-back districts from the very inception the State warned him and the tration that his policy was wrong, and their warning was well-timed, because in four or five years these estates, rents had been quadrupled, serted, and could have been taken up at any price. Vermin was spreading every direction. Estates, of which had risen from and 5s. per square mile to £3 or £4 per square mile, were left on the hands of the Government, and we know that when that happens in the case of pastoral estates improvements' rack and ruin in a very little time. would have been infinitely South Australia not to have got a penny of rent so long as the properties could have been kept in occupation. result of the mistake was that after a Royal Commission had investigated part of the way-back country, legislation of the most character ever submitted Parliament had to be Those men had to be given a forty-two years lease, and, in case of many of the estates, at practically a peppercorn rental with the right to re-adjust the rent at the end of the first twenty-one would seem from the speech of the Attorney-General, that a good many of these estates are held today at a rental altogether inadequate and out of all proportion to their real value, and it is the intention of the National to appropriate the. difference between the present rental and the real value today. If such an available margin does exist, it is the property of the States, and not of the National Parliament. these estates are just now ending first term of twenty-one years, and have nearly reached the time when an adjustment of the rental will have to be made for the second twenty-one years. I say Mr Kicliard Foster. again that the margin between the rental and the real value, if it exists, belongs auction to the State, and if we take it from the State it is depriving the State, not only of its rights, but of something that it needs more than does the National Parliament. But what is the true position today ? Unfortunately, in connection with in many of those pastoral properties, there high is no such margin. The reason is that after the present holders entered upon the occupation of their 1893 leases, they had of to make improvements of an extensive Adminis- character. It is true that wool rose in price, but it is also true that the vermin question became more severe than it had whose ever previously been in the pastoral history of Australia. Will d dogs, rabbits, were deand foxes overran the country and there was a consequent necessity - to provide in over those immense areas vermin-proof the rental fences, which represented an impost on 2s. 6d. the pastoral lessee two, and in some in stances three, times greater than the rental they had to pay. Therefore, the position of the pastoral lessees in South Australia is that, in consequence of the enormous go to liabilities they had to incur to get rid of It the vermin, such burdens have been laid better for upon them that if the real value of their leases is greater today than it was then, the added value does not compensate for The the payments bf 6s., 8s., and 10s. per mile that the lessees had to make for every protection against the vermin. Added pastoral to those considerations is the fact that generous in Australia, with the exception of to any Queensland, there is today so far as introduced. the pastoral properties are concerned, a bigger drought than has even been experienced before. In some instances, the flocks have almost' beeu entirely wiped out, and generally they have been deciyears. It mated to such an extent as to represent a very heavy loss.",76
