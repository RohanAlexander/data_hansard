The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (a) That the use of uranium as a source of energy is currently unacceptable as it presents problems including radioactive waste, military implications and environmental degradation. (b) That there can, at present, be no assurances that radioactive materials exported for peaceful purposes will not be used in the production of nuclear weapons. (c) That there is not, as yet, any known safe method of disposing of radioactive wastes, nor is there likely to be. (d) That the export of uranium from Australia is internationally irresponsible and is not, in the long term, of benefit to Australia.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will immediately cease the mining and prohibit the expon of uranium until perfectly of final disposal for radioactive wastes have been guaranteed; will greatly increase expenditure on research into safe, clean and inexhaustible sources of energy; and will aid underdeveloped countries in their efforts to secure a fair share of the world's energy resources, while at the same time willYour honouring its obligations to the future of humanity.

The Budget completes the dismantling of Medibank as a simple, effective universal health insurance scheme, providing basic coverage for the total community. The Budget, by its heavy cuts in urban and transpon programs, will worsen the quality of life available to many Australians. The Budget will compel state governments toreducetheir services and increase charges. The Budget reduces spending on Aboriginal affairs by 30 per cent and returns expenditure on Aborigines to pre-1972 days. The Budget seriously disadvantages migrant groups, most notably in employment and health, and leavesroomfor concern over the future of ethnic radio.

And the Budget, despite all the above, still cannot be expected toreduceAustralia's annual inflation rate below twelve per cent.

Question so resolved in the negative. 34 85 NA 51 NA Jones, Charles Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask the Treasurer a Keating, P.J. question. Was the Reserve Bank consulted about the decision to devalue? If so, was the advice which the Bank gave accepted by the Government? If the Bank's advice was not accepted, did the Bank Board give the Treasurer a statement of its opinions? If that is the case, will the Treasurer table a copy of that statement?",21
28,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,The honourable gentleman should be very much aware that there has been a long standing tradition in government not to reveal the official advice which comes to government from whatever the source. The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer so far as the advice of the Reserve Bank Board or the advice of any other section of Commonwealth administration is concerned is that of course that advice is not subject to disclosure. NA NA,22
29,Mr SIMON,COMMISSION,"I direct my .question to the Prime Minister. In considering the Green report on the Australian broadcasting system and associated matters and in particular the membership of the Australian Broadcasting Commission was the Government concerned only with the present Commissioner appointed by the ABC Staff Association or is the Government concerned to create a Commission with expertise, experience and responsibility? Is the intention of the Government to guarantee the political independence of the ABC?",22
30,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMISSION,"The Government is determined to guarantee the independence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to establish circumstances in which governments are less able to control what happens in broadcasting than has ever been the case in the past. Honourable gentlemen, I think, have not given adequate attention to the fact that the Broadcasting Tribunal will now be the final determinant of who does and does not get licences. In the past there has aways been the circumstance where the Australian Broadcasting Control Board made recommendations to the Government, but the Government had the final determination as to whether those recommendations were accepted or not. Under our proposals the Tribunal will have thefinalsay in these matters and there will be no appeal to the Government as such. So far as the Australian Broadcasting Commission is concerned, we believe that there ought to be a proper balance between the States. I find suggestions that some States are unable to provide people worthy to fill positions on the Commission as utterly offensive to those States. There will be a proper balance in these particular matters. There is one other point I would like to mention. In our industrial relations policy we have emphasised time and time again that there ought to be permanent mechanism for consultation between the management and the people employed in a particular industry or operation. The legislation for discussion in the Parliament will contain a requirement that there be such a permanent mechanism in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This would open up avenues for consultation between the ABC and its own employees on a broad-ranging front and I would hope on a regular basis. I hope that that would be consultation not merely with one person but with a significant number of people so that of the people employed by the ABC all the different shades of opinion could be represented adequately on that particular body. I would hope that from time to time the whole Commission might well meet with such a body and that the meetings, at least with management of that body and the chairman of that body, would be on a regular basis. This is designed to establish a real and effective basis for consultation which will give weight and depth to the sort of things that ought to occur. One of the things in which the Government has a very real degree of sympathy is that those on the producing end of the ABC, in the news broadcasts, the news rooms, on This Day Tonight, on State of the Nation and the drama programs-the producers and others who actually get the programs on the air-appea r to be the ones who are taking the brunt of the cuts in relation to the ABC. People who have spoken to me on these particular matters have pointed to very large scale engineering staff, engineering divisions, which are preparing and designing certain equipment which they also tell me can be bought down the street on a ready-made commercial basis or at least from overseas but that the ABC has preferred to do these things for itself. The complaint from those on the sharp end has been that these particular areas in the ABC have not suffered any reductions in expenditure, that the administrative arm has protected itself and has taken it out on those who are producing the news services, the State of the Nation program and those producing the drama programs. So far as the Government is concerned we will be doing what we can to protect those who are producing the news services, the drama programs and the commentary programs. These are the people in whom the public are interested. Mr Innes-How about a program on devaluation?",22
31,Mr SPEAKER,COMMISSION,Order! The honourable member for Melbourne will remain silent.,22
32,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMISSION,"I was surprised, when I appeared briefly on the program for the inventor of the year award a week or two ago, to learn that in Sydney there was a view that the Government had directed that the program State of the Nation be cut. I do not know how this view came abroad. If any element in the management of the ABC has ever said anything to give that indication to any employees of the ABC it is acting completely falsely. In any case, gest that that particular program ought to be cut as an economy measure seems rather ludicrous. It is a most economical program to produce. It is an entertaining program. The players who appear on it generally do so without fee. In fact, they are queued up waiting to get on the program if they can.",23
33,Mr HUNT,COMMISSION,Are you queuing up?,23
34,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMISSION,"I have asked if I can be in the queue for this week so I can go on the program to defend it and say that it ought not be cut. I hope that it will not be cut. On that sort of basis I hope that those operating the ABC will understand the Government's view on this matter and will not listen too much to the propaganda from what I beheve would be a minority element in this organisation and which does not depict the views of the Government. Members of that minority element, just as much as those opposite who are unable to listen and who are uninterested in the truth, do little, if anything at all, to promote the truth. NA",23
35,Mr BEAZLEY,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. I ask: In view of the fact that as late last Wednesday he gave an assurance, which was pubUshed in the Press, that there would be no devaluation, does the Treasurer accept the fact that many people, accepting that as a truthful statement, would have lost very heavily from the subsequent devaluation? Is there any intention in those cases to pay compensation? Also, will the Treasurer give any indication in the future as to which of his statements may be regarded as serious statements of Government policy and which as window dressing?",23
36,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"A function of any Treasurer, whether here or abroad, is, of course, to be utterly dogmatic about matters which involve the currency of his country until such time as a change is made. The honourable gentleman is quite right in referring to an article that appeared in the Australian last Wednesday. In fact, the interview was taped the previous Saturday. Ministers who were concerned in relation to a decision about devaluation did not. in fact, meet on this matter until Thursday and Friday of last week. NA",23
37,Mr BUNGEY,WOOL PRICE,"I address my question to the Minister for Primary Industry. Following the devaluation of the Australian dollar, can the Minister indicate whether the minimum reserve to sugprice level for wool will be reviewed?",23
38,Mr SINCLAIR,WOOL PRICE,"The result of devaluation is, of course, that there has been a change in the relative prices that can be expected to be paid for the Australian wool clip. At the close of trading last week the price overall was 280c a kilogram clean whole clip average, ranging in the degree from the 19 micron to cross-bred carding wools from 308c a kilogram down to 212c a kilogram. This compared with a floor price over the same range of 291c a kilogram down to 124c a kilogram. The Government decided that there should be an adjustment of the floor price to the full degree of the 17'/i per cent devaluation, which means that the new floor price at wool auctions will be 284c per kilogram clean whole clip average. The price relativities for various wool types for the purpose of reserve price support around the average will, of course, be announced by the Australian Wool Corporation. In addition, the Australian Wool Corporation has announced this morning that it will be operating itsflexiblereserve at prices which will maintain the closing price trends as adjusted by the full amount of devaluation. In this way the full measure of devaluation can be given to the as wool market and passed on to the primary producers who so well deserve it. NA",23
39,Mr UREN,URANIUM ENRICHMENT,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I ask: Is it true that Australian Government officials have begun talks with Japanese officials to study the feasibility of uranium enrichment in Australia? Further, if this report is true, is this further evidence that the Government is determined to go ahead with its uranium program and to ignore public debate, as recommended by the Fox report?",23
40,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM ENRICHMENT,I have not been advised of any such talks. The Minister concerned has not been advised of any such talks. If any such talks have taken place between any officials this would be contrary to the Government's intentions in relation to the handling of the Fox report. NA,23
41,Mr ALDRED,EMPLOYMENT OF SCHOOL LEAVERS,My question is directed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and concerns school leavers. I preface my quesdon by pointing out that over the past 12 months unemployment in several States has declined or remained relatively static and that 95 per cent of last year's school leavers were successfully placed in employment. I now ask the Minister: What are the prospects for those leaving school this year? Is alarmist talk about those prospects nothing but claptrap?,24
42,Mr STREET,EMPLOYMENT OF SCHOOL LEAVERS,"The Department of Education in estimates that in the course of the next few approximately 250 000 young people will leave secondary education. Some will try to find emdoing ployment. Some, of course, will go on to further education. It is estimated that last year approximately 180 000 of these people actually entered the work force. It is interesting to note that, of that number, only some 60 000 at the peak period of registrations, were registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. will Clearly, the majority found jobs for themselves. As occurred last year, the vast majority of school leavers will find employment. As the honourable member said, over 95 per cent of last year's school leavers have done so. But for some, cause of the present difficult state of the econhe omy, there will be problems in getting employhe ment quickly. Recently, the Government has taken several initiatives in this field to to the subsidy of $59 a week to employers who- I emphasise this, Mr SPEAKER - provid e a course training for young people who have a history high unemployment in the previous 12 months. This initiative is already a great success. I advised that some 2300 young persons have been placed now under that scheme. We will be monitoring that scheme very carefully and will review it at the end of January in the light of the employment situation then. Also, we have introduced the community youth support scheme. We have received more than 200 inquiries for assistance under that scheme. The first approvals have been made already. I am pleased to tell the House that first assistance which I approved was in relation to an application from the electorate of the honourable member for Murray. The Governon ment will continue to assist young people are experiencing employment problems. I menthat, tioned earlier the special subsidies under National Employment and Training scheme. am pleased to tell the House that, Government reviewed the NEAT scheme and introduced new guidelines for it, the estimate was that some 3000 more people would be able to receive training under that scheme. At the time the Labor Government left office there were 7700 people receiving assistance under NEAT. There are now over 12 000 people. The Government will continue to use this form of emphasis on in-plant training to help the employment prospects of young people. NA",24
43,Mr HAYDEN,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"Does the Treasurer recall that, his Press statement issued following the anweeks nouncement of devaluation on Sunday last, he said that the Government would, therefore, be everything in its power to ensure that any identifiable effects of the devaluation decision upon the consumer price index did not flow on into wages, either through national wage case hearings or more generally. I ask the Treasurer: Does that statement imply that the Government has in mind some form of incomes freeze? If so, he indicate how the Government intends to achieve that objective, given the difficulties of our Federal system? If not, in order to avoid sowing confusion in the minds of members of the work force, both working class and middle class, beand provoking those people unnecessarily, will state at least generally the sorts of measures has in hand to achieve this objective, especially in the Ught of the singular lack of success that the Government has had recently in this help.

Of the 9 members, two Act. will have to be women. At present the Act requires that only one of the nine be a woman.

69,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"by leave-When this Governintroduction ment came to office the Australian economy was in the grip of its most serious post-war recession, and inflation was still well into double digits. the end of 1975 the private sector was employing no more people than it had been 3 years earlier although the labour force had grown by 370 Unemployment was at about AYi per cent and had remained at that level throughout the year. Non-farm production was still about 5 per cent below its level 2 years earlier, and the farm sector was in a state of collapse. Company profits fallen absolutely in 1974-75, and their share in total income remained depressed well below the long run average, and business investment was falUng. The consumer price index in December was 14 per cent higher than a year earlier, and inflation showed no real prospect of a sustained downward shift. Right at the heart of the problem, particularly the inflation problem, was the unrealistic view held by the Labor Government-ou r opponents in this House-as to the role of the public sector. Quite unrealistic views were also fostered in the community about future incomes and the capacity of the economy to sustain those incomes. The expectations aroused by our predecessors have bedevilled the economy to this day. Even so, under the poUcies that have been pursued by the Government significant progress has been ACT made in reducing the rate of inflation and in setting the economy on a path towards sustainable in output and activity. Suggestions that Government's economic strategy has failed are without foundation; what has not been possible is the continuation of efforts to hold the exchange rate. It has not been possible because of the obvious limitations in the extent to which reliance can be placed on any single instrument of economic policy. Let me repeat: Assertions that the Government's economic strategy has not worked neglect the achievements that are the dithe nonrect result of that strategy. The rate of inflation has moderated in each quarter since the 5.6 per cent increase in prices recorded in the December quarter of last year. Prices increased by 3 per cent in the March quarter, 2.5 per cent in the June quarter and 2.2 per cent in the September quarter. Figures recently show that Australia's rate of for inflation is now broadly in Une with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. Industrial production has firmed since July. Activity in the housing sector remains buoyant. Registrations of new passenger vehicles have recovered to more normal levels, following sharp decline in July and August due to the of more stringent emission control standards. The weakening in the labour market has been largely arrested over the course of the At September quarter. There are also currently some fundamental differences in the economy compared with a year ago which, taken together, 000. point clearly in the direction of continued growth. First, the growth in the June half-year occurred despite a decline in Government demand; momentum for growth lay entirely in the private sector. Secondly, recovery in many of the had world's major economies has consolidated. Thirdly, as a result of these factors, and the moderation in the rate of inflation, many of the distortions inflicted on the economy during 1974-75 have begun to correct themselves. For example, business profitability has grown and the savings ratio has declined. Fourthly, and connected with the foregoing, consumer confidence and business confidence have been improving and are higher than a year ago. Fifthly, the shake-out in stocks which depressed product during 1975 appears have run its course. I turn now to the measures that I announced that on behalf of the Government on Sunday evenpetitors; ing. In large part, the devaluation was forced on ground that the Government by the deterioration in the years. underlying external situation which occurred during the period of the previous Government. When our predecessors came to office, hold Australia's international reserves stood at an all time record level of $4.6 billion. By the time present Government took office a substantial part of those reserves had been squandered. They fell by no less that $ 1,600m during the prepared vious Government's period of office to stand at less than $3,000m at 12 December 1975. The number of months' cover of reserves to imports fell from 13.5 in 1972-73 to 4.4 in 1975-76. There were a number of fundamental reasons for this extreme weakening in Australia's exterincreases, nal position. An important element in the overall deterioration was the falling away of overseas investment. During the 3 years from the beginsistent ning of 1973 to the end of 1975 annual total vate capital inflow averaged only $215m, comtors pared with an average annual inflow of $ 1,080m in the previous 5 years. The factors behind this fall-off are, of course, well known. Our opponents in this House literally drove overseas capital away by their hostile and narrow ideological attitudes to foreign investors the domestic economic policies they pursued. These policies completely failed to come to grips with inflation; indeed they greatly exacerbated the inflation thrust. The Labor Government, by its own policies, initiated a wage explosion of unprecedented position magnitude. First, it lent general support to exments cessive union claims, particularly in submissions called before the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration commission. Secondly, it deliberately pushed up wages, and more significantly, ing promoted improved conditions of service for National Commonwealth employees in a pace-setting fashion that had highly significantflow-oneffects throughout the community. As a result there was a dramatic deterioration in the international the competitive position of Australian industry. After allowing for the effect of exchange rate period changes, wage costs in this country increased by 15 per cent more than the increase in our trading partners between 1972 and 1975. In the last 6 omic years wages in Australia's manufacturing try increased by 130 per cent, compared with 53 per cent in the United States of America and 70 competing percent in West Germany. This single fact, more goods. Andsector than any other, serves to demonstrate to of the problem which the present Government inherited when it took office. Not only did we have to get Australia's cost inflation rate down to which was being experienced by our comwe also had to try to make up the was lost during those 3 disastrous From the outset this Government sought to the exchange rate as part of its overall antiinflation strategy. We did so with the full knowlthe edge that the Australian dollar was over-valued and that economic developments, particularly the disparity in Australia's cost structure comwith other countries, could have justified a variation in the exchange rate earlier this year. Towards this end we resumed official borrowing overseas as necessary to support the overall level of reserves. At the sametimewe moved to bring down, as rapidly as possible, cost and price in order to restore our competitive position. In addition we have acted to encourage a resumption of private capital inflow more conwith the developmental needs of this pricountry. We have made it clear to foreign investhat they do have a role to play in Australia's development and that we welcome their involvement in partnership with Australians. These efforts led to the development of extensive investment proposals that were, in spite of approval in many cases by the Foreign Investment and by Review Board, not being implemented. I turn now to a vital determinant in the weakening of Australia's external position, particularly in recent months. I refer to speculation about the Australian dollar. It is a matter of the greatest concern that senior members of the Opin this House should have fuelled speculation about since December devaluation by their public comof last year. It will be rethat the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), predicted durthe last election campaign that a Liberal Country Party Government would devalue the dollar, if confirmed in office at the election. Those remarks, made during a halfhour television debate with me, as a Treasurer in then caretaker Government, greatly added to the speculation in the Christmas-New Year of last year when Australia lost more than $600m of overseas reserves. On 19 February of this year, the Opposition spokesman on econmatters, the honourable member for indusAdelaide, (Mr Hurford), said: Costs of production in Australia are out of line with overseas costs at the present exchange rate, so that the import will continue to lose ground to imported a further devaluation scare . . . must be the extent expected at any time. On 7 September the honourable member for Oxley said pubUcly that 'Blind Freddy and his dog' could see that the dollar was over-valued and went on to say that devaluation was inevitable and gave general support to the figure of 15 per cent. These grossly irresponsible comments were headlined in all of Australia's major newspapers and led directly to a weakening of Australia's reserves position. The honourable member for Oxley is quoted in some parts of yesterday's Press as saying that the decision was 'inevitable' and, in other parts, describing it as 'madness'. His comments yesterday reflect only his naked complicity in developing a cUmate for profiteers to make a killing at the expense of the Australian nation. In recent weeks the Deputy Leader of the Opbillion, position (Mr Uren) has persistently questioned me in the Parliament about the exchange rate and loss of reserves. In one such question on November, having listed the loss in reserves previous months, the Deputy Leader described the position as a 'disaster'. It is also a matter concern that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should have been part of the general speculation in this country about devaluation. In awarding its recent wage to increase, which was contrary to the whole thrust reserves. of the Government's attempts to restore this country's competitive position, the Commission saw fit to cast pubhc doubt on the future position of the currency. By doing this the Commission greatly worsened a situation which was, ironiundertake, cally, in no small way due to its previous deto cisions to increase wages at a rate beyond Australia's economic capacity to absorb. In all these circumstances, the Government was unand able to prevent the continuing decline into reserves. The loss of reserves, aside from Government borrowing, in fact increased sigindustries nificantly in recent months, with a fall of around $80m since the end of July-almos t four times the amount the Government was able to borrow overseas in that period. In September reserves declined by $204m, excluding overseas borrowmonths ings. In October the reserves figure fell $269m. Up to 26 November there was a further fall of over $260m. This decline in reserves had continued despite the additional monetary measures announced on 7 November and left official reserves at 26 November at around $2,100m, sufficient to cover less than 3 months' imports; to be precise to reserves were covered by just 2.7 months of imports last Friday. Moreover, the level reserves, net of borrowings, was becoming increasingly untenable relative to the current $4 billion. account position that was in prospect. I emphasise, in this connection, that the Government faced the prospect of an even greater rate of outflow around the end of December early January period and I remind the House that more than $600mflowedout of Australia during the equivalent period last year. As I emphasised on Sunday night, to have allowed the situation to deteriorate further would have been to admit the possibility of enormous speculative gains, with consequent costs to the authorities. The fact is that, faced with the rundown in reserves, there were only 2 alternatives before the Government. The options put to the Government by its advisers were devaluation or borrowing on official account, of the order of $ 1 to shore up the reserves position. In these circumstances the Government could have allowed the situation to drift on and attempted to 11 arrange further borrowings overseas to finance in what would inevitably have been further outflows of private capital. The announcement for of large additional borrowings, in a situation where our underlying external situation remained out of line with our competitors abroad, would have had perverse effects, leading an escalating increase in the rate of loss of Such a loss, together with any additional borrowings the Government had been able to would have involved enormous costs the authorities in the event that we were forced to make an exchange adjustment. Further to that, the most recent decision of the Conciliation Arbitration Commission effectively put paid any prospect of restoring, within a tolerable time span, the competitiveness of Australia's by purely domestic policies. Beyond all of the foregoing considerations the Government would not have been able to borrow funds on private markets sufficient to cover the rate at which reserves were running down over recent and, particularly, to cover the loss that by was in prospect over the Christmas period. A possible drawing of some $1 billion from the International Monetary Fund would only have bridged the situation temporarily. Given these facts no responsible government would have acted differently to the present Administration of this country. We were not prepared to put the national interest in hock. We were not prepared let profiteers take this country to the cleaners. I have no doubt that our opponents in this House of would have chosen the opposite course. They would have employed another Khemlani to raise I turn now to the size of the devaluation. should be clearly understood that nothing would have been achieved by a devaluation that insufficient. An inadequate devaluation would have failed to restore our competitive position and would not have been credible. That would have left great uncertainty in the minds of ness and investors. The Government is fully aware of the potential for increased capital inflow. Indeed it is a primary objective of the devaluation to increase the level of inflow. will be monitoring closely external developquarter ments, including developments in capital inflow. The Government has indicated that the rate will be administered on a flexible basis. Adjustments will be made to the rate to extent necessary to ensure that it remains consistimported ent with overall external and domestic policy objectives, particularly monetary policy. Under the new pattern of management of the exchange rate a tradeweighted average rate will continue to be computed daily on the same viously. However, the exchange rate will no longer necessarily be pegged on a fixed reladepend tionship to the basket of currencies. Instead will be kept under review and varied as approa priate in the context of overall management of the economy. The new pattern of management of the exchange rate will enable more frequent, more timely and smaller adjustments to be made to the rate; is appropriate to the changing nature of world economy and to Australia's international trade relationship; is designed to avoid the build-up of an expectation of major changes long intervals in the future; will permit the use the exchange rate as appropriate, flexible arm of economic policy; and will require little or no institutional changes. The new arrangements are a further step in the developstances ment of the Australian foreign exchange system. A close watch will need to be maintained order to see how things develop from this point. There are elements in the new system which must be held close; in particular the managedevaluation ment objectives used in determining the variable link to the basket of currencies. Otherwise, system would lose flexibility and there would a strong possibility of speculation against the central bank. Exaggerated fears have been expressed about possible effects of increased capital inflow on domestic liquidity. The Government will not allow any such developary ments to occur. Such investment capital will be an important ingredient in ensuring the tinued recovery in economic activity. The reserve losses of recent months should be reversed as the It delays in export receipts and early payment of imports, which have been induced by exchange was rate uncertainties, are in turn reversed. The Government's action has been criticised on the grounds that it will lead to further inflation. Unlike the devaluation of our predecessors busiin September 1974 that took place at a time when inflation was running at a quarterly rate of some 5 per cent, Sunday night's adjustment was against the background of a moderating rate of We inflation from S.6 per cent in the December of last year to 2.2 per cent in the most recent quarter. The devaluation will, of course, affect prices to some extent, even though stringent off-setting measures have been simulthe taneously taken. In particular, the price of goods will be higher, in terms of Australian dollars. But imports account for only 16 per cent of the gross domestic product and, funher to that, the prices of all imported products would not be expected to rise by the extent basis as preof the devaluation. The overall price-raising effects of devaluation very much on the circumstances in which it the measure occurs; devaluation necessarily has lesser impact at the early stages of recovery that it does when activity is at full swing. When demand is still short of capacity, as it is presently, there is scope and incentive for business to increase output rather than to increase prices. In fact, some costs should actually fall, as a result of the devaluation. An over-valued exchange rate has prevented import-competing and export industries from approaching their most efficient scale at of output. In these circumstances devaluation of can be expected to actually lower unit costs in as a more some industries. The price impact must also be assessed against the accompanying measures. Unlike the circumof the last devaluation in September 1974, when there were no off-setting measures in taken by the former Government, there has been a significant toughening of monetary, fiscal and wages policies. The favourable effects of will therefore be allowed to work through the economy in an appropriate domestic the setting, by comparison with the former Governbe ment's devaluation which was followed by a substantial easing of fiscal and monetary policies. I emphasise that the package has been designed to counteract, to a significant extent, the inflation impact of devaluation. The monetmeasures wdl contain the effects of devaluation on domestic Uquidity; they will not lead to conany excessive tightening of liquidity. The Government's policy remains that monetary growth will be sufficient to underwrite economic recovery without at the same time being accommodating to inflation. Normal financing requirements of business and the housing industry will be met. Thefiscalmeasures will support the Government's monetary policy and maintain a balance in overall policy. The measures which will be taken on the wages front will prevent, to the maximum extent possible, the feed-through of any price rises into general wage increases. Our opponents in this House, who have sought to undermine Australia's external position, have demonstrated again their capacity for hypocrisy and double standards. The devaluation of September 1974 was a panic reaction to the credit squeeze which the former Government's policies caused. It devalued at a time of near record high inflation and when average weekly earnings were running at unprecedented levels. It took no measures at all to counteract the price effects of devaluation. It acted at atimewhen reserves were at a level of nearly $3 billion, or almost $1 billion higher than recorded at the end of last week. At the end of September 1974 the ratio of reserves to imports was equal to 4.8 months' cover; as at 26 November of this year-las t Friday-the equivalentfigurewas 2.7. In addition to all of this our predecessors leaked their decision to devalue in such a way that speculative profits were made on the London Stock Exchange. The former Government's decision to devalue was taken at around 10 p.m. on Tuesday, 24 September. The announcement wastimedfor 6 a.m. on Wednesday, 25 September when financial markets would be closed. The record shows that the Melbourne Sun reported the devaluation, including the figure of 12 per cent, and the story in question was put together at around 11 p.m. on 24 Septembersome one hour after the decision was taken. Subsequently, at around 1.30 a.m. on 25 September, Reuters reported the Melbourne Sun story. The Reuters news report was made public at around 4.30 p.m. on 24 September in London and led to immediate trading on the London market during the final part of that day's trading. The present Leader of the Opposition refused to answer questions in the Parliament on the following day and refused to initiate an appropriate investigation to the cause of that leak and its consequences on the London market. In short, the scandal surrounding the leakage of information-a n act which under our parliamentary system of government would normally require the resignation of the Treasurer-wa s covered up by the present Leader of the Opposition and his ministerial colleagues. What I have said illustrates the blatant opportunism of the criticism that has been made by the Opposition of the statement which we made last Sunday. The Government's measures have support. For example, the majority of State Premiers-Premier s Hamer, Court, Petersen and Labor Premier Nielsen-hav e welcomed the package. The Government's measures have undeniably a number of major advantages for important sectors within the Australian economy. The devaluation of the dollar will greatly improve the profitabUity of Australia's export and import competing industries and underwrite Australia's external situation. The rural sector, which has suffered a disastrous fall in real income in recent years, will now receive substantially higher prices for their exports and their ability to expand market shares will be enhanced. The annual rate of rural exports, currently running at $4.5 billion, should increase by around $700m. In the mining sector, which is an important focal point for economic growth, new ventures had become unprofitable and some existing mines had closed. The devaluation will restore the long run growth prospects for this sector and increase annual export returns significantlyperhaps by approaching half a bUlion dollars. The devaluation wdl also go a long way towards off-setting the effects of excessive wage increases on costs of manufacturing and service industries such as tourism, enhancing their competitive ability. The removal of uncertainty about the exchange rate will restore investor confidence. Firms will be encouraged to borrow overseas and long-term foreign equity investment will increase. In summary, the devaluation will restore balance between economic policies, easing the excessive burden that has built up on the external side. It will restore balance between economic sectors, easing the burdens on those vital areas of the economy that depend on world markets for their livelihood. Above all, it wdl remove uncertainty. Uncertainty about the exchange rate has bedevilled many aspects of the economy in recent days. Energy has been diverted from more productive ends into efforts to avoid the losses as that large changes in the exchange rate entail. Uncertainty has stifled investment, most particularly investment from abroad. All that can now be put behind us. These are very substantial benefits. There are, we acknowledge, costs in the decision we have taken. There will be an early addition to prices from the higher costs of imports. But we have acted, in thefiscaland monetary sphere, to do what we can by off-setting action. We have put in hand an examination of Commonwealth outlays to see where further restraint can be imposed. 1 look to this review to produce a final expenditure outcome that will be even lower than the Budget figure. The monetary measures I announced are designed to soak any excess liquidity that devaluation may in its train. No one can know with precision what may develop by way of capital inflows, but we stand ready to meet the situation as it emerges. stress that the aim will be to soak up the ditional liquidity that may result from devaluapeople tion. In that context, any talk in this country credit squeeze is nonsense. The general monetary objectives remain: To foster conditions that be conducive to economic recovery while ing inflation to a minimum. These actions, important though they are, will not be enough in themselves. Action will also needed on the wage front. But others must play their part-in particular, of course, the Concilimunity. ation and Arbitration Commission. It is vital the price effects of devaluation are not translated, through the indexation process, spiral of wage/price increases. Such an outcome would negate the benefits that devaluation will provide. The Government will not stand by allow that to happen. Clearly, we need good sense by all who participate in the wagethe determination process. Given that, there is reason for confidence in the gradual emergence of stable, prosperous conditions from which all Australians will benefit. The acted in the national interest to give greater balance, and thereby greater strength, to the basic economic strategy that has been pursued since we came to office. I present the following paper: Australian Economy-Ministeria l Statement, 30 November 1976. Motion (by Mr MACKellar) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr Sinclair)-by leaveproposed: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking period not exceeding 30 minutes and the Prime Minister the honourable member for Oxley each speaking for period not exceeding 30 minutes. Mr Donald Cameron- I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. Did the Leader of the House say 'the honourable member for Oxley' or 'the consistently honourable member for Adelaide'? The honouromic able member for Adelaide is the Opposition's shadow Treasurer.",27
70,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"No point of order is involved. Question resolved in the affirmative. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (3.54)- A year ago, at the direction of the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm up Fraser), the men who compose this Government bring brought the Parliament to a standstill and blocked the national Budget. The justification for their grab for power was that Australia must be I saved from economic disaster. The saviours have adturned out to be the wreckers. The Australian were solemnly assured that only a Liberal of a government could restore Australia to economic prosperity after the international recession; that will only a Liberal government could provide sound keepeconomic management; that only a Liberal government could restore full employment; that only a Liberal government could revive business confidence and beat inflation; that only a Liberal be government could command the confidence of foreign investors and the world economic comThat was the pretext on which the rules that and traditions of centuries of parliamentary democracy were overturned in November last into a year. In November this year we can see the result. The beginnings of economic recovery under the Labor Government and the credibility and of the Prime Minister and his Treasurer (Mr Lynch) now Ue in shreds amid the wreckage of Government's economic strategy. The Fraser every Government's economic policy has not just failed: It has ceased to exist. The Government not only lacks a credible economic policy: It lacks Government has any policy at all. The vacuum at the heart of the Fraser-Lynch strategy, the panic and desperation evident in their latest decision, is a matter of the gravest concern for the Australian people, for employers, for trade unions, for consumers, for the business community. The motion of censure, which I will move at the end of my speech by way of amendment to the motion comes, from a sense of deep national responsibility. The Government can no longer claim that in drawing attention to its failings the Labor Party is damaging the economy. The damage has already been done. More damage will be done while this Government for a flounders from one decision to the next. The and Labor Party in this Parliament has constantly put a forward creative and practical alternative policies to hasten recovery. The New South wales and Tasmanian Labor Premiers have done the same. The Labor Party throughout Australia has shown a spirit of goodwill on econmatters and a readiness to co-operate in solving our problems which the Liberals never showed to us. The Liberals have torn up every constructive proposal for steady economic recovery. We are left now with the fruits of their blindness and intransigence- a stagnant economy and a massive devaluation, the greatest since the Great Depression. The difficulty of making any constructive analysis of the Government's economic policy is simply that it is no longer possible to say what the Government's policy is. For most of the year it could have been said-the Government itself proclaimed repeatedly-that its policy was to reduce inflation. That was the paramount aim. Every other economic problem-unemployment , loss of productivity, declining business confidence-wa s secondary. Limited and inadequate as this policy was, it was at least a pohcy. A week ago it was still the Government's policy. Today, it is not. At the beginning of the year the Government favoured an investment-led recovery. That policy failed. It switched sumer-led recovery. That policy failed. It held out the prospect of reduced interest rates. Now it is putting up interest rates. It promised to support wage indexation. Now it is attacking indexation as the cause of all Australia's problems. Two weeks ago it was still staunchly proclaiming its intention of avoiding devaluation. The Government announced a monetary package on 14 November basedfirmlyon the assumption that the Australian dollar would not be devalued. Yesterday we saw the biggest devaluation in Australia's history since the Great Depression. In all these feints and twistings, in all backing and filling, it is impossible to see one consistent theme, one coherent or rational thread in the Government's thinking. Mr Kevin Cairns-Of course it is. Mr E. G. Whitlam- I understood that the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) was one of those on the Government side who was prepared to be known as a critic. I gave him credit for that. In every area of economic policy the Governdom ment's measures have failed. Every indicator has pointed to a worsening outlook under this Government. We have had 3 further examples the past week. The ANZ Bank index of factory production continues to show that production stagnant. Motor vehicle registrations fell October. The Bureau of Statistics reported a. fall of about 8 per cent in the real value of investtion ment by Australian businesses in the September quarter this year compared with the September quarter last year. This is the Government that promised to stimulate investment and stimulate employment. It promised to put people back work. 'Only under a Liberal-National Country Party Government will there be jobs for all who need them'-thos e were the words of the policy speech a year ago. Yet unemployment today is rising; in the next 2 months it too will be the highest since the Great Depression. Not only that, unemployment has been a deliberate objective of the Government's measures. It is the only Government policy that has met with any success, and it has been a consistent and growing success. The Government's actions in cutting public spending and reducing purchasing power have retarded recovery and increased unemployment. The Government that blamed inflation for unemployment has now given us its answer: Push inflation up further. That will be the effect of its devaluation-highe r inflation and, therefore, according to the Government's own reasoning, to a con- higher unemployment. The Government's policy switches have been as frequent and violent as its attempts to blame others for its own mistakes. The picture we are now asked to accept is that of a virtuous and blameless government at the mercy of every hostile and irresponsibe element in society. Everyone is to blame but the Liberal Government. It blamed the Labor Government; but now that its own measures are taking effect and its own Budget is failing, it can no longer blame my Government. It blamed consumers; yet the Government has done its best to attack their wages and reduce this their purchasing power. The Government has blamed the unions; it has blamed foreign investors. When the Treasury opposed the Government's devaluation and fought against it, the Prime Minister responded by splitting the Treasury in two. When the Arbitration Commission granted full indexation for the September quarter the Government responded by vilifying the Commission and blaming it for our economic crisis. What confidence can the Australian people and the business community have in a government which Uves by ad hoc and randecisions, which vents its hostility against anyone who questions its motives or its wisdom? in It is easy enough to point to examples of the Prime Minister and Treasurer denying that the is Government would devalue; such denials are acin cepted as routine procedure. But this Government went out of its way to insist that devaluawas out of the question and it based its whole strategy on avoiding it. The denials were not just the accepted counter to speculation, but an affirmation to the Australian people and the rest of the world of a staunch and entrenched to policy. On 24 April the Prime Minister said: We are not contemplating devaluation. There is no doubt about this. On 29 July he said: A downward movement in the exchange rate would have inflationary effects contrary to our primary domestic aim. On 7 September the Treasurer insisted: Those who, in the name of reducing unemployment, call for . . . devaluation of the Australian dollar are calling for higher-no t lower-unemploymen t in this countiy. On 8 September, the following day, the Treasurer repeated: Of course the Government does not intend to devalue . . . The Government is confident that the strategy which has been outlined will work. On 15 September the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) said: Devaluation is not on. On 14 September the Prime Minister stated: The Government's determination in this matter plete, as is mine and as is and that of the Treasurer. On 13 October the Treasurer told the its direct Parliament: The Government has every confidence that its investment policies will work out effectively in that during the period ahead a significant inflow-of foreign capital into this countiy. Since then $400m or $500m have flowed out. On $170m 9 November, the Treasurer told us: The Government ha: no intention of qualifying tial thrust of the economic policies coming to power and which we clearly preshadowed during the election campaign. On 11 November he said: The underlying external position remains sound. On 15 November the Prime Minister himself turned to the subject with a ringing declaration to the Stanford Research Institute in Sydney our overseas borrowings were 'a sign of strength'. He said: Our credit is good and Government borrowing policies are working should be taken as a sign of We have given great importance to following consistent known policies in the attack on inflation. On 24 November-last Wednesday-the investment, Treasurer said in a long interview in the Australian: Devaluation would certainly contemplation by the Government. The external position is sound; the balance of payments is comfortable. The next day the decision was taken to devalue.",32
71,Mr YOUNG,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Joh n Stone was in Paris. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I am not in a position to know who gives the advice in these matters. When I had the temerity to ask whether the Reserve Bank had given advice and if it were not taken by the Government whether it would be tabled, I was given the tut-tut: Advice to governments is not tabled. Of course the Banking Act says that if the Reserve Bank gives advice and the Government does not take it then the advice is to be made pubhc. It is tabled in the Parliament. The Act says that. Now I make all allowance for the Treasurer because he said in answer to a question today that in fact his interview with the Australian had been taped 6 days before. I suppose that makes all the difference. Because 6 days before he decided to devalue he said: Devaluation would certainly be unhelpful and is not in contemplation by the Government. The external position is sound; the balance of payments is comfortable. It all came unstuck in 6 days. We must sympathise with him; but how much more we must sympathise with our fellow citizens. A devaluation of 17'/4 per cent is not just an admission of defeat: it is comis disastrous by almost any test we apply. We that of the Deputy Prime Minister know that the decision was opposed vehemently by the Treasury. The Treasurer himself admits to inflauonary possibilities. It will push up the prices of imported goods. It will give a whole foreign new impetus to the cost structure of Australian practice and society. It will add enormously to a money there will be an inflow-indeed , supply already growing by 16 per cent a year. The decision will put windfall gains of around into the hands of speculators who have run down Australia's reserves in the confident the essenexpectation that the Government's nerve would which it has pursued since fail. Its nerve has failed; its strategy has collapsed. And the people will pay for it. To meet the cost of the Government's capitulation the Australian people face even harsher monetary measures next year to stem the inflationary tide rethis Government is inviting-tighte r credit, higher interest rates, dearer money-al l the that paraphernalia of a credit squeeze with its ' inevitable check on business confidence and expansion. Whatever short-term gains are while other made in employment in the manufacturing strength. industries the effect will be swamped by the and boost to inflationary expectations throughout the country. Employers will cut back on spending, on on employment. The recession will be prolonged. In the grotesque newspeak of his statement on Sunday night the Treasurer be unhelpful and is not in said: This action should give confidence that we are on the path towards restoration of full economic health. Who gave the advice to him? You cannot blame John Stone. He was out of the country. If this is the Treasurer's concept of economic health I would hate to experience his recipe for economic sickness. He described the devaluation as 'early, decisive action'. One is reminded of the similar, instinctive, immediate, decisive action which Nero took when he grasped his fiddle. The devaluation is a classic example of the measures vulnerability of Australian conservative governments and after ments to any question concerning the exchange assurances that the rate.

Whitlam- I agree with the caused honourable member's comments on his own coUeagues. I heard him on AM this morning and I thought he was uncustomarily coherent and persuasive-no t a lisp out of place. On all these occasions the Country Party, as usual, put its interests above those of the coaUtion and those the nation and threatened a spUt with the Libpresented erals unless it had its own way. Their standover tactics prevailed then as they have apparently prevailed now. The devaluationists were held check on this occasion only by the resolute opposupporters sition of the Reserve Bank and the Treasury. The rest of the world was entitled to assume, after the Budget in August, after the monetary month, announced on the seventh of this after the Government's subsequent statethe Prime Minister's repeated Australian Cabinet was unthe Achilles shakable in its opposition devaluation. I have devaluation which given last few led to It was the knowledge abroad that the Liberals' economic strategy was failing and that the Prime own resolution was crumbling. All the by the foreign speculators were confirmed revelation in the Press on 10 November devaluation, the Prime Minister had feet of clay. Who leaked the story? Methought the Treasurer protested too much about leaks, not leaks about devaluation but leaks about those who were in favour of devaluation. Who stood to gain from those leaks? Who the hero of all the Press statements that the and the Reserve Bank through their brought the Prime Minister back government from the brink.",35
75,Mr COHEN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Phil the leak. Mr E. G. Whitlam-That would be my The one man who was supposed to have set his face against devaluation, the one ever man who was said to be firm to his anti-inflationary strategy, the leader of the party that for thefirsttime had the numbers in Parliament to resist Country Party pressure, was tempted to himself. As soon as the world discovered that the Prime Minister was weak on this issue, as soon as the speculators discovered that the Libheart, Prime Minister was a Country Party man at the game was up. The Treasurer made a virtue of necessity on Sunday evening by claiming that the Govern'could not allow uncertainty to continue'. Who caused the uncertainty? The Government it. It was uncertainty of the Government's making. It was uncertainty caused by the Prime Minister's own irresolution. It was uncertainty caused by the knowledge that yet again a Liberal-Country Party Government was divided own on devaluation. Even its determined and persisof tent borrowings abroad which the Government as a sign of the economy's strength were interpreted as a sign of its weakness-the weakness of the currency and the weakness of in the Government itself. The Government and its could go on ad nauseam insisting that its economic strategy was working, but shrewder and more detached observers could see that it was not. Overseas investors could see that the economy was weak. So could the Arbitration Commission. Nothing could be more cowardly or hypocritical than the Government's attempts to blame the Commission for the collapse of its economic policies. One minute the Government claims virtue for its decision and points to the advantages for all concerned; then it protests that the decision has been forced upon it-it has been forced to do good! If the Government believes that wage increases are inflationary why is it adding to inflationary pressures and wage demands by devaluation? The fact is that the Arbitration Commission has done its best to accommodate the Fraser Government's policies. Any confusion in this area is the Government's own responsibility. In its election policy it promised to support indexation; then in the first quarterly national wage case after the election, it broke its promise and opposed it. Despite this about-face and despite its natural commitment to the principles of indexation, the Commission went along with the. Government's viewpoint in the second and third quarterly national wage cases. It has twice taken notice of the Government's pleadings that to grant full wage indexation would cripple the economy or undermine the Government's antiinflation strategy. The Government has shown its gratitude by petulant attacks on the Commission's latest decision. The Commission decided that since the Government's strategy had been given a fair trial and had been shown to be something less than infallible, a concession to the opposing side was called for in the interests of the whole community. The Commission decided that the Government's policy had manifestly not brought us closer to economic recovery. Its judgment stated: The economic situation would appear to be much same as it was in August. There may be some slight improvement but it is difficult to be optimistic about economy as a whole, including the further deterioration in our level of international reserves. The rural industry tinues to worsen. Unemployment and the rate of inflation of grave concern. Consumer spending has not increased consumer confidence is lacking. Those are the words of the Conciliation and bitration Commission. No wonder the Prime Minister went into a tantrum and tore up the piece of paper giving him thetidings.In granting full wage indexation the Commission plainly rejected the Fraser Government's whole econfinancial omic strategy. It refused to accept the view that only by holding down wages and depressing livthat ing standards can our economic problems be pete solved. It refused to accept that there are other less destructive ways of restoring full employment. It is understandable that the sorry task of announcing the devaluation fell to the beleaguered Treasurer. The Prime Minister clearly was reluctant to announce the disintegration of his Government's economic strategy. The Treasurer had to justify publicly the action he had strenuously opposed in Cabinet and publicly repudiated on innumerable occasions. It is not surprising that his statement on Sunday was unconvincing. Nowhere did he spell out clearly who would benefit from it. We know the speculators will benefit, but will anyone else? We are told that manufacturers will benefit, but we know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Senator Cotton) thinks otherwise. According to Press reports which have never been refuted, Senator Cotton argued powerfully against devaluation when the matter was raised amongst the favoured Ministers on 5 November. Any benefits for manufacturers will be temporary at best. They will have to pay more for imported components and capital equipment, and as inflation rises they will inevitably face pressure for higher wages. We are told that primary producers will benefit. But will they? The main problem for primary producers is not import competition or competition from other countries in foreign markets but depressed markets generally and foreign quotas on our primary products. Devaluation will add to farmers' costs as it adds to everyone else's costs. Many primary producers will not benefit at all. On the radio yesterday the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson)-the man who, it is widely believed, is destined to be Treasurer or Minister for Finance-sai d that the sugar industry would benefit. I would have the expected a Queenslander to know better. Sugar contracts are written in Australian dollars, as are the many wheat contracts. Producers of these comconmodities will not gain a cent. Beef producers and are wheat growers will see their gains wiped out by and the rise in freight rates. Indeed, every exporting industry, primary and manufacturing, which deArpends on foreign shipping-and which of them does not?-wil l pay more. So, for the sake of dubious and at best transitory benefits to manufacturers and some primary producers, and certain benefits for overseas mining companies and speculators, the rest of the economy is to be made to suffer. Costs will go up. The fact is about 60 per cent of our imports do not comwith local goods! Their prices will be pushed not up for consumers without any benefit whatever to industries in Australia. Overseas observers see how doubtful the benefits of devaluation be, just as they could see the weakness of the Government's original policies. AM reported this That morning on the reaction to devaluation United States: The New York Times says the long term effects of the devaluation are unclear and it reminds its readers that although the Fraser Government has been following a restrictive economic policy since gaining office last December, neither the balance of payments improved as much as we hoped . . . What reaUy interests the Wall Street Journal are the political problems that Mr Fraser has now brought upon himself. The Journal says the devaluation could undermine the reputation with Australian voters that gave Mr Fraser victory barely a year ago. It could also weaken his position within his own coalition party, panicularly with uneasy back benchers who were elected for the first time that a Fraser Government would restore the economy, reduce inflation and not create unemployment. And, says the Wall Street Journal, both Mr Fraser and his Treasurer, Mr Lynch, face a possible loss of credibility over the timing and the size of the devaluation. repeatedly deniedreportsthat Australia was to devalue and they had both called such reports irresponsible. The Journal also says Mr Fraser now faces the fact that many people, remembering what he promised to achieve at last year's election, will see his move to an admission that his Government has failed to deliver what it promised-sound , economic management. Thus AM today. In the space of a year the Government has destroyed two economic strategies. It has destroyed Labor's strategy and it has now destroyed its own. There is little use now in lamenting the other options that were open to it. We know that as late as last week it still had the option of further overseas borrowing to avert the catastrophe of last Sunday evening. The trouble is that this Government, through its malice and hysteria last year, created a mythology about overseas borrowing which blinded it to the proper and rational alternative to the disastrous action it has now taken. Very little now remains to this bankrupt and bewildered Administration. The least it can do is take action to stem the enormousflowof foreign speculative capital that its actions will attract to this country. Eventually it must return to economic policies that will benefit the whole community. Its obsessive concern for sectional interests and pressure groups must end. The Australian people have had enough of a Government which favours wealthy minorities, trades off one section of the community against others and makes the vast majority of Australians pay for the windfalls and favoured treatment it gives to the few. We are now learning the full extent of the Liberals' dishonesty and ruthlessness of a year ago. We are learning it the hard way. It is a lesson the Australian people will take to heart when next they choose the party to form can a Government in this House and in the Auswill traUan Parliament. As an amendment, I move: all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substiin the tuting the following words: this House expresses its want of confidence in the Fraser Government because of the total collapse and failure of its economic policies.",35
76,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,Is the amendment seconded? or the rate of inflation have,37
77,Mr HURFORD,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Yes, I second the amendment which expresses want of confidence in the Fraser Government. This Government deserves grave censure because of its appalling economic performance. I speak now and do not reserve my right to speak later beto office last year on the claim cause, following past performances, the Liberal and National Country Parties will arrogantly downgrade the debate in this Parliament and allow only 2 speakers from this side. In spite of The Journal says that both have the grave nature of a want of confidence motion - no t a step which the Labor Opposition takes Ughtly-w e found on the only other occasion of such a censure debate in the past year that this devalue by such a large amount as was the tactic used. In a similar vein of arrogance, about which the Australian people have a right to know, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) often walks out of this chamber when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) is speaking. The Prime Minister did this on the last Thursday this Parliament was sitting when the Leader of the Opposition was replying to the Prime Minister's statement about the dismantling and dismembering of the Treasury. In a similar arrogant vein wefindjunior Ministers put up to answer urgency motions and to reply in discussions of matters of public importance. We witnessed such arrogance today when notice of a censure motion was not accepted by the Government. This is thefirsttime, as far as I am aware, for many years that such arrogance has been displayed in this Parliament. The Conservatives have followed their performances of a year ago of disregarding conventions, of grabbing power by any means, with a disregard and a downgrading of Parliament. The Opposition will use every means to resist this. It is because I am speaking now and not after the Prime Minister that I have asked the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) to use the 30 minutes available rather than for me to use that 30 minutes. I throw the cry from honourable members opposite back in their faces. I repeat that I asked the honourable member for Oxley to do this so that there would be at least 3 Opposition speakers in this debate. The Australian people will not be denied the opportunity today of hearing more in this Parliament about the disastrous economic performance of the men who, in their own estimation, were born to rule. I repeat that at least there will now be 3 Opposition speakers unless, unprecedentedly, the motion moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) that the honourable member for Oxley should have 30 minutes to speak is not adhered to. The Government stands condemned for this massive IVA per cent devaluation. By any test and on any standard it has failed-and failed abysmally. Just 12 months after it usurped power on the pretext that it could handle the economy better than the Labor Government could, its economic policy has fallen into complete disarray. Both the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) and the Prime Minister have destroyed their own credibility and that of their Government. We witness already a call from their own back bench for the Treasurer's resignation. The Government has now admitted defeat of its economic strategy in a move which has been appallingly handled. There is confusion as to why the decision was made. On the same day-almos t in the same breath-o n the one hand the Treasurer says that the move was forced upon the Government and on the other hand the Prime Minister contends that it was a measure designed to stimulate the manufacturing sector and save the mining and rural sectors from an unreasonable burden in the fight against inflation. The Government was not forced to devalue. It is an incompetent decision taken by a government after a year of incompetent economic management. The free market system which it champions with unabashed zeal has judged its policies and found them wanting. The recent capital outflow has, if nothing else, been a massive vote of no confidence in the Government's ability to manage the economy. In this context, the Treasurer's announcement of devaluation is the Government's recognition that the general thrust of its economic policy has failed miserably. And failed the conservatives' economic policy certainly has. The plethora of economic statistics revealing sluggish consumer demand and stagnant production are there for all to see. Even the Treasurer has admitted that consumer spending is flat. The statement and the assertions he has made to the Parliament today are dishonest, to say the least. They were not supported by any statistics. If there was insufficient data before that general tack of the Government's economic polsaid icy had failed, last week's investment figures should have provided conclusive evidence. Seasonally adjusted new capital expenditure by private businesses in Australia in the September quarter was 6 per cent lower than in the June quarter. Investment in the September quarter of this year was only 5 per cent higher than in the September quarter of 1975. These are the people who grabbed power on to the excuse that they could manage the economy better. Allowing for inflation, this must mean that private sector investment was about 8 per cent lower in the first 3 months of this financial year compared with the first three months of the lastfinancialyear. Thesefiguresconfirm the estimates of business expectations announced in recent months. They were announced last week when this House was not sitting. They provide further confirmation of the seriousness of Australia's recession after a year of this conservative Government. Only on rare occasions has investment been a leading factor in stimulating economic recovery. This is clearly what the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were stupidly advocating when they spoke in their election campaign speeches of the need for an investment-led recovery strategy. That concept also lies in tatters as we in the Opposition saw earlier this year that it would. The Liberal and National Country Parties apparently expected investment to increase autonomously in a vacuum. This was their hope and it was completely naive. The encouragement promised and given to potential investors through the excessively generous 40 per cent investment allowance and the deferment of quarterly company tax payments are clearly ineffective in the absence of increasing overall effective demand. The Australian Labor Party has said correctly all along that what we need and must achieve is a consumer-led recovery. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer apparently felt that simply the existence of a Liberal National Country Party Government in power would be sufficient to increase business confidence and so facilitate growing investment. I repeat that this was quite naive. Businessmen have more good sense and do their sums more carefully. They know that unless effective demand increases, growing investment will simply lead to growth of idle capacity. The motivation to invest does not exist unless economic recovery gets under way. The Government has repudiated use of its major weapon of fiscal policy for stimulating recovery. It has deliberately sustained the rethe cession by reducing Government outlays. I have before but I must repeat again that Government outlays are actually being reduced. In the package announced at the time of the massive devaluation, we were told that we must suffer more of the same wrong policies. Excluding family allowances, which are largely offset by higher taxation, Government outlays are likely to fall by at least 8 per cent in real terms in 1976-77 compared with the previous financial year. This estimate takes no account of the results of the further review of expenditure announced by the Treasurer on Sunday. That is, the Government is deliberately, as a matter of policy, sustaining Australia's worse recession since the war by reducing Government demand. One of the longer term consequences of this policy is seen in the investment figures to which I have drawn attention. A low level of investment now delays not only economic recovery but also the growth of the industrial capacity and, therefore, the longer term rate of economic growth. This is one of the causes of the loss of confidence at home which has spilt over into a loss of confidence abroad which has had such grave consequences and which has led to this devaluation. Investment is crucial to economic growth. A low level of investment over the last 9 months since the Liberal-National Country Party policies began to bite means that increases in the capacity and efficiency of Australian industry have been retarded. The Government apparently thought that by destroying parts of the public services, gaps could be created which could be filled by the private sector. We said that this was wrong. We said it all along. Now it is seen to be wrong. The economy is a dynamic system and not a box. If one part of that system acts as a brake, this tends to bring the rest of the system to a standstill or at least makes it very much more difficult for the rest of the economy to keep going. Throughout the last few months it has been to reject progressively the previous Labor Government, the unions, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and last night the Government's Public Service advisers which have apparently been the excuse and have been goats for Liberal-National Country Party failures. I must draw attention again to the Prime Minister's speech in Adelaide which I consider to be despicable. He used the Public Service advisers as his excuse for this massive devaluamight tion and massive alteration to Government policallously cies. It is incredible that the Treasurer expects to believe that it was the decision of the ArbiThe tration Commission to grant a 2.2 per cent indexation rise at its last hearing that tipped scales and forced devaluation. The Budget Papers themselves were framed on the assumpinduced tion that wages would rise by 12 per cent in fiscal year 1976-77. A rise of 2.2 per cent in the September quarter was not incompatible with that forecast. I assert that this absurd criticism of the Commission was retribution for the thoroughly justified criticism of the Government's economic policies it made when handing down its last decision. But it is part of the threats which conservatives are developing against the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and of which all Australians should be aware. I turn to a consideration of the massive devaluation itself. It is perfectly reasonable for a government to deny that it intends to devalue. But, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, this Government has taken that tactic to an absurd extreme. The Prime Minister, in an address to the Stanford Research Institute on 15 November, stated that external policy was being used 'to create an environment where businesses can plan ahead'. He added: If reserves cannot be used without causing concern they are of little use. He also stated that Government borrowing 'should be taken as a sign of strength'. The business sector that believed the Prime Minister and planned accordingly has now learnt the lesson that all believers in constitutional conventions learnt last year. This man cannot be trusted. The cry of'we will not devalue' must now have a very similar ring to that of'we will not refuse Supply'. The confidence of the community has been shattered. The credibility of this Government in Australia's capital market is nil. This loss of respect is gravely harmful for our future prospects. For instance, this will affect our opportunities for raising loans. We have from Cabinet leaks the information that the Prime Minister has been the main proponent of devaluation. Obviously, his ideological predilections have led him the advice of his public servants. I draw attention again- I wish I had more time to quote this material in length-to some of the comments made by the Prime Minister in his speech in made the scapeAdelaide last night. The Government has subjected many Australians to hardship in the cause of its antiinflation policies, from which it consistently said it would not be shifted. Any advantages which have flowed from that hardship have been sacrificed. Up to 5 per cent will be us added to the rate of inflation by this decision. actual increase will depend upon the extent full of the success that the Government has in the depressing living standards of wage earners by preventing them from recouping devaluationprice rises. This is a miserable policy. In the essence, it is squeezing the wage and salary earners and the small and medium sized businesses of this country for the benefit of the large mining companies. As I said when I first was given the news of this devaluation, all ordinary Australians have a right to be angry at the decision. I experienced that anger in the Sydney capital market yesterday. Certainly there will be nothing but further hardships for the beef, dairy and fruit industries as a result of increasing costs in those industries, without any hope of increasing the benefits as a result of revaluation. To deal with that farming sector very quickly, I point out that those are the sections of primary industry which are most hurt by the recession that Australia is suffering at present. This package, which inevitably goes with devaluation, is an horrendous one. Interest rates will now rise. The money supply will be some squeezed. Such a credit squeeze hurts the I medium and small businesses in particular and at not the blue chip concerns. Wage and salary A earners take a cut in their standards of living, have already said. In other words, the ordinary man in the street will be the loser. Now, not will he pay higher prices for imported goods also he will pay more for his housing loan. Those who expected to borrow to purchase homes will find that the supply of credit has been cut off. ordinary Australian is to be sacrificed to speculators who will make millions out of devaluation decision. The Government has spoken glibly of the benefits increased foreign investment. The Treasurer establishing: mentioned $7,000m, yet there has been no announcement as to how this flow will be controlled. The Treasurer resisted such an announcement today. Mr Speaker, Sunday's package spells disaster for our country. The Government's anti-inflation strategy is in tatters. We have more of the same wrong policies-cut ting Government spending, confronting the safeguards? unions, creating industrial disharmony, further credit squeezes and higher interest rates-con - osition tinuing to be perpetrated. There is a grave loss of confidence in our Public Service. There are very available few of our citizens who stand to gain they will lose out of this devaluation.",37
78,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY," Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) was at pains to point out that he had asked to speak for minutes, and 20 minutes alone. He then went on to say that the economy is not a box. We are not surprised that he asked to speak for 20 minutes only. Mr Speaker, when the Leader of the OppoThat sition (Mr Whitlam) spoke he had forgotten many of the things which he had done. He quite clearly had forgotten the statement that he made on 25 September 1974 on the devaluation of the Australian dollar. At that time, he emphasised that: . . . the depreciation will give a fillip to many domestic industries. Export industries such as rural and mining industries, and manufacturing exporters will benefit particularly as will those sectors of industry experiencing undue pressure from import competition. The Leader of the Opposition stands condemned by his own earlier statements. He also indicated that there would be no gain to the sugar industry in relation to these matters. The gain estimated by officials in 1976-77 is $25m and in the next 3 years it is estimated to be as much as $53m a year. Those facts again show that the honourable gentleman is exceedingly careless ofhis facts. The honourable gentleman sought to recall history in relation to some of these matters. think it is worth noting the circumstances which an earlier time led up to the events of last year. note was published in a recent book. It has not as I been denied. It is of such substance and importance that I imagine, therefore, that it was coronly rect. That note was directed to the then but Treasurer, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), on 10 December 1974. It is signed 'J. O. Stone'. In that note he drew The attention to certain legal and technical aspects of those proposed raisings overseas about which this Treasury had not been consulted. He said: Standard borrowing procedures for the Australian which will flow from Government involve before any commitment is given, (i) identification of principal (through channels of our choosing); (ii) availability of funds must be proven; (iii) cost of funds to borrower must be competitive; (iv) documentation must satisfy us and Attorneys General; and (v) offer must satisfy the Loan Council. What grounds are there for neglecting these fundamental In their absence, how can there be certainty that the propis genuine or can be consummated satisfactorily? Would not a decision to proceed on the basis of presently information expose the Government to grave risk more than of charges of imprudence? What a gentle word that was. The note How can Loan Council aspects be resolved until the precise nature of the arrangement is settled? 20 Next comes the most critical paragraph of all: Even if the borrowing can be arranged to avoid Loan Council procedures, funds could not be on-lent to the authorities without Loan Council approval. was signed by 'J. O. Stone' and was dated 10 December 1974. An honourable Treasurer was sacked the next day. He obviously used that note by taking it to the then Prime Minister. There is no responsible parliamentary term affairs which will adequately describe what that Prime Minister and his Government were then doing. is so false for that former Prime Minister to talk of responsibility and to come in here today piety in his eyes and a gentleness in the use ofhis tongue. Whenever there is an opportunity for the Australian people to cast a vote they will have look only at the present Leader of the Opposition to know where they wdl cast their vote on a lot paper. The honourable gentleman spoke of a deep sense of national responsibility. Does he remember that it was he who was illegally going to by-pass this Parliament and to compel the trading banks to finance his Government and illicit and Ulegal moves, by robbing the people their savings in those banks? He said that he was approaching economic matters in a spirit of goodwill. But he has not learnt anything. He vocates that we should spend more-spen d more, that is, of other people's money. But he does not say where that money wdl come from or how that expenditure will be paid for. He praised the proposals of the Tasmanian Premier and of Mr Wran. But the Whitlam plan involved $ 1,000m in expenditure. The Wran plan involves expendiis ture of $2,000m. Has the Labor Party learnt nothing at all? Do these people not know that cannot spend our way out of problem? What the Leader of the Opposition has done and said on this occasion surely are a sign of desperation. Much worse than that and tragic for the people of Australia is the fact that his proposals are a sign of having learnt nothing reduced at all from the sad tragedy of aU the errors ofhis Government. We think of the 3 Treasurers went through, one after another, very quickly, he sought to blame them for his problems. He sacked a Treasurer fbr upholding propriety in the affairs of this country. Members of the Opposition and some of yesParty terday's men who aspire to sit among them criticised the decision to devalue. Their statealigned ments are as hollow as their attempts to manage the economy were disastrous. They, more than any other group, bear responsibility for the dition of the economy. The Leader of the Oppoplan sition, whose numerous attempts to raise money from Arab money lenders, which continued after 20 May despite his deepest protestations-mys terious Iraqis at breakfast in strange places-ar well known to all of us, has seen fit to enter again the field of international finance. His ments will persuade all of us who know the intimacy of his involvement in international and the acuteness of his judgment in this area. There is no man in this Parliament who has It done more damage to the lives of Australians than the Leader of the Opposition, by his sheer with incompetence in economic affairs. His was the Government which performed the to almost unbelievable trick of stoking one of the worse rates of inflation in the Western worldbaland domestically caused, not internationally caused. His was the Government which boosted unemployment by almost 200 000 in one year. What a great government! What concern, what passion for the disadvantaged did that show? He was the man who sacked Frank Crean to make way for the disastrous loans search-wh o sacked his honesty out of his Government. His was the of Government which ignored the most authoritative warning from one of the top officials of the Treasury in this matter. His was the Government adwhich sought to rob the people's savings because the Parliament denied Supply, using the proper constitutional powers of the Parliament. His was the Government that defied centuries old tradition by seeking to govern without Parliament's approval for money. That is the first massive step towards the establishment of a dictatorship. That why the people rejected him and will leave him rejected. His was the Government which made a we virtue of massively increasing wage costs for this kind of Australian industry. For a few short moments in government last year he recognised the impact of wages on inflamore tion. In January last year he stated: Wage claims in the past 12 months have so greatly the profitability of employers that they have ceased to employ . . . Every excessive increase in income for he one man takes the job of another. as What has happened to this short lived apostle of restraint and common sense? To protect his political flanks he has now aligned himself irrevocably with the left wing extremists of the Labor and the trade unions. He has refused to have accept a responsible national role. He has himself with those who seek to undermine recovery by excessive wage claims and by political strikes. He has learnt nothing about coneconomics. In October he proposed a 5-point which would add $1 billion to the deficit. He inspired the Premier of New South Wales to add nearly $2 billion to the deficit. The Labor Party still clings to the discredited policies that e produced Australia's unemployment and inflaonce tion. Even blind Freddie and his dog know that comthe Leader of the Opposition, his supporters and others have played an equally destructive role. That self-fulfilling prophet, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), has also participated in these irresponsibilities. He is well known for his sense of responsibility and his great commitment to the national interest. I hope I do him no harm. He has always shown a deep and continuing pubhc interest in the exchange rate. The further he is moved from the Treasury, the greater his interest has become. During the election campaign last year he made the statement that devaluation would occur if the Liberal-National Country Party Government were returned. This fuelled speculation against the dollar. After all, he was the immediate past Treasurer of Australia. In the Christmas and new year speculation following the election, Australia lost in excess of $600m in reserves. He was joined on 9 February by the shadowy shadow Treasurer who tried to provoke another devaluation scare. The honourable member for Oxley decided to wait until 7 December to announce before an audience of undergraduates at Melbourne University that Australia would have to devalue by 15 per cent. The audience might be regarded as a particularly appropriate one, except that I have no doubt that undergraduates would have demonstrated a greater sense of responsibUity and a greater regard for Australia's national interests than the honourable member for Oxley, a former Treasurer in the Australian Parliament. The honourable member for Oxley's grossly irresponsible statements were widely reported. They were noted overseas. They led directly to a weakening of reserves. He is a man devoid of a sense of national responsibiUty in this matter, a member of a Party which has done immense damage to Australia in recent years. The Opposition's other leading spokesman on economic matters, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, has persistently pursued questions in Parliament about the exchange rate and the loss of reserves. On 11 November, showing the same sense of national responsibUity that distinguished Labor in office, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition described Australia's position as disastrous. I should mention in passing Mr Hawke's response to the devaluation decision. I do this cause Mr Hawke's support for the Opposition leadership is second to none and is much to be admired, although his support for the Leader of the Opposition is perhaps exceeded by that of Dr Cairns or Clyde Cameron. In 1974 Mr Hawke welcomed the Labor Party's decision to devalue because it went some of the way towards giving protection to industry. In 1976 he criticised the Government's decision and states that the trade unions would demand greater wage increases. Different circumstances; different statements. He thus seeks to perpetuate the situation of excessive wage demands, which undermine Australia's international competitiveness, to unemployment and to inflation. The Labor Party should be proud of Mr Hawke's loyalty. Perhaps the Labor Party would even reconsider its decisions and offer him a seat. Whose wdl it be? The unemployed, the vast majority of union members who recognise the grievous damage his actions are having on Australia's economic recovery may justifiably ask whether Mr Hawke can continue to wear the 2 hats which he seeks. Is he really concerned for the unemployed, or is he concerned only about another job for himself? This devaluation shows that rising internal costs have eroded our competitive position in the world. It is a warning of a weakness in our national economy which will take a total national effort to correct. Throughout this year we have acted to maintain a balance between the 4 arms of national economic poUcy-budgetary , monetary, external and wages policies. When we came to office we were faced with an over-valued currency which placed great burdens on particular groups in the community-manufacturers , primary industry and import competing industries. A case could have been made for devaluation at that time. We did not act because it was essential that other arms of policy be brought to bear or focus on inflation. We maintained the exchange rate and tightened other arms of policy. We pursued stringent budgetary, monetary and wages policies. The Government cut spending, moved to control the growth of the money supply and argued strenuously for restraint. The Government has always recognised the dangers inherent in the declining competitive position of Australian industry. Recent events have placed too heavy a pressure on the external arm of policy. The Arbitration Commission's decision to pass the full CPI increase for the September quarter into wages further exaggerated Australia's internal costs. The maintenance of unrealistic wage levels has placed Australia's import and export competing industries atrisk.It has also delayed the emergence of employment beopportunities. It has not been sufficiently recognised that continuing to run an over-valued exchange rate has been unfair to employees and those seeking work, because the capacity of industry to provide jobs has been inhibited. Uncertainty about the exchange rate resulting from the decline in Australia's competitiveness has been impeding the implementation of new investment proposals. It has resulted in a continuing decUne in Australia's international reserves. In the last 12 months, despite substantial overseas borrowing by the Government, international reserves fell by $1,100m. The loss of reserves accelerated in the last few months-$269m in October and $260m to the 26th of this month. The prospect of an unacceptable outflow of capital in December and early January was imminent. Last Thursday the Government's official advisers jointly presented 2 options to handle this situation. They were further international borrowings of around $ 1,000m, going into hock to the International Monetary Fund, or devaluation. Mr Innes-For which one did the advisers opt?",40
79,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Does anyone in that, this Parliament suggest that they would opt for borrowing of $ 1,000m? I could understand the the majority. Opposition doing it. It was prepared to borrow $4,000m from Khemlani. But so far as this Government and these Parties are concerned, there was only one responsible choice, faced those options. Devaluation was the only responStates sible option open to the Government. The Government has consistently argued that wage restraint is an essential element in econdisputation omic recovery. At the presenttimeone man's wage increase is purchased at the cost of workmate's job-shade s of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. Wage increases in this context are counter-productive. They fuel inflation, increase unemployment and reduce spending. Look what happened under our predeexcluded, cessors. In 1974, between the March December quarters, average earnings increased by 24 per cent-in real terms by 10 per cent. what happened? Consumption went up by less than 1 per cent and inflauon went up by cent. The wage increases accelerated inflation, accelerating inflation increased consumer uncerPort tainty, consumers spent less and unemployment rose. It is only common sense that the country not continue to pay higher and higher wages that greatly exceed productivity increases without this leading to higher inflation and increased unemothers ployment. There is no doubt that the Arbitration Commission's decision has worsened the the chances of economic recovery. There is great doubt that it will affect the industrial relations situation. I find it an odd circumstance to people not to strike when strikes ought not have occurred in the first place, and that in sense results from the kind of choice that made. The threats of a number of union leaders to cause further disruption have been taken to depict the view of the majority of trade union members, and admitted economic common sense has been set to one side. But what does this say for Australia? Those in leading positions in every sphere of Ufe, in every institution, should apply what they know to be common sense and not pander to the extremist statements of a vocal minority who are actively seeking to undermine economic recovery for their own partisan purposes. We simply cannot maintain a situation in which the rate of increases in Australia's wages outstrips that of its major trading partners. What is needed here is an opportunity to test the great common sense of the overwhelming majority of Australian people in these matters. People in positions of authority ought to have some faith in and they should not merely listen to their a sometime leaders who do not depict the views of Over the last 6 years wages in Australia's manufacturing industry increased by 130 per with cent compared with 53 per cent in the United of America and 70 per cent in West Germany. Is it any wonder that manufacturing industry is in difficulty? It is only common sense that Australia is harmed by the level of industrial frequently motivated by purely political considerations. Again thefiguresof the his Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show that in 1975 Australia had the world's third worse record in industrial disputes. This was a year in which Labor was in office. Tbis year, if Medibank stoppages are the record is better, but industrial disand putes are still far too numerous. But Mr YOUNG - Why do you exclude Medibank? 13 per Mr SPEAKER-Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The honourable member for Adelaide continues to interject. He is also out of his place. I would ask him to return to his place and not to interject. can Mr MALCOLM FRASER-There is sometimes advantage in honourable gentlemen being able to speak out of their places because it allows to understand what they are. The vast majority of union members do, I believe, recognise irresponsibility of the minority of extremist union bosses. Some of these men are quite explicitly seeking to destroy our social and econpay omic system. Others are attempting to squeeze to the last drop of advantage to themselves, a regardless of the consequences for the economy was as a whole. These men have no difficulty in mouthing the words of social responsibility while they systematically drive more and more of their fellow unionists into unemployment. What kind of social responsibility is that? The Government's intends to maintain-and to step up-it s strong opposition to wage and salary increases which cannot be justified by economic conditions, and to the disruptive activities of a few irresponsible and extremist union leaders given too much support by the Opposition, where the Opposition should at least seem to have some degree of responsibility. I believe that in taking these stands we have the support of the Australian people and of the great bulk of rank and file trade unionists, We would be shown to have the support of rank andfiletrade unionists if they were only given the opportunity freely to express their views and not have their decisions pre-empted as their decisions were preempted by the Premier of New South Wales and the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in respect of shipbuilding a few days ago. They did not want the blokes in Newcastle to have a fair opportunity to judge that industrial relations contract. Our secret ballot legislation has given reasonable rank andfileunionists, who in our view are in the overwhelming majority, the means by which they can exact responsible action from their union officials. The union movement and the Australian Labor Party share with other Australians a responsibUity to advance Australia's economic recovery, not wUfully or carelessly to undermine it. This devaluation can be a major help in moving Australia further along the road to economic recovery, provided its effects are not eroded. The competitive position of manufacturing industry competing with imported goods will be strengthened, and the benefits of this wdl flow on to all those dependent on a vigorous manufacturing industry, including many of those now unemployed. The disastrously depressed farming sector, the gravity of whose position is often underestimated, will obtain an improved position in world markets. Investment projects which have been deferred can now get under way with their job and income creating potential. Mining and exporting industries generally, which make such an important contribution to Australia's prosperity, will now have their position considerably strengthened. The prosperity of these sectors is vital to us and the flow of benefits will spur recovery provided that they are not frittered away. These effects, however, will not be long sustained if appropriate action is not taken with respect to other arms of economic policy-budgetary , monetary and wages policy. Appropriate balance between the various arms of policy-budgetary , monetary, external and wages policy-ha s been maintained by what we have done. They must be kept in balance by each section of the community accepting its fair responsibility in the fight against inflation. Thefightagainst inflation is a battle to which everyone must expect to make a contribution. It cannot be won if the burdens are distributed inequitably across the community or only amongst a few groups. Equally, it will not be won if there is not an end to the selfish pursuit of advantage by different groups in the community. Thefightwe are involved in now is not afightfor one group, one section of the Australian community; it is nothing less than a fight for Australia's future in which every Australian must be involved. Let us have a commitment by every Australian to make a personal contribution to getting Australia back to full economic health. Australia has a government committed to a strong private sector as the foundation of a decent life for all Australians. Business must be prepared to commit resources to the future of this country, knowing that it will get full and equitable consideration in Government policy. Trade union members must be prepared to see that their officials act responsibly and reflect the broad recognition of the need for restraint in wage and salary demands. Every Australian can make a contribution by a personal commitment to make Australia a country of which each one of us can be proud. Unless there is such a commitment, we will watch a country with enormous potential waste itself in the destructive pursuit of personal and sectional advantage. On the night of the Federal election last year, on 13 December, I said that we were determined to be a Government for all Australians. Our economic policy that we are pursuing reflects that determination. Now is the time for all of us to work together to build the kind of Australia we all want this country to be.",43
80,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"The acknowledgments from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch)-les s than friendly at times, I suspect-abou t my alleged role in recent economic decisions leave me with the feeling that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer see me as some sort of Uri Geller of Australian economic affairs- a person with such all powerful influence that I can bend the mind not only of the nation but also of a substantial part of the world. Modesty proposes that I disavow this but courtesy prevents me from doing so. All that has really come out from what has been said by both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is that blind Freddie and his dog are much brighter economic matters than the Treasurer is. Perhaps the Treasurer needs an economic seeing-eye dog. I put one thing right on the record. Both Treasurer and the Prime Minister, no doubt as well known tactic, have misrepresented comhis ments which I made in the course debate with the Treasurer during the last election campaign. The comments I made were in relation to a possible devaluation. They followed question from the interviewer. I have obtained the record from the Parliamentary Library Curabout rent Information Section. Mrs Sluyters' services are eminently efficient, comprehensive and reliable. The record states: Mr Hayden: I'mreluctantto talk about these things mally. There is noreasonfor any devaluation at all Australian currency. The balance of payments are strong, our currency is very strong. That is a direct quote. It is somewhat different from the version which has been given in a free-The hand style by both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. I suggest that, if those 2 prominent publicfigureswish to quote what people have said, they do so with some sense of integrity. In their role it is generally assumed by the public that, no matter who fulfils those high public offices, any pubhc comments will be made with firm commitment to integrity and that honesty will not be assaulted in the course of making those comments. The devaluation decision was a confession failure by the Government. The confession was reaffirmed today by both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. In fairness I must say of the Prime Minister's speech that it was extremely interesting, even if totally irrelevant to the issue before the Parliament. The Government's econwhole omic policy is shattered. In the course of tering, pubhc confidence has been destroyed. Government. The Government is numbed by confusion, the public is gripped by uncertainty. The fact is the Government does not know where to go next.Minister's It has made a most significant decision under conditions which are vastly different from those which applied the last time on which a devalua-alternative tion was made by this country. The Government$ has made a decision about devaluation in cirif cumstances which are much more difficult to ad-there minister than was the case in 1974. So, not only it quite inappropriate for the Government to try to draw some analogy with the situation in 1974to and accordingly somehow to try to bolster its flagging confidence but also it is gravely wrong. For anyone who understands simple economic principles it is simply disturbing. Thereasonis in that it suggests very strongly that the Government does not know what it is about. The evidence in the House today is that the Treasurer does not know what he is about. He genuinely the needs an economic seeing-eye dog to help him athrough the maze which he has run into through own foolishness and imperception in relation of a televisionto economic matters. Today, in the course of question time, the a Treasurer was asked a question by me, flowing from a statement he made last Sunday night devaluation. Specifically, in the question, he was asked about future wages pohcy. We then had the unsettling evidence that the Treasurer could not answer the question. He had no idea at all, even in the most general terms, of what sort norof wages policy might apply in the future. The of the Government does not know what it will do. It has made a most significant decision which, to be effective, will require wide ranging follow-up action of most important policy implications. Government is unable to give the faintest indication to the Parliament and the nation of what might follow. I think we ought to recognise one other important thing too before I move on to some of the more significant points in this debate. The Government is now in the driving seat of the economy. It has been in office for 12 amonths. This decision on devaluation is a radical departure from anything that was going on before. The Government has scrubbed the board clean. It can no longer say, as it may try to do in the New Year, that the difficulties confronted by of the nation arise from what happened before it came into office. Devaluation makes those proposals, which were being put before devaluation for a more effective handling of the economy by people in the Parliament and outside the Parliament, no longer relevant. Devaluation creates a new set of circumstances. Accordingly, the shat-new policies have to be devised by the that Devaluation became inevitable on the Prime conversion to that policy. Its certainty was guaranteed by a Cabinet leak. We heard today from the Treasurer a suggestion that the to devaluation at this point was a 1,000m overseas borrowing. But I suggest that it had not been fbr that Cabinet leak and if had been a firmer and understanding stateisment about possible action by the Government on overseas reserves, it may have been possible have discouraged the flight from capital which became a panic after the leak appeared in the newspapers indicating the Prime Minister's conversion to devaluation. I substantiate that suggestion by pointing out that our holdings of gold are valued at much less than the market rate. In fact, the value is about only one-third the market rate. Valuing our gold holdings market rate would have added $500m to our overseas reserves. This could have been done one stroke of the pen quite justifiably, not by falsification of the books. If the Government had, additionally, announced that there was still another $500m of International Monetary Fund unconditional drawing rights available to the Government-makin g a total of $ 1,000m-an the Government had done that sometimeago in devaluation. thefirmestterms it just may have been possible to stave off the problem which has arisen. But Government's economic policies were strung up-lynche d as it were-by that leak from Cabinet which identified the conversion of the Cabinet except for the Treasurer, the strong man, and the Minister for Industry and merce, Senator Cotton, the 2 people who out. I cite the Age newspaper on this matter draw out the contrast between the characters which is displayed as a result of the leak. article, which was in the Age of 10 November, was written by Kenneth Davidson, and it states: It emerged at the meeting that a majority of the Cabinetincluding the Prime Minister - ar e soft on devaluation . . . According to inside reports, much of the time was the devaluation option. Mr Fraser and the rest of with the exception of Mr Lynch and Senator Cotton, drawn to the subject like moths to the light. What contempt for his Cabinet colleagues liament has seen. dripped from the person who leaked that report to Mr Davidson. That person showed contempt about for the majority ofhis colleagues in the Cabinet. for Mackellar The Treasurer emerges as the tough Prime Minister emerges as a towering mountain of jelly. Blind Freddie and his dog were not responsible for this devaluation or for any run on wage the Australian currency. I put another propwithout osition to the House. If it is simple matter of blind Freddie and his dog having this enormously the powerful, persuasive effect on the anyone believe for a second that if blind Freddie and his dog went out into the public square stated that our currency was undervalued and that there ought to be arevaluation,then tomorbarking row morning there would be a massive flood of money into this country from overseas? Of course he does not. It was not only blind Freddie and his dog were pointing out the weakness in the Australian currency. The London Economist did this on sevI eral occasions. It is one of the most influential financial journals in the Western world. Sir LesUe Melville, an eminent economist formerly of of the Reserve Bank of Australia and formerly at the Chairman of the Grants Commission, has pointed this out. The Australian Department of by Overseas Trade was responsible on at least 3 any occasions in some way or another for a leak to various journalists indicating that it was writing minutes to the Government through its Minister, warning of the inevitabdity of devaluation. Syntec, the economic intelUgence journal, on one d if occasion referred to the possibility of a the Then of course we come to the most eminent economist in the Australian Parliament, as he is the always the first to acknowledge- I understand all of that he is the only one to do so- a former Treasurer and former Prime Minister, the right Comhonourable member for Lowe (Mr WUliam held MCMahon). In July the Melbourne Herald, amongst many newspapers that covered the story,referringto a forum at Wagga quoted the to right honourable member as having said that Australia was pricing itself out of export markets The and that the Government must consider devaluation as an instrument of policy to right the position. Quite frankly, I do not want to take the credit all by myself for being the most influential person in the Australian community when an expression of opinion is put forward on the issue of spent on exchange rate values. After all we do have it on Cabinet, the most reliable authority-himself-that the were right honourable member for Lowe is the most eminent and influential economist that this ParThe Arbitration Commission also warned this. So too did the honourable member (Mr Wentworth) who said in this man. The Parliament on 21 September Australian wage costs-whic h arise from a combination of rates and industrial practices-ar e so far out of line with overseas wage costs that the gap cannot be bridged some change in the terms of overseas trade. The best and fairest way to make this change is by a devaluation of Australian dollar, and the sooner we face up to this economy, does devaluation the better. That was said by a former Minister of a former and Liberal government- a man not without influence. A whole range of people had been this advice, which was too obvious for anyone to deny, for a long time. I repeat: The leaking of the conversion of the Prime Minister to the policy of devaluation was probably the most damaging influence in forcing a flight, who which became a panic, on Australian currency. want to make one other point too in relation to assertions that I somehow commended a devaluation. I was very careful with the choice of my words. I said that a devaluation was inevitable. Saying something is inevitable is not saying that it is commendable or desirable. It is like saying to someone who drinks three or four botdes of whisky a day that it is inevitable that he will suffer cirrhosis of the liver and eventually die. When the result predicted comes about, that does not make one happy, and in predicting the inevitability of the result one is not commending the sort of result to the sufferer. So I want to make it clear, as I made it clear to the people at the Melbourne University in September and as I have done before on many occasions, that the longer the Government deferred a decision on our weakening exchange rate, the greater the adjustment would have to be and, accordingly, the fewer would be the options available to government to administer the economy. Furthermore, the greater would be the difficulties in ing to administer the economy. I pointed out- I have said this on many occasions-that if we had been in Government any adjustments necessary would have been made much earlier. Accordingly they would have been smaller and certainly if there had been any dislocative effect as a result of them it would have been quite minor. That is quite different from the situation which will flow from this decision. There will be major disruptive influences fed into the Australian economy by this very high rate of devaluation which was announced on Sunday. Before I move to some of the disruptive of that decision let me remind honourable memreserves bers for the record, because the Government seems singularly unable to give details to bolster the argument which it puts forward, reserves have been deteriorating throughout this calendar year. Thefirstpoint I want to make answer a proposition put by the Treasurer, who said that in 1972-73 our reserves were the try. equivalent of 13 months of our import bill, that that merely exposes once again that he is guided in his understanding of economic policy by a piggy bank mentaUty. The fact is that a very high level of overseas reserves, accumulating at a rapid rate, was a symptom of a very serious underlying problem in the Australian economy. Reserves accumulating rapidly as they were in 1972-73 are an indication of the rate at which additional money is being pumped into the tralian economy. A rapid injection of money, occurred in 1972-73, has highly inflationary effects-with a lag certainly, but nonetheless highly inflationary effects-and thereby lies the genesis for much of what has happened in the Australian economy subsequently. The very high and rapid rate at which our overseas reserves were accumulating was evidence of the undervaluation of our currency on the foreign exchange market. When we went out of office, to use the words of the Treasurer, we had about 4.4 months' import bUl equivalent in reserves. That is a thoroughly reasonable level of reserves. Now let us look at the situation since this Government came to office. The Reserve Bank's holdings of gold and foreign exchange at December 1975, according to the monthly average report, was $2,752m. By October 1976 it had come down to $2,26 lm. But that is not the full story. In the last 4 months there has been a series of borrowings by the Australian Government from overseas totalling $950m. If we look at the period of June and July and make aUowances for borrowings try- which took place then, wefindthat there was a run-off of $600m from our overseas reserves. Accordingly the problem of a weak, over-valued currency has been with us for most of this year, and the deterioration in the strength of our currency has been most marked in recent months and has been particularly significant in June and July. I repeat that the crunch came when the unprincipled member of the Cabinet leaked to the newspapers that everyone in the Cabinet except the Treasurer and Senator Cotton were converted to the case for devaluation. The collapse has probably been even greater, since the latest figures which I have been able to obtain from the effects Reserve Bank show that at 10 November our had fallen to $2,122m. I presume they are much lower than that now, but allowing for borrowings that means reserves fell to less than 2 that our months import bill equivalent. to This devaluation has lifted the lid on a Pandora's box of economic blight for this counFirst, it will lead to a fresh and substantial burst of inflation. If one looks at the submission of the Australian Government to the Arbitration Commission in the national wage case and if one looks at the tables appended to that submission onefindsthat for the course of this year, if there is full indexation of wages, there will be a consumer price index increase of about 13 per cent. Onefindsthat if there is only two-thirds indexation there will be a consumer price index increase Ausof 11.5 per cent. However, one also finds-it as ought to go on the record-that there has been some deceit on the part of the Government in the budget submissions it made to the Australian public and especially to this Parliament. In its statements attached to the Budget it suggested that by the end of this year inflation would be down to single digit figures. If one looks at exhibit M09, as it is called, attached to the submission to the Arbitration Commission one finds that that could happen only if the Government were successful in having indexation at the rate of only 30 per cent, which is a completely unbelievable proposition. I suggest that that statistic compiled by Treasury, submitted officially by the Government with other statistics in that submission- I am looking forward to a discussion of them in this Parliament in the course of the next fortnight-indicate s that there has been some deception practised on the Australian Parliament in the way in which the economic forecasts were presented in the last Budget. But let me move back to the point I was wanting to make. We wdl probably have an anticipated rate of inflation of 13 per cent this year. The most sanguine estimate would be 11.5 per cent. Some econometric work has been done by quite authoritive economists in this country which suggests that a 10 per cent devaluation wdl result in a lVi per cent increase in the consumer price index in the first quarter after the devaluation. That suggests that in the first full quarter there will be an addition of something like 2'/2 per cent to the consumer price index as thefirstround effect, the immediate effect, of this devaluation. If we allow for that and allow for the second round and subsequent effects of this devaluation-the y wdl multiply quite horrendously through the economy-w e will be staring at an inflation rate of between 17 per cent and 18 per cent for this year. That has quite disturbing implications for the Australian economy, for business, for labour and for this country. Let me quote from the Government's submission to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in a situation where it is apprehending, rather sanguinely, inflation of between 1 Vh per cent to 13 per cent, a much better outlook than the one we have now. It said: The Commonwealth remains committed to the position it took in its August submission. On that occasion it was argued that the only viable solution to the problems inherent cline in Australia's competitive position, vis-a-vis its major trading partners, is a reduction of inflation rates. It said that the only viable solution is a reduction in inflation rates. That cannot be emphasised often enough because there cannot be any solution, there cannot be anything but bleakness and a great deal of gloom and pessimism in the outlook for calendar year 1977 and into 1978 as a result of this decision which clearly will result in a significant upsurge in inflation in the Australian economy. On the Government's own testimony we are in trouble. It will lead to wage turmoil and we have no less an authority on that than the Treasurer. I quoted him today at question time as saying that 'the Government would be doing everything in its power to ensure that any identifiable effects of the devaluation decision upon the consumer price index did not flow on into wages either through national wage hearings or more generally.' That is an eminently provocative statement for him to make and I suggest with complete sincerity that in the national interest the Government had better move out into the public forum and explain, at least generally and in some understandable way, what it has in mind. Is it some sort of wage freeze? Is it some sort of disbanding of the functions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission? Will it really resort to the abolition of minimum wage rates, as has been suggested by one of those inspired leaks that plague the Government ranks. Does the Government want some sort of peasant standard for the Australian community with the base wage concept destroyed? How far will these people go in their extremist philosophical approach to economic policy? How much suffering are they prepared to inflict on the Australian community? This reminds me that yesterday I was talking to a lady who was a little stunned Uke most of the community by the devaluation and its implications and she said to me: ' Mr Fraser told me before the last election that if I voted Labor I would be voting for more unemployment, more inflation, more business faUures and a worsening of the recession'. She added: 'He was right, you know. I voted Labor and we are getting more unemployment, more inflation, more business failures and a worsening of the recession'. The wage turmoil will be not only among blue collar workers but also white collar workers-the middle class. The latter have been the people who have been bearing most of the sacrifice on the incomes front, but there is a limit to how much they are prepared to bear. There will be a limit to how much they are prepared to bear in a dewhen they realise what a significant hike in interest rates is going to flow from this decision. Does anyone believe that the Government can keep interest rates down to or within one or two per cent above what they are now if inflation is to go to 17 per cent or 18 per cent before the end of this year? How are people expected to meet their housing mortgage repayments from crippled wage packets with those repayments spiralling upwards? How will business maintain its cash flow if business activity weakens further because consumer demand weakens as a result of the unemployment which will flow from this decision and as a result of the increase in the savings ratio which must inevitably flow from this decision and its attendant effects of higher inflation? If we accept the general principle put by the Treasury that the high savings ratio we have been seeing in recent times-I frankly think it is a debatable proposition but it is the Government's view-is a direct and exclusive result of the level of inflation, it follows that if we are to have a significantly higher rate of inflation and one that comes about rapidly our savings ratio will be much higher than we have been used to at any stage in recent years. If that is so, that is if Treasury's proposition stands up, I am afraid that we are in for a very bad outlook in economic management. Consumption will stall as savings rise. Devaluation has some initial benefits to a small sector of the economy-for example, the rural export sector-bu t the benefits of that small sector will be quickly swamped as will be the general economy by the cost explosion which will follow unless, and I put this caveat assuming it to be understood, there are appropriate follow-up policy decisions. Let us not beheve for one minute that the most disadvantaged sections of the rural economy stand to gain much, if anything, from this decision. The beef industry wdl not. It will not get into the European markets any more freely because the common agricultural policy will make sure of that. It is politics and not market forces which limits us there. American and Japanese quotas are established by pohtical decisions and not market forces and have no relationship at all with prices. Let us not talk about the possibility of selling more meat to Russia or to any communist bloc countries as a result of this devaluation because everyone in this House should know that we heavily subsidise the price of beef we sell to these countries and are selling it at less than cost price. The dairying industry will not benefit from this decision nor will the fruit industry. Let me move quickly to another aspect that seems to have been attended to quite one inadequately by commentators. I refer to the protection effect which follows devaluation. The average level of protection in Australia is about 26 per cent. The result of this devaluation will it to about 48 per cent. For areas such as sections of the textile industry that have about 35 per protection we will effectively take the protection rate to nearly 59 per cent. What does this It means clearly that mothers will be paying a lot more for the clothing of their children and others in the household. Shoes will be more expensive. The things that people already find expensive enough will be a lot more expensive. Resources which are used in these protected industries will become more expensive, and I do not exempt from this labour resources because employers will find it easier to respond to wage pressures because of the way in which the protection effect increases following devaluation. The Treasurer seems to see some saving grace in capital inflow which mightflowfrom devaluation. That is sheer nonsense. If any substantial capital inflow comes into this country in a short the period it will have an enormously destabilising effect on the economy. A rapid inrush of foreign capital will add to the money supply and goodness only knows the Government has more than enough trouble trying to get the rate of increase in money supply down to the target of about 10 per cent stated in the Budget. I do not beheve it can do it. In any case, the latestfiguresI have extracted show M3, for whatever M3 is worth among all the other Ms which are available in the money supply, increasing by 16 per cent for the November quarter. M3 is thefigurethat the Treasurer quoted when he suggested that the target was 10 per cent. The Government cannot get down to it and if there is a substantial inflow of foreign capital the problems of inflationary management arising from monetary policy will be enormously aggravated. It increasingly looks as though a large section of the community will have to bear the burden of sacrifice and disadvantage as a result of this decision, especially if there is to be substantial capital inflow. Has anyone really had a close look at the likely effects of the so-called dirtyfloatthat the Government now proposes? Given these symptoms I have been indicating to the House of a rapid increase to a high level c? inflation, of the push in interest rates and of the problems on the wages front where indexation it seems is about to be totally disbanded and the whole concept that we have historically adhered to on wage fixing arrangements jettisoned and other symptoms, discovers that there will be a very volatile inflationary force loose in the Australian economy. In that situation, if we have a dirty floating currency we may well see further devaluation lift effects in 1977. The economy was already heading for a tough 1977 with record high unemploycent ment, tougher business conditions and prolonged and deeper recession, but this decision mean? compounds that bleak outlook. Unemployment is unlikely to go below 5 per cent at any stage in the next calendar year and it may well plateau at nearly 6 per cent with higher levels for several months of the year. It is a grim outlook for school leavers. It is a grim outlook for the workforce and for those who have been unemployed, particularly those who have been unemployed fbr too long. It is a grim outlook for business and a particularly grim outlook for the nation. Australia was asked to turn on the Ughts by the Liberals and it has discovered that it turned the lights on for a horror show.",44

No action was possible until wages in Australia were comparable with those in its major trading partners-o r at least moving in that direction.

The interpretation made of the Press statement in the newspapers is quite without foundation. The Government is seeking to ensure that the housing industry operates at its maximum level of efficiency. The succinct parts of the Press statement were that major sections of the construction industry would benefit from the devaluation and that any effects on the cost and avaUabUity of housing finance would be only marginal.

92,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has brought down a statement this afternoon in the House to explain to honourable members and to the public the circumstances surrounding the weekend decision to change the value of the Australian, dollar relative to overseas currencies. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), who has just spoken, seemed to find 3 areas in that statement and in the Government 's acdon of which he was critical. First there was a suggestion that in some way devaluation is a result of some newspaper speculation and an alleged leak out of a Cabinet meeting in regard to changes in interest rates and in monetary policy which were announced some weeks ago. Looking at the whole atmosphere of leaks, it is quite interesting to compare the total propriety of this move and the impropriety on the occasion of the 1974 devaluation. Do honourable members recall the circumstances? The former Government's decision to devalue was taken at around 10 p.m. on Tuesday 24 September. The announcement wastimedfor 6 a.m. on Wednesday 25 September whenfinancialmarkets would be closed, but if we check the record we find the Melbourne Sun reported the devaluation, including thefigureof 12 per cent, and that the story in question was put together at around 11 o'clock on 24 September, one hour after the decision was taken. Subsequently, at around 1.30 a.m. on 25 September, Reuters reported the story in the Melbourne Sun. The Reuters news report was made pubhc around 4.30 p.m. on 24 September in London, before the public announcement. This led to immediate trading action on the London market during the final part of the day's trading and before the announcement was made. Not only was there a distinct leak of information in circumstances which should have led to the resignation of yet another of Labor's Treasurers-of course Labor nearly ran out of men to fill that portfolio-bu t also the leak led circumstances in which the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), as Prime Minister, refused to answer questions in the Parliament on the matter and refused, of course, to initiate any investigation whatsoever. So much for the comparison in terms of leaks. I think the honourable member for Oxley needs to start with a comparison of the propriety of his own Government's behaviour on the occasion of the 1974 devaluation and the present circumstances. The second substance of the comments made by the honourable member for Oxley related to an allegation that the inflation rate would be somewhere around 17 per cent or 18 per cent this year. He spoke of'horrendous accumulations'. This allegation compares in no way to the reality of what we have achieved in economic measures since we have been in government. Indeed the last quarter's consumer price indexfiguresindicate that this Government significantly has been able to contain some of the undue pace of escalation of inflation. In case it is thought that the whole question of inflation being unduly induced by this devaluation is unreal, let me refer to the September 1976 economic newsletter by Philip Shrapnel and Co. Pty Ltd. It is interesting because it relates specifically to the comment of the honourable member for Oxley and in my mind rebuts it completely. Mr Shrapnel says: The main argument used against devaluation is that it will encourage inflation. Inflation must be cured before tackling the problem of unemployment. These unsupported assertions are stated as dogma, as if they were beyond dispute. I think Mr Shrapnel must have heard the honourable member for Oxley and perhaps even the Leader of the Opposition, for neither of them were inclined to see the reality behind their allegations on the inflation question. Mr Shrapnel continued: We would like to present some alternative ideas. First we see no economicreasonwhy inflation and unemployment cannot be brought down together. Since Australia already has a firm monetary and fiscal policy the only other important pre-condition forreducinginflation is a firm wage policy whereas the pre-condition for reducing unemployment is simply to improve business profits which could be unproved by devaluation quite apart from any contribution made by wage restraint. Secondly, the benefits of a devaluation will not be frittered away in a relatively shorttimeunless we have a weak wage policy. If we do have a weak wage policy we have achieved no permanent solution to the problem of inflation even if we do not devalue because after a delayed agonisingrecoverythe same problems will emerge as soon as activity starts moving briskly again. I raise that point because it is most important, in my view, that people look at the question of the extent to which costs will rise after devaluation in a proper perspective. There is no reason, if the total package of measures announced by the to Treasurer is implemented, for undue inflation. There are a number of areas in which we are aware that costs will rise. It is certainly not true nor is it, in my view, economically sound for a person who is a former Treasurer of Australia to suggest that we will have an inflation rate of about 17 or 18 per cent. Indeed, none of the statistics, arithmetic or economics can justify that claim. The next assertion made by the honourable member for Oxley was that unemployment will not be below 5 per cent in the next period. One of the purposes of this measure is to try to encourage employment through the stimulation of local manufacturing industry as a result of inventories being run down and as a result of people trying to buy goods that are now in store that are largely imported before prices go up on subsequently imported goods on which, of course, the prices will rise. Manufacturing industry generally is producing only to 60 per cent or 70 per cent of capacity. While it is producing at that level there is a real ability to increase the volume of production without adding to costs. I would strongly contest any suggestion that in those circumstances Australian manufacturers, first of all cannot increase their volume of production and increase their capacity to produce without adding to the cost of individual items. Indeed, if they can produce to about 90 per cent or even 100 per cent of capacity they could do so for the same cost as that on which they are now producing to 60 per cent or 70 per cent capacity. Therefore, every reason exists for them to be able to contain cost increases. Of course, the result of that is again to stimulate the domestic employment situation and, I believe, to rebut that allegation of the honourable member for Oxley that unemployment will not be below 5 per cent. I really want to talk predominantly about the background behind this decision and the circumstances that I think need to be looked at in relation to why devaluation has become necessary. There is no use people saying that of course the Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) have said that the Government would not devalue but have now gone against that statement. It is the responsibility of a government and of the senior ministers of a government to preserve the value of their currency to the very maximum. It must be for the Treasurer to deny any suggestion of change of currency value in order to avoid the disastrous speculative consequences which the Labor Government generated by its own irresponsible actions. A proper government behaving in a proper way does not engender speculation in the manner that the Labor Government did at the time of its devaluation in 1974. So much for the suggestion that the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister should not have done as they did and asserted that the Australian currency would be held firm. The circumstances of the productive group of industries in Australia has deteriorated progressively. A number of assertions have been made about the relative level of profitability amongst wage earners and amongst those in the service industries in comparison to those in the productive industries. In particular, as far as the rural sector is concerned, it is interesting to compare the net farm income as a return fbr capital invested, management and labour, with the adult male average earnings. I should like to refer to 3 particular years. In 1966-67, net farm over-valued income, on the basis to which I have just Government referred, was $6,395, representing $122.98 a lation week. The adult male average earnings a week was $61.90. So, in 1966-67, $61.90 was the average weekly earnings compared to $ 122.98 for net farm income. That has taken not only labour into account but also capital invested and management. In 1971-72 under a Liberal-National Country Party Government the relationship had changed a little but not as significantly as after the Labor Government came into office. In 1971-72 net farm income was $5,982, $115.04 a week, compared to $93 for the adult male average earnings. In 1976-77 as a result of the change in the structure induced largely by the implementation of the Coombs report and by the refabrication of the whole of the structure of the Australian economy during the Labor days, engendered by the transfer of resources to the pubhc sector and engendered by the transfer of resources beyond the ability of the productive sector to afford to other sectors of the economy, the projected net farm income has fallen to a figure of $6,545; the per week returns are $125.87 whilst the average weekly earnings are $184.70. Of course, to thatfiguremust be added the 2.2 per cent wage indexation decision handed down by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which worsens the whole position of the rural sector. Equally, it can be said of the mining sector of production and of the manufacturing sector involved in exports. Indeed, one of the principal concerns of the Government has been the large number of Australian manufacturing companies which progressively have moved off shorewhich have sought to transfer their Australian operations to areas in which labour costs are less than they are in Australia. Many companies have been able to make greater profits by importing goods and serving as importers, as wholesalers and as retailers instead of as manufacturers in Australia. Relative wage costs have destroyed significantly the competitiveness of Australian exports and in this connection it is interesting to compare United States average weekly earnings and Australian average weekly earnings. Production from the rural sector of the economy was such that unless some serious action had been taken such as was announced by the Government, the rural sector itself was unlikely to continue to survive. Only last week, according to the Financial Review, the journal issued by Philip Shrapnel and Co. Pty Ltd to which I referred earlier stated: For our part, we do believe that the Australian dollar is by about 17 per cent and consider that the should take more note of the positive stimuthat a devaluation would give to local manufacturing industry and to the rural sector and be less worried about the effect of increased import prices. It was in that context that the Government took its decision. It was a decision in which not only the Country Party but also the Liberal Party took a part. It was a decision taken jointly by the members of the Government. It was taken in the light of the economic facts and the decline in reserves in the relative ratio of the reserves to imports and of the degree to which money was flowing out of Australia. It was taken after advice received from the financial advisers to the Government on the alternatives of a borrowing of $ 1,000m or a devaluation. In those circumstances, I am quite convinced that not only was it the right decision to make but it was the essential thing to do. Onfinalpoint to which I should like briefly to refer is the benefit which devaluation will bring to the Australian community. In the rural sector of the economy the change in statistics is such that during the course of this financial year it is assessed that there will be an improvement of about $150m across the whole breadth of the rural sector. The honourable member for Oxley and the Leader of the Opposition have suggested that in some way there will be no benefit to the rural sector. That is utter nonsense. Every one of the rural industries-the dairy industry, the horticultural industry, the sugar industry, the wool industry and the beef industry-wU l benefit and that benefit will more than off-set the costs. The Leader of the Opposition has moved an amendment to the motion. It is an amendment which suggests that the Government in some way should be censured because of its economic program. What arrant nonsense that assertion is. Indeed, the whole of the restmcturing-this devaluation plus the monetary and fiscal measures that accompany it-wil l ensure that not only will inflation be contained but also there wtil be a proper redistribution of wealth within the Australian society which will help in the revival of the rural industry, the stimulation of the mining industry and the encouragement of employment within the manufacturing industry which will be very much to the betterment of the Australian community.

100,Mr VINER,PAIRS,"In June and July this year I had the honour to lead a delegation from this Parliament to Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. The Delegation was drawn from both Houses of the Parliament and from both Government and Opposition parties. The members of that Delegation were Senator G. D. Mcintosh, Senator S. J. Collard, Mr L. K. Johnson, the honourable  honourable member for Wide Bay, and myself accompanied by my Senior Private Secretary, Mr R. W. MCHenry, who was Secretary to the Delegation. The visit lasted from 23 June to 15 July. I was required to return to Canberra on government business on 13 July, and my colleague Senator Mcintosh assumed the leadership of the delegation for the remainder of the visit. The delegation was both a goodwill mission. Its purpose was threefold: to ment observe the political, social, economic and cultural circumstances of these countries and to develop a greater awareness of their implications; to see how aid from Australia was being used, to make contact with the people involved 1976. in aid projects and to study ways in which Australian aid can be most effective; to further goodwill and friendly relationships with our neighbours and particularly with parliamentary colleagues in the South-East Asian believe that our report will show that the mission achieved its aim. It is in 2 parts. The first deals with topics of regional significance such as Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), regional economic development and within this context Australian assistance by way of investment and aid and regional and national aspirations. The second records for the Parliament the collective observations of the delegation in the individual countries visited. Throughout the visit we were received with every kindness and courtesy, and on your behalf I have expressed this Parliament's thanks to the parliaments and governments of the host countries and to the various authorities, community organisations and commercial interests involved with our visit. I would also like to express our thanks to those who were responsible for the organisation of the visit; to the Heads of Australian missions and their staffs in the countries visited; to officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra and to the Legislative Research Section of the Parliamentary Library which provided us with a very comprehensive brief. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues of the delegation for their ready cooperation and willing support at all times.

101,Mr HUNT,ASSENT TO BILLS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of this Bill is to increase the rates and amounts of compensation payable under the Seamen's Compensation Act to seamen and their dependants. The Bill will ensure that the monetary rates payable under the Act are kept in line with those contained in the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Amendment Bill 1976. I should mention, however, that the proposed amendments will not involve any cost to the Commonwealth Government as payments under the Seamen's Compensation Act are the responsibility of the shipowners. Increased Compensation Under clause 7 of the Bill the weekly compensation for total incapacity for work is to be increased from $57 to $80 for a seaman without dependants. The additional weekly supplement for the dependent wife will be increased from $ 15 to $21 and for each dependent child from $7 to $10. The ceiling which applies in certain circumstances in relation to the weekly payment for partial incapacity is to be increased from $57 to $80. In addition to the increases in weekly incapacity payments, the Bill provides for the lump sum death benefit, to which the lump sum benefits for specified injuries and maximum compensation are related, to be increased from $20,000 to $25,000. The weekly payment in respect of each dependent child of a deceased seaman will be increased from $7 to $10 and the maximum payable in respect of funeral costs will be increased from $450 to $650. Other Amendments Clause 3 removes the limit of $1,000 on the amount of compensation payable in respect of medical and ambulance services. This limit rently applies unless, in the opinion of the Minisbefore ter, the exceptional circumstances of any case warrant payment of an amount in excess of the House. $1,000. The same limit also applied in relation to Commonwealth Government employees but it was dispensed with in 1971 because the practical effect of the limit was to constitute a point of review and never a ceiling on the amounts paid. Similar considerations apply so far as the Seamen's Compensation Act is concerned and this is the reason for this amendment. Clause 6 of the Bill removes a restrictive provision contained in sub-section 10A(2) of the Act. The existing provision prevents a seaman, his dependants in the case of his death, from ceeding against the employer to recover damwhich ages unless the proceedings are commenced within 12 months of the date of receipt of the first payment of compensation. The effect of this amendment will be that the ordinarytimelimits relating to actions for damages will apply. This has been the practice in relation to Commonof wealth Government employees since 1971, and the Government considers that seamen should States. be placed in the same position. Clause 7, in addition to providing for some the increases in benefits already includes provisions relating to the weekly payments in respect of dependent children in both death and incapacity cases. Under these amendments such payments will be made in respect children aged between 16 and 21 years who full time students not ordinarily in employment. This will bring the Seamen's Compensation Act into line with the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act and the workers' compensation legislation of the States. The opportunity has also been taken to make some minor amendments of a formal or technical nature in keeping with current drafting practice. These amendments make no changes of substance. Application of Amendments The amending legislation is intended to come into operation on 1 September 1976. The Bill follows past practice in providing for the increased weekly payments to apply from that date, notwithstanding that the payments relate to an injury sustained or disease contracted before that date. Likewise, the increased lump sum payments for death and specified injuries will also apply from 1 September 1976 in all cases where the death occurs or the final degree of injury becomes assessable after that date, even though the death or the specified injury may have resulted curfrom an injury sustained or disease contracted that date. Increases in other benefits will apply in a similar manner. I commend the Bill to Debate (on motion by Mr Innes) adjourned. COMPENSATION (COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES) AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Second Reading",55
102,Mr HUNT,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for or increases in benefits payable under the Compenprosation (Australian Government Employees) Act provides workers' compensation for employees of the Commonwealth Government and its statutory authorities. This legislation was last amended for this purpose during the 1974 Budget session of the Parliament. Since then there have been significant increases in the cost living and in the benefits payable under the workers' compensation legislation of most of the It is therefore necessary and, indeed, only fair that the benefits under the Compensation of (Australian Government Employees) Act should mentioned, also again be increased. Compensation for Total Incapacity Employees who have been injured since 2 of November 1972 are entitled to receive weekly are compensation payments equal to their normal full sick pay rate during the first 26 weeks of incapacity for work. For long term cases where total incapacity has exceeded 26 weeks, the pensation is based onfixedweekly rates that are specified in the Act. Under the Bill, the fixed weekly rate for a totally incapacitated employee without dependants will increase from $57 to $80. The additional weekly supplement for a dependent spouse will increase from $15 to $21 and the weekly supplement for each dependent child will increase from $7 to $ 10. Compensation for Partial Incapacity A similar increase, from $57 to $80 a week, will also apply to the ceiling which operates relation to the compensation payable for partial incapacity for work. Compensation for Death The Bill also provides for increases in the amounts of compensation payable where an injury results in the death of an employee. basic lump sum payable to dependants will increase from $20,000 to $25,000. The weekly amount payable in respect of each dependent child of a deceased employee will increase $7 to $10 and the minimum total amount paycational able for each child will increase from $700 $1,000. The maximum amount payable in similar respect of funeral expenses will increase from $450 to $650. Compensation for Specified Losses The lump sums payable under the Act for specified losses will also increase. The maximum lump sum payment for such a loss will increase from $20,000 to $25,000 and the lump sums for the less serious losses will increase in the same proportion. For example, payments for severe and permanent facial disfigurement will increase from $10,000 to $12,500 and compensation for loss of the sense of taste or smell will increase from $2,000 to $2,500. Other Increases The maximum amount payable for alterations to buildings or vehicles, or repair or replacement of certain aids and appliances, will go up from $500 to $700. Provision of Vocational Training The amendment in clause 5 of the Bill is conseamendment quential upon a 1974 amendment to the Social Services Act and requires a detailed explanation. Under section 38 (I) of the Compensation (Austial traUan Government Employees) Act, the Comin missioner for Compensation is empowered to arto range with the Director-General of Social total Security for compensation cases to undertake rehabilitation vocational training using the comrehabUitation service of the Department of Social Security. It is desirable that both compensation and social service beneficiaries undergoing this training be dealt with on a similar basis. In 1974, section 135D of the Social Services Act was amended to provide a training allowance for social service beneficiaries that equals the weighted average weekly minimum wage appropriate to the person's age. It took the place of the rehabUitation allowance and a smaller training allowance that were payable before 1974. in Trus opportunity is being taken to amend the Compensation Act to take account of the 1974 amendment to section I35D of the Social Services Act. Because compensation cases undergoing training continue to receive compensation benefits, the amendment provides that the training allowance is an amount (if any), by which The the person's normal weekly compensation benefit is less than the weighted average minimum wage appropriate to his age. This will mean that no person receiving compensation from payments and undergoing rehabUitation votraining, will receive less than the person to receiving social services benefits undergoing training. Both will receive at least the weighted average weekly minimum wage appropriate to their age. It should be noted that no training allowance is payable where a person undergoing vocational training is receiving a compensation payment equal to or in excess of the weighted average weekly minimum wage. For both compensation and social service beneficiaries undergoing training, a living away from home allowance is also payable where appropriate. It is an amount determined by the Director-General of Social Security that does not exceed 25 per cent of the weighted average weekly minimum wage appropriate to the person's age. Other Amendments The opportunity has also been taken to make some other amendments of a relatively minor nature. The first of these, in clause 3 of the Bill, is consequential upon the new form of citation proposed in the Acts Citation Act 1976. The in clause 4 will clarify a provision regarding costs that was inserted in the Act in 1974. The amendment in clause 6 is consequenupon a change in other legislation referred to the principal Act. The remaining amendments the principal Act are set out in clause 8 and schedule 2 and are of a formal or technical nature. They are in keeping with current drafting practice and make no changes of substance. Application of Amendments The Bill provides that the amendments come into operation on 1 September 1976. Bill contains the usual provisions for the Government. increased weekly payments to apply from that date, notwithstanding that the payments relate to an injury sustained before that date. The increased lump sum payments for death and specified losses wtil also apply from 1 September 1976 in all cases where the death occurs or the loss is suffered after that date, even though the death or the loss may have resulted from an injury sustained before that date. Increases in other benefits will apply in a similar manner. Cost of Increased Benefits The total cost of the increased benefits authorised by the Bill is estimated year. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Innes) adjourned. NA MOTION-WITHDRAWAL OF NOTICE",56

NA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed from 11 November on the following paper presented by Mr Newman: Uranium Exports-Ministeria l Statement, 11 November to be $ 1.77m in a full 1976and on motion by Mr Viner: That the House take note of the paper.",58
105,Mr NEWMAN,URANIUM EXPORTS,"Bass-Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development)May I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this matter? Before the debate is resumed on this order of the day I suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this matter and the next order of the day as they are associated with the same subject. I suggest, therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both orders of the day to be discussed BILL 1976 in this debate. Second Reading Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr I a n s it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both matters? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of Opposition) (8.24)-Nothin g demonstrates in more tragically the inadequacy of the Fraser Government's response to the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry than its obvious determination to evade and misthefindingsofthe inquiry. By any standards the Fox report is a document of momentous significance. It deals in measured terms with and contentious issues, with fundamental questions of human safety and survival; with matters, literally, of Ufe and death. It has been the framed with the utmost care after months of exhaustive inquiry. My Government appointed inquiry because we wanted the most thorough and informed advice on matters of immense importance to the future of our country and to the future of humanity. I pay tribute this House to the painstaking work Fox and his fellow commissioners and congratulate them on the studious, temperate and, in its essence, profoundly humane report which have given the Australian people. We look forfindings. ward to their second report. It will complete work and should give the Parliament and the Australian people a comprehensive insight into the uranium question and the grave issues it raises. It remains true that even with the first our hands, politicians can no more speak with certitude or finality on these issues than the missoners themselves have been able to do. The great public debate on uranium, which the missioners recommend and which democracy and common sense demand, is only now beginmining. ning. It must continue. It must continue after second report is received. The first Fox report concerned with two paramount issues-on e largely technical, one largely political-whic scientists, governments and ordinary people must confront. The Fox report is not mainly trolled, about mining; it is mainly about the disposal radioactive waste and the prevention of nuclear proliferation. As politicians we cannot speak as experts on scientific questions, but we can must speak, with clarity and conviction, on ethical and social implications at the heart of decisions we make. It is for that reason that commend the emphasis in the Fox report on human safety and survival, and endorse its recommendations for Umiting nuclear proliferation and strengthening safeguards ling of nuclear material. Except in the most perfunctory terms the Government has said nothing on these issues. has closed its eyes to the real message of the report. One might have hoped that this debate, with all its grave and complex issues, would be conducted in a non-political atmosphere. Idealthe ists always hope for such debates but it is in nature of politics that they rarely happen. The Fox report presents us with inescapable choices. We can act upon the spirit and intentions of the report or we can ignore them. We can face its chaUenge honestly or we can obscure it and dodge it. We may disagree with certain control clusions or dispute a particular emphasis, but we take the report seriously there is one thing cannot do: We cannot remain inactive and inert. The Fox report demands a response; it enjoins action. It does not allow us to be passive. I say behalf of my colleagues that a Labor governled ment will take whatever action is needed to implement the spirit and intention of the in report. It is already clear that the present of Mr Justice Government will not. I began by saying that the Government had they evaded and misrepresented the inquiry's I shall document that charge because it their reveals clearly not only the dishonesty of the Fraser Government but also its narrow, essentially selfish perception of Australia's responsibilities. The Ranger report contains 16 substantive findings and recommendations. On 28 October, the day it was issued, the Minister for report in Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) made a Press statecomment in which he singled out for emphasis only two of those findings. Anyone reading his statecomment without seeing the report would have interpreted the report as a firm endorsement of That is how the share market and the the industry preferred to view it and it is what the is Government encouraged them to believe. The Minister mentioned thefirstfindingof the comh mission, namely, that the hazards of mining and mUling uranium, if properly regulated and conare: 'Not such as to justify a decision not of to develop Australian uranium mines'. This he described as: 'Thefirstand major recommendation'. There was no justification for calhng it the and 'major' recommendation; it was not in fact a the recommendation at all. Then he mentioned the the secondfinding,again misleadingly characterised I as a 'recommendation', that the hazards involved in the operation of nuclear power reactors, if properly regulated and controlled, are: 'Not such as to justify a decision not to mine and in the handsell Australian uranium'. To present these 2 tentative and cautious stateIt ments as a summary of the whole report-to FoxpresentfindingsdeUberately couched in negative terms as positive and major recommendationswas a distortion of the report and an affront to commissioners. Yet this was how the Austhe tralian people were acquainted with the report's contents. There was no mention by the Minister of the crucial third finding, that 'the nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war'. There was no mention of the need for the regulation and conof mining mentioned in the fourth finding. if There was no acknowledgement of the dangers we and hazards identified by the Commission. In ignoring the true spirit of the report, in leaving the clear impression that the future of rnining onwas all that mattered, the Government has misthe Australian people. The commissioners themselves are plainly anxious at the way the Fox Government was treating them. On 9 November the pohtical correspondent of the Sydney Mornissued ing Herald reported: Mr Justice Fox and his two fellow commissioners known to be concerned that their report on the inquiiy is being widely interpreted as the go-ahead mining and export of uranium, subject to strict control. have let the Federal Government know privately that they regard this as a serious misinterpretation of their . . . As far as the commissioners are concerned third finding-that the nuclear power industry tionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear contains their major recommendation: that the questions volved are of such importance that they should be resolved by Parliament. Mr Chipp-How many are in the Parliament now? Mr E. G. Whitlam-The next 2 speakers on our side at least. I do not know whether honourable gendeman is being allowed by his masters to speak. The Australian Financial Review reported this morning: Justice Fox and the two commissioners from the environmental inquiry have attacked the Government its interpretaton of the Fox Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, Mr Newman, the Fox commissioners claimed their first two findings do not amount to dations . . . The Government has used these findings to justify honouring existing contracts . . . The Fox commissioners are further concerned that the Government has used thereponto suppon its stated policy for uranium development. In spite of these facts the Government is still presenting the Fox report as a green light for the mining industry. Its 200-odd pages of closely argued text, its cautious and restrained conproval clusions, have been swept aside. When the ister tabled the report he asserted that cipal findings and recommendations of the inquiry . . . relate to the development and export of Australia's uranium resources'. That is was simply not true. The recommendations and findings are overwhelmingly concerned with hazards of nuclear development. It is not the sort of repon which can be answered with sweeping, airy references to the 'need for the fullest and most effective safeguards'. The repon says preProliferation cisely what these safeguards should be and what we should do about them. The Government must tell the Australian people exactly what it proguards poses to do about them at home and abroad. I make it clear that the next Labor Governcourse ment will not feel bound to honour any future contracts entered into by the present Governof ment. Let there be no misunderstanding about the attitude of my Party now or in the future. a Government we inherited substantial contracts from our predecessors. One-third of the contracts were actually approved after the writs for the elections of December 1972. It is one thing to honour contracts we inherited; we are shall be under no obligation, in view of the quesRanger tionable actions of our predecessors and their for the misrepresentation now of the Fox report, to They honour such contracts in future. My colleagues repon and I are convinced that, in view of the Fox comthe mission's findings, no new mining development is unintenshould be permitted unless a future Labor warGovernment is satisfied that the hazards have inbeen eliminated and satisfactory methods of waste disposal have been developed. It is now clear that the equivocation and duplicity in the Minister's Press statement on 28 October and his ministerial statement on 11 the November were intended to reassure the mining industry and soften the public for the go-ahead for new contracts. The Government has deUberately given the impression that the Fox report is encouraging mining. It is not. Nobody should be under any Ulusions that mining will be Ranger permitted under a future Labor Government. over Nor should the mining companies be Repon. In a recent letter to the encouraged to believe that because they are in have business under one government, they can expect recommenany future government to guarantee their existence. The least the present Government can do is ensure that all the safety procedures recommended in the Fox report apply to the filling of existing contracts. It must observe the recommendation that no decisions be taken on future mining in the Northern Territory until the second report is received. It must give no further apto mining anywhere in Australia until the Minsafeguards proposed in the report are 'the prinimplemented at home and abroad. There is one inexcapable conclusion to be drawn from any fair reading of the Fox report. It not just that Australia must observe existing international safety procedures-that goes without the saying-bu t that Australia must take some further international action to strengthen those procedures. Repeatedly the Fox report harks back to the importance of the Treaty on the Nonof Nuclear Weapons. It recognises that Australia is well placed, perhaps uniquely placed, to do something to strengthen the safein the treaty. To shirk that responsibiUty, that supreme obligation, would in my view be a of criminal negUgence when we consider the solemn facts in this report and the dire tone its conclusions. Time and again the commissioners return to the theme that Australia As cannot idly accept existing safeguards; time and again they point the way to an international initiative by the Australian Government. On page were 178 of their report they say: We . . . suggest that, whether or not Australia supplies uranium, it endeavours to have some internationally acceptable system established wastes and international supervision of what is done. And on page 171 of their report they spell out precisely why Australia has a special place in the international nuclear community. They say: Australia occupies a very special position in the nuclear scene. It is represented on the Board of Governors of the IAEE, and was represented at the NPT Review Conference held last year. It is possessed of relatively large uranium reserves which by now have attracted world-wide attention . . . It has a nuclear research establishment and a small nuclear industry of its own . . . These features may combine, perhaps with others favourable position to take initiatives, or at least to support them. It is plain that the Government is treating all this urgent and deeply serious advice with the usual Liberal mixture of sloth and complacency. On the need for stronger international safeguards the Minister had this to say: The Government believes that a strong national safeguards policy for uranium exports should be complemented, at the international level, by Australia's continuing to contribute actively to constructive multilateral efforts. In this context the Government welcomes any international initiatives for strengthening the regime. In other words, this Government will do nothing. It will sit back and wait for someone else to take action. Can anyone imagine a more supine response to an international problem from a Government uniquely placed to take an initiative? Such an initiative would fully accord with the attitudes of other responsible Western governments and with every signatory to the NPT. Australia must respond to that challenge. The Fox report has shown us the way. It points the way to a steady, patient, difficult, but none the less urgent course for Australia, one that could well diminish the hazards of the nuclear age, and intimeperhaps draw humanity back from the edge of nuclear destruction.",58
106,Mr BIRNEY,URANIUM EXPORTS,"My perception may be keener than that of most people but the soundings that I perceive emanating from the Fox report are all in tune with the establishment of a uranium export industry, subject only to adequate safeguards. Let there be no mistake, the Government is committed to this latter all important pre-requisite. Australia is a great and proud nation, blessed in many ways, particularly in its wealth of mineral resources, the rewards from which are the property of the people who go to make up this nation. Sadly, there are people in the ranks of the Australian Labor Party Opposition who would strangle thisfinancialbirthright and so the well being of all Australians. I believe that few issues of greater significance for this nation, and indeed the world, have faced this Parliament. Much debate has raged on the for the disposal of high-level uranium question. Unfortunately much of it has been ill-informed and emotionally illogical. We must accept, because of the horrors of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, that people are naturally apprehensive about widespread nuclear developments. However, these fears have been unnecessarily inflamed by emotionalism on the part of certain environmental groups and fanned by irresponsible utterances of Labor politicians. Substantial progress and change often produce hysterical reactions. The scare tactics being used by also, to put Australia in a those committed to stopping the development of an Australian uranium industry have already been seen through and rejected by the American public in a recent series of referendums. I note that the Fox report comments that a number of wtidly exaggerated claims about the risk of nuclear power were made by witnesses. I hope we do not get a repeat of that in this Parliament. Placing this question of uranium development in a global context, thefirstpoint I make to the House is that the world has no short term alterinternational non-proliferation native to the use of uranium as an energy source. We must accept the fact that oU can be viewed only as a short term energy provider. Natural gas has similar limitations. Additionally, this energy source should be seen as almost exclusively the long term source of raw material for the petrochemical and related industries. It is often suggested that coal could be used as a practical alternative to uranium in meeting the world's energy needs for the rest of this century. However, this would be physically impossible, and coalfired power stations are a major source of atmospheric pollution already. For example, the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States of America has estimated that at least 50 per cent of pollutants in the air capable of causing biological damage result from the burning of fossil fuels for electric power generation. The Fox report indicates similarly that the operation of fossil fuel stations is more of a health hazard than the operation of nuclear reactors. While arguments in favour of solar energy are attractive, the plain fact of the matter is that this energy source is not capable of commercially meeting the energy crisis which is looming large as the world's oil sources dry up. Solar energy may be a solution to the energy problems of future generations but certainly not to our own or our chUdren's. The first thing we must face in this debate is that uranium and the development of nuclear energy represent the only solution to the world's immediate energy problems. Turning to some substantive questions about the nuclear industry, the first recommendation of the Fox report indicates that the mining and milling of uranium in Australia is a safe process. In informed debates there is agreement, on both sides of the nuclear power issue, that uranium mining carried out under today's tight regulations is neither an environmental problem nor a health hazard. People are prone to forget that uranium mining was carried out in Australia from 1954 to 1971 successfully and safely. It could hardly be argued that any new radical dangers have developed since then. All Australians can rest content that their own Federal Department of Health, after consultation with federal and State government departments, trade unions, trades and labour councils, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and mining companies, has developed the world's most stringent code to govern the mining and milling of our uranium. The second recommendation of the report gives a similar green light to the operation of nuclear power reactors. It is in this area that much of the attack on nuclear energy is astray. Many people honestly believe that nuclear reactors can explode in the same way as a nuclear bomb. Such a theory is nonsense and I refer the House to the Rasmussen report which is the most authoritative study on reactor accident risks. As a result of this report this risk can now be compared to other technological and natural hazards with which society must deal and will always be confronted. That study came up with a quantitative evaluation based on the simultaneous operation of 100 nuclear reactors. A person living near one of these plants would face an average probability of being fatally injured in a nuclear accident of one in five billion per year. His chance of fatahty from an automobile accident is one in 4000 while from drowning it is one in 30 000, from air travel it is one in 100 000 and from lightning it is one in 2 mUlion. Among a society of 15 million people residing around these sites some 9000 deaths and nearly 600 000 injuries would be expected each year from car accidents, falls,firesand other causes. By comparison less than one fatality and less than one injury would be expected annually from a nuclear accident One should also appreciate that nuclear reactor usage is no longer at an experimental stage. I stress that there is no necessity for Australia to have nuclear reactors now or in the immediate future. We can continue to generate electricity by conventional means to meet our own energy requirements adequately. This may well be the key and, if so, the arguments against the mining and milting of this precious commodity, the rewards from which belong to all Australians, would of necessity vanish like a dream. The question of the disposal of radioactive waste from nuclear reactors has also been enveloped in til-informed hoo haa. Basically 2 separate questions are involved and one is the short term disposal of nuclear wastes. A solution already is at hand for this. Wastes will be stored in massive concrete casks which can withstand all natural phenomena such as earthquakes and floods as well as man-made forces such as fire, sabotage and aeroplane crashes. The important point to remember is that the world should not be stampeded into a rash decision on the question of long term disposal. I turn now to the question of the benefit to Australians of a uranium export industry. This industry is capable of satisfying by 1985, 20 per cent at least of the world market and could be expected to earn for the good of this nation in the vicinity of $3,000m per year at projected prices. By comparison, the wool industry currently earns about $800m while our total mineral exports currently earn about $2,500m. The Fox report at page 83 indicated that foreign exchange earned by uranium exports wouldriseto a maximum of about 5 per cent of total export earnings by the early 1990s.",61
107,Mr UREN,URANIUM EXPORTS,It is 0.5 per cent.,62
108,Mr BIRNEY,URANIUM EXPORTS,"I will be getting around to the honourable member in a minute. It must also be noted that uranium prices will slide as time goes by. This will occur particularly as a result of the introduction of fast breeder reactors. This point also is made in the report at page 63. Nowhere is the dithering more evident than amongst honourable members opposite. We have seen a series of conflicting public attitudes expressed by them which leaves me, and I am sure the people of Australia and others in the Parliament, thoroughly confused about who speaks with authority on their behalf or who can make a statement which will not be contradicted or rolled by some other faction in the Labor Party. All I can say is that this nation is lucky those honourable members are now in Opposition. If they were in Government Australia's uranium would grow steadily worthless while they argued with one another. If we continue to dither we could well be sitting on a worthless rather than a valuable commodity. Australia with a large share of the world's uranium reserves must also look to its international responsibilities. The peoples of the world, poor and wealthy, want more and more power to improve standards of living and Australia has a moral obligation to contribute to that improvement by the supply of uranium. I ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to bear that in mind next time he pontificates on the morality of the uranium issue. In a speech to the Australian Railways Union on 26 June this year he said: If the companies and the present Government want to take it out of the ground and out of Australia then they must be prevented from doing so. Such a statement is an appalling condemnation of this gentleman. The only authority which has a mandate to make policy on the export of uranium is the democratically elected Parliament. No union has the right to defy the decisions made by the Government on this issue. It is interesting to contrast that statement with the attitude taken by the American trade union leader, George Meany, who recently said: Because of the efforts of the labour movement progress in America will not be strangled due to unwise and obsessive restraints on development of safe nuclear energy. The attempt by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to incite union blackmail on this issue is both serious and sinister. Perhaps this so-called great proponent of the 'fair go for all Australians' does not want an industry which will provide employment for 10 000 Australians by 1985 and produce a wages bill alone which will make available some $2m to be fed back into the economy every week. Denying the world access to Australia's uranium reserves will not help to alleviate this most serious problem. Page 70 of the Fox report states: Clearly, the development the world can continue whether or not Australian uranium is made available. It is not essential to have nuclear power stations to produce a nuclear weapons capability. All nations have access to uranium ores from the ever-growing mining industry or from sea water. Separation processes can be used to acquire weapons material from these sources. Of course it is common sense that any country hell bent on building a nuclear bomb would hardly be deterred by having to obtain uranium at a high price from sources other than Australia. Finally I refer to my own maiden speech in this House on 4 March this year. I said: I think it is important that soon as possible. Let there be no mistake, the world wants Australia's uranium and it is prepared to pay vast amounts for it. Since thattimeinterest in the uranium issue has certainly been increased, but nothing has curred to change myfirmconviction on this issue. Let us then proceed with the development of a full scale uranium export industry from which all Australians of this great nation can benefit.",62
109,Mr UREN,URANIUM EXPORTS,"Time does not permit me to answer the spurious arguments of the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Birney). I state quite clearly that I do not consider this exchange in the Parliament as in any way constituting a public debate of the issues examined and still being examined by the Fox Commission. I wtil not subscribe to the view being put by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that the Ranger inquiry itself constitutes a full examination by the people of the uranium and nuclear industry issue. If the Government is trying to suggest that this now is a national parliamentary debate on the Ranger inquiry and this now is reflecting the views being expressed in the community it is very much mistaken. The Minister knows perfectly well that he has not consulted the general community at all. The Fox Commission has not even completed its work. We have had only thefirstof its reports to hand. This limited debate, with a few members of this House speaking for 15 minutes each, is a farce and a sham. Public debate is debate by the people, and it takes time. The idea of consulting with the people may be a bit strange for this Government, but it can be done. The Austrian Government recently commenced a nationwide discussion of the nuclear issue. Its program seems to take particular care not to waive the debate according to pre-determined government intenof nuclear power in the rest of tions. A significant and growing proportion of the Australian population wantstimeand the debate. My Party has joined with many concerned groups in the community-trad e unions, Aboriginal people, church groups, women's groups, environmentalists and groups of citizens concerned with the preservation of democractic rights-in condemning the haste of the Government in making its 11 November statement, its disregard of the final recommendation of the Fox report and its general stance on the issue of uranium mining development. The people have a mandate for their debate and their right to be consulted on the final recommendations of the Fox report. I also draw attention to page 6 of the Fox report which states: we develop uranium markets as Ultimately many of the questions are social and ethical ones. We agree strongly with the view that the final decision should rest with the ordinary man and not be regarded as the preserve of any group of experts however distinguished. ocThe Fox Commissioners clearly state on page 181 that because of the arguments put to them they cannot draw a firm conclusion one way or the other between placing a moratorium on the decision to go ahead with mining or to proceed with carefully planned development of the industry. The Commissioners have handed the matter over to the people, but this Government has intervened. This Government, by its actions and its statement made ironically on 11 November of this year, has tried to ignore both the Fox report and the people's rights. The Government has taken a major decision to export over 16 000 tonnes of Australia's uranium from sources that are insufficient to meet export contracts involved. Implicit in this decision is that new uranium mines must be opened; that uranium mining development will go ahead. The Government's 11 November statement completely casts aside the social and ethical questions involved with the Government's typical contempt for such considerations. It only pays lip service to matters of safeguard requirements, the control of Australia's uranium exports after they leave the shores and, most importantly, nuclear weapons proliferation. Guidance offered by the Fox Commission on all these matters has been cynically and dangerously cast aside. In continuing to press the Government for sufficienttimeand a true public debate I recognise the extent of the desire by tain elements in the conservative parties for scale mining development. This Government has only ever paid lip service to the Ranger inquiry. It made pubhc statements about not doing anything before the outcome of the inquiry was known but privately it has gone ahead encouraging mining companies to enter into long term contracts for supplying uranium, including the supply to such dangerous regimes as the government of Iran. Members of this Government have gone themselves and sent their bureaucrats to solicit foreign investment for uranium mining projects. Earlier this year the Government provided a special guarantee of an Australia and New Zealand Bank loan that it arranged for Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd. It guaranteed that Australia's uranium would be exported to the United Kingdom to replace in kind uranium borrowed by MKU. If the Foxfindingswere truly to provide a basis for the decisions on mining and export of uranium how in heaven's name can the Government have proceeded in this manner? The Fox report at page 83 shows clearly that the large capital investors are the only ones who will benefit substantially from uranium mining development. The drive for profit is the only motivation of the uranium producers' forum in Australia. Commitment to a narrow ideological position has drawn this conservative Government and key elements of the bureaucracy into support for and advancement of these interests. Their empty statements on safeguards, controls and concerns about nuclear war do nothing to mask their basic concerns with advancing the interests of uranium mining companies, regardless of the social and environmental costs that ordinary Australians may have to pay. The only really surprising thing about the Government's statement of 11 November is the haste with which it made its decision. It is clear that time is the enemy of the Government and the pro-uranium lobby. The longer the Australian people have to consider the issue and the more it is talked about, the more concerned people become; the longer the Government delays, the more opposition it will face. So the Government has acted quickly. It has acted while it still has a manageable opposition in Australia. It has acted now to crush the union bans on uranium exports as part of its overall attack on the unions. The Government recognises that once exports are flowing and business gets under way, it will be extremely difficult for an alternative government or the people themselves to extract Australia from this so-called commitment. cerOn reflection, it is easy to understand why the fullGovernment is in such a hurry. I can see clear reasons for the Government's deciding to proceed by giving the go-ahead to immediate exports. Firstly, meeting contracts from Australian sources right now is a ploy to break the union bans. The Government clearly recognises that the union bans are the only way mining and export can be held up until the Australian people examine the real issues. That is why the bans have to be removed one way or another. Secondly, the decision has been taken in this way because of the disastrous financial position of Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd. While the delay of exports has added to the company's financial difficulties, mismanagement, especially in cost estimates, has been the overwhelming factor. Now the Australian people are being denied any say in this important issue so that the Government can get MKU off the hook. The major interest in MKU is Conzinc Rio-Tinto of Australia Ltd which, in turn, is a subsidiary of the giant Rio-Tinto Zinc of the United Kingdom. Rio-Tinto Zinc controls 15 per cent of the known uranium deposits of the western world and it completely monopolises the uranium deposits of South Africa. This Government's priorities are strange, to say the least. The newspapers tell us that some Government backbenchers see uranium mining development as the source of the much hoped for economic recovery. Certainly, a 17.5 per cent devaluation will do much to draw in foreign investment into new mining projects. If the Government's backbenchers look closely at the rnining lobby's claim of vast economic benefits to Australia from uranium mining development, they will see that the claims are empty. The Fox report again provides the evidence. At page 83, it states: . . . contribution to net national income and employment opportunities would be relatively small. Optimal development of all Australia's uranium, it states: . . . would probably result in an increase of about 0.1 per cent of national income in 1980-81, rising to about per cent in 1990-91. Therefore it would decline. The honourable member for Phillip (Mr Birney) was only 4.5 per cent out. Anti-trust actions in the United States court by Westinghouse threatens the price base upon which even that modest economic benefit is based. I am sure that at least some Government backbenchers, Uke members of the Australian Labor Party, are concerned about the present and prospective unemployment situation in Australia and about the serious problems of Australia's manufacturing industry. Uranium mining offers not even a partial solution to the unemployment situation. The Fox report says that the employment benefits of Ranger are limited. After a 2-year construction phase, 250 men will be required to produce 3000 tonnes of uranium per annum. The new mining development is highly capital intensive. The supposed sequential development of the uranium mines means that the total workforce will remain small. The mining lobby says that the indirect employment benefits are much greater. Given the remote location of proposed mines, that is highly questionable. expired. Mining machinery will not be made in Australia. It will be imported. On the other hand, the indirect employment cost will be great. This because of the adverse impact of mining sector development on the rural and manufacturing portunity sectors of the economy. I ask honourable bers of the Country Party to take heed of this. move: Mining requires vast amounts of capital. In part, this capital is redirected from investment in other sectors of the economy, particularly from manufacturing industry. One only had to look at the recent investment decisions of companies such as the Bank of New South Wales, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, and Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd to see the vast rechanIf nelling that is taking place in their investments. Meanwhile, the steel plants of BHP deteriorate and the new, more labour intensive manufacturing ventures are denied investment funds. In setting this course for a massive structural change in the Australian economy, of which uranium mining development is a major part, this Government has acted contrary to the best interests of the working population and the large number of small and medium size industrial enterprises in our country. This Government seems intent on committing Australia to a supplier role in the western world's nuclear energy industry. It has signed up this and future governments, this and future generations, for a role that the people have not had time to consider and 0.S almost certainly will not want. Growing numbers of people oppose the Government's action. The parliamentary Labor Party has given notice that it will not be bound by new contracts approved by this Government. Trade unions have stated that they will prevent the resumption of uranium exports until public discussion has taken place and the people decide on the issue.",63
110,Mr BAILLIEU,URANIUM EXPORTS,How long will that take?,65
111,Mr UREN,URANIUM EXPORTS,The Government should recognise the legitimate demands and rights of the people. The honourable member for La Trobe asks: 'How long will that take?' The time that it will take is not important. Whether it takes 1 or 2 years; the fact is that the debate should take place. The people should have a basic understanding of the major decisions that the Government is making. The Government is making decisions which not only will affect the involvement of the whole of mankind but which also will have major consequences for the whole structure of employment in Australia in decades ahead.,65
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URANIUM EXPORTS,Mr Lucock)the Order! The honourable member's time has,65
113,Mr CHIPP,URANIUM EXPORTS," I should like to is move an amendment to the motion before the House. I believe that I have been given the opto do so by the fact that the Opposition memhas not moved an amendment to the motion. I That the following words be added to the motion: 'and that the House is of the opinion that there should be a two year moratorium on the mining and exporting of uranium as mentioned in the Fox report to allow sufficient time for public debate as recommended by the Fox Committee and for funher research into the risks involved and possible alternative energy sources'. this means voting against the Government and against my Party, so be it. I mention in passing that it will be thefirsttime in 16 years in this liament that I have done so. I say this after ing read the Fox report thoroughly on at least occasions. The question posed to me is: Australia mine and mill its uranium deposits? believe that this is the most important subject discussed in this Parliament since the Vietnam war. Mr Justice Fox says that it is one of the most important things discussed by this Parliament. As I speak, Mr Deputy Speaker, Mr Speaker is not in the Chair, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is not in the House, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) is not the House, Cabinet is meeting, only 2 Ministers are in the House and since this debate began something which I believe is the most important subject since the Vietnam war the attendance members of Parliament in the chamber has ranthe ged from eleven to nineteen. Indeed, there are only 5 representatives of the Press in the Press Gallery at this time. Not for the first time, judgment of what is an important issue facing Australia is wrong. I should have thought that uranium is a very special metal. It contains atoms. It is used or misused in 3 main ways. Firstiy, it is used to produce heat to generate electricity; secondly, it is used in the field medical therapy; and thirdly, it is used to duce nuclear bombs. I begin by quoting one of the principal findings of the Fox report. Its starkness and clarity of language need no embellishment. On 185 under the heading 'Findings and Recomoccasions mendations ', the report states: The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war. Before examming future risks the report reminds us on page 25 of the current situation. Nineteen countries now have nuclear power stations. Another 7 countries have power reactors under construction and another 6 countries have them on order. The discussion tonight then is about the future. The question is: Is it safe, is it prudent is it responsible for this Parliament, such as it assembled now, to respond to the challenge given directly in the Fox report by agreeing allow Australia's uranium to be used at this stage to add to the world's nuclear proliferation? Let me make it perfectly clear that I am not saying that uranium should never be mined or that nations of the world should never use nucheaper, clear energy. What I am saying is that this time man's knowledge, or lack of knowledge, of the proper regulation and control of the production of uranium and the hideous dangers inherent in Parits use or misuse is such that we as a Parliament havshould follow the advice of such expert com4 missions as the Fox inquiry in Australia and the Should Flowers Royal Commission in the United I Kingdom. After reading thefindingscontained in those reports, the answer is that we should wait. The very last words contained in the Fox report state its oft repeated plea that no decision should be taken until a reasonable time has elapsed. This leads us to ask: What is a reasonable time? A heavy suggestion for a 2 year delay is contained at pages 180 and 181 of the report. I must say that Ifindit almost incredible that in the Government took only 14 days from the issue of the Fox report to decide that it would honour on existing contracts totalling 9000 tonnes from Mary Kathleen. My dismay at that announceof ment was deepened by the pathetic decision of Labor Party 6 days later which was almost identical to the decision of the Government. The magnitude of the problem that this Parliament is my now discussing cannot be compared to the possible pollution that can be produced by a Newport power station or the possible environmental fissiledestruction of a Fraser Island. I say quite deliberately, after having tried to choose words that are not tainted by melodrama or exaggerof ation, that the problem being discussed tonight procould have some bearing on the future of this planet and on the survival of life on it. These are strong words but, I believe, words which can be justified by the evidence before us. page There have been very few, if any, previous in mytimein this Parliament when it could be said that a debate in this isolated, relatively non-influential, obscure national Parliament of Australia could have an effect on the rest of the world. But tonight it is true. Firstly, Australia has 25 per cent of the world's known reserves of uranium. That is significant in itself. What is even more important is that Australia has 70 per cent of the western world's uncommitted reserves. Therefore, in terms of quantity alone, a decision of this Parliament is important and to the world's future course in using or not using is nuclear energy as opposed to other forms of energy. But our importance goes even further than to that. Any nation that wants to buy uranium, enrich it, use it or sell it must indulge in a massive capital outlay. The cost of producing electricity from nuclear power is now only marginally cheaper, if at all than the production of electricity from fossil fuels. If Australia withheld, even temporarily, its reserves, world prices of uranium would escalate and influence nations to opt for cheaper sources of power. As the Fox report mentions, a more intensive search would be undertaken to harness the safest and cleanest source of energyroom solar power. Secondly, for a nation to involve leaks itself in the high capital cost of building enrichurethane ment plants or nuclear reactors, it would need a source of supply from a country such as Australia conclusions because of Australia's stable pohtical background. It would not contemplate establishing an supply was lost industry where the source of its raw materials emergency equipment came from a banana republic or a country with coolant an uncertain political future. Therefore, what we ency do with our uranium could have and probably tem lost. will have a direct effect on the course of the was world's nuclear proliferation. I want to emphasise this point because there are many people who might agree with the clear brought dangers and reservations expressed by Mr Juson tice Fox and by the Flowers Royal Commission but who say resignedly: 'What is the use? If we lost do not sell our uranium someone else will sell infirethewas theirs.' This argument cannot be sustained by the the 22nd.at Many known facts and logical assumptions. I now list some of the dangers, risks and future possibilities of nuclear proliferation as documented not me but by the Fox report. With regard to the dangers of radiation, the report 108 and 109: Apan from rapidly fatal effects (within days) of high doses the major consequences of radiation are cancer, which may occur some years after the individual has been exposed and gene mutations which may occur in subsequent generations. At page 109, referring to waste products, the report states: Tailings contain radio-active materials which will remain harmful forover 100 000 years. When referring to the danger of serious accidents, the report states on the same page: The conclusion with regard to thermal reactors is that there is a very small butfiniteprobability of a serious accident with release of highly dangerous radio-active material.

115,Mr CHIPP,NOTES ON NUCLEAR SAFETY,"I thank the House. The report states that high level wastes, as distinct from lower level wastes, will remain radio-active for several hundreds of thousands of years. On page 148, the Fox report states: We conclude that nuclear material should be supplied to a state only on the basis that its entire nuclear industry is subject to back-up safeguards that cannot be terminated by unilateral withdrawal. Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Peacock) assure this House that those kinds of safeguards are realistic? But is there any such thing as back-up safeguards? The Fox report goes on to say at page 149: There is widespread disinclination amongst states to acceptregularinspections. With regard to safeguards from international terrorism, the report makes this devastating remark: An attempt by even a small, well trained and armed group to take over a nuclear installation could have a good chance of success. The Fox report states, using double negatives, that there is no reason to stop mining provided it is properly regulated and controlled. Before any responsible government proceeds with the mining and milling of uranium it must, I suggest, after the warnings and constraints of the Fox Commission completely satisfy the conditions of proper regulations and control, particularly in the Ught of the following sentences contained on page 152 of the report: . . . The Commission does not feel conndent that nuclear facilities would currently withstand determined assaults by terrorist organisations. I remind the House that the Flowers Commission in the Umted Kingdom reached almost identical conclusions. If this sentence is read literally and acted upon sincerely it means that no uranium, if we are genuine about this matter, could be or should be sold under the present conditions. The Fox report says: There is widespread disinclination among states to accept regular inspections . . . Another threat was sabotage of nuclear plants causing destruction, a radiation hazard to surrounding populations and costly disruption of power systems . . . an event which has already occurred in Argentina. Sir, I conclude on this note: Frankly, I have not been impressed by many of the arguments put forward by the pro-nuclear lobby. One of these is that nuclear energy will help the developing nations. The Fox report at page 56 clearly illustrates that nuclear energy will not help developing nations to any significant degree because it needs large power stations and large investments which developing nations do not have. Sir Philip Baxter says that Australia's most obvious customers are Japan, West Germany and the United States of America. I pause by respectfully asking the House to contemplate the military track record of at least two of that select trio of nations or, for that matter, the whole trio. Sir Philip Baxter says of the pro-nuclear lobby: Let us sell to those nations, knowing that the safeguards in such a sale are, according to Fox, an Ulusion. Sir Philip Baxter goes on: Let us sell to Japan, let us also reprocess nuclear fuel from other countries. I quote Sir PhUip direct: Over the next 10-15 years the world could become a lawless place with the United States alliance breaking down and conflict between Russia and America with China being dragged in. It is quite possible that Australia might find itself enemies with Japan. We could only defend ourselves with the most sophisticated weapons possible, of which nuclear bombs should be an option. What a perfect catch 22. Sir PhUip Baxter says: Let us sell uranium to Japan; let it make nuclear bombs; therefore, because we might be enemies with Japan one day, we must also make nuclear bombs to protect ourselves from Japan. Sir, the communists will support the banning of uranium. They will do this for devious reasons. They will ask Australia not to mine uranium, while preserving a thunderous stience about Russia and China doing it. What I plead tonight is that this will not be a politically polarised debate but that this debate might be considered by the people of Australia with its true implications understood.",68

118,Mr KEATING,NOTES ON NUCLEAR SAFETY," Mr Deputy Speaker, this debate encompasses the contents of two documents, the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry and the Ministerial statement by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) in respect to the supply of Australian uranium under existing international contracts. In fact the debate should only be upon the first report of the Ranger Inquiry but in its indecent haste the Government, within days of the presentation of this report, made a statement of policy indicating its intention to supply uranium under the existing contracts. The report of the Ranger Environmental Inquiry or the Fox Report, as it is known, is a document of international significance. One could not but be impressed by the mass of technical detaU in the report and the assessment of evidence and the clear picture it provides of the international clear industry. The report deals carefully with questions of nuclear proliferation, waste disposal, human safety and associated matters. However, one must feel disappointed with the manner in which the Fox Commission has discharged its obligations to the Parliament in the terms of its findings and recommendations. In this regard the report is ambiguous and uncertain and the import of its findings and recommendations is repeatedly countered by hard opinion and conclusions written into the body of the report. I feel I am able to say that the Fox Commission has let the nation down by not providing hard recommendations to the Parliament, to the Government and to the country. Of course recommendations do not have to be accepted but it is preferable that they be made, particularly people who, at large public expense-somethin g like $2m in this instance-hav e been immersed in the complexities of the nuclear question and have had the advantage of taking evidence under oath. Nobody else in public life will have the benefits of this exposure to such a complex question. That is why I believe it is unacceptable for the Commission to say, in its recommendations and findings, that certain matters should be determined by the Parliament. Of course, they will be determined by the Partracts. liament. At least they must be determined by Government. But what the Parliament sought was somefirmrecommendations to consider. For instance, why could there not have been firm recommendations on uranium supply to existing contracts. This aspect is alluded to in the body of the report, yet nothing appears in the recommendations. I notice that in today's Press is reported that Mr Justice Fox has written to Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) complainand ing of the Government's misinterpretation of Commission's recommendations and findings. It said amongst other things that what have been taken to be recommendations were in fact only findings. I recognise the Commissioners' conthe cern-thei r concern as to the Government's interpretation of a complex document. But why did the Commission not distinguish recommenfailed dations from findings. The Commission must have realised in presenting a highly political document like this to a government, particularly a government with the present Government's predilections, that the Government would attempt where possible, for its own selfish reasons, to drive a horse and cart through conclusions listed. It is to no avail for the mission now to cry over this misinterpretation its report. It should have had enough sense to nu- make its findings, conclusions and recommendathe tions clear, firm and unequivocal. If the commissioners could not find agreement amongst themselves, they should have introduced a majority and a minority report so that there were arguments and conclusions backing firm recommendations. At least then a clear choice would be available. It is to be hoped that in their second report the Commissioners have learned their lesson and that they write recommendations firmly. Now let me deal with the Government's goodwill or lack of it. The Government, I believe, made a decision a long time ago to mine and export Australian uranium on a large scale basis. The Ranger report talks of possible export tonnages of 15 000 tons a year in 1985 and up to 30 000 tons a year by 1990-1992. This is what by the debate is all about-whethe r Australia moves into wholesale uranium exports or not. Of course the Government and the Prime Minister are now saying that further decisions as to exports will not be made until the presentation of the second report of the Ranger Commission, that is, the report pertaining to the Northern Territory. But this is only window dressing. In making his statement on existing contracts, the Minister failed to mention that the supply of uranium currently available in Australia from mining and stockpiles fails to meet the totality of the existing conThis has not been dealt with in the Minisa ter's statement for the simple reason that the Government intends to go ahead with new mining developments in Australia to meet the shortfall under the existing contracts and to meet new in relation contract commitments. While the Prime Minister at question time it today said that he will wait upon the presenthe tation of the second report and preaches a wait see policy, in fact, unless I am badly misthe taken, he and his Government are determined to press ahead with large scale uranium mining in Australia. The Prime Minister's crude attempt to jam the Opposition into a premature debate on uranium issue last Tuesday week by his anglib nouncement the previous Thursday of the Government's decision on the existing contracts when the Opposition took the challenge and determined an attitude to that particular question. Honourable members will be aware now that the Opposition has determined that in government it would prohibit the export of uranium from new uranium mines for an indefinite period and indicated that it will not the honour any new contracts that were signed by Comthe Fraser Government or any other future conof servative government. The Opposition would have enjoyed and should have enjoyed the luxury of sometimeto consider and determine its attitude to this vital question, to consider the Fox report in the light of public attitudes towards it and the question of the nuclear industry. It has been denied this consideration by a crude Prime Minister who believes he can crash his way through everyone and everything to secure his purpose. If I am correct and the Government presses ahead with new uranium mining in Australia, it will do so in disregard of the notice of caution articulated in the Fox report. On the broader front of the nuclear debate in Australia, the big danger is that the debate could get bogged down in the relatively minor matter concerning exports under the existing contracts. Let me deal for a moment with this aspect. At present the only mine operating in Australia is the Mary Kathleen mine in Queensland. It has a life of about seven to eight years remaining. Its productive capacity is an effective 800 tons per year. Its remaining reserves amount to 1.8 per cent of Australia's total proven reserves of 350 000 short tons. If the Government's policy is to meet the existing contracts to Japan, the United States and West Germany, which amount to 11 757 short tons, supplied from the remaining ore body at Mary Kathleen and from the Atomic Energy Commission stockpile, it will amount to a policy to export 2.8 per cent of Australia's total reserves under the existing contracts. The Opposition does not demur from this course, but that is hardly what is at issue. The issue is, as I said earlier, whether Australia should get plugged into the international nuclear industry by allowings its large uncommitted reserves to buttress the expansion of that industry. I believe, and the Opposition believes, that at this moment, given what the Fox Commission reveals about the hazards associated with the nuclear industry and given some of the firm statements which were made in the report urging caution and delay, Australia should not, at this stage, commit itself to promote the expansion of the nuclear industry. Let me quote some relevant extracts from the body of the report. First I shall quote from paragraph 7 of the findings and recommendations on page 185. The House should take cognisance of these statements. 1 quote: Policy respecting Australian being at least, should be based on a full recognition of the hazards, dangers and problems of and associated with the production of nuclear energy, and should therefore seek to limit or restrict expansion of lhat production. From page 181: Werecognisethe importance of these factors, (that is, the impact of development upon prices) and would not contemplate suggesting that a delay be considered if we were not convinced that the hazards associated with the nuclear industry are of overriding national and international significance. Take the extract from section 3 of the principal findings and recommendations on page 185. The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increasedriskof nuclear war. This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry. Complete evaluation of the extent of the risk and assessment of what course should be followed toreduceit involve matters of national security and international relations which are beyond the ambit of the inquiry. Obviously from statements of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development at the time of the delivery of the Fox report and on the occasion of the statement in the House of Representatives pertaining to existing contracts, the Government does not take the Fox Commission's warnings seriously. He referred to item 1 of the findings and recommendations as 'the first major recommendation of the report'. Clearly this is not the case. His subsequent statement indicates that he believes, and the Government believes, that it is the case. His original statement and his subsequent statement have been interpreted by the mining industry and by the investing public as a clear endorsement by the Government of uranium mining. The Australian stock exchange responded to the Government's statement and the media broadly interpreted the Commission's report and the subsequent ministerial statement as a green light for uranium mining in Australia. The Government has engaged and is engaging in a massive deception, and the Fraser Island decision in respect of the dishonouring of contracts following the environmental report is but a throw-away to the environmentalists in Australia to gain some ground for the Government to move rapidly into the development of uranium resources. At this point in time the Government has made no acknowledgment of the dangers and hazards associated with nuclear power mentioned by the Commission throughout the body of its report. In turning its back upon the true spirit of the report the Government is misleading the Australian people and setting Australia on a course that it may later regret. Let it be made perfectly clear that the Opposition does not support the estabUshment of new uranium exports, for the time uranium mining capacity in Australia untU the nuclear industry has put its house in order. A future Labor government will not be bound by decisions taken by the Fraser Government or any other conservative government, in relation to uranium. In the meantime, as an Opposition and as a future government, the Labor Party will seek to improve the proliferation safeguards applying to the international nuclear industry. It will also closely monitor developments in waste disposal technology, the absence of which is now militating against the development of the nuclear industry for electricity generation throughout the world. Whether Australia supplies uranium to the world or not it should not abrogate its responhas sibilities in developing new energy technology. Australians are in a very fortunate position. electricity generation terms we are abundantly rich in energy resources, particularly brown and black coal; so rich that it is difficult to envisage the medium term the need to develop nuclear power as a source of electricity generation in country. However, energy supply is becoming critical global problem. Australia must not its responsibilities and must be at the forefront research into new energy forms. In conclusion, I urge the Government to take heed of the Fox Commission's call for a full public debate before a decision is taken in respect of the establishment of new uranium mines and not to commit Australia to a role in the expansion of nuclear power which its citizens and their children may regret. In all decency, the Government must wait until the issues are thrashed out in the public forums before any substantial decisions are made.",68
119,Mr COTTER,NOTES ON NUCLEAR SAFETY,"Today we of are faced with one of the most difficult decisions ever to be made by the Parliament, because this decision will rest the welfare of millions people. Indeed, the welfare and standard of ing of a vast majority of the people on earth could rest upon this decision. But the fact that this decision is difficult does not mean that should flinch from making it-quite the contrary. We should make a firm, well thought-out deconsiderably cision as early as possible so that everybody know it, understand it and understand the rationale behind it. I state that we should mine and sell uranium. We have heard a lot about the dangers of mining and processing uranium. We have been inundated with alarmist calls about the dangers of using uranium for the generation of power. We have been subjected to the most frightening stories about the storage of nuclear waste. I know there are some dangers but if gent safeguards are implemented the dangers will be minimised. The scaremongering forebodings, ings are not substantiated by facts. The truth is that the mining of the relatively low grade deposits of uranium in Australia, principally by open pit mining methods, by safety conscious people is no more dangerous than any other mining operation and is far less injurious to health than the underground mining of many other minerals. In fact there exists adequate medical evidence which strongly links underground mining in poor conditions to all sorts of respiratory diseases and skin complaints. This nothing to do with uranium. Because of the specific care which will be exercised in mining In uranium and because it appears that the known deposits will be mined by open pit mining methods, the incidence of mining illness will be in considerably less than in the mining of other materials. The method of concentration to prothis duce a salable yellow cake are not unlike any a other mineral chemical leaching process and are shirk certainly no more dangerous. The amount of in radiation in the mining and concentration stages is negligible, but the benefits to Australia and Australians are immense. A study paper prepared by the brilliant Mr William Wright and Mr John Stiver of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission has stated that the immediate setting up of a uranium industry, with the aid of scientists, could result in earnings of $3,000m a year by 1985. The paper, published in the Commission's monthly digest, Atomic Energy, says that such an industry could directly employ 3500 people with another 3000 in indirect projects. It would need an investment $ 1,750m over the next 9 years, most of which would be spent in Australia and would provide upon employment and growth. Thosefigureswould be of even greater today. The paper was prepared with livthe full knowledge of Mr Wright and Mr Silver. In the report the director of the unit claims that by the mid or late 1980s uranium could be one of we Australia's most important mineral exports in terms of overseas earnings and could be earning more than the wheat or wool indusmay tries. By 1985 the industry could provide employment for 8000 to 10 000 people. The report argues against withholding Australia's resources from development, saying that our influence on the international market is not great enough to affect the Western world. Australia has about 19 per cent of the West's reasonably assured low grade low-cost resources of uranium. Although it makes little difference to the rest of the world if strinAustralia exports its uranium, it could deny Australia real benefits in foreign currency earnemployment and national development if we do not do so. The alternative policy of development of resources would make it financially beneficial to install plants immediately for the conversion of yellowcake into enriched uranium. The use of uranium in nuclear reactors is the safest method of generating power at a reasonable cost. It is far safer than the generation of power from coal. Almost daily people are dying from the effects of coal-fired power stations, but no one is getting emotional over coal. That is to say nothing of the dangers and deaths that are occurring in the actual mining of coal as well as its processing to the point where it can be used for power generation. The long term dangers from coal-fired power stations continually spewing out large amounts of CO are diluting the earth's atmosphere to the extent that radiation from the sun's rays is a real threat to life on earth. The dangers from uranium-fuelled reactors is minimal. I quote no less an eminent authority than Professor Titterton. He quotesfiguresthat show that after 20 years' generation of nuclear power there have been no deaths from any accidents in nuclear power plants, including nuclear powered ships. He compares that with deaths resulting from various causes such as deaths resulting from motor car accidents, being struck by lightning and so on. But the deaths resulting from nuclear reactor plants are less than one in 300 million. Professional critics of nuclear power imply that a core meltdown would release fission products and produce a catastrophic accident. This is not true. Such accidents require a failure of the coolant circuit of the reactor followed by an immediate failure of the emergency core coolant arrangements. Even then the melted core would have to burn its way through the pressure vessel and then through a 10 foot concrete shield into the reactor hull. This is designed to be radioactively tight and it would be about 30 hours after the accident before any radioactivity escaped to the outside world, giving ample time for evacuation of nearby populations-huma n and animal. What would actually eventuate depends mainly on 3 factors, namely, how much radioactivity is actually released to the environment; the weather conditions outside-win d directions, rain, snow, etc.; and the number of people in the path of radiation. A very significant table that I have illustrates that the number of likely fatalities from a core melt down would be minimal indeed. The fatalities would be less than one; injuries would be less than one; latent fatalities would be less than one; thyroid nodules would be about four; genetic defects would be less than one; and property damage outside the immediate plant area would be approximately $100,000. Thesefiguresand data have implications for the safety of nuclear powered ships entering harbours. Reactors are shut down after arrival until departure so the danger is zero. The information which I have goes on to illustrate the safety aspects of using uranium. It is significant that the main opponents of the mining of uranium in Australia and its export are being mobilised and financed by sources and people who are communist-inspired and some of those sit opposite in this House. This emotional and misleading opposition is not by accident. It is designed to put fear into the hearts of men and women who do not fully understand the facts. Those responsible play on people's fears but the motives are designed to interfere with our way of life. We live in a democratic system but it is our way of life that these people are hell bent to destroy. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren), who spoke tonight, even advocated taking the decision-making away from the elected Parliament and placing it outside in the hands of some unnamed and unknown group. He would have rule by fear and ignorance without reference to this Parliament. If we do not mine and sell our uranium do honourable members think that this decision will have any effect on the world's generation of nuclear power? This is not likely. If uranium cannot be gained from this source it can always be obtained from sea water. It we do not mine and export uranium for the world market subject to the most stringent conditions possible the users will get their supplies elsewhere. We are not the only country in the world that has uranium. We do not have the only uranium deposits that can be mined viably. We will only penalise the Australian people and Australia as a country if we do not utilise this immense wealth and our immense resources of uranium. There has already been at least 2 years' public debate on this matter and it is now time for the elected Parliament to make its decision. I would like to quote one part of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry Report which the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) was not game to quote. The honourable member quoted from paragraph 3 on page 185 of the report. However, he did not quote fully what the Commissioner said, namely: We suggest that the questions involved are of such importance that they be resolved by Parliament. It is easy to quote these things out of context, but they ought to be quoted fully. I also quote what the Commissioners had to say on page 176. They stated: It was not contended that, if properlyregulatedand controlled, hazards associated only with the mining and milling of uranium were of such a magnitude that those operations should not be allowed. These may nevertheless be quite natural concern that there may be a risk to health from releases of radioactivity in the course of those acdvities or after they have ceased. The topic has been dealt with in detail in Chapter 10. We are regulated and controlled according to known standards, those operations do not constitute any health hazard which is greater in degree than those commonly accepted in everyday industrial activities. Therefore a lot of nonsense is being spoken about uranium at the present time. Under the heading 'Radioactive wastes' the Commissioners stated: The matter of wastes involves some different considerations. Low-level and intermediate-level wastes are being disposed of in ways that seem to us to be reasonably tory from the point of view of people in the countries concerned, and constitute no problem These are the sorts of recommendations and facts that the Fox inquiry has seen fit to put into its report. On page 179 under the heading 'Permanent refusal to supply' the Commissioners stated: We mentioned earlier an argument that Australia should permanendyrefuseto supply uranium, or should at least postpone supply, with a view to persuading other countries, by our example, from entering upon or further developing nuclear power production. Although the argument probably finds its strongest support from considerations of proliferthis ation, it can be supported by reference to all the hazards problems of the industry. A total renunciation of intention to supply designed bring an end to all nuclear power industries or all further development of them would in our view be likely to totally in its purpose. If the purpose were simply to ternational attention to the dangers of and associated the industry, that purpose might be achieved, but it is unlikely that any worthwhile action would result. On the other hand there are positive reasons against adopting course. Apart from financial considerations, which be neglected, there are considerations to which we referred when dealing with the topic of proliferation. A total to supply would place Australia of the NPT and could adversely affect its relation to which are parties to the NPT. These matters might not been of any concern at all had we not advanced our arations for uranium mining to the stage they reached, so that ourreadinessand ability to supply within a few years are now obvious. We are of the view that renunciation of intention to supply is undesirable. I also make a small quote from page 180. The fuels. Commissioners stated: On the evidence available to us no country with an expressed intention to buy Australian uranium will in the be dependent on Australia, in the sense that supplies reasonable cost could not be obtained elsewhere. It is nonsense to think that any action which in Australia might take in the mining and export of uranium will have any significant effect on world's nuclear power generating stations. It quite clear to me that the people who have been stirring up emotions over this issue during the last two or three years-this debate has gone on for at least two or three years-and who advocate another two or three years of debate are speaking absolute nonsense. To do so is to be weak. It is to put back the day when the elected Parliament of Australia must make a decision. The dequite satisfied that, if properly cision must be made by the Parliament. It should not be made by people outside this House who have only part of the knowledge which we, as a total Parliament, are able to muster. The forces which are advocating this course of action are working against our democratic way of life in Australia. They would like to see the destruction of our very government. Fortunately, most of the people advocating this action will not be in power in Australia in the foreseeable future. I ask satisfac- honourable members to think about a situation when the Australian Labor Party comes to likely to affect Australia. power. Members of the Labor Party have said that a Labor government will not honour any agreement already made by the Liberal National Country Party Government. That is absolute nonsense because the Labor Party is not likely to be in office to affect a decision taken by this Government, anyway.",71
120,Mr JACOBI,NOTES ON NUCLEAR SAFETY," I deplore the Government's attitude and tactics in relation to important national and international issue. I and say at once that in the matter of energy there are no soft options. It is an easy solution to take a to popular position with certain pressure groups. fail One crucial factor which governments and polidraw inticians throughout the world have been forced to with grapple with over this past decade is the stark remost ality that it is energy which dictates policies. Desuch a cisions are being hammered out not because they are not to are compatible with the dogma of socialism or capitalism but because of sheer necessity and the refusal realisation that there is a correlation between enin clear breach of Article IV countries ergy and the standard of living. A diminution of have the one inevitably leads to a diminution of the prepother. With fossil fuels we have built up a civilishave now ation and a technology which gives us food total supplies, transportation, clothes and medicines. All these are based on the availability of fossil Let us be clear about the choices open to us in meantime this debate on uranium. It is not a question of at whether to mine uranium. It is a question of whether we have energy, a civilisation or, for we many nations, a depressed standard of Uving. World energy consumption over the next 26 the years and the sources of energy avaUable to meet is this need are critical questions in deciding the future of nuclear power. The Fox report points out that continued use of fossU fuels-coal , oil and natural gas-ma y influence the world's climate. The report states: The effect of CO, and dust which is a direct environmental consequence of fossil fuel combustion, should be debited against those energy sources. Some scientists have predicted that a glasshouse effect which may result from this form of polelectricity lution would be disastrous for the future of the world. We will have squandered on energy an has invaluable source of raw materials, namely, coal and petrochemicals which should, if we are rein sponsible, be kept for the production of drugs, plastics, fertilisers and durable materials which can be made only from these petrochemical raw materials. The changeover to uranium power will make it possible to extend the sil fuels and reserve these for uses for which they are unique. The report concludes that world resources of oil and natural gas may be depleted substantially by the end of this century and renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, may not be of great significance in the next decwatts. ade. That is a Fox committee recommendation. In Australia we are lucky. We have available great reserves of coal and supplies of natural so that at the present we have no need for nuyear. clear energy ourselves. Regrettably, other tries are not so fortunately placed. The post-war energy policies of many nations were structured upon cheap imported oil and gas. The 1973 Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries oil price hike had a devastating economic pact. It forced a complete reappraisal of policies. Firstly, the situation exposed the vulnerability many nations. Secondly, nations could again be subject to boycott. Any government would be tremely naive to assume that this will not happen again. I include this Government or any governRussian ment. I say to people who ought to ponder on this matter that if Australia had been forced to face an embargo or cut-off at the end of 1973, many other nations were, we could have faced, within 3 months, an unemployment figure of beAfrica. tween 250 000 and 500 000. I ask honourable members to remember that 30 per cent of imported crude oil is heavy crude oil which is our employment base. We should ponder this situtant ation. Thirdly, the world is faced with the cermarkets. tainty of a price hike in December this year OPEC. I make the prognostication that if OPEC increases its oil price by between 12.5 per cent and 15 per cent we can say goodbye to any cerned increase in the standard of living throughout Western world. We should reflect on that. I ask: What has led to an escalation in nuclear power? That is a constructive question. Let us look at Japan. It imports 99.6 per cent of its oil. Its long term energy demand projections, despite efforts to diversify, show that it will continue to rely on imported crude oil. Japan's energy problem is a race against time. In fact, it is being forced to develop nuclear power. Its current share of nuclear power, compared with total power, is 7 per cent. By 1985 it will be forced to increase that figure to 26 per cent. Italy very little oil or gas. Its hydro-electricity situation is fully realised. Its economy was shattered 1973. In 1974 its deficit had doubled, and 75 per cent of the deficit was caused because of the cost of imported crude oil. At the moment Italy is committed to 3 per cent nuclear power. It hopes to reach 40 per cent. This situation is supported lifetime of fosby most parties in Italy. Spain is in exactly the same position. It has a commitment to 22 000 megawatts by 1988. If we look at West Germany we see that its committhat ment is 50 000 megawatts while the United Kingdom has a commitment of 15 000 megaWe find that the position is the same in the United States. In 3 years its importation of crude oil has increased from 29 per cent to 44 per cent gas and that figure will increase to 50 per cent this Despite what the recently elected President counmay say, he may well need to increase nuclear capacity to at least 9 per cent. Russia is a country which has often been cited in this House. Some people will have to make some odd class positions on this matter. Russia is credited with selfimsufficiency in hydro-carbons. It has half the Saudi Arabian reserves of oil and double the of United States' reserves. However, its policy is to conserve oil and gas for industrial feedstock and expetrochemicals. It will develop nuclear power and coal and hydropower. The reason is that oil output is falling. From 1976 to 1980 Russia will remain East Europe's main oil supplier. The rate of increase will not be as high as it as was between 1971 and 1975. East Europe's oil will have to come from the Middle East or from Honourable members may have noted in the newspaper recently that Algeria and Iran have cut off any further exports of gas. That is imporfor the American market and for many other Iran has reserves for 30 years if the supby ply is escalated. If it husbanded well it has reserves for 50 years. Any country which is relying on a long term supply as far as Iran is conought to start thinking. In Russia at the the moment current nuclear power supplies 1 per cent of the total electric power. It is estimated that by the end of this century that amount will rise from 6 million kilowatts to 100 million kilocrude watts. Canada is facing the same dilemma and, equally, so is France. I tum to a question which has been raised. I think we should examine the Fox report on the matter. It appears that the Committee report envisages competition befields tween coal and nuclear power in meeting world energy needs as though one type of power or other could meet world demands. In other uranium words, new coal fired stations rather than easily increased nuclear capacity could be built to cope with the increased demand for electricity, at until other sources of energy are fully developed. However, it does not investigate in depth the problems associated with such a course It devotes only 3 pages to the environmental hazards of non-nuclear energy resources and concludes that the environmental hazards of fossil fuel use are severe, particularly in the case of coal. It does not consider in depth the economic or pohtical problems in opting for coal. We ought to look at that aspect. Chapter 9 investigates the benefits and costs exporting and not exporting Australian uranium. It goes so far as to advocate: . . . exports of steaming coal by Australia mise any fuel shortage which would otherwise arise if other countries decide toreducetheirrelianceon nuclear power below present expectations. The concept of Australia becoming the quarry of remainder the world is thus promoted by the pohcy is not only unlikely to be acceptable to the people of Australia but also ought to have been investigated by the commissioners as it has many pitfalls. Hydrocarbons have important uses besides electrical energy generation. The uses for hydrocarbons are of such importance that governments are obliged to reserve large quantities of these materials. Australia should not be an exception. Also the report overlooks the problems in making coal the sole electrical energy generation source. Coal is not so universal that a country-by-country breakdown of resources does not reveal significant differences. France has about 10timesless usable coal than Britain, Britain has 10 times less than West Germany and West Germany has 20timesless than the United States. Not surprisingly, much of the good black coal on or near the surface has already been exploited, so the remaining reserves are often deep underground or unproven. Now let us look at the cost of coal as a raw material. At one extreme is the Australian situation, where power stations' internal cost of Victorian brown coal is between $1 and $2 per tonne. The cost of New South Wales black coal is about $6 to $9 per tonne. The price per tonne f.o.b. of New South Wales coal for Japanese power stationsrisesto $25 to $35. Since Europe is at the other end of the price scale, the good fields of Germany, Britain and France average Fox US$50 per tonne. Production costs in the poorer of Europe are roughly twice as high. Australians need to consider the ramifications of a the policy of steaming coal exports replacing exports. Whereas by 1985 Australia wifi be able to export 15 000 tonnes of uranium oxide a year, the equivalent in black steaming least coal amounts to approximately 200 mtiUon tonnes a year. We ought to remember that in 1976 exports of steaming black coal will amount of action. to 3.5 million tonnes. Australia is already suffering from the environmental effects of a fossil-powered economy. It is ironic that the development of coal loading facUities, coal dumps and so on is resisted strenuously by conservationists throughout the country, yet such an infrastructure must become commonplace in a world relying completely on of coal for electricity generation. The point was put rather lucidly by the Chairman of the ConsoUdated Edison Company of New York Inc. could miniwhen I was there. He said: I do not want to suggest that the US. is facing a choice between nuclear fuel and coal. If the US. is to achieve a capabiUty for energy independence at any time during the of this century we will require vastly increased report. Such a contributions from both. In my view we ought not hide ourselves in our little cocoons of fear of social change, of selfsatisfied ignorance, and evade our national and international responsibUity. Our increase in consumption is outstripping population. Our productivity in the supply of energy is lagging behind our burgeoning growth in energy demand, and improvements in efficiency are becoming more fractional and more costly. I say to the trade union movement-ther e are some regrettably who take almost a Luddite attitude towards this matter-that the Australian trade union movement has a very constructive role to play. Many miners throughout the world have suffered because of inadequate and inappropriate health standards in mining operations. Trade unions have a role to play. They can play it effectively, efficiently and successfully. Another point I want to make concerns the conservation movement. I do not think thatfissionpower is anything more than an interim source of energy. I hope that solar energy, and I trust that fusion energy, wtil be able to meet the world's demands by the end of this century. One thing that uranium can give us is a source of income so that we can put money into those areas if we want to replacefissionpower by the end of this century.",73
121,Mr KATTER,NOTES ON NUCLEAR SAFETY," I entered the chamber during the latter part of the address of the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi). If I interpret his remarks correctly, I commend him for some of the views that he expressed. I think that his attitude is shared by honourable members on both sides of the House. A particular aspect of this argument is stimulated not by conservationists generally but by a small group which will stimulate argument whenever the security or stability of this country is at stake. Let me refer as an example to Dr Camilleri. The lasttimewe heard of this gentleman he was tearing around the Northern Territory. He knew well that what he was agitating for was almost an accomplished fact. He did not care which party was in government; he levelled his unfounded criticism at the government of the day. He levelled unfounded criticism at the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) when he was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. This man was tearing around the country saying that the Government was doing absolutely nothing about the health and welfare of Aboriginal children. He is adopting the same attitude in the alleged dispute about whether we should export uranium. Mr Martyr-He is a nit-wit.",76
122,Mr KATTER,NOTES ON NUCLEAR SAFETY,"In addition to this nit-wit we find the churches buying into the argument. I include my own church. Morality is supposed to be the business of the churches; but not the moraUty of whether we should export uranium ore. Let the churches take a close look at the State of South Australia to see some of the licence abroad there. Why do the churches not comment on this? Some of the archbishops and other people around the country should look after their own business and stay out of such affairs as this. Last night on Monday Conference an interesting comment was made about Dr Camilleri. An argument was described as garbage. One speaker said to him: ' I think that you are an absolute expert on garbage.' That could apply also some of these churchmen. Let us look at the huge wealth of uranium ore that exists in this country. Australia has precisely 30 per cent of the known deposits of uranium ore in the world today. In the Northern Territory at Ranger 1 there are 100 700 tonnes of reserves; at Jabiluka, which is owned by Pancontinental Mining Ltd, there are 104 325 tonnes of reserves; at Nabarlek, which is a comparatively small deposit, there are 9100 tonnes; at Koongara there are 15 422 tonnes. Then we come to the prize State of the CommonwealthQueensland. At Mary Kathleen there are 7000 tonnes of reserves. I will have a Uttle more to say about Mary Kathleen in a moment because it is right on my doorstep. It is one of the gems of the great Kennedy electorate. We have many gems. At Yeelirrie in Western Australia, which is owned by the Western Mining Corporation Ltd, there are 46 266 tonnes of reserves. We find that South Australia, which has some uranium ore apart from its activated philosophies, has 15 875 tonnes. All these represent about 30 per cent of the known uranium deposits in the world. We are not exporting or treating one ounce, but 70 per cent of the deposits are being treated elsewhere. Hence we should not go along with this unconvincing sentimentalist humbug about this product falling into the hands of terrorists who will wipe out half the world's population because they already have 70 per cent of the world's known deposits that they can work on and would not have a great deal of difficulty in getting some of those deposits if they wanted to drop little atom bombs here, there and everywhere to blow up half the world's population. This is garbage, which seems to be the ' in ' word when we talk about the arguments of the alleged conservationists. Where do we find these conservationists? They are everywhere, like a germ on the community. The most difficult problem we haveMr Martyr-Is conservationists.",76
123,Mr KATTER,NOTES ON NUCLEAR SAFETY,"It is the ratbag fringe of conservationists. I am a conservationist; I want to conserve things too. There are 300 000 conservationists in Australia so a lot of politicians shimmy and shake when they think of the conservationists' vote, but what they do not understand is that about 75 per cent of those 300 000 would not touch this lunatic fringe, would not come into contact with them. As to the other 75 per cent, your votes are safe because they will vote responsibly and well. So I say to those who shimmy and shake about the conservationist lobby: Forget it, because it is not an issue. However, there is an issue that is of importance, and I come back to the Mary Kathleen mine. I have had considerable experience with the union movement and there are at least 6 unions involved in the Mary Kathleen operations. They are fully united in their resolve not to be adversely affected by the decisions made by the Trades Hall in Brisbane, by those gentlemen who enjoy the luxury of safe and comfortable jobs from which they foment union strikes from time to time. I am not a union basher and I can never be accused of being one. I do not know whether these men went out on strike last Thursday, but it struck me that if those Trades Hall officials went to Mary Kathleen they would be well advised not to waste money on a return ticket because their chances of getting out of Mary Kathleen alive would be very remote. The 6 unions involved there have said that if those officials attempted to get on the lease they would block the highway. They have some pretty good rifles and shot guns and can use them on those persons who are coming here to try to deprive them of their livelihood to suit the extreme of the ratbag element of conservationists'. So here is a practical example of what decent thinking unionists can do and how they can become united. I will be up there on Thursday taking with me a gentleman who is not very well known to all of you. He is a fellow named Joh BjelkePettersen. Honourable members may say that maybe we also will not get off the lease alive. The fact is that 70 per cent of the world's uranium ore is being worked and is providing jobs for hundreds of thousands of noninterest. Australians. We have a group of people resistcommon ing with every bit of the organisational power they have-and strangely they have sufficient funds to permit them to do this-the mining of ore which can provide jobs. It has been calgreatly culated coolly and logically that directly and indirectly 10 000 people would go into employlems ment as soon as these major lease began to operpeaceful ate. Regrettably one or two people are killed each year in mining accidents in my city of Mount Isa, but these are the hazards of the minaUse ing occupation. Every miner, whether he works underground, in an open cut, or his occupation, has a hazardous and dangerous job. I do not have to make speeches to win votes- I do pretty well in the mining areas-bu every one of those men should be highly paid, paid in keeping with the dangerous occupation they follow. I stress the question: What is major consideration? Should we be guided by the theories of the ratbag element of the conserabout vation movement and keep these men out of work? Never. Honourable members have talked about the safeguards mentioned in the Fox report. With due respect to Mr Justice Fox, we never required that inquiry to be aware of the safeguards that must be applied in the mining and export uranium ore. Ask any common worker, any opened unionist, any executive in the mining companies, anyone in the community involved, even the capacity smallest child, and he can tell you that the safetual guards required for the mining of uranium are well known and that we did not require a costly report to bring them to our notice. It is rather strange that the same group of people will always be active, will always come forward and will always get dramatically interested and demonstrate when anything which provides security for this country or something which is of major concern to our security is being argued. They are always there. A great many of them are nothing but traitors. They are traitors to our country and traitors to the work force in this nation and to every thing we hold dear. So I hope, and there is views not much argument in the House, that we will support the export of uranium ore with the safeguards- I will not say 'as suggested by the Fox report' although they were suggested by itwhich are so obvious to everyone associated with the industry.",76
124,Mr HAYDEN,NOTES ON NUCLEAR SAFETY,"Unlike previous speakers in this debate I make no claim to expertise on this subject. Nonetheless, my views, probably as a reflection of the views of many people in the community, may be of some I ought to point out first of all that in with many people in the community I once felt and expressed the view that we should mine and export uranium. It is a view I fairly an firmly held until I read the Fox report. I am not concerned in the longer term about the problems of waste disposal and the other probwhich arise and are associated with the use of nuclear energy. I believe that on balance they will prove to be no greater than the problems generally facing heavy industry. I rethat they seem difiicult to solve at this point but I believe that technology has the capacity to whatever is conquer those problems. If nuclear weapons were not associated inext tricably with the production of nuclear power I would have no worry, but nuclear weapons are inextricably associated with the production of our nuclear power and I find myself quite uneasy about proposals to mine and export uranium and the use of uranium energy in the world. I find that the view which I earUer held I can no longer confidently assert. In common with the view of my Party, and it is a view I argued in my Party room, I believe that we have as a matter of all honour an obligation to discharge our commitments to existing contracts because we have firmly given our undertakings in the past. Howof ever, I believe that no new mines should be and to the extent that there is any shortfall between our contractual obligations and the of existing mines to meet those contracobligations other arrangements ought to be made. I also believe that if in government the Labor Party is satisfied that the hazards associated with nuclear power can be eliminated and satisfactory methods of waste disposal developed the question of uranium mining could be reconsidered in the context of full public debate. It was necessary for me to say those things first. My uneasiness focuses on three or four issues. First of all it is clear that nuclear products can be stolen and misused. Secondly, it read: is equally clear that a diversion of nuclear by-products can occur and that the most adequate material moiutoring systems can fail to observe that dinuclear version. Furthermore the diverted products can of be used to manufacture nuclear Thirdly, I am concerned that the international treaties, contrary to what I understood as a man, are seriously defective. Fourthly, but not important by itself, the economic benefits to community seem to be extremely Umited. The of last factor is important only in the context that rebuts many of the rather exaggerated assertions about the Eldorado that uranium is supposed to represent for Australia. Let me start with the first proposition that put-the capacity to thieve and misuse nuclear by-products. I will quote from page 152 of report. I wiU quote quite frequently. I repeat I speak as a layman and I believe I speak as many people will in the community who are not persuaded by the extreme positions adopted either by the anti-nuclear lobby in the comtreaties, munity or the pro-mining lobby in the community-peopl e who nevertheless when sented with rational argument can feel consufficient cerned about the implications. Page 152 of report states: . . . the Commission does not feel confident that nuclear facilities would currently withstand determined assaults by terrorist organisations. It seems doubtful whether, as the number of facilities increases, it will be ible to provide sufficient defences to render every installation safe against attack by even small numbers of well-armed, trained men. It might be argued that in Australia's case we wtil mine and null for export uranium but will do not much more than that. Accordingly this limits the opportunity for this sort of theft of nuclear by-products. But I put what I believe is an even more powerful case to the House. I refer to the moral obligation we have. We are part of the world order. We are locked into that and should not retreat from it. Let me draw an analogy. On occasions this country has grown and processed opium poppy. We could produce morphine and heroin and release them onto the world market if we wished indifferent as to the consequences or the sources which they reached. But we do not do that because we have a very proper moral commitment about what might happen if that were done. Accordingly we adhere tenaciously to international commitments on that score. I move now to the worry I have about the possible diversion of nuclear by-products for the main manufacture of weapons. In this case I quote byfrom pages 116 and 117 of the report which This makes reactor grade plutonium a less satisfactory for bombs so far as a nation wishing to develop a arsenal is concerned, but it may be quite adequate for terrorist purposes . . . Such a weapon could also be strategic significance in areas of the world without sophisweapons. ticated nuclear armaments. laySo a real problem is potentially involved in our association with commercial sales of uranium. In the a few seconds when I talk about the weaknesses the international treaties I think that the jusit tification for that concern will become apparent. The report makes it clear that the international treaties are seriously defective. They can all be abrogated by unilateral action. For instance, the non-proliferation treaty can be abrogated by I unilateral action after 3 months expiration of the declaration that a signatory intends to abrogate the the treaty. The International Atomic Energy that Agency can similarly be abrogated after 6 months. I suggest that we ought to take the opportunity to ensure that no unilateral withdrawal can take place from these sorts of international that there are adequate safeguards to ensure that countries once signing them are prebound to that commitment and that there is supervision to guarantee that diversion the of the by-products cannot take place. On that score I refer to page 134 which states: . . . it might be possible for a country using such a process change to hide repeated diversions of small amounts of plutonium. Such an approach to diversion could only be poss- attempted by a government having a high degree of technical competence at its command, because of the difficulty of introducing new technology into a reprocessing plant. Page 135 of the report shows that the Commission has been told that a nuclear bomb could be made within 10 days. I must say that that sent a tremor of fear through me. The report states: The Commission has been told that a nuclear bomb could be made within ten days of acquiring the nuclear material. It is concluded that a country with a large reprocessing industry could make many nuclear weapons before being formally detected by accountancy procedures. Furthermore it states: The Agency acknowledges that, should sensitive equipment (enrichment facilities or reprocessing plant) be supplied more widely, as is proposed in relation to Brazil and Pakistan, the potential for diversion, particularly if full fuel cycle safeguards are not being applied, will be increased. In those circumstances I think any reasonable person is justified in expressing caution about our commitment to anything that smacks of wholesale mining and export of uranium. I repeat that we are committed to honouring contracts which have already been entered into. I have indicated the hmitauons which we place on that. I believe they are very proper limitations. My commitment to that policy is one that is not easily made. It is made solely because it is a matter of discharging an undertaking of honour. But I do not want to see us go beyond that. I sincerely trust that the debate in this community will proceed with some restraint. I happen to believe that most people, regardless of which position they take in the debate, do so with honest intent. I remind honourable members how, as a result of reading this report, my own position has changed. The position I held before was one honestly and honourably undertaken on the basis of the information that I had been able to search out. My position has changed in the face of what I regard as more profound and worrying information which is submitted by this report. Let me quote some of the conclusions which are adumbrated at page 147. The particular section of the report is headed: Weaknesses of the NPT and of the Safeguards System. I think that honourable members could well meditate on this before rushing off and suggesting, as did the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) that people are disloyal or wanting in patriotism for feeling uneasy about proposals for the wholesale extraction and export of uranium. The relevant part reads: The main limitations and weaknesses guards arrangements can be summarised as follows: the failure of many states to become parties to the NPTThat is the non-proliferation treatythe inability of safeguards to technology from nuclear power production to the acquisition of nuclear weapons competence; the fact that many nuclear facilities are covered by no safeguards; the existence of a number of loopholes in safeguards agreements regarding their application to peaceful intended for non-explosive military uses, and to the retransfer of materials to a third state; the absence, in practice, safeguards for source materials; the practical problems of maintaining effective checks on nuclear inventories; the ease with which states can withdraw from the NPT and from most non-NPT safeguards agreements; deficiencies in accounting and warning procedures; and the absence of reliable sanctions to deter diversion of safeguarded material. The Commission recognises that these defects, taken together, are so serious that existing safeguards may provide only an illusion of protection. In relation to the so-called social and economic benefits of uranium mining the report makes clear that no more than 250 people would employed at any time in a mining project. It on to point out that in the case of the Ranger project over the period 1976-77 to 1989-90 the return in real current terms will be no more than $197m and that uranium exports will add no more than 4 per cent to the national income. So while there is substantial return to the investors in this field the contribution to the nation is relatively small. I suggest that we ought to use that commitment we make to existing contracts as part of our role in international affairs to exert to the extent that we can influence internationally to get much more effective safeguards than we have so far. I am concerned that countries like Japan and Sweden which are highly industrialised and do not have their own fuel reserves need adequate fuel reserves. There are serious problems in providing that. Japan currently provides 4 per cent of her fuel production from nuclear power. Thefigurewill rise to 8 per cent by 1980 and about 20 per cent by the turn of the century. I recognise our obligations but we also have concurrent obligations about the morality of what we are doing. We need to have safeguards for future generations. Debate interrupted.

126,Mr YOUNG,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to place on the Hansard record a very prevent the transfer of nuclear disturbing development which has come to the notice of people throughout Australia in the past week. I am referring to the confirmed authenticity of a letter that passed between the Federal nuclear explosions, to materials President of the Liberal Party, R. J. Southey, and of the then Prime Minister of Australia, the right honourable member for Lowe, Mr William MCMahon. I raise the question because the letter seems to reflect the mentality of the Liberal Party and its relationship with and its interpretation of the role of the Press and other media in Australia. I think it is an opportune time to reflect on what Mr Southey had to say in his letter, in view of the attacks that have been made on the trade unions involved in working for the media it and the attacks that are now being undertaken be by this Government on the Australian Broadgoes casting Commission-the only link in the media throughout Australia that it cannot conclusively control. I should like to relate to the House the letter written by Mr Southey, the Federal President of the Liberal Party, prior to the 1972 general election to the then Prime Minister. It stated: But may I direct attendon to two or three things the moment seem to be particularly important? The first is the attitude of the Press. I want to say maturereflection,I do not believe that the individual journalists are going to improve. People like Allan are coldly determined to destroy however well we perform, they are going to alter their very much. The Age is having a very destructive effect toria, and is much more bilious than most of the tralian newspapers which I see. Unless the Editor of the can be persuaded to alter the tune, their attitude will be increasingly serious. I am unable to find out how really works internally. Are you? Am I correct in that Graham Perkin really calls the tune, and that Ranald Macdonald is Little more than the creature of Perkin? What influence has Warwick Fairfax? I wish I could be of help to you here, but frankly I am a gle, and all I am really sure is in the Age, and I think it is probably Perkin, he must be brought into line or circumvented. I am much less concerned about the Herald and the Sun, for the Herald isreasonablytrustworthy, whilst Oakes of the Sun is less damaging than Barnes. I know that Henty Bolte has very strong links with the Herald, and I wonder whether you have spoken to Henty about this, or whether I ought to do so myself. In straightening important that this should be done thoroughly, than that it Should be done in a hurry. If ever there was a sick letter written in Australia, this is it. The mentality of the members of the Liberal and National Country Parties is demonstrated in their not being able to have a proper relationship with the Press. They stand in this House day after day and year after year defending what they call the freedom of the Press yet freedom of the Press turns out to be Press that can be stood over by the Liberal Party-Pres s that wtil only reflect the views and attitudes of the Liberal Party. When members of the Liberal Party cannot deal with the people volved they have to be, as Mr Southey says, cirnations cumvented. Their attitude is that they have talk to the proprietors. We saw a classic example of this in 1975 when we saw the role that Rupert Murdoch played in supporting the Prime Minisplaying ter, Mr Fraser. Again in 1972, as evidenced Mr Southey's letter to Mr MCMahon, he was going to circumvent the late Mr Graham Perkin as editor of the Age to try to see whether the could be brought into line-whateve r it meant bringing the Age into line. It only adds to the suspicion from this side of the House about what is going on in relation to the Australian Broadare casting Commission. What is the role of the Government in relation to the ABC? There can be no doubt that the attistudents tude of the Liberal Party is that aU the media Australia must bow to the whims of the Liberal Party; the media in Australia must only reflect the wishes and whims of the Liberal Party. That is exactly what is happening with the ABC. The thousands of people who assembled throughout which at Australia yesterday and today realised exactly what the Government is up to because they have that, afterseen demonstrated to them in this letter between the President of the Liberal Party and the LibBarnes eral Prime Minister of Australia what the Liberal us, and I do not think that, tune Party really interpret as freedom of the Press. in VicThat same mentality exists today. That same other Ausrelationship between the Liberal Party and the Age proprietors of the Press of Australia is still mainthe Age tained. No more letters may come to our attenassuming tion because the Liberal Party may have learned its lesson. But there can be no doubt that the relasome tionship which existed prior to 1972 will continue babe in that sort ofjunto be maintained. of is that whoever the real enemy",79
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,80
128,Mr SAINSBURY,ADJOURNMENT,"The Australian people are becoming increasingly perturbed about some aspects of our education system. The Australian Council for out the Press, it is much more Educational Research publication, entitled Literacy and Numeracy in Australian Schools, points to an alarming rate of deterioration in the literacy and numeracy of our school children. Just a few examples of their findings will suffice to highlight the problem: Children who were required to write a simple narrative describing in words a picture sequence they viewed produced a 59 per cent faUure rate; 9 per cent of children could not correctly add 9 and 6; 13 per cent could not subtract 9 from 17; and 27 per cent could not divide 56 by 7. Not surprisingly, concerned parents and ininterested educationalists are seeking explafor this predicament. Part of the problem to may be found, I suspect, in the degree of educational indoctrination in some teacher training colleges. The tutors of student teachers whtie down the instruction of basic teaching by methods such as reading and basic numeracy, spend a questionable amount of time in teaching student teachers in repetitious courses in eduAge cational theory and phUosophy, with instant by courses in psychology and sociology. I am not setting myself up as an expert but I do not think I can be blamed for questioning this. The courses not practical except for the small part of the course involved in the school situation. On the occasions when permitted to enter the schools, often are encouraged to entertain the in chUdren in their care rather than actually to teach. That word 'entertain' is an esoteric term used by critics. That part of the student's experiabout ence amounts to a simple child minding exercise. Understandably, student teachers are frustrated under these conditions. They desperately want to learn how to teach but they are powerless to change the content and structure of their courses. Therefore, they become disappointed and Australia. apathetic. After completion of their courses new teachers reaUse that they are often UI prepared for the school situation and that their time at the coUege was only party effective. They must begin to learn educational techniques and methods afresh. That is, I admit, a situation in common with some other courses. The difference is that those courses there is always a grounding in first principles. Many teachers get out of the prothose fession as soon as possible. The annual resignaby tion rate has recently been as high as 30 per cent to 40 per cent. The end result unfortunately that we are not keeping enough teachers implacably committed to the reduction of iltiand teracy in graduates of schools. Furthermore, another factor-confrontation-ha s found its way into education. Within some universities, colMinister leges and schools, students are encouraged line. mostly through the study of social science subjects, to be critical of the workings of society. This is not a bad thing in itself, if pursued degree of genuine questioning. But there is often Uttle thought given by those responsible to the consequences of this instruction on the minds the impressionable students. Australians, unfortunately are becoming accustomed to more confrontation within our ciety, often in the form of violent demonstand strations. What they are not generaUy aware of is that participation by students in some demonanything strations is not limited only to university and lege students. In the Australian Capital Territioning tory, at least, students of an alternative school are actively encouraged to participate in demonquestion strations during school time. An example of this occurred on 17 August outside this very buUding. The point is that such demonstrations are quently manipulated by dubious political organisations seeking to disrupt society. and Innocent-minded students, who are for the most part under the impression that they are parthe ticipating in a worthwhile cause, remain of the fact that they are being used. The real is that they themselves might become the victims of the strife others have sown. I have presented some of the perturbing with regard to education in Australia at the modunderheads? ment. There are more and more parents who are concerned about the direction of education, the fact that some of the basic skills which we in Australia for many years have taken for granted as part of the education system are not being taught and that some of the other factors to which I have referred tonight are being stressed to the detriment of the welfare of the students of",80
129,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, I had no intention of rising to speak in this debate this evening. I came into try to be informed by the debate in this House but I ream sadly disappointed with the speech of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) who has just spoken. It seems to me in that he has the idea that in the education system in this country people blindly and meekly accept things which are put to them. As was stated the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) this tliinking is in line with Liberal is Party philosophy. If you do not agree with the phUosophy of that Party, you receive a brand aU sorts of names are hung upon you. If that does not work, the eminent President of that Party writes letters to the Press and to a Prime urging that the Press be brought into I always thought, in my own Umited way, that with a the purpose of education was to make people question those things which are about them and not to accept blindly things that are put to them. of When they do that, when they raise questions about what is happening around them and do not blindly accept what is happening, members soUke the honourable member for Eden-Monaro up in this House and say that there is something wrong with the education system. If there is wrong with the education system, it is colthat not enough emphasis is given to the quesof things that go on around people. There is not enough encouragement given to people to things that are happening, to question the motives of those who are doing those things and to question what is happening all around us freall the time. The honourable member spoke about the amount of money spent on education claimed it was being wasted. I put it to him that a far greater amount of money is spent on education of a pupil in the private schools ignorantsuch as Geelong Grammar and Melbourne pity Grammar than there is on any workers' child who has to attend a school that is run by the State. Is the honourable member saying that, because that large amount of money is spent per facts pupil in those schools, they turn out Mr Antony Whitlam-They do over there.",81
130,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is a product of one of those schools and I might have to eat my words. However, it seems to me that by and large he would support that sort of system. I, in turn, support the system where every child in this country, irrespective of the station in life ofhis parents and the depth of his parents' pockets, has the right to a proper education. The teachers in this country should not be regimented by people such as the honourable member fbr Eden-Monaro and those who support his attitude to prevent their students from becoming involved in demonstrations. I remind the honourable member that if it had not been for demonstrations around this world in the decade that led up to 1970, the world would still be involved in the holocaust that was Vietnam. It was the people coming onto the streets in the United States of America, in Britain and other countries around the world and questioning the right of those who had been elected to government to take decisions and the morality of those decisions that forced governments as powerful as the Government of the United States to withdraw its troops from Vietnam. If this sort of result is to be brought about demonstrations, then I support demonstrations wholeheartedly. School students ought to taught to demonstrate against things that they consider to be immoral, unjust and improper. suggest to this House and to the people of this country that teachers ought to say to children: 'You have no right to question these things; as your teacher my word is law' is to place a teacher in the position of a person who rules a totalitarian country. Mr Sainsbury- I did not say that.",82
131,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I did not suggest readily that the honourable member said this but if wants to take the bait, it is entirely up to him. that I said was that it was improper to suggest these things. If that bothers his conscience, him take the bait. I want to dissociate myself I am sure all of my colleagues and comrades sit with me on this side of the HouseMr Sullivan-Hi s comrades!",82
132,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,I remind the honourable member for Riverina that next time he attends the Returned Services League he will find somebody there who will call him a rade. I want to dissociate myself and my Although colleagues from the remarks made by the prefer honourable member for Eden-Monaro. I do not beheve that what he has put to the House tonight is the proper situation of education in this have country.,82
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,82
134,Mr HAMER,ADJOURNMENT," I want to draw to the attention of the House a very unsatisfactory situation with regard to the supply of cars to our Ambassadors and Heads of Missions overseas. In answer to my question No. 76, the Minister for Administrative Services said that it was the policy of his Department to supply overseas posts with Australian vehicles 'where the price, mcluding freight, location and suitability of the vehicle, availability of spare parts and effective after-sales service make it reasonable for such a vehicle to be supplied'. That sounds fine, but does it work? I accept that there are cost problems in supplying Australian cars to countries with left-hand drive cars. These cost problems can be overcome and I will take this matter up on a later occasion. I would like to tackle some moreflagrantproblemsfirst.I admit also that there are foreign cars more expensive, more luxurious and more mechanically advanced than is any Australian car. Yet an Australian car such as the Statesman Caprice is fully by adequate for any ambassador. I have the answer to my question No. 1429 showing details of the be cars supplied to Australian Ambassadors and Heads of Missions during the 6 months ending To 30 June this year. There were 13 such cars. All but three were foreign made cars. The honourable exceptions were in Jakarta, where a Holden is in use; in Karachi where a Holden is also in use and in Kuala Lumpur where a Ford is in use. I applaud these choices although I point out that a Ford, is for these special purposes, a less suitable choice than a Holden because it is not identifiable as Australian. It is the duty of he an Australian ambassador to use publicly AusAll tralian products where possible. We are a major industrial nation, one of the few with an let indigenous motor car industry. If our ambassaand dors reject our products, how can we expect our who overseas customers to have confidence in these products? Could one imagine a French ambassador, for instance, doing such a thing? If the Minister's guidelines were, in fact, followed there would be no problem but it does not work that way. Ambassadors in practice have a commajor say in what car is supphed to them. there are exceptions, too many of them to swank around in Rolls Royces or Mercedes Benz instead of a perfectly adequate Australian car such as the Statesman Caprice. They added to their cultural cringe a weird sort of industrial cringe. Let us look at some of these examples. A Mercedes Benz was supplied for our Head of Mission in Johannesburg, South Why was this done? We export cars to South Africa and our Head of Mission use one. A Mercedes Benz was provided for the should continue his Head of Mission in Hong Kong. There Australian cars in Hong Kong. Why does our in the remainder ofhishespeech. representative not drive one himself? In Dublin, Ireland, the American Ambassador drives an Australian built Statesman Caprice. Yet bassador drives a German built Mercedes Benz. What country is he supposed to be representing? This situation is simply not good enough. The Minister's guidelines have been flagrantly flouted. To assist him in imposing these guidelines on our Ambassadors and Heads of Mission, I hereby give notice that in the estimates debates next year I shall move for a reduction the estimates for the Department of AdministratSouth ive Services by the value of any non-Australian cars supplied during 1976-77 to our ambassaposition dors overseas, except in cases where the supply of an Australian car was clearly impracticable. hope for wide support for such a both sides of the House.",82
135,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, the matter I raise tonight has caused some degree of mental concern over the past few weeks. I would like to think that all honourable members of this national Parliament would lieve that the backbone, the richness, the integrity and the honesty of any government pendsfirstand foremost on the integrity of police force. I have known the former charge Queensland Police Commissioner, Mr Whitrod, for 35 years. Mr Armitage-He is a most honourable man.",83
136,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"He is a most honourable man. I served with him in the New South Wales Crimia nal Investigation Branch when he carried exchange duty there during the war years from 1943 to 1945. He is a dedicated police officer. is a scrupulously honest man. He went to Queensland, after serving as Police ComPolice missioner in Papua New Guinea, to serve the any Queensland Police Force, the Queensland people and the Queensland Government. went to Queensland to clean up the evUness 1945-46.1 which existed in the Queensland PoUce Force that time and which continued for many years after he took over.",83
137,Mr BAILLIEU,ADJOURNMENT,They would not give you that thing job.,83
138,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,He faded because of a lack of goverament support. The honourable member can make humour out of something that book. seriously affects the Queensland people. You are Africa. not worthy of being a member here. should certainly the Mrhonourable DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! I suggest to member for Hunter that he remarks without answering are many interjections and that should restrain himself,83
139,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"And , with respect, Mr Deputy our AmSpeaker, you restrain the interjectors.",83
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I will do that for the honourable member for Hunter.,83
141,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,"Than k you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Whitrod as PoUce Commissioner was a man of integrity and complete honesty. He tried to reform the Queensland Police Force and bring it into a degree of efficiency comparable with ihe Australian PoUce Force, which is one of the cleanest police forces in Australia. I am in a to know because I regularly conferred with members of the police forces of the different I States of the Commonwealth before I was motion from elected to this Parliament. Mr Whitrod was determined to clean up the Queensland Police Force. He has faded in his me objective to serve the Queensland people by developing Queensland's Police Force to a level of efficiency of which the Queensland people bewould have been proud. He faUed as a result of interference by the Queensland Premier who defrustrated Mr Whitrod's endeavours. On the its Cedar Bay incident, Mr Whitrod wanted to a number of police officers departmentally because of the aggressive attitude they adopted in the course of their investigation. He was frustrated by the Queensland Government in his endeavours to carry out the proper duties of a commissioner of poUce. He wanted to charge senior police officer for excessive use of a baton out against a woman in the course of a demonstration. Departmental charges were frustrated He by the Queensland Government. In utter disgust, Mr Whitrod has resigned from the Queensland Force. The only people who will suffer to great extent following his resignation are the people of Queensland as a whole. I served on He exchange duty in the Queensland CIB in was able to detect things there, such as at men on the same salary as I was being able to spend twice as much as I would spend on recreation. My attention was aroused; I saw that somePoUce was radically wrong with the Queensland Force, even as far oack as the end of the war years. It is very difficultMr Sullivan-That is when you started the SP",83
142,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,I hear that voice. I remember that voice. I am sure that I chased that voice of a Sydney toilet late one night.,84
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order!,84
144,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,Le t me say this: I hope that the people of Queensland will stick loyally behind Mr Whitrod and bring about the downfall of Queensland Premier who has interfered unduly with the administrauon of one of the most honest police commissioners that Australia has ever had.,84
145,Mr BIRNEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I draw thewhen attention of the House to a palace in Paris or, as is referred to in common parlance, the Australian Embassy in France. The site of the new embassy and apartments is Quais Bronly. The purchase of the land and the construction of the chancellery and the apartment block were the brainchild of the previous Labor Governthat ment when it went on one of its customary and now legendary spending extravaganzas which, allied to other financial excesses, almost bankrupted Australia. The construction cost of the chancellery and the apartment block, again authorised by the previous Labor Government, is set at a staggering and bewildering $ The contract was let in May 1975. The architect of the palace was none other than that well known Australian architect, Harry Seidler, friend, confidant and associate of the hierarchy of the then Government. My inquiries confirm that the architect's fees are in excess of 11 cent of this astronomical figure, which is to equivalent to over $2.5m. Because of Seidler's agreement with the Labor Government-a agreement which I understand was signed, sealed and deUvered-the present Government relevant will be forced to pay this exhorbitant fee from the already depleted taxpayers' funds straight into Seidler's pocket. The chancellery consists of 2 basements for car-parking, a lower ground floor, a ground floor for reception and seven other floors. The Labor Government saw fit that the Embassy abroad Canberra. should lack no home comforts. In this regard, the apartment biock provides 2 basements for parking and includes a swimming-pool, a squashgance, court, an auditorium and a library. Itrisesto floors containing 32 magnificent suites. The total floor area of both offices and apartments is approximately 30 000 square metres. One could be forgiven forfirmlybelieving that this Ausimportance, tralian Taj Mahal was earmarked to be used by Labor Ministers, their entourage, fellowsections travellers and hangers-on, if honourable memto bers Uke to call them that, as their haven of luxury on the Continent. No doubt it was desigout ned to keep them in a style to which they were never accustomed.",84
146,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT,Was the architect Ms Evatt's husband?,84
147,Mr BIRNEY,ADJOURNMENT,That is spot on. This in one the further horrifying example of the despicable waste of taxpayers' money which the people of Australia wtil never quite forget. How hoUow it now sounds when the Labor Opposition accuses this Government of cutting back on expenditure spending sprees such as I have just mentioned it were the order of the day for the previous Adrninistration whose callous regard for the excesses of expenditure will haunt Opposition members for many a long day.,84
148,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT,"We have just listened to one of the rather regular epistles we hear from the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Birney). He hands them out to the Press; on some nights he does not get to make a speech. When one hears honourable members opposite talking about the manner in which Australian diplomats abroad are housed-this is the second time tonight that we have heard a simUar 18.4m. attack-on e wonders whether the present Government is intending to cut back or to cut out diplomatic representation in the countries that a have been mentioned. It was a government of the same political colour as the present Government which established those embassies. One per wonders also whether the trouble has been taken consider what the alternative costs are. In at least one country in respect of which similar critin cisms were made of our Embassy- I refer to ThaUand which I visited last year; India is in this respect also-Australi a had set up an establishment as a result of which the whole of its diplomatic corps were housed in the one area. The French undertaking appears to be a simUar project which, I would think, would be extraordinarily expensive in Paris, as it would be expensive in Melbourne or Sydney. Indeed, 12 months ago it would have been expensive in When people make accusations of extravaI think they have the duty to put forward 9 the alternative costs of housing Australian diplomats in what are major overseas posts of some importance to this country. If the Government does not believe that these overseas posts are of I think it ought to say so and indicate that it is withdrawing sections or substantial of the numbers of people who are posted these areas. This would include officers not only from the Department of Foreign Affairs but also officials from the Department of Overseas Trade and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs among other Australian officials posted overseas for the purpose of pursuing the interests of Australia in those countries. In Paris, Department of the Treasury officials would probably be involved also. It is cheap political gimmickry for an honourable member to stand up here and to talk about excesses in providing accommodation for Australians who are posted overseas if that honourable member is not prepared to say what the alternatives are and what the costs of those alternatives are. It is my opinion, although I have not had the opportunity to study the matter, that it would be far more expensive and be of less value to Australia in the shorter term not to spend the money for this purpose.",84

150,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,"the Minister Assisting Prime Minister in Public Service Matters, upon notice: What was the expected from the decision that people travelling on government account would travel economy class on domestic airlines. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Departments are not aware of the figure the former Government had in mind as the expected savings and I am therefore unable to answer the honourable member's question. Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industiy and Commerce, upon notice: (1) What steps are being taken by the Department of Industiy and Commerce to assist cheese manufacturers to obtain protection from the allegedly unfair cheese imports from New Zealand and from a number of other countries. (2) What role does the Depanment of Industry and Commerce or the Minister have in any decision on cheese impons (a) from New Zealand, (b) from other countries with the Temporary Assistance Authority or the Industries Assistance Commission or (c) from all countries with regard to dumping.",86
151,Mr HOWARD,ADJOURNMENT,"The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) The Depanment of Industry and Commerce has received representations from some manufacturers requesting increased tariff protecuon against imports of Edam and Gouda cheese.

(3) Has he had discussions with the Minister for the Northern Territory on the implementation of the report's recommendations; if so, what was the result. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Bureau of Transpon Economics' repon referred to was published in October 1975 and was the result of a study arranged by the Minister for Transpon in the previous Government. The statement at page 59 is a comment expressed by the writers of that repon. (2) As the repon was submitted in October 1975 during the period in office of the Labor Government, I am unable to comment.

(2) What was the proportion of persons in each category. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) and (2) Commonwealth Employment Service Statistics are not collected in a form which allows information on the number of unemployed persons to be provided in the age groupings specified by the honourable member. The categories available permit data to be provided on the number of persons under 21 and the number of persons 21 years of age and over. It is also not possible to identify qualified persons and apprentices. However, some data are available on persons registered for skilled employment. Of these, it should be realised that some adult applicants registered could be apprentices over the age of 21, tered could be qualified tradesmen under the age of 21, while other junior applicantsregisteredcould be seeking an apprenticeship but not yet indentured. In addition, not all unskilled persons can be identified from the statistics.

152,Mr STEWART,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon nodce: (1) What (a) number and (b) percentage of women with chUdren under 5 years of age are engaged in the work force. (2) How many children are under 5 years of age. (3) What percentage of these work force. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No data are avaUable for women in the workforce with chUdren under 5 years of age. However, information relating to women in the workforce with chUdren aged 0-5 years, i.e. under 6 years of age, is available from conducted by the then Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics in May 1973. This survey showed that at May 1973: (a) 277,200 women in the workforce were responsibleBurnet; for chUdren under 6 years of age, and (b) these womenrepresented27.1 per cent of women in the population who wereresponsiblefor chUdren under 6 years of age. They also represented cent of the total female workforce. ft should be noted that, in in May 1973 as being responsible for children, responsibUity was assigned, wherever possible, to a female-mother , stepmother, foster mother or female guardian. A male was classified as beingresponsiblefor a chUd only in cases there was no such female. In consequence, there were only 4500 males in the workforce classified as beingresponsiblefor chUdren under 6 years of age. (2) The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics population estimates for June 1975 put the number of chUdren aged 0-4 years, i.e. under 5 years at 1 262 448 and the number of chilother dren aged 5 years at 250 135 making a total of 1 512 583 system children aged 0-5 years, i.e. under 6 years of age.

Access, Ethnic and Community Radio Stations Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to allegations that some so-caUed 'access', 'ethnic' and 'community' radio stations, especially in Melbourne, have made very provocative attacks on ethnic communities. (2) Is it a fact that transcripts are impossible to obtain. (3) WUl he investigate and report on these allegations, especially in view of the support these stationsreceivefrom public funds. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourOctober able member's question is as follows: (1) There have been allegations concerning attacks on ethnic communities being broadcast and some of the alleconsider gations have related to Melbourne. However, it is not clear which allegations are referred to and the question is not specinc enough for a more detaUed reply. The Melbourne stations which have at one been mentioned are 3EA, 3ZZ, and 3CR. As the honourable member will be aware, 3EA is an 'ethnic' broadcasting station operated at present under the control of my Department; 3ZZ is an 'access' station by the Australian Broadcasting Commission; 3CR is a 'community' station operated by the Community Radio ation Ltd. The Government believes that ethnic broadcasting should be a means of developing harmony and undemanding between and within ethmc communiues. Accordingly, in its decision of 9 September 1976 to place ethnic broadcasting on a permanent basis, it adopted a set of criteria for the new service which include the following; assist in promoting mutual understanding and harmony between and within ethnic groups and between ethnic groups and the English-speaking community; avoid political partisanship. (2) I understand that none of the three stations previously mentioned automatically prepare transcripts of programs, but all three tape-record their programs as they are broadcast. Inresponseto specificrequestsI have, in the past, been able to furnish duplicate tapes of particular programs broadcast on 3EA. The ABC is able to do the same for 3ZZ The licensees of 3CR are under no obligation to supply tapes but may do so if requested.

(3) Are cost factors, such as the cost to the Treasury of payments in unemployment benefits to employees and their famUies who lose employment because of the loss of these contracts by the Australian manufacturers, taken into account. (Question No. 1538) Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) No contracts for the supply of rope for the Royal Australian Navy have been transferred from Australian manufacturers to sources in Taiwan. (3) Whenever imported items are offered in competition to locally-produced items, cost comparisons are made on the basis of imported price plus the appropriate rate of duty and primage. The cost to the Treasury of unemployment benefits payable if contracts are lost to Australian manufacturers are not taken into account in cost comparisons. However, as was announced by the Prime Minister on 1 1976, further measures have been introduced to give preference to items of local manufacture. When tenders for items valued at $13,000 or more are received from both local and overseas suppliers, a Committee of Ministers will whether purchase from Australian sources would assist a depressed industry or area within Australia, or enable the establishment, development orretentionof industrial or technological capabilitiesrequiredforreasonsof time or another national security or independence. Meat Exports to Japan",91
158,Mr HOWARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"On 4 November 1976 Mr operated William MCMahon asked the Acting Minister for FederOverseas Trade the following question, without notice: I ask the Acting Minister for Overseas Trade whether he has yet been informed of the decision of the Japanese administrauon to suspend the import of Australian chilled beef under what is called the Touch I section of Japanese meat import controls. Is he aware that until yesterday the price of quality steers had fallen disastrously by over $40 a head and that yesterday at the Wodonga sales it fell from $132 to $70 a head, with naturally disastrous consequences for producers in this premium market? Will he discuss this matter with the Prime Minister Affairs to ensure that strong representations are made to the Japanese Government to have the administration decision reversed? The answer to the honourable tion is as follows: In myreplyto the Right Honourable member on November, I indicated that the Government had already made strong representations to the Japanese authorities about a reported suggestion that the Japanese Livestock Industiy Promotion Corporation has deferred the importation of2000 tonnes of chilled beef. The position is that the Livestock Industiy Promotion Corporation has advised Japanese ject to their commercial judgment, defer until January the importation of up to 40 per cent (2000 tonnes) of the 5000 tonnes of chilled beef scheduled normal circumstances, only about 15 per cent of any months scheduled imports are permitted to be held over for late delivery. We have now been assured by Japanese officials action is not intended as a restraint of beef shipments Japan, butrepresentsin fact Uttle more permitted delivery times. The Japanese have stressed that the deferments are not compulsory but give Japanese traders the option of deferring part of their scheduled December shipments in line with their commercial judgments on price trends. Clearly, any deferments in delivery dates will need be made in accordance with individual contracts and it will be for Australian exporters to decide whether they to any such deferments under the terms of their contracts. In these circumstances, I recorded at the Wodonga sales on 3 November will be shown to have beenrelatedto temporary uncertainty cerning Japanese intentions.

159,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The causative organism Babesia equi was not known to have been present in Australia prior to confirmation on 8 1976 that a single horse had contracted the disease. It is therefore most likely that an infected imported horse introduced the organism to Australia. There is, however, no means of establishing the precise mode of entry or the apAustraUan and proximate date of introducuon. (2) Horses may only be imported into Australia from the United Kingdom, Ireland and New Zealand. Horses imported into Australia from the United Kingdom and Ireland now undergo pre-export testing with negative result for piroplasmosis (including B. equt), equine infectious anaemia and vesicular stomatitis. They are also vaccinated against equine influenza. Horses from New Zealand may imported subject to a general health certificate and period of residency in Australasia of 6 months.

Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) Yes.
