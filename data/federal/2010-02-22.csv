5,Ms PARKE,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"In November last year I was in my parliamentary office preparing my speech in support of this important legislation which imports into Australian domestic law the principles contained in the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment, an instrument that Australia has been a party to since 1989, and the provisions of the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. While I was in the office that day, the mail was delivered. Among the envelopes addressed to me was a handwritten one with stamps indicating that it had been sent from Indonesia. I opened the envelope to find inside a Christmas card. The card was from Scott Rush, one of the young Australians on death row in Indonesia. He wrote: Kerobokan Prison 18 November 2009 Dear Ms Parke, peace be with you this Christmas. I thank you for all you have done for me again this year. God Bless, Scott Rush. Despite all this young man is going through, he had the presence of mind and the kindness to write this lovely card. This Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009 is for Scott and for those imprisoned with him on death row, whatever their nationality and whatever their crime. This bill is for all those be who have gone before them for whom it is too late. Renowned anti-death penalty campaigner and author of Dead Man Walking and The Death of Innocents, Sister Helen Prejean, noted: The practice of the death penalty is the practice torture. And by the time people I have been with finally climb into the chair to be killed, they died a thousand times already because of their anticipation of the final horror. By this bill we, as a nation, fundamentally repudiate the death penalty and the use of torture. We repudiate these acts in keeping with our international obligations. We repudiate them explicitly in the form of Commonwealth law as one of the highest statements of our common values and convictions. It is an affront to human dignity whenever a fellow human is tortured or put to death. By this law we clearly say that the state shall not put individuals to death, and that the state shall not in any circumstances practise torture. I commend the Attorney-General for his work in preparing this bill. Australia has taken significant steps under this Labor government to re-engage with the international community. As the Attorney-General has noted, the United Nations' Committee against Torture recommended that Australia enact a specific offence of torture at the federal level. Torture is any act by which severe pain or suffering is intentionally inflicted upon a person by a public official for certain purposes, such as obtaining information or a confession from a person. We saw graphic examples of torture from the United States before the advent of the Obama administration, where the CIA admitted using ‘water boarding' to obtain confessions, where the Bush administration used the practice of ‘extraordinary rendition' to transport detainees for interrogation to countries which practise torture, and where the appalling treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay was exposed to the world. This bill means we have learned from the unfortunate experience of the United States under President Bush and we have heeded the comments of the UN Committee against of Torture. Torture will now be criminalised both within and outside Australia and it will have operate concurrently with existing state and territory offences. The explanatory memorandum for the bill noted: Giving the offence extraterritorial application is intended to reflect a key aim of the Convention, which is to end impunity for torture globally. In enacting such an offence, the intention is to demonstrate the Government's condemnation of torture in all circumstances. With regard to the death penalty, Australia's position is clear: we are opposed to it, and the death penalty has been abolished as a practice in this country for many years. Prior to the passage of this bill, however, the prohibition has been based on the abolition of the death penalty for Commonwealth and territory offences-through the Commonwealth Death Penalty Abolition Act-and the separately legislated abolition of the death penalty by all state governments. But as it stands, it is not out of the question that a state government could consider the reintroduction of the death penalty. The instinctive insistence by some on an eye for an eye is written deeply into human nature. Despite this being a recipe only for increasing blindness, there are those who believe it is appropriate for the state to take retribution or vengeance, and there will always be those who believe-wrongly, as the evidence shows-that the death penalty works as an effective deterrent. That is why this bill is necessary to remove the possibility of the death penalty being reintroduced anywhere in Australia. In so doing, the bill comprehensively implements article 1(2) of the second optional protocol, where it requires: Each State Party shall take all necessary measures to abolish the death penalty within its jurisdiction. I am pleased to note the multipartisan support and strong statements from other speakers to this bill. This is a clear demonstration of our common and shared values as Australians. The death penalty is an act that decreases the store of human dignity. It is a practice that has no social justification, for all the evidence indicates that it does not function as a deterrent, and, while the putting to death of the worse criminal may give some satisfaction or closure to those aggrieved, quite understandably, by a terrible crime, it is not right that our system of justice function as an instrument of vengeance. What is more, when the state, as society's delegate, takes a life in vengeance or as punishment, it condones a view that one can, by their conduct, forfeit the right to life, and so it invites, even tacitly, individuals to make that judgment against one another. In 1764, the Italian philosopher Cesare Beccaria wrote: Is it not absurd, that the laws, which detest and punish homicide, should, in order to prevent murder, publicly commit murder themselves? He believed that the more cruel and severe the punishment, the more the minds of men grew ‘hardened and calloused'. I also take this opportunity to note, as the Attorney General has done, that this law will strengthen the Australian government's capacity to oppose the use of the death penalty wherever it occurs. There are Australian citizens waiting on death row in several of the countries that still apply this penalty. The Australian government's ability to make representations on their behalf, and to campaign generally for the country-by-country abolition of capital punishment, is enhanced by our clear and uncompromising position on this issue. I have protested and I will continue to protest against the sentences of death that apply to people like Scott Rush, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran on the grounds that capital punishment is fundamentally wrong. But I have not and I will not confine myself to only protesting against the death penalty where it is applied to Australian nationals. The putting to death of an individual by the state is wrong anytime and anywhere it occurs. On that point, I note what the Hon. John von Doussa said in 2006 as President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, when he stated: In an era where law enforcement requires international cooperation Australian commitment to the universal abolition of the death penalty should be uncompromising-not vary from case-to-case depending on the crime, citizenship and country. We need to make sure that our mutual assistance and agency assistance arrangements reflect Australia's commitment to abolishing the death penalty. The question is, having set ourselves upon a path to a higher civilisation, are we prepared to go the distance? Are we prepared to oppose the death penalty wherever and whenever it occurs? The international and diplomatic efforts to oppose the death penalty on that basis are important, and Australia's expressed position to that effect is important. Only by saying that we oppose the use of the death penalty by any country, and by saying that we oppose the execution of any person, can we deploy the necessary strength of conviction on this issue. Last December, the Attorney General announced new guidelines for the Australian Federal Police, whereby any cooperation with international criminal investigations with possible death penalty implications will require ministerial approval. This is extremely important in order to avoid a repeat of the Bali Nine AFP debacle. It also sends an important message to countries with which we cooperate. It is, in my view, a great shame that so many countries, including global and regional leaders like the United States, Japan, Indonesia and China, continue to use the death penalty as part of their criminal justice systems. The United States and Japan are the only developed democratic nations to retain the use of capital punishment. I am glad that in the recent appointment of Keiko Chiba as Japan's justice minister we are likely to see at least an unofficial moratorium on executions in that country. I understand that Ms Chiba has been an active death penalty abolitionist for some 20 years. Hangings in Japan have surged over the last three years, and there are approximately 100 inmates currently on death row. In the United States, the constitutional so-called freedom that is supposed to protect people from violent crime, in the form of extraordinarily permissive gun laws and the laws which in many states punish people with death for those crimes, have together failed to significantly reduce comparatively high rates of violent crime. It is significant in comparing the 35 states in the US which apply the death penalty and the 15 states which do not, that the average murder rate in death penalty states in 2008 was 5.2 per hundred thousand, while it was only 3.3 per hundred thousand in states without the death penalty. That disparity is reflected in, year out. It is also significant to consider the counyear-old tries that, along with the United States, feature, year in, year out, at the top of the worldwide executions list. From information collated by the Death Penalty Information Center, I can say that in 2008, at least 2,390 people were executed in 25 countries around the world, and 8,864 people were sentenced to death in 52 countries. Amnesty International has reported that in the course of 2008 executions almost doubled in number from the 1,252 that occurred in 2007, and 95 per cent of all known executions were carried out in only six countries: China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United States, Pakistan and Iraq. The confirmed numbers of executions in those countries during 2008 were (1) China, 1,718; (2) Iran, 346; (3) Saudi Arabia, 102; (4) United States, 37; (5) Pakistan, 36; and (6) Iraq, 34. The death penalty is wrong in itself, and it inevitably takes the form of a cruel, unusual and inhumane punishment. As recently as September last year, the state of Ohio's botched execution of Romell Broom provided another reminder of the barbarism that is involved in putting a person to death. In its editorial on 3 October, the New York Times described the circumstances of the attempt at a lethal injection of Mr Broom: The execution team in Ohio spent about two hours trying to access a vein on Mr Broom's arms and legs. They stuck him with a needle about 18 times, returning to areas that were already bruised. In one case, the needle reportedly hit a bone. Mr Broom tried to help, pointing to veins, massaging his arms to keep a vein open and straightening tubes. At one point, some witnesses suggested he was crying. Such scenes are a transparent window onto the profoundly uncivilised nature of the act by which the state puts to death one of its citizens. Such occurrences demean us all. year Twenty-one years ago, Romell Broom was convicted of the rape and murder of a 14girl. It was a terrible, terrible thing that he did. It is right that he be severely punished and that he be kept from doing such awful harm ever again, but I maintain that he should not be put to death and that the death penalty is not at the high end of a range or rising curve of penalties that includes fines, community service and incarceration. The death penalty is something else altogether. It is an act of barbarity for the state to end a life. What makes capital punishment even more abhorrent is, on the one hand, the use of the death penalty as a tool of political oppression and, on the other hand, the application of the death penalty in ways that clearly reflect and express societal prejudice. In the first case, the death penalty has the clear poThe tential to be used not as a sanction by the state against the criminal conduct of an individual but as an instrument of tyranny. I am sorry to say that executions in China of Tibetans and Uygurs are naturally and not unreasonably perceived through that kind of framework. It is very difficult not to regard executions that occur in the context of civil strife or protest as being an expeditious punishment that is meted out to enemies of the state, rather than a criminal sentence. And it is no surprise that a majority of countries which practise the death penalty are nations with less than impressive human rights records. Many have political systems or systems of government that do not operate in the best interests of their people. In the second case I have mentioned-and the United States is unfortunately a good example of this-the analysis of both death sentences given and executions carried out often suggests that capital punishment is criminately or prejudicially applied. A Californian study published in the Santa Clara Law Review in 2005 found that those who murdered whites were three times more likely to be sentenced to death than those who killed blacks and four times more likely than those who killed Latinos. In his 1998 report to the American Bar Association, Professor David C Baldus presented his finding that, in those states where there has been a review of race and the death penalty cases, 96 per cent were found to have either raceof-victim or race-of-defendant discrimination, or both. As with those many cases throughout history where it is shown that the death penalty has been imposed on an innocent man or woman, the fact that the death penalty can tend to be imposed discriminately or prejudicially is yet another argument against its validity. As noted by Bryan Stevenson, the death row lawyer: reality is that capital punishment in America is a lottery. It is a punishment that is shaped by the constraints of poverty, race, geography and local politics. Where the death penalty exists, there is the ever-present possibility of the most extreme injustice being applied to innocent people. PN Bhagwati, the former Chief Justice of India, famously wrote: ‘The death penalty is irrevocable; it cannot be recalled. It is destructive of the right to life. Howsoever careful may be the procedural safeguards erected by the law before the penalty is imposed, it is impossible to eliminate the chance of judicial error. One innocent man being hanged should be enough to wipe out the value of capital punishment forever'. Of course, the death penalty admits no possibility of redemption, of rehabilitation. Australians will recall the hanging of the young Melbourne man Nguyen Tuong Van over four years ago on 2 December 2005 in dis- Singapore. Van had admitted carrying drugs in order to help his twin brother pay off debts. Van admitted guilt at the first opportunity, showed great remorse and fully cooperated with the police. Just before he died, his lawyer Lex Lasry said: He is completely rehabilitated, completely reformed, completely focused on doing what is good, and now they are going to kill him. The then Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, branded Van's impending execution as abhorrent, especially because the sentence was mandatory and mitigating circumstances were ignored. He said: It's a most unfortunate, barbaric act that is occurring. Could anyone argue honestly that this execution achieved any useful purpose for society? In the case of Indonesia, I acknowledge that that country takes very seriously offences involving drugs and wishes to ensure that a strong message is sent to the community that dealing in drugs will not be tolerated. I would simply say that it is possible to be tough on crime and drugs without imposing the death penalty, which is a fundamental violation of the right to life. This is demonstrated by the fact that the international criminal tribunals which try and punish the most serious crimes possible-genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity-do not have the death penalty. As I asked in my contribution to the adjournment debate on 1 December 2008: why is it that blank bullets are distributed among the Indonesian firing squad, leaving each member of the squad with the hope that it was not their bullet that exploded the heart of the condemned tied to a stake? It is because it is contrary to our shared human values of respect for life for the state to plan and calculate the termination of life, regardless of the nature of the crime or the nationality of the perpetrator. In conclusion, can I say again that this strengthens Australia's existing position against the use of capital punishment, and it meets fully our obligations under the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. I congratulate the Attorney-General on the passage of this important law, and I know that it reflects his own strongly held and strongly expressed principles on this issue. I will finish by ing I hope it is a happy new year for Scott Rush and his companions. They are in our thoughts and prayers. (Time expired)",17
6,Mr SIMPKINS,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to make some comments today on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009. It is not my intention to go over all the points that others have made. Certainly from what I have heard I agree with the points that have been made in this debate. While I think that Australia was always unlikely to go back to death penalties for any crimes in this country, this bill will take the steps needed to ensure that it can never be done again. So I welcome the bill and it certainly has my personal support. But I would like to go to some slightly different places in the time that I will make my contribution today, because I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that when you walk on the streets of suburban Australia and you knock on doors there is some support out there for things like the death penalty and even corporal punishment. I think we can be certain of that. I think that they are wrong. I think that ultimately there will not be any improvement as a result of having the death penalty as a possible outcome for a conviction in Australian courts. Yet there will still be people who will say, ‘Look back to what happened in Singapore in 2005, when an Australian was executed,' or who go back further to Barlow and Chambers, who were executed for drug bill offences as well. Nothing has really moved on. People are still taking those chances with their lives when they try to traffic drugs. I will say it again later on but there is a degree of personal responsibility involved with this, particularly for those Australians who take the risk of smuggling and trafficking drugs to or from various countries in the world. It is a high-risk scenario and the rewards will never make up for the risks that say- they take. As the member for Fremantle has quite rightly said, once people are beyond the protection of our borders they are subject to the charges and penalties that another state may impose. So it does come down to people realising that just because we will never have the death penalty and it is unlikely that we will ever have corporal punishment again in this country does not mean that other countries will observe our standards. People need to be very careful when they take these risks for a quick buck, to support somebody else or for whatever misguided reason they have to try to traffic drugs: they are and will be subject to the penalties that apply in other countries. Of course, I would also say that the damage they do if they get the drugs back here is completely unacceptable as well. But there are more appropriate penalties to be imposed upon people who try to traffic drugs and hurt this country and the people of this country by selling and trafficking drugsother ways that do not include the death penalty. I can understand when members of a family, particularly children, have been the victim of a hideous crime-such as the hurting or molesting of a child-how parents could feel that revenge through the death penalty would in some way help them. I understand that people feel very strongly about these things. But, again, as the member for Fremantle said, we need to be consistent. While I personally think there are some people who commit crimes for which they cannot ever be rehabilitated, such as child molesters, child rapists and often drug users-I do not believe that a lot of those people can be rehabilitated-you can never be certain in the matter of capital punishment. You can never be certain that the person who is executed is actually the one who committed the crime. The fact that there is any form of doubt even in one case is a very strong argument for why it is right to go down this path and fully enshrine the abolition of the death penalty in this nation. I would also like to speak on the matter of torture. Again, I think we all have very clear ideas of what is involved with torture. I would just make the point that by some definitions of torture the methods used in the acquisition of information in combat zones by intelligence personnel for, say, the Austrawe lian Army would be considered torture. I am not talking about water boarding. I am not talking about those matters where a person who has been detained-a POW or whatever-is in fear of their life. I am not talking about that. That is certainly torture and should not be allowed. But certainly from my limited experience over 15 years in the Defence Force the pressure that is placed upon people to obtain information from them reasonably quickly is an essential part of fighting and combat. By that I mean sleep deprivation and other ways of imposing a great deal of pressure on someone that do not cause permanent damage. Sleep deprivation is a very quick way of obtaining information. Within 24 hours people are sufficiently disorientated that they are more likely to provide information. This is non-lethal. This does not cause long-term damage. It is a little bit of pressure which can be very useful in obtaining information. Provided that is still retained as part of legitimate acquisition of information, I certainly stand by all other modes of torture being prohibited. I said before that when Australians travel overseas they need to be very careful about the decisions they make. They need to appreciate that they will be held accountable for the actions they take. If they attempt to traffic or smuggle drugs then they have to appreciate that, whatever their reason for doing it-for instance, the young Vietnamese Australian who was executed in Singapore wanted to pay off his and his brother's debts-these are not legitimate excuses. As soon as you hop on a plane or exit immigration control in Australia and have taken actions to commit an offence you will be beyond the control of the Australian government, and the rules and culture of another country will then be what will affect you if you are caught. It is very important to make the point that do not control the values and laws of other countries. We attempt to influence, and that is good, and the United Nations working in this area is definitely good, but there are some countries out there that are ultimately and totally wedded to capital and corporal punishment. While we may think that barbaric, that does not mean that they will stop. So every time an Australian goes overseas they need to be very careful with the way they conduct themselves because consular assistance cannot stop another country imposing its system of justice and punishments on Australian citizens. I want to conclude by reiterating that I support this bill. I believe that the death alty will never be the way forward. It will never stop crime. What will stop crime is the certainty of being caught, a belief that no matter what you do you are likely to be caught and that justice will be imposed upon you, not that if you get caught your life might be in jeopardy, might be forfeit. We need to put in place measures that will increase the certainty of people being caught. That will be the best deterrent to crime. I acknowledge that there are many Australians who remain in support of the death penalty and who support corporal punishment such as the use of the rattan in Singapore but, if you look at the way some countries operate around the world who have the death penalty and these forms of corporal punishment, I do not think such countries maintain the sorts of systems of government that Australia would ever look up to. It is right that we take this move now and that we complete the abolition of the death penalty in Australia. I stand in support of this bill.",22
7,Mr ZAPPIA,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I too take the opportunity to speak in support of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009. I am pleased to see that most of those who have spoken in regard to this bill, including the members opposite, have indicated their support for it. I begin ing my support for this bill by stating my view that this bill reflects our civility as a nation. The taking of another person's life, or the torture of a person, are acts that in my view see human behaviour descend to its lowest point. Nevertheless, I accept that there are people who have a different point of view on these matters and who will argue the case that both the death penalty and torture can be justified in certain cases. I recall an incident when I was campaigning in 2004 in which I was confronted by some people from within the community and the issue of pentorture and the death penalty arose. I was able to stand back and watch the debate between different people who were there at the time arguing for and against the case of the death penalty and torture. It is interesting to note that it is certainly an issue that causes a degree of division throughout communities. Both practices, the death penalty and torture, are used in countries around the world today. They are practices that date back as far as our historical records go. In Australia today around half the population supports the death penalty for certain crimes. That figure, based on some of the more recent surveys and polling that have been carried out, again highlights that it is certainly a matter that causes divisiveness throughout the community. Those who support the use of the death penalty and torture will argue that they serve as both a punishment and a deterrent to those who commit, or who contemplate committing, a serious transgression against others. On that point, I note the comment by the member for Cowan that it is the certainty of being caught that acts as the greatest deterrent. I certainly concur with him on that point. It is not the ultimate punishment that does. Of course, some will also argue that in the case of torture there is the additional justification that extracting information by the use of torture may prevent the suffering of in express- others in due course. These are not simple matters of morality. I am also acutely aware that if I, a family member or a close friend were a victim of a horrific act my views may well be different. It is, however, important that these matters are dealt with objectively and are not clouded by personal emotions. I also hear with some persuasion the argument that a person who has committed horrific acts, who is unlikely to be rehabilitated and who continues to be a serious risk to others loses their right to live. Furthermore, life imprisonment does not guarantee that a person will not reoffend and that the community is still safe. Of course, there will always be the question that can never be answered as to how many innocent lives have been saved because of the use of the death penalty and torture. The moral dilemma, however, becomes under what circumstances, if any, do you apply the death penalty or torture? It is in the absence of being able to clearly define the circumstances under which the death penalty should apply, and in the firm belief that one barbaric act does not justify another, that I support this bill. Furthermore, history is littered with executions of persons whose guilt remains in doubt, of persons tortured without ever having knowledge about matters over which they were tortured, or tortured just so that others could get pleasure and enjoyment from their suffering. The bill addresses two matters. Firstly, it implements a specific Commonwealth offence of torture into the Commonwealth criminal code and, in doing so, will fulfil Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention against Torture to ban all acts of torture wherever they occur. Secondly, in accordance with the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, the bill will ensure that the death penalty cannot be reintroduced anywhere in Australia in the future. The death penalty was abolished in each of Australia's states by the state governments last century, with New South Wales being the last state to abolish the death penalty in 1985. Queensland had abolished the death penalty as far back as 1922 and was the first state to do so. The Commonwealth abolished the death penalty for federal offences as well as those under territory or imperial acts with the passing of the Commonwealth Death Penalty Abolition Act of 1973. In 1985, Australia also became a signatory to the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Punishment or Treatment. The convention protocols were ratified by the passing in 1989 of the Commonwealth Crimes (Torture) Act 1988. I note that Australia was one of the 31 sponsors of the original optional protocol when it was presented to the United Nations. The first recorded hanging in Australia was that of Thomas Barrett on 27 February 1788 for stealing food. The last judicial execution in Australia was the hanging of Ronald Ryan on 3 February 1967 for the fatal shooting of prison officer George Hodson during Ryan's escape from Pentridge Prison in December 1965. I can well recall, as a child, the media stories and the community backlash against that hanging. From all accounts, the hanging divided the Australian community, resulting in some of the largest public crowds ever seen in Australia rallying to protest against the use of the death penalty. I understand that several people, including journalists of the day, were allowed to witness the hanging. According to several eyewitness accounts, the experience left many of them with the clear view that the death penalty should be abolished. The governor of the jail, the sentencing judge and others who were associated with the hanging all said that they were distressed and tormented by it. I suspect it must have also been an incredible burden on the hangman himself to carry out the execution. I quote Catholic bishop Greg O'Kelly, who at the time of the Ryan hanging was a young Jesuit scholastic teacher at Pentridge. In an interview with Elizabeth Hook, editor of the Southern Cross, Bishop O'Kelly said: To execute somebody in cold blood is a barbarous act. It's a calculated act of extreme, terminal lence against the living person. He has killed someone and so the same act is perpetrated upon him. Bishop O'Kelly goes on to say: You can release somebody wrongly imprisoned but you can't resurrect somebody who has been executed. The last quote highlights the other major dilemma relating to the death penalty and that is the fact that evidence has not always been clear or conclusive and courts have been known to convict innocent people. Statistics would show that one of the reasons is that quite often the innocent people who are convicted come from a very poor background. Therefore, they are unable to hire the most expensive and best lawyers. So, not surprisingly, they lose their cases and are found to be guilty. I am sure that there have been many, many examples of that which in retrospect have proven that the system of our courts is not infallible. A person's life is too precious for mistakes to be made with it. I will make some observations on the second aspect of this bill relating to torture. Torture is allegedly a common practice and there is widespread use of it around the world. Of course, it is nearly always denied by the relevant authorities. As with the death penalty, there is often doubt that the person tortured was in a position to render any meaningful information. It is highly likely that, over the centuries, many innocent people have been tortured. Torture is, however, often carried out by government security agencies and therefore almost impossible to prove or prosecute. I welcome the establishment of a UN Committee against Torture to monitor the implementation of the UN protocol. The committee can consider individual complaints, visit places and assess reports from parties to the convention. I note that that the vioHoward government had voted in the UN against the optional torture protocol and outright refused to sign it, yet torture is an offence and has been for many years under state and criminal laws. I have to say I am perplexed by the position that the Howard government took on this when it had the opportunity to sign the protocol. Under this bill, a new offence of torture will be enacted which will criminalise acts of torture both within and outside of Australia. The new act will replace the existing Crimes (Torture) Act, which will be repealed. I do note that this bill does not prevent the extradition of a person facing a death penalty charge to the country making the charge. It is a matter that causes me some concern, given the position that this country is now taking on the death penalty. Under the Extradition Act 1988, the Attorney-General can authorise the extradition of an individual for a capital offence if their extradition country undertakes that: firstly, the person will not be tried for the offence; secondly, if the person is tried for the offence, the death penalty will not be imposed on that person; or, thirdly, if the death penalty is imposed on the person, it will not be carried out. Under those conditions, there is no guarantee that once the person is extradited the conditions will be honoured. I want to comment on the issue as to whether the death penalty acts as a deterrent to serious crime and particularly to the crime of murder. It would appear from the research available that the death penalty does not reduce the murder rate. In the United States, for example, crime levels have not increased in those states which abolished the death penalty and, conversely, in those states where the death penalty applies, crime levels have not been reduced. One survey showed that US states which abolished the death penalty had homicide rates at or below the national rate and that over a 20-year period, between 1980 and 2000, the homicide rates in states with the death penalty were 48 per cent to 101 per cent higher than in states without the death penalty. Over the years, Australia and the Australian people have quite rightly condemned the use of brutality, torture and execution by dictatorships and oppressive governments in other parts of the world. Regrettably, we are presented with examples of those practices all too often. Australia has quite rightly spoken out on behalf of Australian nationals who have faced the death penalty in overseas countries. In this regard, I would like to acknowledge the staff of the consular division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who, over the years, have on so many occasions worked tirelessly to assist Australians who have found themselves facing the death penalty in other countries. I well recall the case of Kevin Barlow and Brian Chambers in Malaysia in 1986 and the public reaction in this country to the news that they were to be executed, as they ultimately were. Subsequently, there have been many other cases. On each and every one of those occasions, the public reaction in this country to the use of the death penalty has been, in my view, overwhelmingly against those people being executed for the crimes they committed in those countries. I noted the comments of the member for Cowan, who referred to the laws of other countries and the fact that people travelling overseas need to be aware of those laws and that, clearly, we as a nation cannot intervene in those laws. We may not be able to intervene but, as the member for Fremantle rightly said in her address to the House, if we are to take a position that we oppose the death penalty and that we oppose torture, we should oppose it in all instances regardless of where it is carried out. However, it is important that, if we are going to condemn other leaders who carry out those barbaric acts and criticise them for doing so, we show and lead by example-firstly, by not having the death penalty or torture agreed to by the government of this country and, secondly, by taking a consistent stand wherever it occurs, not by taking a stand only when it suits us to do so. If we are to have credibility on these issues-and in many cases I think the broader Australian community would want the Australian government to take a stand on these issues-we need to be consistent. In supporting this bill Australia joins some 80 countries around the world that have abolished the death penalty and around 20 or more that have a policy not to execute, albeit that the death penalty has not been formally abolished. I believe that those numbers will increase as time moves forward. I want to close my remarks by referring to the proceedings of this House. Each day we commence proceedings by reciting the Lord's Prayer. Regardless of whether one is a Christian or not or whether one is religious or not, the fact is that we recite Lord's Prayer. I assume that in doing so all members of this House accept in principle the values enshrined in that prayer. One of the lines in the Lord's Prayer says, ‘Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.' If we are to embrace and accept that as part of the values that underpin the work of this parliament, then torture and the death penalty have no place in this parliament or in the civil society that I would like to think we have in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.",24
8,Mr OAKESHOTT,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I also rise to strongly support the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009. In summary the purpose of the bill is to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 to include a specific torture offence and also to amend the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 to extend the application of the current prohibition on the death penalty to state laws to ensure that the death penalty cannot be reintroduced anywhere in Australia. Turning firstly to the offence of torture, the definition, essentially, that is being included as a specific torture offence includes very generally four points: it must involve a public official in some form; it must be an infliction of severe physical or mental pain or suffering; there must be an intent severe physical or mental pain or suffering; and that it is for a specific purpose such as extracting a confession or information. This is a difficult but welcome addition to the laws of this land. It addresses an issue that was raised in this place by several people, including me, with regard to Guy Campos, an individual who was in this country last year, who was allegedly involved, but all the evidence would strongly suggest was involved, in offences in East Timor throughout its transition to being a sovereign nation. He was identified as being in this country last year, from memory, on a World Youth Day visa. He was identified by people who are local Australian residents now, people who had escaped what was a torturous regime at the time in East Timor. One of the TV stations-from memory I think it was Channel 7-identified him as an individual of concern. I think they faced him at a community event and all but got an admission of guilt out of him on camera. The AFP became involved and several trips to East Timor were undertaken. A brief of evidence was prepared and, I think, upwards of $500,000-well over, at least, $400,000-of Australian taxpayers' money was spent. Despite many people in the community saying that Guy Campos was going to skip the country if this brief of evidence was acted upon, the Australian government could ping him on no specific offence. As far as I know-and I would be happy for the Attorney-General to tell me otherwise in his response-Guy Campos is still at large, overseas, out of the Australian jurisdiction, despite a brief of evidence and half a million dollars of Australian money being spent potentially to do some good work on behalf of the Asia-Pacific region and to bring to justice someone who looked to be quite clearly involved in a good example of torture, as is to inflict defined in this new legislation. I would hope that this legislation is a start in addressing the anomaly that occurred only in 2009. Much of the debate I have heard and many references that have been made to particular pieces of legislation go back a long time, to the seventies and eighties. Clearly, there is a history of bipartisanship and also tripartisanship with regard to torture prohibition and the abolition of the death penalty. That is welcome. The Australian parliament should be proud of that, that it is strong in its defence of the liberty of men and women not only in Australia but throughout the world. If such a clear case, such as that of Guy Campos, emerges again in the future, with such a significant spend of Australian dollars-say, $400,000 to $500,000, as was spent by the AFP-and if there is a courtroom full of willing witnesses, such as there was in the Campos case, I would hope that this legislation will be a trigger to addressing the anomaly that occurred only last year and to ensuring that justice is done within this country and this region. I wish to make another point, and this is more for the benefit of anyone who is resident on the mid-North Coast or for anyone reading this speech who may be wondering why we may all get so passionate about an ethical issue like torture prohibitionMs Saffin-So we should.",28
9,Mr OAKESHOTT,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"We should. But for those who are still wrestling with that issue, this is not only about someone from East Timor, on a visa, having an extended holiday, who was involved in offences; this is also about local residents. In my old days as a state member of parliament there was a horrific case on the mid-North Coast of ongoing and habitual abuse of an individual by residents. They were not public officials and there was no extracting of confessions or of information. I would hope that, through this legislation, the concept of torture will not be forgotten in a free and democratic Australia. It can easily permeate a free, democratic society. We all need to be vigilant, from everyone on every street on the mid-North Coast to everyone around Australia, in ensuring that we are all aware of what torture is and that we are certainly doing our bit to identify it and doing all we can, where possible, to oppose it. Various people have spoken previously on the death penalty. My view is that the court system is a human system. It might be 99 per cent right, but that is 100 per cent wrong. It is the one case in 100 cases that the human court process, the human legal system, gets wrong that completely discredits any argument for the death penalty system of justice in a country such as ours or in any country around the world. The previous speaker, the member for Makin, mentioned some examples in the United States, including the great example of the corridor trading within the political process that went on when the gun law changes came in in the US and where negotiations with the states had to take place. Part of that trading with the states included increased penalties that could have the death penalty attached to them so as to get some greater restrictions on gun laws. For that to be a trading mechanism in the halls of political power, I think, sniffs of the inconsistency of death penalty laws in that jurisdiction. It is also a great example for our jurisdiction as well. Previous speakers have also mentioned the lack of an evidence trail between jurisdictions that have the death penalty and any decrease in crime. Therefore, I think that that, again, is a clear statement of the inability of the death penalty to do its job if it is there as some sort of fear tool to prevent murder, manslaughter or any other heinous crimes. I will also mention a really interesting study that I think was done by Chief Justice Gleeson on community standards and community sentiments around crime. Again, for those who may be sitting in their homes wondering why this is relevant to them, this study was a very interesting reflection on the lynch mob mentality. A survey was done of community views on particular judgments through the court process. The question was asked, ‘Are those judgments too lenient or too hard?' The vast majority, when they were looking at the judgments alone, said, ‘It is too soft; we should be harder and tougher on crime.' He then presented the same survey group with all the facts of the case and said, ‘You provide the judgment.' In the majority of cases, those community members who were surveyed provided a less harsh judgment than given where the judges' judgments alone were provided on those particular cases-the point being that, without all the facts, without all the evidence, we do potentially suffer from a lynch mob mentality. We are responding to community in an irresponsible way if we just throw the question out to the community and say, ‘Do you agree with the death penalty or not?' We are going to get a range of views, and I reckon we might even tip into the side of more people saying yes than no. But if we provide detail and evidence around a particular case, its particular circumstances and the facts of the case and then ask, ‘Do you think the death penalty should apply?' then, I would hopeand, more often than not, I have faith in our community-that common sense would apply and most people in the community, once they understood the facts and the evidence trail, would say no. To the question of whether we are here to serve the majority view within our communities, I would say, ‘Yes, we are, so long as it done on a factual base and our representation is responsible.' On this topic I would hope that the tripartisan support for getting rid of any chance that the states may reintroduce the death penalty reflects overall community sentiment and is a common-sense approach. It was a bit of a surprise to me, in my first 15 months in this job, to see the number of Australian citizens held against their will, for a number of different reasons, in other criminal justice systems around the world. Some of those cases involved the death penalty as one of the potential judgments for the Australian citizens involved. I would hope government would be strong on this and that, even at times when it is difficult-when it may affect trade or sensitive bilateral or multilateral relationships-it would be vigilant in arguing the case for the upholding of Australian law for Australian citizens as much as possible. I would hope that, on the death penalty, we do not drop the ball, either behind the scenes when working through diplomatic channels, or when working through the mouths of Prime Ministers, Attorneys General and the executive. We need to be strong in our message about the death penalty. We live in a complex region of the world. The death penalty does apply in many of those jurisdictions. Our strength of leadership is important in reaffirming the reasons why the abolition of the death penalty is important. Hopefully, from that, we will get some other jurisdictions to reconsider their position. But I do not think it is acceptable for leadership to be silent when it might be difficult to raise issues around the death penalty because it may affect trade, for example. I would hope that all our relationships with our neighbours are above that, and I would hope that our role in being one of the great protectors of freedom and liberty is to be loud and vocal and strong about this issue is of why the abolition of the death penalty is a sensible move in all criminal justice systems around the world.",29
10,Ms SAFFIN,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I speak in strong support of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009 for a number of reasons. Firstly, I oppose the death penalty. I oppose torture and other forms of degrading treatment. And I do so on moral grounds. We come to this place with a whole lot of roles. But we are also law-makers and as a lawmaker I do not have the right to pass a law that would allow the state to execute another citizen or subject another citizen to torture or other forms of degrading treatment. I do not see that any lawmaker, in Australia, in any country, has that right. It is not a right that is given to us. We have to protect life and we have to protect human beings and human dignity. So it is totally on moral grounds that I oppose those things. I have long been part of anti-death-penalty networks, both in Australia and in the Asia Pacific region. A lot of people do not know about that movement in the Asia-Pacific region-and it did not start in Australia; it started in countries that we identify as Asian and Pacific-but they are very strong and active networks. I have been part of them for a long time-also internationally, and through Amnesty International. I cannot recall the number of written as a member of Amnesty International-and I am still a member-for people I do not know, and who I will never get to know, who are on death row. Some of those people, I know, have committed terrible crimes and caused terrible suffering, and I know that there are families and there are victims. I can understand somewhatsomewhat-their pain, and that sometimes people would want to extract vengeance. That is why we have laws; that is why we have the rule of law-so that we do not go out and extract vengeance and become part of a lynch mentality. I can well understand some of those feelings; I know that, as a parent, if something were to happen to my child, I might have those feelings and I might want to do that to somebody who had injured my child-particularly if it were the ultimate injury of taking their life. So we have to the law. We have to have the rule of law. I remember speaking to this a few years ago. I was living in Timor Leste when one of our citizens, Van Tuong Nguyen, was executed in another country. I can remember well the trauma that that caused the whole of Australia. The whole of Australia was seized by that issue. Confronted by the reality of death penalty, the community showed its strong anti-death penalty sentiment-and that is why we have passed laws in each state that prohibit the death penalty. I well remember that, through Amnesty International and the Asia-Pacific Network, there were people sending text messages asking us to text our members of parliament. Everybody joined in, and a whole lot of actions took place. People who do not often get involved in political action did get involved. A whole lot of parents and grandparents were involved in that. I would like to quote from an essay entitled ‘The death of Van Tuong Nguyen' by Peter Norden SJ in the Catholic Social Justice Series booklet Confronting the letters I have Death Penalty. He said: At 8 am on Friday, 2 December, 2005, in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond, the bells of St Ignatius' Church rang 25 times. The bells sounded over the cries and wailing of many of the 1000 people who had gathered to pray during the moment of the execution of an Australian citizen, Van Tuong Nguyen. Van was executed at Changi Prison by officials of the Singapore Government, who placed a noose around his neck and let him drop through a trap door to his death. Each of the 25 bells that morning represented a year of the life of this young man, whose family had been part of the community of that parish during his first years. The death penalty is final; it is absolute. I have read reports, studies and research that show people internationally have been executed by the state when it has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that they did not have commit the crime. We cannot bring people back; whatever anyone might think about the death penalty, that is one reason why we should not impose it. Justice Michael Kirby said: Inflicting the death penalty is the ultimate acknowledgement of the failure of civilisation. I have often said-and I do not say it the lightly-that we cannot abide the death penalty in a civilised country. The death penalty exists in a number of jurisdictions. I do not want to say they are uncivilised, but I do say that a civilised country should not have the death penalty. I would also like to quote from a motion introduced to the parliament by my colleague the member for Werriwa, Chris Hayes. We all know that he has been very active about young Scott Rush and the so called Bali 9, nine Australians who are in prison in Indonesia. His motion states: (j) abhorrence of the death penalty is a fundamental value in Australian society and there is bipartisan opposition within the Australian Parliament the death penalty; And it is clear that there is bipartisan opposition to the death penalty. This parliament has a working group on which all parties, all sides of politics, are represented. We come together and work to advance the cause of getting rid of the death penalty and making sure it never again comes to the fore. I welcome the introduction of this bill. I thank the Attorney-General, with whom I have frequently discussed the death penalty and torture, for bringing this forward. I congratulate all those members of parliament who have been active in advocating for this bill. It is important to do good when you can, and this is an example of doing good to put beyond reach the ability of any jurisdiction or agency in Australia to either introduce a law or take any action that would cause an Australian citizen to be executed or tortured by the state. I will turn to this matter after I walk through the legislative provisions and the convention framework. This bill does two key things. Firstly, it enacts a specific Commonwealth torture offence in the Commonwealth Criminal Code which will operate concurrently with existing offences in state and territory criminal law. Secondly, it amends the Commonwealth Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 to extend the application of the current prohibition on the death penalty to state laws to ensure the death penalty cannot be introduced anywhere in Australia. That act was enacted in this parliament in 1973 with the support of the parliament. I will now turn to torture. The aim of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is to end impunity for torture globally-this is the right aimso that no individual can escape the consequences of their actions if they inflict or to cause torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. This bill will enact a specific Commonwealth torture offence in the Commonwealth Criminal Code to prevent that. The Crimes (Torture) Act 1988 will then be made redundant, because the key inclusion of this torture provision is now in the Commonwealth Criminal Code-so it will be repealed. The Crimes (Torture) Act currently criminalises torture when committed outside Australia but only when committed by Australian citizens or other persons present in Australia. The United Nations convention that I referred to requires Australia to ensure that all acts of torture are offences under domestic criminal law. The convention definition of torture is along these lines: any act by which severe pain or suffering is intentionally inflicted upon a person by a public official for certain specified purposes-for example, obtaining a confession or information. In Australia's previous periodic reports to the United Nations Committee Against Torture it has been said that state and territory laws already cover this. However, the coverage is not complete. This act will serve to complete it. In this place we often have interns, through a program that operates through the Australian National University. Last year I had an intern in my office for a few weeks working on a project on the death penalty. She wrote an excellent report about the death penalty, Australia's position on it and what should happen here. I am going to quote from it because it is not a report that you can easily access, as it is not published in the normal way. She will not mind me mentioning her name: Eloise Fowler. She completed some really good forensic work in this area. Her report suggested a number of reforms that, as she said: … could be implemented to relieve the tensions between Australia's international obligations and Australian domestic law. They are: … reviewing the Attorney General's Office of International Law (OIL) advice on Australia's international obligations; reforming the Mutual Assistance Act to include human rights safeguards; amending the AFP guidelines so they abide by Australia's international obligations; enacting an Agency to Agency act; creating a caveat system for information sharing; implementing a federal charter of rights; and creating a Parliamentary committee to oversee the actions of the AFP, particularly relating to police-to-police assistance in investigations that may result in the death penalty. I will read her conclusion. It says: Australia's position on the death penalty is both contradictory and unsustainable on any moral critical reckoning. The failure to adopt the Second Optional Protocol into domestic law has placed the country in a bi-polar quandary. Obviously this bill corrects that. Then she says: While Australian citizens are protected by law enforcement agencies at home, the very same agencies that provide this protection are also involved in handing over information to assist in the execution of Australians overseas. The adoption of the Second Optional Protocol may not provide all the answers, but it will achieve two outcomes. Firstly it will reduce the possibility of this country having any hand in the killing of its own citizens and it will come as close as possible to abolishing the death penalty forever from Australia's shores. Finally, if Australia is to argue for the lives of Australians on death row overseas, a necessary first step is to clarify once and for all moral, legal and political position on the death penalty-especially in relation to formal and informal assistance. Although we are still law-makers and the laws can be passed, this bill will put beyond reach the ability to reintroduce the death penalty in any state or territory jurisdiction in Australia. I commend the Attorney-General and the Minister for Home Affairs for amending the guidelines for the informal mechanism that operates with the Australian Federal Police when operating with their colleagues in other international jurisdictions so that the issue of putting Australian citizens in harm's way will be corrected. As a parent, I can remember when we learnt about the cooperation that had existed between the Australian Federal Police and their counterparts in Indonesia and about the two Australians of the Bali Nine who had been subjected to the death penalty. Then young Scott Rush on appeal had the death penalty imposed. I can remember reading about it, hearing about it and thinking just how dreadful his parents would have felt, particularly because in trying to protect his son the father said that he had gone to the Australian Federal Police to get help. To have that eventuate must be absolutely traumatic. There are a few things I want to say about this point. In Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] the judgment was in favour of the Australian Federal Police, saying that it had acted within its procedural guidelines in assisting the Indonesians in their investigation, and obviously that is what they needed to change. But Justice Finn stated: … there is a need for the Minister administering the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth) (“the AFP Act”) and the Commissioner of Police to address the procedures and protocols followed by members of the Australian Federal Police (“AFP”) when providing information to the police its forces of another country in circumstances which predictably could result in the charging of a person with an offence that would expose that person to the risk of the death penalty in that country. Especially is this so where the person concerned is an Australian citizen and the information is provided in the course of a request being made by the AFP for assistance from that other country's police force. Justice Finn did that with great eloquence, as was noted in the report of Ms Fowler. I can remember when I mentioned the Office of International Law and the advice that they had given This advice came to light when Cameron Murphy from the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties was able to access it. It showed, to my thinking-and this was a few years back-some rather questionable advice around this whole issue of the guidelines and putting Australians in danger of the death penalty. I have referred to Ms Fowler's report, where she had the opportunity, as did I, to have a look at that whole situation quite forensically and it should be reviewed. I agree with Ms Fowler, but what also came to light was that at some point in time-and it was a few years back and with the previous government-there was a conscious decision to revise Australia's universal and consistent opposition to capital punishment in light of the government's strong stance on terrorist offences. It was commented that it could be raised within the text of the election and it disturbed me greatly to hear that, because I am not sure members of parliament knew about that. (Time expired)  rise in support of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009, which essentially introduces some amendments to the Commonwealth Criminal Code. One of the previous members for Moreton, Sir James Killen, studied for the bar while he was a member of parliament. He then practised at the bar and did quite a lot of criminal work. mention that in passing because I have just been taking a group of friends and family on a tour of Parliament House. One of the party, Des Draydon, was a very good friend of Sir James Killen. He shared chambers with him and organised Sir James Killen's 70th birthday party, had some Sir James Killen bottles of port and gave me one of those bottles of port. It is actually Des Draydon's 70th birthday today. When we were doing the tour of Parliament House it was interesting to look at the democratic institutions. As MPs we become used to it; this is our workplace and we see these things all the time. As a new MP, I am very proud of the house that we work in. It is funny that when you take people around the house you see things with fresh eyes and you point out some of the wonderful things that we have here. I am proud to be able to stand today in support of this legislation, the torture prohibition and death penalty abolition bill. Why? This bill toughens Australia's stance against the death penalty and torture and helps more fully meet our international human rights obligations. It has been more than 40 years since an execution took place in Australia. I am proud to say that Queensland was the first state to abolish capital punishment back con- in 1922 and Western Australia-a little bit tardier-was the last in 1984. The last person all executed was Ronald Ryan in Victoria in 1967, a mere 45 years ago. Ronald Ryan was executed for shooting a prison guard during an escape attempt. Incidentally, the first recorded execution in Australia-in terms of whitefella law, I guess-was on 27 February 1788; pretty soon after the first Australia Day, 222 years ago. That was a bloke called Thomas Barrett, who was hanged at Port Jackson in Sydney for stealing food from the public stores. Any student of history would know that the first I fleet did it pretty tough in terms of food when they first settled. Thankfully as a society we have come a long way since 1788. We have learned the value of human life, and all of us agree there is no place in any society for inhumane or degrading punishments like torture or capital punishment. The death penalty is now prohibited in all Australian states and territories. As a signatory to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Australia is committed to the abolition of the death penaltyeverywhere, every state, every nationwhether it be an Australian on death row or any citizen from any nation on death row. This is something on which all sides of politics agree. Australia's opposition to the death penalty is long standing and has been upheld for decades by governments of all persuasions irrespective of the ebb and flow of public opinion, especially after heinous crimes, murders or the like. Australia also works through the UN human rights commission to lobby other nations to abolish the death penalty. Some Australians still face the death penalty in countries overseas-people, as the member for Page pointed out, like Scott Rush, who is on death row in Indonesia right now. His parents, Lee and Chris Rush, are my constituents and they are incredibly brave. I cannot imagine how they get up every day and face the fact that their son is sitting on death row. I have spoken on this a couple of times in the parliament, and it has become even more poignant once I had children, once I had a son. In previous speeches I have made the comparison of the mistake that Scott made and how in my life I have made some mistakes as well. Hopefully, I have learnt from those mistakes. Unfortunately, Scott is sitting on death row and maybe will never get the opportunity to learn from his mistake. Late last year we were reminded again about the cruel and vile act of torture with the release of Australian photojournalist Nigel Brennan. Nigel's safe return was obviously a great relief for his loved ones, but the torture that he and Canadian journalist Amanda Lindhout endured over 15 months detained in Somalia is completely abhorrent to everybody. All countries, all societies who value human life, must take a stand against torture and the death penalty. This bill ensures Australia complies fully with its international obligations to combat torture and demonstrates our ongoing commitment to the abolition of the death penalty. State and territory legislation covering torture and assault occasioning grievous bodily harm ensures Australia meets its obligations under the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. However, this bill will introduce a specific torture offence in the Commonwealth Criminal Code. In doing so it repeals the Crimes (Torture) Act 1988 and responds to the UN recommendation that Australia enact a specific federal torture offence. The offence will not replace state and territory offences but will operate together with them. It ensures that Australia explicitly meets our obligations under the convention against torture. This bill also amends the Commonwealth Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 to ensure that capital punishment can never be reintroduced in Australia ever again. The act already applies to Commonwealth, territory and imperial criminal laws. This bill will extend the abolition to the states and ensure that the death penalty cannot be reintroduced at the state level. The stronger our stand against torture and capital punishment at home, the more credibility we have to lobby other countries against the death penalty; we are then able to speak with a voice with standing, not just when an Australian citizen is in trouble, but at all times. We will be able to look other nations in the eye and say: ‘This is not something you should be pursuing, not just because you have an Australian in a prison cell, but because it is the wrong to do and it is not a civilised thing to do.' It would obviously give us more credibility when it comes to fighting for the lives of people like Scott Rush. Scott faces the death penalty for carrying 1.3 kilograms of heroin into Bali on 17 April 2005. I remember that day particularly because it is the day my first son was born. Since February 2006, Scott has continued to face that death sentence while my son brings me nothing but joy-that is, mostly joy. All people who value human life stand united against this sentence and continue to hope and pray for Scott's sentence to be commuted. This bill also ensures Australia continues in compliance with the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. I commend the bill to the House.",30
11,Mr NEUMANN,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I speak in support of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009. Torture in criminal law is unacceptable. The death penalty is unacceptable. Anyone who has practised in criminal law would know that any confessions, any admissions or any statements uttered as a result of intimidation, harassment or violence are lacking in probity, authority and efficacy. People who are interrogated by police officers ought to retain their civil liberties and civil rights. It is ceptable, barbaric, inhumane and uncivilised for people to receive torture when faced with overbearing civil authority and it is something that is more akin to feudal or medieval times. The legislation here reinforces our opposition to torture in the criminal justice system and in the way we treat our fellow humans who live on this continent. The situation is that there are many people who face criminal charges, investigations and prosecutions in this country. We have a strong criminal justice system which operates as a result of the Federation, with the Commonwealth government having enacted some years ago a Criminal Code, and the criminal laws operating at a state level throughout the country. In fact, in Queensland, where I come from, the Criminal Code is taught in the first year of a Bachelor of Laws degree. I certainly studied it in the first year at the University of Queensland at St Lucia. The Criminal Code is important because it says what we believe is unacceptable and criminal behaviour in our society. For example, the Criminal Code in Queensland-for the information of those who may be listening-was authored by Sir Samuel Griffith, Chief Justice and former Queensland premier. He was educated in Ipswich from 1854 to 1855 and he was the son of a Welsh Congregational minister who practised his religion and ministered in the Congregational church in Ipswich. Sir Samuel Griffith made a lasting contribution to our laws, and that has formed the basis of laws throughout the country and at a federal level. Actually, Sir Samuel Griffith wrote the Queensland Criminal Code in his spare time from 1896 to 1899. It is a wonder he had spare time because he certainly was an incredibly hard-working individual. The legislation before this place has been endorsed by many people. I will come to the unacthird-party endorsements of this legislation, but I want to read a quote which, I think, is germane by the federal Attorney-General, Robert MCClelland. I think it is worth putting in Hansard what he said of this legislation: It will ensure the death penalty cannot be reintroduced anywhere in Australia in the future. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that Australia complies fully with its international obligations to combat torture and to demonstrate our commitment to the worldwide movement for the abolition of the death penalty. Taking these steps demonstrates our fundamental opposition to acts that are contrary to basic human values. There are some in our society who believe in an eye for an eye. I do not believe that is the case. In terms of my own religious convictions, I am more of a New Testament person rather than an Old Testament individual. I think it is important that we prosecute those who breach our criminal codes and they should be subject to the rigours of the criminal justice system. Taking someone's life as an act of vengeance is really barbaric, and I am pleased that the federal Attorney-General has put forward this legislation. It implements a very specific Commonwealth offence of torture into the Commonwealth Criminal Code. As I said, the Commonwealth Criminal Code at a federal level owes a lot to Sir Samuel Griffith and his genius and legislative and legal ability at the end of the 19th century. The new offence is intended to operate concurrently with existing offences in state and territory laws. This is an area of criminal law where both the states and the federal government have jurisdiction under our Constitution, and it is important that that legislation acts concurrently and intermarries. I will deal with that particular aspect and why it is so important later in this speech. The bill also amends the Commonwealth Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 to extend the application of the current prohibition of the death penalty in state laws to ensure the death penalty cannot be introduced anywhere in Australia. The bill, of course, had to be developed in consultation, through the COAG process and in discussions with attorneys-general throughout the states and territories. That is important. As the member for Moreton pointed out, the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 needs to be amended to cover state laws. This will safeguard ongoing compliance and obligations that we have under the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is focused fairly and squarely on the abolition of the death penalty. It is not that long ago in this country that we had the death penalty and it was operating, sadly, in a way which meant that people who committed certain criminal offencesmurder, manslaughter and other types of criminal offences-were subject to that potential risk. Many times the convictions were commuted to life imprisonment or other penalties, which was the just and humane thing to do. Queensland did take the lead in relation to the abolition of the death penalty. It is often said by those who live elsewhere that Queensland has been backward. In fact, Queensland was very progressive in that regard and took the attitude that we needed to abolish the death penalty before anyone else; it was abolished in 1922. As the member for Moreton said, Ronald Ryan was only executed in 1967, certainly in the lifetime of many people who sit in this chamber. So we are not talking about ancient history; we are only talking about a generation ago when the last person was executed in Australia. A few more than 100 people have been executed for criminal offences throughout the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. That really is a tragedy. It is important that we listen to the arguments of those people who are supportive of our current stance. Too often people will come up to us-I have certainly had them at mobile offices that I have conducted in my electorate-and advocate for the return of the death penalty. The death penalty is brutal. Anyone who has practised in law knows that judges and juries can fall into error. We know that there is no chance that if someone is killed by lethal injection, hanging, shooting or some other form of device as a result of a conviction that they will ever be rehabilitated. There will be no opportunity for reformation and repentance. Contrition, if ever expressed, cannot be acted on, and they can never be a useful member of our society and community again. I would argue, as many have, that it is certainly not an effective terrent. That has not been the experience here, and it has not been the experience in places where the death penalty has been used frequently, such as the United States of America. I mentioned earlier in relation to the prohibition on torture that we had been a party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Torture is defined in the convention as an act by which severe pain or suffering is intentionally inflicted upon a person by a public official for certain specified purposes, such as obtaining information or a confession from a person. When a person is charged with an offence or is facing the prospect that they may be charged, it is one of the most difficult times in their lives and their family are worried concerned. That is not to say that we should not have respect and sympathy for and give assistance to the family of victims; nor should we forget what those victims have suffered. But we have a criminal justice system that presumes people are innocent until proved guilty, and we should never go back to the days of kangaroo courts and Spanish Inquisition-style tactics, which were used just a few centuries ago in respect of the exeopposition cution of people or the extraction of confessions or admissions. Many times, those types of torture implements and instruments were used not just upon the alleged perpetrator of the criminal offence but upon witnesses as well. The Commonwealth Crimes (Torture) Act 1988 currently criminalises acts of torture committed outside of Australia, but only when committed by Australian citizens or other persons who are subsequently present in Australia. So there is a gap in the legislapenalty tion. Also, acts of torture that are committed anywhere in the world during the course of an armed conflict or as a crime against hudemanity are currently criminalised under the Criminal Code. The UN Committee against Torture have been critical of us-I have read what they had to say-and other nations which have not enshrined in legislation a specific criminal offence relating to torture, and the UN has called on other nations to do so. That does not mean to say we should blindly do it, but I think it gives us a degree of moral authority if we are going to criticise other countries in relation to human, civil and political rights offences and violations if we ourselves say in our criminal laws that we have specifically prohibited torture as a means of extracting information or confessions from a person. So it is a matter of giving ourselves that kind of moral authority in international relations. In May 2008 the UN committee I referred and to recommended that Australia enact a specific offence of torture at the federal level. It is certainly prohibited at state level and, as I say, there is a gap in our legislation. So the legislation currently before the House is important. The new offence will mean that the Crimes (Torture) Act is otiose and it will have to be repealed in the circumstances. We as a country, to the credit of both sides of the chamber, have had a long period of to the death penalty. We have, as I said before, been party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the second optional protocol in relation to that, aimed at the abolition of the death penalty. It is sad that not all countries throughout the world subscribe to the same viewpoint with respect to the death penalty as we do. We should take every step through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and also through our diplomatic efforts to advocate for the abolition of torture and the death throughout the world. Torture should be criminalised throughout not just the Western world but the Third World and other countries that we trade with, have relations with and deal with daily. This legislation before the House has support in the community. There has been strong support shown by Amnesty International and the Australian Human Rights Commission. I wish to outline what has been said by both those authoritative bodies with respect to the legislation. The Australian Human Rights Commission welcomed the introduction of the legislation before the House, describing it as ‘a landmark piece of legislation in Australia's human rights protections'. On 19 November 2009 commission president Cathy Branson QC said that torture in any form is unacceptable and welcomed the introduction of a specific offence of torture in the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Cathy Branson said the following: This new offence means that torture will be criminalised both within and outside Australiaeffectively closing that gap. She also said: This legislation demonstrates Australia's commitment to fully meeting its obligations under the United Nations Convention against Torture. She also talked about the death penalty and said as follows: The death penalty will not be able to be reintroduced anywhere in Australia. She said this, and I think this is very important: Once Australia becomes a party to the Optional Protocol, we will be required to establish a national system of inspection of all places of detention tion to prevent the mistreatment of people who are detained. She also went on to say: This legislation demonstrates a commitment to preventing some of the most serious breaches of human rights. Amnesty International has also come out very strongly in supporting and welcoming the proposed legislation, which it says ‘confirms Australia's opposition to torture and the death penalty'. Amnesty International has said the following: Amnesty International believes the proposed legislation is another important step towards Australia fully realising its obligations under the UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Amnesty International has described the legislation as: … a welcome commitment made by Government in 2008 to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Amnesty International has campaigned extensively on this issue and has made the point that we should be campaigning to outlaw the death penalty throughout the world in law and in practice, which I think is important, because there are many countries throughout the world that take the view that legislation says it. In practice, it does not happen. In fact, in practice often the criminal laws and the rules to protect the criminal justice system and those who come in contact with it are violated in the most heinous and horrible way. Amnesty International has said this, and I will finish with it: Amnesty International has been working for decades to prohibit the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. Its use is an affront to human dignity and a fundamental breach of human rights. I could not have put it more eloquently or articulately. It is extremely important legislathat we are dealing with today. It fulfils our obligation. It gives us moral authority and says to the Australian community where we stand and where we on both sides of the House believe Australia should go in the future. I welcome the legislation.",36
12,Mr GEORGANAS,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009 is just as it appears to be: bill to make torture a specific offence in the Commonwealth Criminal Code and also to prevent the death penalty from ever being reintroduced in any jurisdiction within the Commonwealth of Australia. I am very pleased to be here supporting this bill today. Both elements of this bill-the torture and killing of another human being-come down to matters of principle. We know that torture takes place. We see the horrendous and horrific pictures beamed through our TVs, the internet and the many media that we have today. We have known this for many, many years. The stories we hear from refugees who come to this country seeking refuge from these acts of brutality and of systematic brutality perpetrated by many forces-rogues or rogue governments-are enough to shock most of us every time we hear them, even today. We hear of instances of brutality that are inflicted to induce people to communicate all sorts of things, whether they be secrets, information or the betrayal of another human being. We have heard of people being tortured until they betray the confidence of an associate, a colleague or even a member of their family and we have heard of the persecution or execution that can happen as a result of this. We have heard of torture being used as a means of inducing terror and compliance towards a given authority. For many years, we thought that such practices had been limited to areas and conflict that were removed from our Western sensitivities, practised by powers within countries who never got involved in active participation in the UN or its focus on human rights. We thought it was the tactic of the barbaric, the brutal and people who were nothing like us. The horrors in and around the world that we see every day through the media have changed that perception to an extent, as I said earlier. But nothing could a have prepared us, for example, for the events we saw in places like Rwanda and the former republic of Yugoslavia. Previously the tendency of a national leader to engage in torture has always been perceived as evil-and rightly so-as the depths of human potential and even a self-evident rationale to depose that particular leader. I am sure that by far the majority of Australians are disgusted by the horrific act of torture. Whether any person tortured is an Australian citizen or a national of some other country, I would like to think that most of us here in Australia would draw the line at the practice of crushing a person's body and crushing a person's mind by inflicting intolerable pain, terror or the systematic loss of self. Some people may argue that under particular circumstances within the context of a highly emotive hypothetical situation or within an imaginary context through which all their fears and dreads are brought to the fore such tools of persuasion as torture may be needed, that it may be the lesser of two evils and that, while it may be regrettable, it might even be necessary to avoid even greater pain and destruction. This argument receives alarming support. But when one asks, ‘What then is the required level of threat that would legitimise the use of torture?', it is difficult to anticipate a coherent response. If it is that someone's interests are more important than the person subjected to the torture, it is a race to the bottom. I do not believe that torture has any positive outcomes for anyone or has any benefit to anyone. Jane Mayer, a writer for the New Yorker and author of The Dark Side, which was released last year, refers to substantial evidence, including from the US military and the FBI, of torture being one of the least effective methods of gaining intelligence and it being more likely to induce false confessions and misinformation through the fear and pain perpetrated on the victim. It may be that the practice of torture says more about those who perpetrate the act than the conflict in which they are involved, the nature of the threat they may be responding to or the information that they seek. It may be that the practice of torture is simply an opportunity for the sadistic to be brutal to a fellow human being. The bill also deals with the death penalty. The death penalty, also brutal, may also involve other motives. I suspect it may have an economic motive in some countries-it being cheaper to kill and bury than imprison for decades upon decades. The potential for injustice is quite apparent. The irreversibility of the act is obvious. But, apart from a desire to not want to be in a position where an innocent has been put to the sword, there is the principle as well. The principle is this: it is wrong to take the life of another. It is as simple as that. The act of taking another's life is perhaps just as low as the horrendous act that took place that precipitated it. I am also very glad that jurisdictions throughout the Commonwealth of Australia have removed the death penalty from their list of prescribed penalties and that the community has not been increasing the volume of blood on its hands for some time now. I am very pleased to speak here today in support of this bill which will confirm and restate the principle which we have all spoken to all around the world. Speaking on this bill, my mind goes to what was said just last year on 25 November here in this House. It was White Ribbon Day, which is held by the UN each year to oppose violence towards women. Violence perpetrated by men against women is evidence of the same disrespect for human dignity as the subjects of the bill we are debating here today. Violence, intimidation, physical and emotional abuse-no-one can justify such actions against another human being. No-one can say it is required, that it is for the greater good or that it will produce some good. Noone can say that this violence is not akin to thuggery and pointless brutality perpetrated by the strong against the weak, the armed against the defenceless or the organisation or rogue state against the individual. Brutality and the disrespect of human dignity must be opposed in all manifestations, on every level, in the name of every cause or in defence of even the very principle of which I speak.

13,The SPEAKER,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Hindmarsh will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",41
14,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and the Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Services Delivery will be absent from question time today, as they are in Alice Springs for a meeting of the Alice Springs Transformation Plan steering committee. The minister for housing will answer questions on behalf of the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Furthermore, the Minister for Health and Ageing will answer questions on behalf of the Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Services Delivery. NA Canonisation of Mary MACKillop",41
15,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition and all members of this place will join the government in expressing its delight at the decision by the Vatican last Friday night and the formal announcement of the canonisation of Blessed Mary MACKillop, which will go ahead later this year. This is a significant announcement for the five million Australians of the Catholic faith and for all Australians, whether of Catholic faith or not. Mary MACKillop is our first Australian to be canonised, and she will enter our history books as Australia's first saint. Mary MACKillop is an extraordinary figure in Australian history. She was a pioneering woman who dedicated her life to advancing the cause of social justice in Australia. Mary MACKillop was 24 years old when she became the first member of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, an order dedicated to teaching poor people in the parish of Penola in South Australia. Her first school was a disused stable, and it was open to all, even those who could not afford to pay school fees. Within five years the Josephites were running 35 schools. They took education to wherever it was needed, travelling in twos and threes, living in shacks, refusing government aid and begging for their living. As the Catholic priest and teacher Edmund Campion has put it, the sight of religious women lugging a carpet bag from door to door, begging, was too much for some Catholics at the time, who were used to the more sedate, large, competent nuns of Europe. One man said, ‘If my daughter were to do that sort of thing, I'd have her run in under the Vagrancy Act.' But it was because the sisters lived in poverty that Catholic schools were able to survive and expand. It is said of Mary MACKillop that her own clothes were so worn that her mantle fell apart one day when a young sister gave it a tug. While her clothes were frayed and worn, Mary MACKillop never lost her indomitable spirit and fire within. This is a good day for the Australian Catholic Church, and I believe that all members of this place would extend their heartfelt scheme. congratulations to the Australian Catholic Church, to all Australian Catholics, at this great honour which has been bestowed on this leading Australian Catholic woman.",41
16,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"On indulgence, finally we have a Vatican decision that I can support. It is fitting that the parliament should mark the canonisation of mother Mary MACKillop, who was more than just a great Catholic; she was also a great Australian. First, she was the very model of an independent woman, often in conflict with male officialdom and invariably prevailing through strength of argument and force of character. Second, she dedicated her life to the promotion of education, especially in small towns that might not otherwise have had a school. Third, she dedicated her life to the service of the poor. She did not demand that the government help the poor. She rolled up her sleeves and did it herself. In all these respects she is an exemplar for all times-for our times, not just for her times.",42
17,Mr SECKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"On indulgence, it certainly is a day for rejoicing, not only because Penola is in the electorate of Barker and the Mary MACKillop Centre is in Penola, of course, but my elder sister is a Josephite nun or, as we call them in a friendly way, a Joey. NA Home Insulation Program",42
18,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I refer the minister to the Minter Ellison report, first received on 9 April last year, and to admissions by officials in Senate hearings today that he received weekly safety updates from the secretary of his department to the 20 warnings from union, industry and state officials since the inception of his now scrapped home insulation On behalf of the 240,000 households with either unsafe or substandard installation, the 1,000 households left with potentially deadly electrified roofs and the four families of the young men who have tragically lost their lives, I ask: when did the minister first receive elements of the Minter Ellison report, and what action did he take to address the serious concerns that this report raised?",42
19,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because it allows me to continue to advise the House on those measures and actions that were taken by me and the government in relation to the Home Insulation Program. I can advise the House that the Minter Ellison report and the risk assessment processes that the government undertook at the time produced a set of advices to me in relation to this program and informed the establishment of the guidelines under this program, the nationally accredited training model under this program and a set of additional measures that were delivered to ensure that we had safety, effective delivery and adequate training in relation to this program. I caution the Leader of the Opposition against extrapolating from interim results of audit and risk management to produce in the community an apprehension that each and every ceiling is of an order to be identified having a specific risk. As the secretary of the department made clear in her statement on Friday and as I have made clear in my statements subsequently, the totality of the advice that has come to me includes the consideration that the department has had not only of Minter Ellison reports but of other material and consultations with stakeholders, industry, training bodies and the like, and they are the matters upon which I took advice and acted in this program. Mr Speaker, I add through you to the Leader of the Opposition that I have additionally announced further details today in relation to both safety inspections and rectification work relating to the termination of the Home Insulation Program. We have said we will expand the: … targeted, risk based audit and inspection program to 15 per cent of homes with non-foil insulation installed under Home Insulation Program which may have safety risks. This risk based audit will be extended further, if necessary, to any segments of households deemed at risk. That is the commitment that the government has made today. We stand by that commitment and we will deliver the new program, the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme, in that manner. Health",43
20,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what are the future challenges facing the Australian health system?",43
21,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for her question, because working families across Australia have a deep interest in the future of the health and hospital system of Australia. Australians have a fundamental interest in making sure that our system is got right for the future. Every year Australians make about 115 million visits to the doctor. Every year the nation's 768 public hospitals as deliver some 49 million hospital services to the Australian public. All this is made possible by a dedicated Australian health workforce made up of something like 60,000 doctors, 230,000 nurses and 134,000 allied health professionals. This comes at great cost to the Australian taxpayer. Taxpayers at present pay some $71.2 billion each year to support this public health system of Australia. We have to look, however, at how this system of ours is sustainable into the future. By international standards our health and hospital system performs well, but it is under great pressure. The demand for health services in Australia is rapidly outweighing the supply of those services, and the reasons are pretty plain: firstly, an expanding population; secondly, an ageing population; and, thirdly, of course, great advances in medical technology. I also say to those opposite and to the House at large: the proportion of those over the age of 65 is increasing and is expected to increase around sevenfold, which means that the overall burden on our health and hospital system for the future will be greater indeed. The other point of stress in the system for the future isMr Laming-Your lack of action! You've done nothing in two years.",43
22,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the ability of the states and territories to fund the system's expansion for the decades ahead. Mr Speaker, those opposite interject about the capacity of the health system to deliver, a health system which has not been able to deliver effectively because the previous government ripped a billion dollars out of the public hospital system. Treasury projects that the total health spending of all states will exceed 100 per cent of their tax revenues, excluding the GST, by around 2045-46 and possibly earlier in a number of states-in fact, as early as in about 20 or so years time. A final point about stress in the system and the ability to fund future needs is this: waste, duplication and overlap. The Bennett report reached conclusions that some 10 to 20 per cent of our total health expenditure at present could currently be being wasted because of the duplications which exist within our system. The government in its two years in office has increased the overall allocation to health and hospitals by some 50 per cent. We have a $1.1 billion investment in training for more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals; a $750 million investment in improving our emergency departments; a half-billion dollar investment in subacute care beds; and nearly a half-billion dollar investment in prevention, expanding the preventative healthcare investment to $872 million. These are the practical measures we have taken so far, given the billion dollars which was ripped out of the system by those who preceded us. The government is also taking significant steps to underpin the future funding needs of the system. That is why in the 2009-10 budget we introduced the vital private health insurance savings measure to make sure that lowand middle-income Australian taxpayers were not subsidising the health insurance of wealthier Australians. This important savings measure is still being blocked by the opposition in the parliament. If not passed it will cost taxpayers almost $2 billion over the forward estimates and much more beyondbillions of dollars which should be being invested in the future needs of our health and hospital system. This is absolutely fundamental to the future funding of the reforms and expansion of the system that we need, a system that is already under considerable stress. That is why the government welcomes a debate on the future of health and hospitals. That is why the government has acted, in its two years on this matter, against the billion dollars ripped out of the health and hospital system by those opposite. I say to those opposite, when they reflect upon their 12 years in office-the freeze they put on the training places for GPs, the billions they ripped out of the health system overall and, on top of that, the shortage of 6,000 nurses across the country-this is a debate that we welcome for the parliament and for the country at large. We have acted in the two years we have been in, and we have much more to do on this one. Home Insulation Program",44
23,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I refer the minister to the Minter Ellison risk assessment on his now failed home insulation scheme provided to his department prior to the commencement of the scheme in July last year and in particular to the warnings that this risk assessment contained about program timing, compliance, fraud, safety and the potential for house fires. I ask the minister: was he briefed on and did he read any part of the report prior to receiving the full report a fortnight ago? Why did he not read the full report immediately and respond immediately and why did he not table the full report, including the so-called risk register, rather the selected parts of the full report?",45
24,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The answer to that question is that I received the full Minter Ellison report this year and that is the first occasion that I saw and read that report in its entirety. The second part of his question to me I respond to as follows. In determining a risk assessment mechanism for the rollout of the Home Insulation Program, I understand my department drew on a range of sources and information including the Minter Ellison risk assessment report and began to deliver a risk register as a consequence of that report. The totality of advice that I received, including my department's identification of matters raised not only in that report but in others coming through to me, I have responded to. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: I have responded to it in these terms which were to ensure that we put in place a delivery of the Home Insulation Program that provided for the management of risk to acceptable levels. A number of those matters that have been identified in this report were identified in other engagements that were brought to my attention over time-namely, consultations with stakeholders, views of relevant technical experts and otherwise. The task that I set myself was to determine that the advice that I received was the appropriate advice to act upon. I put in place a series of measures to ensure the rollout of this program taking into account any matters identified by the department and brought forward to me by way of advice. That is what I did in relation to this program. There are a staged series of additional announcements I made on the basis of advice I received to lift issues in relation to safety and subsequently to training. It is a case of managing acceptable risk levels that has always been the determiner for me than as minister. That is why I have made every decision up to the decisions I have made in the last week. Health",45
25,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. What are pressures on the health system as outlined in the report 2010 Intergenerational Report Australia to 2050: Future Challenges and why is it important to place the health budget on a sustainable footing?,45
26,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his very important question. It is important that we put the health budget on a sustainable footing. The Australia 2050 report highlighted the impact of rapidly rising health costs on the future of the Australian economy. Health costs are projected to increase from 15 per cent of all Commonwealth spending now to something like 26 per cent by 2050. This is an increase in 204950 of something like $200 billion from today's spending. This makes health the biggest pressure on our budget, contributing around two-thirds of the total increase in public spending over this time. This reflects ageing pressures, increasing demand for health services and new and more expensive drugs and technologies. The Australia 2050 report identifies the critical need to address the rising cost of our health system. This side of the House is committed to safeguarding the long-term sustainability of the health budget but also making sure that taxpayers' dollars are distributed fairly. Spending on the private health insurance rebate has grown from $2.1 billion in 200001 to $4.2 billion last financial year. Real spending per person is projected to increase by more than 50 per cent from 2012-13 to the equivalent of $319 per person in 202223. That is the primary reason why the government has announced fair and responsible changes to the private health insurance rebate to better target that rebate to those who need it most. Our changes are designed to have a minimal impact on participation with 99.7 per cent of people expected to maintain their hospital cover according to Treasury analysis. Unfortunately, the opposition shows no sign at all of doing the right thing with this change to the private health insurance rebate. They want a health system where working families subsidise the healthcare costs of the well to do. That is simply unacceptable in the circumstances that I have outlined. We hear all sorts of extreme statements from the shadow Treasurer and from the Leader of the Opposition about how they stand for fiscal responsibility, but they are in there knocking off a saving of $2 billion over four years and $9 billion to 2019-20. Every day the shadow Treasurer huffs and puffs about how responsible he is and says that the opposition stand for responsible economic measures, but the opposition in the Senate just show that he is full of hot air, because there is no fiscal responsibility on that side of the House. If they were interested in providing affordable health care to average Australians and if they were responsible economic managers, they would be backing this very important bill in the Senate, but what they are doing is demonstrating yet again what a risk they are to the Commonwealth budget and the Australian economy. We on this side of the House will get on with the hard work of supporting hard working Australian families and giving them a fair go. NA",45
27,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Deputy Chairman of External Affairs for the Justice and Development Party of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, Mr Suat Kiniklioglu. On behalf of the House I extend to him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Home Insulation Program",46
28,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I refer the minister to remarks made at his media conference last Friday by the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts with respect to his scraped home insulation scheme that the scheme had ‘a very high level of compliance', ‘very high safety requirements', that the guidelines were ‘very stringent' and also that the scheme ‘has probably had one of the highest compliance and audit regimes put in place'. If a 24 per cent failure rate and 240,000 unsafe or substandard installations is a high level of compliance, why should the public have any confidence that the new scheme administered by the same minister will be any safer than the old one?",46
29,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and point out to the honourable member that, as he well knows, the information that was provided by the secretary of the department on Friday pointed to two components of compliance and risk under this program, one relating to actual risks identified as being significant and the other a range of risk issues including, amongst other things, spaces between the installation of batts, uncompleted paperwork and the like. I again caution the opposition about conflating interim figures on risk assessment to make predictions about the risk levels across the landscape of the Home Insulation Program. The fact is that we have insulated over one million homes under this program, that there has been a risk and compliance strategy in place since the program ran out from 1 July and that that has been delivered as a consequence of advice that we received not only from my department but also from the industry itself, from training bodies and from consultations with stakeholders which have regularly taken place as a consequence of the delivery of this program. The changes we announced on Friday go to the key point that the appropriate and safe management of risk under this program is a responsibility I take seriously and the measures that we have identified for both a register and a continued delivery of insulation into people's homes through the transition to a new program is well articulated and identified. We will work closely with industry and the relevant authorities, particularly state authorities, in relation to that delivery. It be done in a way which ensures that the delivery of insulation, a product which has been in use in Australian homes for many years and installed safely for many years, can continue. Private Health Insurance",46
30,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. How does the government plan to reform the private health insurance rebate and make it more sustainable for taxpayers? Mr Simpkins-A broken promise again. Mr Tuckey interjecting,47
31,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Cowan is warned! The member for O'Connor is warned!,47
32,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyons for his question because I know the member for Lyons and the member for Braddon and many members on this side of the House, and I suspect also the member for Maranoa and perhaps the member for Gippsland, the member for Lyne and the member for New England, would all understand that their constituents on low and middle incomes rely very heavily on the private health insurance rebate and want it to be sustainable for the future. It is important for those lowand middle-income earners in electorates that are not like the North Shore electorates represented by the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Treasurer that have large numbers of high-income earners who are being subsidised by those on low and middle incomes who indeed need government assistance to ensure that they can keep their private health insurance. The changes that are being debated in the Senate today are designed to make the private health insurance rebate sustainable to ensure that those lowand middle-income Australians are able to continue to have the will support that they deserve from the government. But before those opposite get too agitated let me read a statement by the new President of the Business Council of Australia, Mr Graham Bradley. I do not think the Business Council of Australia can be accused of being Labor patsies, but it appears that even the new Business Council of Australia president supports the government's approach. Recently he called on the government ‘to secure the future affordability of our health care system' and said that bringing the budget back into surplus would require ‘tightening eligibility requirements and means testing'-in other words, exactly the type of measure that is being voted on in the Senate today, tomorrow or whenever the opposition finally decide that they are prepared to let there be a vote. There is another chance for the opposition to show that not only do they support lowand middle-income earners but also they support the views of the Business Council. It is no longer just a question of whether or not they can play the politics of this. Ultimately, millions of lowand middle-income earners across the country want this support, need this support and deserve to be able to have the rebate system sustainable into the future. So it is a question of not just the fiscal bility that the Treasurer dealt with earlier but also their credibility in the community, telling lowand middle-income earners in electorates across the country that their support is under threat when they will not support these sensible measures that even the Business Council of Australia thinks should be supported. Home Insulation Program",47
33,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Given that at least 93 house fires have now been directly attributed to the faulty installation of roof insulation through the minister's failed home insulation scheme and, Minister, given your own department's admission last Friday that up to 240,000 homes have either unsafe or substandard insulation installed, what specific arrangements have been implemented to ensure the completion of proper safety inspections on the nearly one million homes that are currently at risk? When will the inspections be completed, Minister, for the nearly one million Australian households, many of whom cannot sleep for worry that they have a fire hazard within their roof?",48
34,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am advised that there are 87 identified risks in relation to fire under this program, but I will go on to say that the announcement that I made today in relation to the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme and this program as it transitions made clear that a number of factors will be taken into account in relation to the assessment process as it pertains to those who are installing insulation under the scheme from June of next year. In relation to the existing program of monitoring, audit and compliance, can I advise the House-as I began to again todayof the decisions that I have taken today in relation to the rollout of an amplified audit, risk and compliance program under the existcrediing audit and compliance measures that the department has in place. We will accelerate and amplify that audit and risk assessment. It will be done initially to capture some 15 per cent of those targeted homes, and it begins, as a matter of course, on top of the existing program of audit compliance that is already underway. Pensions and Benefits",48
35,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Minister, why is it important that the parliament pass the student income support legislation and what are the consequences if it does not?",48
36,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question, and I know that he, as I am and members of the government are, is very concerned about student income support and supporting Australian students to go to university. The Leader of the Opposition is always free with advice to others about things that they should take responsibility for. Well, the Leader of the Opposition himself faces a test this week as to whether or not he will step up to his responsibilities to ensure that legislation passes this parliament which enables us to pay fair student income support to the students who need it the most. I want to make clear to this parliament and to the Leader of the Opposition the consequences he will be personally responsible for if this legislation does not go through the parliament. If this legislation does not go through the parliament then 25,000 students with family incomes between $32,800 and $44,165 per annum will miss out on an increase to the maximum rate of youth allowance. We should be clear about that. That means that the Leader of the Opposition will be personally responsible for a student who lives in a home that earns around $40,000 a year not getting full youth allowance. Then, of course, the Leader of the Opposition, if this legislation does not pass, will personally responsible for the fact that a dent who needs to move to study from a family that earns $60,000 a year-they should be able to receive almost $12,000 in their first year-will get no support unless they take a gap year. Then, on the question of university students, for a family with, perhaps, two students living away from home and a family income of $140,000, if this legislation passes then those students will be able to get rent assistance and the new Student Start-up Scholarship, plus a relocation scholarship. If this legislation is not passed, those students will get nothing. These are the consequences of the conduct of the Liberal Party and what is at stake this week. It amazes me that, at the same time as the Leader of the Opposition is obviously directing his Liberal Party senators to hold up this legislation, I get correspondence from members of the opposition asking me to fix the very problems that they have created. I got correspondence from the member for Gippsland, who asks whether or not we would fix the fact that someone who gets youth allowance has part-time income taken into account when they are calculating youth allowance. He wants that fixed. Well, the legislation that Liberal senators are holding up fixes that very thing. The thing he wants fixed is being held up by his colleagues. Then, of course, he is not alone. I have had correspondence from Senator MCGauran, who originally wrote to Centrelink; the correspondence was referred to me. Senator MCGauran was complaining about the parental income test for youth allowance being too low. Well, Senator MCGauran is right, but all Senator MCGauran has to do during the Senate vote is vote on our side of the chamber, and we will be able to get this legislation through. Ultimately this comes down to a test for the Leader of the Opposition, and it is a test be this week. The test is whether or not he will stu- stand up for a youth allowance package that is fair or whether he will end up explaining to literally thousands of students in thousands of families why they are not getting the benefits that the government wants to pay to them, a gross unfairness for which he will be responsible. Home Insulation Program",48
37,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I refer the minister to his announcement on 10 February of the suspension of the foil insulation program and the establishment of the safety hotline. Can the minister explain why, in the 27 television and radio interviews he gave in his own defence in the days following this announcement, he did not once mention the safety hotline number or specifically warn householders of the potential dangers of entering their roofs? How long will it take before all of the potentially 1,000 deadly electrified roofs have been found and fixed?",49
38,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I remind the honourable member that on a number of occasions, including in radio interviews in relation to this program, I have made very clear to people what the number is in relation to the Home Insulation Program. I do recall an occasion when I was first asked the question in the House on this particular matter and that the opposition made much merry of the fact that I actually quoted the number: 1800 808 571. But can I go further and respond to the honourable member's question by sayingMr Randall-You don't know the number!",49
39,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Canning will cease interjecting and actually listen.,50
40,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will say that in terms of providing the public with information concerning the Home Insulation Program, it has always been the case that there was a website available for people to access. That website has had the guidelines and requirements under the scheme, and there was also posted clear information to installers under that program about what steps should be taken in relation to any risks or compliance breaches that may take place. The fact is that we take safety seriously the delivery of ceiling insulation. I have to say that there are a substantial number of credible, well-qualified and honourable ceiling installers who have done their job under this program according to the guidelines. They have placed insulation in people's ceilings which does not pose any additional risks for householders. For the opposition to claim in the parliament that up to a million homes or otherwise are at risk is not an appropriate or responsible way to ask questions of me on this matter. I am very happy to take the questions that the opposition puts to me, but I simply point out to those opposite that the information that was tendered on Friday made clear that some 75 or 76 per cent of households that had been insulated under this program had not shown compliance or risk issues associated with them and, of those that remained, it was some eight per cent where significant risk issues were attached and they would be followed up as a matter of urgency-as they always have been under this program. Economy",50
41,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. What has been the Reserve Bank's recent commentary on the state of our economy and the economic debate in Australia?,50
42,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his very important question. I think that the evidence the governor gave last Friday was a heartening assessment of the performance of the Australian economy during the global recession. I think when we last sat we were talking about the creation of some 180,000 jobs in this country in extraordinary circumstances, meaning that breadwinners were going to work and businesses were keeping their doors open because of economic stimulus and because of the remarkable resilience of in the Australian economy, the capacity of the workforce, the capacity of employers to work together with the government and the economic stimulus to support our economy during a time of great trauma in the global economy. Everyone on this side of the House certainly celebrates that performance. It has been very important to this country. I think that the evidence the governor gave at the committee was heartening. He talked about the strong rebound in the Asia Pacific but, of course, he did note that there were headwinds elsewhere in the global economy. He made the point that we were still yet to see evidence of a self-sustaining recovery in private demand in the large industrial economies, with growth being driven by the inventory cycle and temporary stimulus. He confirmed, however, that Australia's finances are much healthier than comparable countries. I would just like to quote from the governor: And in terms of fiscal sustainability, Australia's position is, by any measure, very strong indeed. Of course, his remarks follow those of the assistant governor, Philip Lowe, last week, who had this to say about the Australian economy: We have come through the global downturn better than expected and, unlike many other advanced economies, employment has recently grown strongly and the level of investment remains So that is encouraging for the country and it is encouraging for all of our citizens. I think it also demonstrates not only that Australia has cause for confidence but that it is important that we do not have public commentary which is talking down our economy. It is very important that we do not get into that position. Of course, the governor had some interesting remarks to make on Friday about recent commentary around spending and interest rates. Many in the House would remember that a week or so ago the governor gave a speech at a conference in Sydney, where on page 1, at the bottom, it said, ‘This commentary has got nothing to do with Australia.' ‘Nothing to do with Australia'-you might recall that we had the opposition in here with a map of the globe, and the shadow Treasurer came out with all guns blazing. I think he asked the question to the Prime Minister-I have not had many questions from the shadow Treasurer; I think there has been one since SeptemberMr Hockey-You won't even debate me!",50
43,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sloppy Joe there went out, all guns blazing",51
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will refer to members by their titles!,51
45,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"hurdling the RBA governor in his attempts to talk down the economy! What did the governor say in his evidence about this distortion and misrepresentation from the shadow Treasurer? He said: No particular message was intended for Australia here, as I think was clear in the disclaimer at the front of the paper-which most people who have reported on the paper have overlooked, I notice. There has rarely been a sharper rebuke of a shadow Treasurer than that delivered by the governor at the committee last week: a direct repudiation of those opposite, and another high. demonstration of why they are so reckless and such a risk to the Australian economy. For our part, we will go on supporting the Australian economy, creating jobs and looking after working people. Home Insulation Program",51
46,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Did the minister read or receive a briefing on any part of the Minter Ellison report prior to receiving the full report 10 months after the program was announced?",51
47,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As I have already indicated to the House, I did not receive or read the Minter Ellison report until this year. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. He was asked a direct question: did he receive any part of the report or read any part of the report prior to receiving the full report?",51
48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The minister is responding to the question.,51
49,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to the totality of advice that I received from the department, including advice that would have taken into account issues raised not only in the Minter Ellison report but also in other reports and inquiries, I acted on the basis of that vice and, on the basis of that advice, I put measures in place which we rolled out in terms of delivering the home insulation program. Economy",51
50,Mr RAGUSE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Human Services and Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law. Minister, how are the government's economic policies being received by Australian businesses? What risks are there to the growing confidence and stability within our economy?",52
51,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and I recognise his extensive small business experience and his knowledge of the importance of business confidence in creating jobs. Last week we saw a broad improvement in business conditions across almost all sectors. The NAB quarterly business survey found that business confidence strengthened in the December quarter 2009 and now is at its highest level in 15 years. I am sure this is welcomed by members on both sides of the House, because business confidence is so important when it comes to job creation. Getting Australians into work and keeping them in work has been the focus of the government in the light of the global financial crisis and the ongoing international economic instability. Clearly, the government's stimulus package has had a marked effect on business confidence, which has flowed on in terms of jobs. The OECD last week issued another reminder of the importance of the government's stimulus when it comes to the economy. It said that employment in Australia in 2010 will be between 1.4 and 1.9 percentage points higher than what it would have been without the stimulus measures adopted. That is what the OECD says. It is very important that stimulus remains in place, because withad- drawing the remaining stimulus would put at the risk 100,000 jobs. One hundred thousand jobs will be put at risk by the opposition. I am also asked about risks to the confidence and the stability within the Australian economy. The main risk lies in the trifecta of economic ignorance which makes up the economic team of those opposite-the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance; the trifecta of economic ignorance. We have all grown accustomed to the daily rants of the shadow minister for finance, but I think he has the right to feel aggrieved that his mistakes have received so much attention, because all he has been trying to do is keep up with the boss. We have seen the Leader of the Opposition cite New Zealand as the role model for the Australian economy. We remember that on The 7.30 Report on 6 January he was asked about how the stimulus was necessary and that it had appeared to have done the trick, and he said: But at high price. And if you look across the Tasman, New Zealand has done just as well it seems as Australia without going into anything like the same level of debt and deficit that we have. So they have done just as well as us-with an unemployment rate of 7.3 per cent! Apparently, that is good enough for the Leader of the Opposition. And we have the shadow Treasurer, who has been willing to cite anyone and anything in support of his arguments that stimulus should be withdrawn. Do we remember the famous Gordon Brown speech-the phantom speech invented by the shadow Treasurer, a fabrication by the shadow Treasurer? That then brings us to the fabrication with respect to the Governor of the Reserve Bank's remarks-the verballing of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, as the Treasurer indicatedwhich was completely repudiated by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. But if that was not enough, last week in Senate estimates, in answering questions from Senator Joyce about the line of argument put by the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance about spending and interest rates, the Secretary to the Treasury said that that was ‘a gross oversimplification of economic understanding'. So we have a new year and a new leader, but the same old sloppy Joe.",52
52,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will refer to members by their parliamentary titles.,53
53,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is at his most credible when he is wearing a tutu, not when he is quoting others in response to his argument. We have a pattern here-a pattern of a fundamental lack of understanding of the Australian economy. I say through you, Mr Speaker, to the Deputy Prime Minister, that perhaps we need an enhancement to the My School website. Perhaps we need a subjectby-subject breakdown. If we had that, Nambour high school would beat Riverview every time. What we see is three people who have no fundamental understanding of economics and who are a great risk to the economy, because they do not get economics in Australia and they do not get international economics-they do not get economics at all. Home Insulation Program",53
54,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I refer the minister to his home insulation scheme which, despite the 20 warnings he received and ignored, has resulted in 240,000 homes with unsafe or substandard insulation, 6,000 jobs under threat, at least $50 million to be spent on home audit costs, 1,000 homes electrified, at least 93 house fires and the tragic loss of four lives. I ask the minister: will he take personal responsibility for this public policy disaster and will he apologise to all those people who are now less safe as a result of his program?",53
55,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I certainly do acknowledge that, where there has been a tragic loss of life in relation to the potential linkages between this program and a fatality, that is a matter of great concern to me, as it is to everyone in the House. I make the point as well to the Leader of the Opposition that I have made no judgment on the cause of those fatalities, neither should I in my position as minister and, frankly, neither should he in his position as opposition leader. These matters are the subject of inquiry by relevant state safety authorities and, additionally, potentially, by coronial inquiry. It is abuse of the position that we hold-to be able to speak to the nation as a whole-to infer, prior to properly and fully understanding the consequences of any incident, what has or has not caused this matter. It is the case, regrettably, that there have been these fatalities and the association with this program has been identified. I very, very much regret that. In terms of the honourable member asking me about responsibility: I take responsibility for delivering a program that the government designed to achieve the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, for dealing with the challenges of the fiscal stimulus package responding to the global financial crisis, for providing the opportunities for extra employment and for ensuring that the program was delivered in a way which was safe, and that training standards were in place to enable us to do that. At every step of the way I have taken advice from my department as to what appropriate measures should be in place to ensure those goals of risk management. Mr Laming interjecting",53
56,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bowman is warned!,53
57,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will continue to do that. I will continue to exercise my responsibilities diligently as the minister for the ronment. MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, NA Censure Motion",54
58,Mr ABBOTT,HERITAGE AND THE ARTS,I seek leave to move a motion of censure against the minister for the environment.,54
59,The SPEAKER,HERITAGE AND THE ARTS,Is leave granted?,54
60,Mr ALBANESE,HERITAGE AND THE ARTS,"On the basis that there is an understanding that there will be two speakers a side, the government will grant leave. Leave granted.",54
61,Mr ABBOTT,HERITAGE AND THE ARTS,"I move: That this House censures the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts for his gross and systemic failure in delivering the Government's Home Insulation Scheme that through his incompetence, refusal to heed safety warnings and blatant inability to do the job the public mands of him as Minister, he has put at risk the safety of tens of thousands of Australian homes, the jobs of thousands of workers and the lives of installers and householders living with tion and fire risk across the country. Minister, enough is enough, it is now time to take responsibility and resign. It is a fundamental principle of our system of government that ministers are responsible for the administration of their portfolios and for the administration of their programs. If that principle is to be disregarded or ignored, what is the point of this House sitting? What is the point of this question time if ministers do not take responsibility for the maladministration of their portfolios? The tragedy of what we have seen in question time today is that we have seen a minister betray what I am sure is his basic decency. We have seen him squirming, twisting envi- and turning, and doing anything to try to save his political hide rather than address the serious problems that are now absolutely manifest in the programs that he has been administering, and administering badly. What we have seen from this minister is a whole series of weasel words and a whole series of obfuscations and equivocationseverything but a simple statement of the truth. The truth is that this was a badly designed program, that the minister was warned about the flaws in the design and that he did not take any action about the flaws in the design. The program was put into practice and all of the predictions about what would go wrong came true. At every step in this whole sorry saga, the minister either did not react or reacted completely inadequately. After 160,000 insulations that did not comply with product standards, 80,000 insulations that did not comply with safety standards, 1,000 electrified homes, 93 house fires and four deaths, finally, this minister suspended the program. deBut it was too late for all of those people now living in unsafe houses and, tragically, too late for the families of those four young victims of a program that should never have electrocubeen put into place the way it was. That is the tragic truth. The minister's program has had these consequences and the Prime Minister still says, ‘He is a first-class minister.' This is a minister who was responsible for 240,000 bodgie home installations, 100,000 electrified roofs, 93 house fires and four deaths, and this Prime Minister says, ‘He is a first-class minister.' I would hate to see a second-class minister in this government if a first-class minister is responsible for such mayhem on a grand scale. What we have seen from this minister today is, clearly, an inadequate explanation about what he was told, when he was told about it and what he did about it. We asked him question after question in this House today about when he first learnt of the contents of the Minter Ellifirst-class son report and when he was first briefed about the Minter Ellison report. What we got from this minister was a series of obfuscations and equivocations, and he said, ‘I only received the full report 10 days ago.' Well, that is just not good enough. Why did his department ask for the report? Why did he ask for the report if he did not know there was a problem? Having got the report, why did he not read the report and why did he not act on the report? Whichever way it is, this minister is guilty. This minister should resign and, if this minister does not have the decency to resign, he should be sacked. Either he had the report, did not bother to find out about it and did not act upon it or he did have the report and he did not do what he so obviously should have. And he has misled this parliament about what he actually knew and when he knew it. This is a minister and a government which just does not get it. This is not the ordinary argy-bargy of parliament. We are not talking here about the usual business of a dollar here, a dollar there, a document here, a document there; we are talking about a program that has put at risk tens of thousands of people. We are talking here about a program administered by this government which has compromised and jeopardised the safety of tens of thousands of people, and this minister not only will not take responsibility but will not apologise for actions for which he clearly should be accountable. We asked him, ‘Would he take responsibility?' and he said he was concerned. It is just not good enough, Minister. We asked him, ‘Would he apologise?' and he said, ‘It was regrettable'. It is just not good enough, Minister. These are people's lives at stake and you show no remorse, you show no concern and you show no urgency about anything except saving your own hide. And this Prime Minister says that this minister is a minister. If this government goes to its political grave later this year, it will be with the words of the Prime Minister about the minister for the environment ringing in its ears, ‘He was a first-class minister'. If the Australian public thinks that the Prime Minister really does believe that this minister is a first-class minister, they will conclude that this Prime Minister is not worthy of their continued confidence. If all of this had happened suddenly, despite repeated assurances from his senior officials and from experts in the field that all was well with this program, and if this disaster on such scale had simply been sprung upon this minister, it should still be fatal for his continuation in office. But this did not happen suddenly. This was a slow motion train wreck. This program was a disaster that unfolded step by step in the full knowledge of people in the field, in the full knowledge of the experts in the department and, I say, with the full knowledge of this minister-or it should have been with the full knowledge of this minister if he was maintaining adequate supervision of his department-and he did nothing. He was warned at every step and at every step he failed to take adequate action. As early as 9 March last year he was warned in writing by the National Electrical and Communications Association that this program was a disaster waiting to happen. In late April last year he was warned by state and territory ministers that this program was a disaster waiting to happen and that, if this program went ahead in the form that the government envisaged, there would be serious risk to property and to life. On 14 October last year we had the first death directly linked to this program. On 16 October last year the master electricians association formally wrote to the minister, warning him that without an immediate suspension of the foil insulation program there would be further fatalities. What did the minister do? He had meetings but he did not suspend the program. There were further warnings. In November the ACTU-the Australian Council of Trade Unions-called for the suspension of the foil insulation program, and still this minister did nothing. The New South Wales minister warned of the fire risk from this program. The South Australian minister warned of the fire risk from this program. These were not market fundamentalists. These were not wild-eyed right-wing conspiracy theorists. These were Labor government ministers warning this minister of the risks inherent in his program, and still he did nothing. It was only in February that he finally acted after another two deaths. Let me make it crystal clear: these were preventable deaths. The minister did not kill them but he did not take the action that would have kept them alive. There is no more terrible judgment that could be pronounced against a minister in a Labor government: that his inaction contributed to two deaths. Yet that is the judgment that is pronounced against this minister, and still the Prime Minister insists that he is a first-class minister. The first charge against this minister-the charge on which he should be censured if he does not have the decency to resign-is of a comprehensive failure to administer this program, leading, I repeat, to 240,000 dodgy installations, to 1,000 electrified roofs, house fires and to four deaths. But the second charge, at least in the context of parliamentary accountability, is no less serious. This minister has wilfully misled the public and this House about the failures inherent in his program. From the very beginning this minister has been boasting about what a magnificent program this is. From the very beginning he has been telling us how splendid it is that some one million houses have been insulated under this program. What good did it do to insulate these houses if 240,000 of them have not been properly insulated, if 1,000 of them have actually been electrified, if 93 have been burnt down and if four people have died as a result of this program? Instead of warning people about the safety risks, all this minister has done-at every step of the way, at every twist in this tale-is defend himself. This minister is the issue. He is the issue because his failures have compromised the safety of tens of thousands of Australians. As recently as 10 February this minister was saying: … a successful program continues to rollout, to deliver the kind of benefits that it is to Australian households … Just 12 days ago he was calling it ‘a successful program' that was continuing to roll out and to deliver benefits to Australian households-but what are those benefits? They are: dodgy installation, unsafe installation, electrified houses, house fires and the deaths of installers. Just 12 days ago he was telling us what a successful program it was. The next day, 11 February, again he called it ‘a very successful program'. Even last Friday, the day he announced the suspension of the program, he could not help himself. He was still boasting about how successful it was. He said that the program was put in place to respond to the global financial crisis, to provide fiscal stimulus and that ‘it delivered into 93 spades'. Last Friday, the very day he suspended the program, he claimed that it had delivered in spades. He went on to say: ‘Each step along the way we have sought to take into account the necessary safety and training requirements to ensure that the program could be delivered not only effectively but safely and properly.' The very day the program was cancelled he was boasting about how successful it was. This minister is in electrocution denial. That is the problem with this minister. This is a government in electrocution denial. Having boasted about how good this program was, the minister went on to admit that, if he had known more, nearly 4,000 of the installers would have been suspended and 1,050 of them would have been deregistered. This is a minister who claims that he was always on top of this program and this portfolio. The third charge against this minister is that the man who created the mess is the last person who should be trusted to fix it. He designed a program that could not work. He ignored repeated warnings that it would not work. He was wilfully blind to the fact that it was not working, and he stopped it only after 240,000 houses had been improperly insulated, after 1,000 houses had been electrified, after 93 houses had burnt down and after four people had died while installing insulation. This program is a disgrace, it is an embarrassment, and if this minister had any shred of the conscience that he so exemplified in his former life, he would now be looking into his own heart. He would now be probing his own soul, he would be consulting his own conscience, and he would be asking himself, ‘Will this really do?' It is just not good enough that a program has failed to this magnitude with 6,000 people, at the very least, potentially losing their jobs while this minister desperately clings to his. Six thousand people are losing their jobs, on top of all the other things that have happened, and this minister is desperately clinging on to his. And still the Prime Minister says that he is a first-class minister. What does that say about the Prime Minister when he says that this minister is a first-class member of the government? It says that this Prime Minister is more than likely in this program up to his neck. That is what it says about this Prime Minister. Last week, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, just on the other side of the chamber, said: ‘Who really cares about the maladministration of this program? Let's face it. We had to shovel the money out the door to save Australia from recession, so how could we possibly be expected to dot the i's and cross the t's?' We know what happens with programs like this when the i's are not dotted and the t's are not crossed: terrible disasters take place, terrible tragedies happen, and the government should take responsibility for these tragedies. Ministers should be accountable for these tragedies. Ministers should be censured if they refuse to be accountable, and ministers should be sacked if they are not so conscientious and so honourable as to take responsibility. I say on behalf of 240,000 householders whose houses have been improperly insulated, on behalf of the 7,000 workers who are likely to lose their jobs, on behalf of the 1,000 householders who face potential electrocution risks, on behalf of the 93 householders whose homes have burnt down and on behalf of the four families whose young sons have perished: first, this minister should apologise; second, he should appreciate the enormity of his incompetence and resign; and third, if he remains obdurate, the Prime Minister should sack him. Otherwise it is the government that is guilty, not just this minister.",54

64,Mr GARRETT,HERITAGE AND THE ARTS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts) (3.14 pm)-I want to make very clear in the parliament that this government has always taken issues of safety seriously, that I as a minister take issues of safety seriously and that the construction of the risk management program and framework under the Home Insulation Program was particularly and specifically designed to that end. Additionally, I want to make the point that there is no activity which is risk-free and that the challenge in programs of any kind delivered by any government, at federal or state level, is for departments and ministers to assure themselves that the program they have put in place is capable of satisfactorily managing risks that are identified and, if necessary, adding to the safety risk management exercise by way of action where necessary and doing that on the basis of advice from the department, advice from experts and advice from stakeholders. The fact is, at every step of the way as this program has been rolled out, I have taken advice about what measures we needed to have in place to manage safety. I have always said, at every step of the way, that, if there were a requirement for additional steps to be taken in terms of the satisfactory management of risk under this program, then I would take those steps. It is the case that the most recent advice to me in relation to risk management around this program provided me the opportunity to consider whether or not the program could continue in a way that would satisfactorily manage risk-that is, in a way that was adequate and appropriate for a program of this kind-and I came to the conclusion, on the basis of that advice, that it could not. So I have not run away from these problems. I have actually addressed them as they have come to me and I have taken the step not only of closing a program where there was the potential for additional risks to arise, on the basis of the most recent advice that I had, but also of putting in place a transition to a program which would lift even higher the level of regulatory framework for risk management in relation to insulation in people's ceilings. It is a fact that the government has been criticised on occasions for not responding to a range of issues that have been raised and it is the case that sometimes those who are involved in the discussion about the rollout of this program have had different views. It is a fact that, as minister, I have sought advice from my department about a range of views that have come to me: views expressed by stakeholders; views of the industry itself, in which there are divergent voices; views of technical experts; and views in relation to the risk assessment that the department itself has as an ongoing process, informed by the report that was referred to earlier in the House. The appropriate course of action for any minister in this situation is to take that advice seriously. If a minister receives advice which identifies and highlights risks and does not act in a timely and appropriate fashion, then it is absolutely legitimate for an issue to be raised around the exercise of that judgment. But my statement in the parliament last week and my subsequent decisions show that in fact I have taken the advice of the department in reaching my decisions and making decisions about this program. It is on that basis that the conduct of my responsibility as a minister rests. I must go back to a round-table in February and to issues that were raised in relation to training. One of the risks that had been identified was that there was not a nationally accredited training module for ceiling insulation. Everybody in this House knows that, from the outset, the delivery of this program relied upon the existing state regulatory framework, including occupational health and safety requirements, and a rollout of the program where the Australian standards were appropriately taken as the guide for the program. But the issues of risk that were identified included training. The fact is that, upon that advice being received, we set in train steps to deliver a nationally accredited training model. We took advice from departments, from training organisations and from the insulation industry as a whole and we put that training module into place. Subsequent to that, I have added to the level of training compliance and requirement that we saw was necessary in that instance. It is a matter of great regret to me that there are a proportion of installers-individuals and companieswho have been associated with this program over its time and who have not complied with the guidelines that I put in place, have not complied with the duty of care that they have for their employees and have not complied with the common-sense requirements that would come down upon anybody who had the opportunity to put insulation into somebody's ceiling. To the charge made by the Leader of the Opposition to me, I respond by saying that I have not been able to create a regulatory framework under this scheme that would sufficiently manage the risk-on the basis of the most recent advice I have had-with the very small number of those delivering this scheme who have not observed the regulatory compliance requirements. Upon the receipt of that advice and the identification of that risk, I took the step of ceasing the program and putting in place a transition to a program which not only will continue the sustainable delivery of ceiling insulation, both for the industry and for Australians under this program-and to take the considerable benefits that that brings-but additionally, in consultation with state authorities, will draw on the third-party independent assessment and consider carefully the requirements for the appropriate delivery to enable ceiling insulation still to be put into people's homes. On the basis of advice to me, I announced a series of measures consistent with the original risk management framework set up for this program by the department and the government. In doing that, I recognised that there may be a need for additional steps to be taken and I took them. In some instances in taking those steps, there were mixed views about whether they should be taken or not, but I made the decision to go the extra step. I made the decision to ban metal fasteners. As exemplified in one of the instances that we referred to earlier, the breaking of the law can lead to a potential accident or a potential fatality. I very much regret that that has happened, but that is the situation that we face. I put in place the requirements for a mandatory formal risk assessment by installers prior to the installation of ceiling insulation and I put in place a series of other measures: a ‘name and shame' register, a national register of installers and, of course, the compliance and auditing program that has been rolled out as a consequence of the advice that has come through to me. There are many Australians who recognise that there are responsibilities which attach to anybody coming into your home and to anybody doing work in your home. That responsibility lies in part with those who are doing the work-to observe the appropriate and proper regulations that are in place, to be informed of them and to follow them. That is an expectation that I think everybody listening to me respond to this censure motion in the House will recognise. It is also the responsibility of the government to ensure it has in place measures that will enable that to happen. That is what has happened all through the period of the Home Insulation Program and, consequent on my receipt of the most recent advice, on our then embarking on a program to transition into the future. In relation to the industry and the impact upon jobs, I make the following observations. The first is that there are hundreds of thousands of homes. I am not going to start making predictive assessments here, but given that the secretary of my department has provided material, statements, to the media and to the public on the existence of a percentage of risks and the existence of a percentage of homes that do not carry those risks-and that number of homes is very large-Australians can be reassured that, if they had a reputable insulation installer, if the installer followed the guidelines that were established under the program and if they signed the order form satisfying themselves that the job was done properly and that the installer had followed the guidelines properly, there are no additional safety risks as a consequence of this program. But in those instances where installers have not observed the guidelines and where additional risks have arisen the opportunity is there for householders to immediately contact the government. Any home where there is a suspicion of, or apprehension about, risk will be appropriately investigated and inspected as a consequence of this program. The Minister for Employment Participation, Senator Arbib, has made a number of statements about the assistance measures that have been identified for workers in the industry. I expect to meet with the industry Wednesday to discuss those issues in more detail. I also make the point that there are already Commonwealth programs in existence which enable householders to take, on reputation, any company that comes to them with a view to installing insulation safely. in fact the work is done safely, then at a sequent time the householder would be able to claim a rebate. My own very strong view, given the number of installers that would be subject to deregistration under the Home Insulation Program-those that would be suspended and those who complied with the regulations-is that there will be sufficient opportunity for the responsible and reliable parts of the industry to continue to do that work into the future. I am advised that evidence was put to the Senate committee hearing today that there are some 93 homes, so I place that correction on the record. To people listening to this debate, I advise that there are additional phone numbers that they can call in relation to this program other than those that I have already given. These include the electrical safety check line 131792 and the installer line 1800686. I conclude by making the following observations. At all times my goal has been to ensure that careful account was taken of the advice that I received. In taking careful account of that advice, I have listened to the views of the industry and of technical experts in determining the appropriate level of risk management for this program. We had the first nationally accredited training scheme and the first national register for installers. For the first time we instituted a requirement for installers to observe a set of standards higher than the Australian standards and the building code. At each step along the way, I added to that. In doing so, I acted on the basis of the advice that I received, which I believe and accept is the proper discharge of this my duty. I am continuing to do that for the decisions that I make. I take safety seriously and I take the effective delivery of programs seriously, and I am going to continue to do that job in my capacity as minister.",57
65,Mr HUNT,HERITAGE AND THE ARTS,"The If Minister for the Environment, Heritage and subthe Arts knew about the risks of fire and fatality under the Home Insulation Program, but he failed to act. This minister knew about the Minter Ellison report, but he failed even to open the front cover. This minister knew about the warning from the National Electrical Communications Association of 9 March which warned of systemic failures, but he failed to act. This minister knew about the warnings of the state and territory governments on 29 April, when they warned of fires and fatalities under his program, but he failed to act. This minister knew about the warning of Master Electricians Australia on 16 October last year, when they called for the foil insulation program to be suspended and warned of further fatalities, but he failed to act. Above all else, this minister, charged with the duty of bringing this program into being in a way that protected public safety, ignored not just his technical duties as minister, ignored not just the 20 warnings, ignored not just the advice from the opposition or the numerous calls through the media in August, September, October and November but also the basic duty of courage to stand up to the Prime Minister and say that he knew there were significant problems in delivering this program. He also ignored common sense. Common sense is what would have told anybody in this chamber given the task facing the minister that to proceed with this program irrespective of any paper changes was to put public safety at risk. I turn to common sense as a very simple proposition, and that is because we know that the minister was aware of the Minter Ellison report. We know that, on three occasions today, the minister refused to answer the simple question: was he briefed on any part of the Minter Ellison report over the last 10 months? On three occasions in this House he refused to answer the simple question: was he aware of, was he briefed on or did he read any part of the Minter Ellison report? That was his own department's risk assessment. That was prepared to bring this program into being in a way which was safe, and yet, although he was informed and he was aware, he ignored the 20 warnings. Most importantly, the very reason that the Australian public elect somebody to be a minister is to accept responsibility and exercise not just the word of the department but basic common sense, because if you create a program of this size you will attract, like a honey pot, the shonks, the spivs and the dangerous installers, and, in the words of the state and territory authorities of 29 April, there will be fires and fatalities. The warnings could not have been more clear; the warnings could not have been more absolute, and the consequences could not have been graver. In human terms, this is perhaps the most significant public policy failure of the last 20 years in Australia, and the reason why it is such a significant gross and systemic failure of ministerial responsibility is because of the human consequences. First we begin with four young Australians. I think it is important that this House records the names of those young Australians, who will not be with their families again: Matthew Fuller, 25; Rueben Barnes, 16; Marcus Wilson, 19; and Mitchell Sweeney, 22. This House, this government, this parliament has failed them. We put forward the warnings but, if we did not warn loudly enough-even though we did everything we could-we are sorry for that. It is a matter of profound regret that, no matter how loudly we made our warnings, they were not heeded by the other side. This is a moment where we all sit and say, ‘Let us not forget the very reason we are here: to create an environment in which Australians can proceed with their lives in safety and security and to give them the chance of a better opportunity for the future.' This House knows that what has occurred is an element of high human tragedy. But beyond those four human tragedies, of which there were warnings by the states and territories, of which there was a warning by Master Electricians Australiaof which there have been multiple warnings-we know that, beyond those tragedies, there have now been, as the minister has just admitted to this House, 93 house fires under his program. It is a matter of extraordinary disbelief that we had to inform the minister that an extra six house fires had been missed along the way. There have been, perhaps, 1,000 deadly electrified roofs created under this program. There have been 6,000-plus jobs which are likely to have been lost, not created, as a result of this program. We now know that there are 80,000 houses with potentially dangerous insulation installations. We know that there are potentially 160,000 houses-in the words of the minister's own departmental officials-with potentially substandard insulation, which is effectively worthless and meaningless and could be of more consequence than that. So almost a quarter of a million Australian households now have insulation which is either unsafe or improperly installed and of no value. This is a massive public policy failure on a gross and systemic basis with real human consequences. It is these human consequences that bring us to this moment. They cannot be ignored. They cannot be wished away. They cannot be washed away. They are real and profound, and it will take years to undo the damage that has been wrought through improper administration, gross and systemic failure and an inability to heed the warnings. We know that the minister was aware of the warnings, and that is what is profoundly important. I feel some sympathy for the minister. He is not a person of bad character. He is a person with a long history of contributing to Australia. But his ministerial career is over. We all know this. He knows this. It is a derogation of duty on a grand scale which it is almost impossible to reconcile with the last 20 years of Australian history and to match. This is not some trivial matter of administration. This is not maladministration on a minor scale. This reaches into a quarter of a million Australian homes. It reaches into 6,000 jobs. It reaches into a thousand potentially deadly electrified roofs. It reaches 93 house fires. How can you create a policy which causes 93 house fires and not recognise from the outset that this is a bungle on a scale which is unlikely ever to be repeated over the next 100 years in Australia? Above all else, it has reached into four families. I believe the Leader of the Opposition made the point in a very sensitive and reasonable manner: the minister did not commission or take the action which caused those tragic losses but he failed to take the steps which could have prevented those losses. All members of this House know that. The only reason that the minister is here now-the only reason that the minister has not embraced the principles of Westminster democracy-is that the Prime Minister will not let this minister take the fall and the Prime Minister will not let this minister do the right thing. The reason why is that it is a gross and systemic failure of cabinet responsibility as well as of individual ministerial responsibility. There can be very fewer higher breaches of a minister's duty. There were not just one or two but 20 official warnings, including from the Master Electricians of Australia, the ACTU, the CFMEU and the ETU. These are profound warnings from within the minister's own camp. There were warnings from the National Electrical and Communications Association. There were also warnings from the state and territory governments on 29 April last year. Then there was the Minter Ellison risk assessment. What we have seen today is not just a failure of ministerial administration and responsibility but low-grade evasion, by which that failure has been compounded. The low-grade evasion is that the minister was clearly briefed on the contents of that report. He had weekly briefings from the secretary of his department. By her own words today, he had many reports along the way. Three times he was asked whether or into not he had received any part of that report. Each time he retreated to a technical defence about never having received the totality. Everybody in this chamber knows that is code for saying: ‘I was aware of it but I didn't bother to open the cover. I was briefed on it but I didn't bother to open the cover. I was aware that there were risks which were unacceptable but I chose for reasons of political cowardice to plough ahead, irrespective of the human consequences.' There is a duty which was fundamental, and that duty was to take steps to protect and prepare Australians for this program. That duty was to stand up to the Prime Minister when it most counted and to say: ‘Prime Minister, I am sorry. I understand the political desire and the political haste to rush this money out the door but in good conscience I cannot allow this to happen, because there are risks of which we have been warned.' That is the sacred trust you undertake when you step before the dispatch box in this House as a minister of the Crown. If the Westminster system means anything in the Australian parliament today, if the Westminster system means anything under the Rudd government, there must be accountability and the buck must stop with the minister for the environment. This is of profound importance. It is of profound importance to the families of the four young men who have paid very dearly for this program. It is of profound importance to the 93 homeowners who have had ceiling and deeper house fires as a consequence of this program. It is of profound importance to the thousand Australians who live now under potentially deadly electric roofs. It is of profound importance to the 48,000 Australians who have foil insulation and do not know whether theirs is one of those thousand roofs. At current rates of inspection it will take 12 years to find and fix every one of those roofs. It took three months to inspect 1,000 foil roofs under the minister's program. It would take one year to inspect 4,000 houses under the current rate of the program. It would take 12 years to find and fix, through the 48,000 houses, all of the 1,000 potentially deadly roofs. Even as we speak, whilst the program has been dispatched the solution has not been achieved. One thousand deadly electric roofs are potentially out there. One thousand homeowners are at risk. At some stage, whether it is two or three years from now, some of these people will sell their homes, and somebody else will crawl into the roof to check for a possum or to check the wiring and will not be aware of this risk. This is not naive. This is totally foreseeable. It is foreseen and forewarned about, and there must be a plan. It is extraordinary that there is no plan to find and fix the thousand deadly roofs immediately. This motion is of profound importance to the 240,000 Australian homeowners whose homes have been equipped with either unsafe or substandard insulation. There has arguably not been a greater public policy failure in terms of its real-world human consequences over the last 20 years, and right along the way it was foreseen and forewarned. Everybody knew that this was happening. Everybody with common sense in Australia knew about the dodgy installations. The minister himself on 26 August last year said it was ‘bleeding obvious' that there needed to be an inquiry, yet that inquiry never happened. Those were the statements. We have it recorded. That is the moment. This minister must go under the principles of Westminster democracy. He stands censured. (Time expired)",60
66,Mr ALBANESE,HERITAGE AND THE ARTS,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (3.44 pm)-I rise on the 35th time that those opposite have attempted to move a censure motion, suspend standing orders or move a dissent motion in this term of parliament. We have had almost 30 hours of debates on censures and suspensions. Why? It is because those opposite do not actually have an alternative view about running this nation to put forward. The Leader of the Opposition said on Sky News on 8 December: … it is a two stage process. But the first stage making the Government look bad. He went on. Once he became leader he said on 11 January: I mean, if in doubt our job is to oppose. Mr Hockey interjecting",63

We saw it again today during the debate where the Leader of the National Party interjected across the chamber while the environment shadow was speaking that one million homes would be burnt down-all of them will be burnt down. That says it all. What we have here is a Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts who has acted responsibly. He put in place risk management at each step of the way. There were extra measures every time an issue was raised and they were raised most of the time because this minister had initiated the inquiries and made the appropriate changes along the way.

They were not interested. Most of the 20 warnings that they talk about were the minister's initiatives. This minister ensured that he moved forward at each step. This is a classic example of the Abbott habit: talk first, think later. The Leader of the Opposition always goes that one step too far. He is always overreaching. You make allegations and then you look for proof later. You make policy announcements then you come up with costings later. is You make extreme statements and then you roll out excuses for them later. Mr Robert interjecting",64

He went that one step too far as he always does. There is some irony I have to say in the party of Work Choices speaking about the safety of workers. Here we have the Leader of the Opposition who wants to reintroduce Work Choices but he is going to give it a different name. I say to him, good luck to you. If you can get away with still calling it the Liberal Party, maybe you can get away with anything because the fact is that this opposition leader goes too far no matter what the issue is. He does have the Abbott habit. Just last week we saw it again. He accused the government of bribing the networks for good coverage-he said we have Channel 7, Channel 9 and Channel 10 in our pocket; Laurie Oakes, Mark Riley and Paul Bongiorno are all in our pocket.  on a point of order.

The government's economic stimulus plan has resulted in an unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent. Had we not taken that action there would be more than 200,000 Australians more out of work. This is about whether we continue with a government that is interested in policy and moving forward or whether we move to a reckless opposition led by an opposition leader who at every point goes one step too far.

78,Mr ALBANESE,HERITAGE AND THE ARTS,"The Leader of the Opposition went further again on homelessness. On 16 February in the Sydney Morning Herald he said we just: … cannot stop people from being homeless if that's their choice. That is his attitude, the great man of compassion, to homelessness. He is also a great defender of workplace safety. There has been a workplace safety issue in this country over many decades, and that is the issue of asbestosis. People such as the member for Charlton and the trade union movement have ironically been quoted in here, for a change, by those opposite. The trade union movement led the charge to make sure there was justice for those victims. What we had from those opposite on that issue was extraordinary hypocrisy. On a 30 October 2007, the late Bernie Banton had an appointment with the then Minister for Health and Ageing, the member for Warringah, in his office. That appointment was to submit a petition of more than 17,000 Australians to the then minister, a petition pleading for Commonwealth government support for action-something that this government has now put in place, it must be said. The then minister failed to turn up for the meeting-maybe there was something else onbut he could not resist going that step further. He blamed and condemned Bernie Banton, saying: … it was a stunt … I know Bernie is very sick but just because a person is sick doesn't necessarily mean that he is pure of heart in all things. He was questioning this late, great Australian about his motives for wanting to protect his fellow Australians in his dying days. The member has form for crassness and crudeness. It is not just people in the Labor Party, the labour movement or the union movement who have suffered at the hands of the Leader of the Opposition. From what we saw in the battle in New South Wales between the hard Right and the extreme Right where the extreme Right won the preselection and knocked over the member for Mitchell's candidate, we know that Tony has a long history of intervention in these disputes. On 31 August 2005, the day after the former New South Wales Liberal leader John Brogden attempted suicide, he went along to a meeting of health industry executives and said: If we did that, we would be as dead as the former Liberal leader's political prospects. That is an indication of how this Leader of the Opposition treats his friends-treats members of his own political party. We have seen it before. We saw it during the last election campaign, and that is why this Leader of the Opposition, three leaders ago when he stood for the leadership after the 2007 election, could only get six votes in the ballot. It was front and centre of how this Leader of the Opposition performs during election campaigns. Remember him coming along to the National Press Club half an hour latewhich was bad enough-and then choosing to abuse the now Minister for Health and Ageing because he could not defend his health policy: the billion-dollar cuts to health and freezing GP places. He said to her: That's bullshit. You're being deliberately unpleasant. I suppose you can't help yourself, can you? We saw it as well in his comments about the Deputy Prime Minister and others. The fact is that this Leader of the Opposition does always go a step too far. His extremism and the opportunism that we are seeing during this debate are typical of the way that he acts. The Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that the environment minister is personally responsible for the deaths. As Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, I have some responsibility for the national road network, but it is not my fault or my personal responsibility if there is an accident on a road. We have a responsibility to act upon advice. We have a responsibility to do what we can to improve safety in whatever area we are in. That is why I have set up the National Road Safety Council. It is like suggesting that the current Leader of the Opposition is responsible for what occurred in the hospitals while he was health minister, if there was a mistake-and mistakes occur in hospitals funded by the Commonwealth government. It is like saying he was personally responsible for everything that happened in the industrial relations system. The opposition cannot resist. So desperate are they, according to their own words, that they are not prepared to put forward a positive agenda. Essentially, we have a Leader of the Opposition who, in his own words, says he is not interested in economics, he is not interested in fundamental debates that go to the heart of how we move forward and, of course, he is not interested in home insulation and other measures that are about dealing with climate change because this Leader of the Opposition has said that climate change is ‘crap'. That is his position. Once again, he went that yard too far, as he always does. I conclude with this. Yesterday he had this to say in the Examiner in Launceston: The only one of the Ten Commandments that I am confident that I have not broken is the one about killing, and that's because I haven't had the opportunity yet. Once again, always that step too far. The problem is that, come the federal election campaign, we know and they know in the back that he will go that step too far yet again, as he always does.

87,Ms VAMVAKINOU,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today in support of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009. I want to welcome the efforts of the Attorney General, the Hon. Robert MCClelland, for introducing this very important piece of legislation that goes very much to the heart of our national judicial framework. This bill introduces a specific Commonwealth torture offence into the Commonwealth Criminal Code, which operates concurrently with the existing offences in state and territorial criminal laws. The bill also amends the Commonwealth Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 to extend the current prohibition on the death penalty to state criminal laws, thus ensuring that the death penalty cannot be introduced anywhere in Australia in the future. My strong opposition to the detention and torture of Australian citizens abroad, as well as to the killing of Australians in foreign jails, is unequivocal and, in fact, very much on the record here in this place. This bill serves to ensure that Australia will never accommodate those involved in the judicial killings and torture of individuals both on our shores and abroad. This bill is a reflection of Australia's strong opposition to any form of torture, as well as the death penalty, wherever it may occur. It sends a strong message to those who engage in such activities, who may one day imagine that they can find sanction in a modern Australia. By enacting torture as a specific Commonwealth offence in the Commonwealth Criminal Code, the bill reflects this government's commitment to end impunity for torture and fulfils Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. By amending the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973, this legislation also highlights Australia's commitment to its obligations under the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In speaking to the part of the bill which goes to the introduction of a specific Commonwealth torture offence into the Commonwealth Criminal Code, I want to make the following observations. The basic definition of torture is that contained in the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Torture can never be an acceptable means of extracting information or compelling people to yield to someone else's will or to squash dissent. know, an act of sheer cruelty, primarily designed to degrade human beings by inflicting extreme physical pain and humiliation. Victims of torture, if they survive-many do and many, unfortunately, do not-are often left with lifelong physical and psychological scars. Many will suffer post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression and will almost always have difficulty readjusting to normal life. However, it is not only the individual who is the victim of torture who suffers; it is also their families and friends and, indeed, the community as a whole. In my own electorate I often come across people who have come to Australia via our Refugee and Humanitarian Immigration Program who, more often than not, are actually victims of torture back in the countries they have left, and who have come and settled in Australia. I have had the opportunity to see the kind of trauma that remains with people who have been victims of torture. This is trauma that I think remains with them for the rest of their lives. So the impact for those who survive and their families is unspeakable. Torture as a tool continues, however, to be practised today in all too many parts of the world-and, whether practised in the name of political dogma or religious dogma, it is and always has been the tool of despots. No society, individuals or communities should tolerate torture in any form or for any reason. Australians do not support torture, and this bill is a reaffirmation of this. We should be under no illusion that torture continues to be used to this day and even, as English historian Mark Curtis says, ‘in circumstances where the perpetrators were hailed as the upholders of civilisation'. The most recent and most infamous images of the use of torture at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq demonstrates that the nature and outcomes of torIt is, as we all ture have not changed. SBS's Dateline program revealed to the world the horrors at Abu Ghraib prison. Images, some too shocking to reveal, reduced the humanity of both its victims and its perpetrators. We were all, I am sure, appalled and shocked, more so because the torture that had been inflicted on people in Abu Ghraib was actually inflicted by those who were hailed as the upholders of civilisation. In this case, they were the forces of democracy and freedom, forces who upheld the value of the rule of law and the dignity of human rights, forces whose purpose in Iraq on this occasion was to actually free the Iraqi people. But it was not just the practices in Abu Ghraib that shocked the world. Here was a situation where the world's super power and its alliance powers resorted to sidestepping the rule of law and principles of democratic justice and employed torture techniques that matched the cruelty and degradation of the cruellest, undemocratic regimes. As such, I want to put on record that I regret the US administration's delay in closing the infamous Guantanamo Bay military prison in which, I remind the House, two Australian citizens were detained. The images and stories coming out of these prisons have single-handedly done more damage to the principles of freedom, human rights and democracy than many of the stories that have come out of the so called ‘war on terror'-all the more so when they are practised under the banner of freedom. To put it simply: torture and death is the antithesis of both democracy and human rights. In 2007 I moved a motion, seconded by the member for Melbourne, the now Minister for Finance and Deregulation, the Hon. Lindsay Tanner, that called for acknowledgement that the ongoing torture and incarceration of David Hicks was a breach of both the Geneva conventions and the Australian Criminal Code. Now, as then, the ongoing imprisonment and torture of individuals in the most horrific of circumstances, coupled with the denial of any of the most basic human rights, runs counter to the principles of freedom and democracy. That is why I am so pleased to be supporting a bill that makes it an offence to commit torture. I would also like to welcome the bill's amendment of the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 to cover state laws. This will uphold and safeguard our nation's ongoing compliance with the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. Extending the application of the current prohibition on the death penalty to state laws-in addition to Commonwealth, territory and imperial criminal laws to which the Death Penalty Abolition Act already applies-ensures that the death penalty cannot be reintroduced anywhere in Australia in the future. Australia has a long standing policy of opposition to the death penalty. This bill is a comprehensive rejection of capital punishment and demonstrates Australia's commitment to the worldwide abolitionist movement. It complements Australia's international lobbying efforts against the death penalty. It is important to me, as it is to an overwhelming majority of Australians, that this parliament and, indeed, our nation as a whole be active in advocating for the abolition of the death penalty at a global level. I want to take this opportunity to encourage and urge other nations and other parliaments to act in the same way as this parliament is acting here today. There are still some 70 states worldwide that apply the death penalty, making the work of the worldwide abolitionist movement that Australia is a party to all the more imperative. It is important that Australia stands with the European Union and other states with the firm resolve that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights. To this end, I want to welcome the Russian Constitutional Court's decision late last year to effectively outlaw the death penalty, and I want to take this opportunity to call on its State Duma to go that one step further and ratify the protocol banning capital punishment. I would also like to call on China and the United States, as the world's leading powers but also as prolific users of the death penalty, to follow suit and join us in the worldwide movement for the abolition of the death penalty. It should be our collective aim to end the use of the death penalty as a punitive practice, wherever it may occur. As a member party of the Socialist International, which holds the view of the total abolition of the death penalty, Labor is committed to the pursuit of justice both at a social and a judicial level. The federal government's unwavering opposition to the death penalty is a reflection of our humanitarian approach to issues of justice. The death penalty serves no purpose other than to compromise our humanity and violate the sanctity and dignity of human life. In 2005, I spoke during a grievance debate on the execution of Australian Van Nguyen, who we will all remember was hanged by the government of Singapore after being found guilty of drug trafficking. I stated then that the government-sponsored execution of a human being is a crime against humanity and a breach of the UN convention. Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states: 1. Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life. The death penalty is an archaic and barbaric practice that runs counter to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognises each person's right to life and categorically states: No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In that same grievance debate, I stated: It is easy for people to be unforgiving and to loathe those who they believe by their actions perpetuate the misery of drug abuse. But we must never allow such feelings to cause us to lose sight of our humanity. I cannot therefore agree with those who support capital punishment. Putting aside all the moral and legal arguments that militate against the use of capital punishment, for me personally it is a simple case of a profound belief that no human being has the right to take the life of another under any circumstances. I said that in 2005 in this House and I say it again because I want to reaffirm my absolute belief in that statement. The right to life is a basic, inherent and instinctive feature of what it means to be human, and we must never lose sight of our humanity. This bill is important on a number of fronts. However, its underlying importance is that it judges life and just treatment as issues which are beyond political expediency. Deputy Speaker Scott, I would like to bring to your attention Amnesty International's description of the death penalty. It states that the death penalty is: … discriminatory and often used disproportionately against the poor, minorities and members of racial, ethnic and religious communities. This is strikingly clear in the United States. As the Texas Department of Criminal Justice reveals, 70 per cent of the last 100 executions were either black or Hispanic. This is an extraordinary reflection of the way in which death as an instrument of the state is No one handed out, often disproportionately. As I said at the time of Van Nguyen's execution, people-to-people campaigns calling for the end of the death penalty are not enough-they are necessary but they are not enough. This is why I am pleased that the bill before us today sets in concrete Australia's commitment to its international and humanitarian obligations, and this legislation will now ensure that Australia is never party to violations of these fundamental principles. As I bring to a close my thoughts on this bill, I want to make some statements in relation to an issue currently in the media. I hope and urge that members on both sides of the House reflect on the pending execution of the three Australians convicted of drug trafficking in Indonesia. This amendment bill is a timely reminder of our need to strengthen our commitment to the abolition of the death penalty and ensure that the abolition of the death penalty occurs on a global scale and in accordance with international covenants already in place. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the crime for which the three Australians have been convicted, and in full respect of the laws that govern Indonesia, we must do all we can as parliamentarians to appeal for clemency with regard to the death sentences handed out to them. In light of the seriousness of the crimes for which they have been convicted, along with the legislation we rise to speak on, I want to finish by reflecting on the words of former South Australian magistrate Brian Deegan. The House will remember that Brian's son, Joshua, was an Australian Rules football player who was one of the 202 people killed by terrorists in the October 2002 Bali bombings. In a letter to Indonesian authorities, Brian described himself as: … the father of Joshua Kevin Deegan, a beautiful young man, my eldest child, who was a victim of the atrocity. Brian was able to move beyond the emotion and the trauma of that terrible act and reflect on what justice means in a modern Australia. That is why I want to conclude with his words, which sum up all that has been said and what I and many Australians also believe. Brian said: The Bali bombers who murdered my son last October are evil extremists … but the prospect of their judicial murder is something I want no part of … As a measure employed to dissuade potential criminals, the death penalty has been an abject failure. This is borne out by statistics that point to the commensurate rise of murders and executions in countries where capital punishment is awarded. The argument in favour of executions remains difficult to reconcile with the universal revulsion generated by periods in history when society thought nothing of hanging a child or burning a witch. We read with disgust? or perhaps with guilt? of the stoning of adulterers, the removal of a thief's hand or the decapitation of a blasphemer. Yet we find it palatable to break a man's neck, to poison his veins or to electrocute him. The bill before us demonstrates that Australia will never again deem the death penalty, or torture for that matter, palatable, wherever it takes place. I commend the bill to the House.",69
88,Dr KELLY,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (4.27 pm)-I rise to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009. I have had much to do with issues of torture and capital punishment over the last 20 years, so I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this legislation. It amends the Criminal Code Act 1995. The new offence that is intended to fulfil more clearly and explicitly Australia's obligations under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment will be brought into effect as a single federal offence under this legislation. That convention was signed by Australia in December 1985 and ratified in August 1989. The old act criminalised acts of torture committed outside Australia only when committed by Australian citizens or other persons subsequently present in Australia. Other aspects of torture were left to be dealt with by the laws of armed conflict. Recently, the UN committee against torture called on nations to enact a specific torture offence. In the concluding observations on Australia in May 2008, the UN committee recommended that Australia enact a specific offence at the federal level, which we do with this legislation. One of the interesting things to note about this legislation is that it ensures the definition of ‘public official' or ‘person acting in an official capacity' encompasses certain nonstate actors who are exercising authority comparable to a government authority. That is a common scenario our Australian Defence Force and police personnel face in many environments when deployed in this current unstable world. That could include people belonging to political organisations or de facto authorities in a particular region or country. I will come back to that contemporary environment later in my comments. This legislation also relates to extending the application of the current prohibition on the death penalty to state laws to ensure that it cannot be introduced or reintroduced anywhere in Australia, thus safeguarding our commitment to the second optional protocol. Interestingly, during the current turbulent times and the challenges that have been placed upon us in our adherence to human rights standards, there was a lot of debate after 9-11 about the issue of torture and the defence of necessity. My advice is that under the legal regime created in Australia, the defence of necessity will be abolished. The story used to go that, if you had a situation of the so-called ticking bomb, any measures would be justified in extracting information that would prevent a disastrous consequence. It is clear that in Australia that is not the case. Our legislation and our approach to the law give effect to the words of the convention: No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat or war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture. In a speech by my good friend the Attorney General to the Lowy Institute last year he confirmed that: Nothing justifies torture-and nothing justifies a State's use of it. In the provisions, the definition of torture refers to: … any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining … information or a confession, punishing him … In effect, this explains the circumstances in which our own personnel have confronted this issue in recent times, as have many Western nations. The nature of our operating environment has become so fluid and so difficult and challenging that we are often in circumstances where there exist no law enforcement structures and no mechanisms by which persons who are committing offences or doing things that require treatment by the law can be handed over to a responsible authority. This leaves open the question of taking the law into your own hands at times. After 9-11, confronting the challenge of Islamist extremism has given rise to what I would call the gloves-off syndrome. In other words, because of the heinous and dastardly nature of the threat elements that we face, any measures would be justified in dealing with these persons. I will deal with those in order by firstly referring to my experience in Somalia back in 1993. In that environment, as I mentioned, we were in that vacuum situation, as were many contingents. The experience of quite a few contingents was that the troops were faced with lawlessness and took matters into their own hands. Probably the most notorious of those incidents related to a young Somali teenager by the name of Shidane Arone. What had been taking place in the camp under the direction of the commanding officer of the Canadian airborne regiment was instruction that they were to ‘rough up' persons intruding on the base. This led down a slippery slope to where, eventually, people were receiving severe beatings. In the case of Shidane Arone, he was beaten to death in particularly grisly circumstances. It became even more notorious, because there were photographs taken of the incident. The repercussions of this were enormous in that this led to great scandals within the Canadian defence establishment. At times there were attempts to cover up aspects of the issue, which led to even worse scenarios for the personnel involved all up and down the chain of command in the Canadian defence force. It became a cathartic and very difficult experience for the entire Canadian public. This brought home to me some very important lessons for the way our own forces deal with these situations and how we manage the circumstances that I have described. It was interesting when one of the lawyers representing one of the Canadian troops in that situation-there were a number of courts-martial of the personnel involvedstated that: It is my submission, gentlemen, that there is ample evidence before this court that there was a general understanding amongst the troops that it was OK to rough up the prisoners a little bit for a deterrent purpose … And I say that for this reason, that the troops were in a lawless country. There was no civil institutions, there was no authority. There was nothing that could be done to those looters who were captured. They could not be turned over to anybody who could effectively deal with them such as happens in most civilised countries. They could not call the police and have them arrested and expect that he would be taken to court and dealt with according to the law. At the same time the soldiers were very vulnerable. They're out in the field. They had no locks. They had valuable kit and they are obviously particularly concerned about the security of their weapons. That was no justification, obviously, for what occurred to the Somalis who suffered at the hands of those troops. But I was actually in Somalia at the time, deployed with the 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, and we identified that those were the circumstances we were in and that we would not be doing the right thing by the community or our troops if we did not put in place measures to deal with the situation. What we did at that time was re-establish the Somali court system and get the Somali police up and running again. We put a lot of effort into this. We formed a multidisciplinary team within the contingent itself, involving military intelligence, military police, myself and some infantrymen, and we were able to identify persons who had committed crimes against humanity, those persons in the society who were committing criminal acts and facilitate them being processed in the re-established and resurrected Somali courts in the region. This certainly took the steam out of any disgruntlement or frustration that the troops might have been feeling. They understood that there was a process that could be resorted to and, therefore, there were no instances in the Australian battalion's time in Somalia of resorting to these sorts of techniques. We took that lesson to a number of our operational circumstances subsequent to that. We deployed to Timor in 1999 to deal with civil the situation there of the breakdown of authority and the departure of the Indonesian authorities. Taking the lessons that I learnt in Somalia, I established a detainee management unit for the circumstances there. We were ready to go with that. We were certainly forewarned from our previous experience and we were able to take the steam out of that situation as well, so that once again were no incidents of Australian troops abusing Timorese detainees in that operation. Unfortunately, we were required to go back to Timor in 2006 and similar circumstances applied, although it was a bit more complicated, because there were some UN mechanisms in place which we needed to mesh with, and we put an elaborate process in place to deal with that. So there is a great deal of Australian experience in dealing with those environments. We then came to the circumstances in Iraq in 2003, and this was a situation of great frustration to me personally. To understand the need to provide for detainees and that we should not resort to torture and then to observe what took place in Iraq was deeply disturbing. Initially, of course, the detainee problems emerged as they quite often do, just by lack of planning and preparation. The facilities that were put in place for holding detainees were very ad hoc and they became humanitarian nightmares. Effectively they were dusty dirt rooms that were pushed together because the prison system in Iraq had been trashed. There was no capacity to place people in suitable circumstances. There had been no planning to take care of this situation. Often the fact that the operational niques and tactics of the troops at the time were not in tune with the principles of counterinsurgency led to situations where, for example, if there were a grid square where it was suspected that there were insurgents, the US army formations would go out and arrest the grid square. There would be 1,000 or more people apprehended at a time in one of these operations. They would be put into these detention camps and they would effectively become black holes. It was impossible to properly record their names, there were insufficient military intelligence people to process them, and of course there was no ability for the families to track them. So the there circumstances were inhumane, the troops were not equipped with non-lethal equipment to deal with people in those circumstances, there was often rioting where the first resort was to firearms, and of course in some cases there was a resort to abuse in the context of the punishment aspect of what is referred to in the legislation. During the whole of 2003 I was sending back a lot of reports through the authorities about this situation, as I was on the ground there from May 2003 until July 2004. None of my warnings about this situation were heeded, and I became deeply concerned in September of 2003 when the authorities decided that the problem we were having was winning actionable intelligence-not the fact that we were going down the wrong road in dealing with the counterinsurgency. So the Guantanamo team was sent to Iraq to ‘Gitmo-ise' the intelligence operations. General Miller was sent over to put that into effect. We were also advised at that time that the US was going to resort to civilian contractors doing interrogation. In my report in September 2003, I indicated that I was disturbed by this development, but those concerns fell on deaf ears. As has been referred to in many other tech- comments, the Abu Ghraib circumstance became a matter of great shame and loss of moral authority in our operations in Iraq and caused a great setback to our overall confrontation with Islamist extremism in the world. It was of course a matter of great distress that these things could happen, but they stemmed from a whole culture and process that was developing at the time. In fact, what the military police at Abu Ghraib were doing was what is called ‘preconditioning for interrogation'. They were being enlisted into the effort for winning intelligence-softening up, in effect, these detainees for further interrogation by the intelligence assets that were in the theatre at the time who were effectively given encouragement to take the gloves off. This of course led to the deaths of detainees and the mistreatment, and in effect it helped to feed the insurgency itself, because those people who were involved in those detainment situations went out to become recruits for the insurgency, to spread the word about what was happening and the images certainly promoted recruitment and actions against coalition troops that subsequently happened. This was a distressing situation. There were misinterpretations of the law involved. Article 5 to the Geneva convention was misinterpreted so that excuses were made for the removal of certain safeguards protecting the rights of detainees, and it was a shameful period for all those involved in providing legal advice to authorities. Perhaps the most shameful aspect of that was the infamous memos provided by Messrs Bybee and Yoo. These were civilian lawyers who were providing advice from the justice department to the former US administration. They were obviously attempting to craft their advice to suit the desires of their clients. This was highlighted just recently, in the last couple of days, in a report by the justice department. It really broke down when Bybee and Yoo, in their memo, concluded that physical torture only occurred when the pain was equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure, impairment of bodily functions or even death. Mental torture required suffering not just at the moment of infliction but lasting psychological harm such as seen in mental disorder like post-traumatic stress disorder. The memo concluded that torture of suspected terrorists for interrogation would not be unlawful if it could be justified on grounds of necessity or self-defence. This ignored the dictates set out in the US military manualsFM 34-52 in particular-and international law. Many of my colleagues-military JAGs, or judge advocates general, as they are called in the US military-had tried to hold the line against this denigration, deterioration and erosion of the standards of the US military. The advice and the regimes that were put in place effectively were doing end runs around the military approach to this-to the everlasting shame of those who were providing this advice. While the report by Associate Deputy Attorney-General David Margolis into this matter, which has just been released, did not recommend further disciplinary action, it did state that these two persons had exercised poor judgment-in what must be one of the great understatements of the century. The report stated that Yoo committed ‘intentional professional misconduct when he violated his duty to exercise independent legal judgement and render thorough, objective and candid legal advice.' Bybee was said to have ‘acted in reckless disregard of ethical obligations' by agreeing to sign those memos. One of the quotes was: I fear that John Yoo's loyalty to his own ideology and convictions clouded his view of his obligation to his client and led him to author opinions that reflected his own extreme, albeit sincerely held, view of executive power … This is a cautionary tale for all of those who are in the position of and have responsibility for providing accurate legal advice and guidance to government. Obviously, in recent times we have had some interesting experiences, with the so-called Utegate affair, as to how public servants can sometimes be enlisted in undesirable activities, but we must draw the line, particularly when it comes to these fundamental human rights. Certainly, the US Supreme Court managed to turn things around in its rulings in Hamdan v Rumsfeld in 2006, where it overturned the advice of people like Yoo that common article 3 of the Geneva convention did not apply in circumstances such as those in Afghanistan and stated that they did. So there was something of a fight back. I was also involved in a lot of training doctrinal developments in this space through my role in training those involved in field intelligence. A feature of the Australian story is that we have had in place doctrine and training to address this issue. I note that in 2008 the CDF underwent some questioning on this in estimates, because the issue of the so-called ‘dog pens' in Afghanistan came up. He referred to the fact that that was a mistaken reference to how people were actually being treated and that we constantly review our techniques and training in this area. I am happy to say that I believe that is the case, having been involved in a great deal of it myself. I refer to the words of General Richard Myers, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said that not engaging in torture is not ‘a matter of whether it is rocated-it's a matter of who we are'. I think that is an essential point for our Australian Defence Force and police personnel. It is reassuring to know that many of my colleagues in the US military felt that way about it, notwithstanding attempts by the civilian administrators to erode that position. In relation to the death penalty, I suppose it is a subject. I am somewhat compromised on, because in my own career I have probably been the cause of a number of people having the death penalty inflicted on them. The first time was in Somalia in 1993 when I had to play a significant role in the execution of war lord Gutaale because that was the aspect of Somali law that applied and there was no way of dealing with it in any other fashion. In Iraq I was involved in the creation of the court and the process that saw the ‘dirty dozen' and Saddam Hussein subsequently executed. Notwithstanding that experience and the fact that I have actually witnessed an execution, I am totally opposed to the death penalty and I would hope that we could promote that position worldwide. In the final analysis, after seeing the and depths to which humans are capable of descending and understanding that progress is not inevitable, I am firmly of the view that we as a nation need to contribute in whatever way we can to maintaining fundamental human rights standards. This legislation and the principles to which our public officials must be trained and committed is part of that effort.",73
89,Mr DREYFUS,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The first execution after Europeans arrived in our continent occurred within a month of their arrival, on 27 February 1788. Thomas Barrett was sentenced to death and hanged. He was 17 years old. His crime: the theft of some butter, dried peas and salt pork from the meagre stores the First Fleet had brought with it. Execution for offences like this was recipcommon at the time. Many of the convicts who came to Australia with the unfortunate Thomas Barrett on the First Fleet had initially been convicted and sentenced to be hanged but had had their sentences commuted to transportation to the colonies. Others had faced the death penalty for the petty crimes that they were convicted of but had had a sentence of transportation imposed on them. One hundred and seventy-nine years later, in February 1967, Ronald Ryan was hanged at Pentridge Prison in Melbourne. He had been sentenced to death for the murder of a prison guard during a prison break-out. Between these two hangings, it is estimated that between 1,700 and 2,000 people were judicially executed in Australia, but there has been no-one put to death since 1967 and since then each state and territory has abolished the death penalty. Queensland was the first state, in 1922, to abolish capital punishment for all offences. New South Wales abolished the death penalty for murder in 1955 but somewhat curiously forgot about the death penalty being there for some other offences, like treason, until 1985. WA was officially the last state to abolish the death penalty, which it did in 1985. The Whitlam government abolished capital punishment for all federal offences in 1973. In my home state of Victoria, although Ronald Ryan was hanged under a Liberal Premier, Henry Bolte, his Liberal Party successor as Premier, Rupert Hamer, introduced legislation to abolish the death penalty in 1975. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009 now before the House will ensure that the death penalty cannot be reintroduced anywhere in Australia. It demonstrates the commitment of our nation to abolition of the death penalty across the world and will add strength to the lobbying efforts of our government for abolition across the world. The hanging of Ronald Ryan in February 1967 had a profound effect on me, as it did on many other people, young and old, across Australia. I was 10 years old to be interested in politics and government. I recall that there were protests across Melbourne-indeed, across Australia, but most notably in Melbourne. The media had avidly covered the trial of Ronald Ryan, as indeed it had covered his escape from Pentridge and the shooting of the prison guard that led to him being charged with felony murder. There were massive protests following the sentencing of Ronald Ryan. Barry Joneswho was already a public identity, later a member of the Victorian parliament and, later still, the member for Lalor in this House-was one of the leaders of the fight to have Ryan's sentence commuted. This had occurred in very many cases over preceding decades. There was no doubt that the state cabinet could have commuted the sentence to life imprisonment, but the Liberal government led by Henry Bolte refused to do so. That is what brought home to me just what a political and governmental issue this is. The state government was recognised by the whole community as having the right, a right that it had exercised on many occasions, to commute sentences of death to life imprisonment. It was widely thought at the time that the refusal to commute the sentence was driven by an impending state election. Certainly there was a wave of protest across Melbourne. Thousands gathered at a vigil outside Pentridge and at Flinders Street Station at the hour of execution. Across Australia, people felt revulsion at this judicial killing and redoubled their efforts for abolition of capital punishment across our country. When the abolition legislation was finally debated in the Victorian parliament in 1975, Barry Jones gave a memorable speech, which explained his vote for abolition in these terms: Essentially, I cast it against darkness, against obscurantism, against instinct, against pessimism about society and about man's capacity for moral and just starting regeneration. Barry Jones continued in moving terms: It is extraordinary that often people who argue for retention have a fundamental pessimism about man's capacity for regeneration. They say certain persons ought not to have the opportunity for regeneration. However, they have no humility about their own judgment. They are convinced that their own judgment is right. As they participate in it, they have not a scintilla of doubt that their judgment is absolutely correct. I find their confidence in their own judgment and their pessimism about society is an extraordinary paradox. There are many arguments against the death penalty. We have heard many of them in speeches by other members in this debate. They are multiple arguments and they are overlapping arguments against abolition, but, for me, for our society to kill one of its members is an act which diminishes us all. We should believe in life and not in death and it is a matter that can be reduced to terms seemingly as simple as that. It does not aid the victims to judicially kill. As Barry Jones said in that same speech, it adds no roses to the grave of the victim that the murderer is killed by society. There is the much established proposition that to kill with judicial authority will necesthis sarily mean the killing of innocent men and women, at least on occasion. Our consciences rightly recoil from the idea that society has put to death an innocent man or woman. Because the United States is still, in very many states, imposing and carrying out the death penalty, it has, regrettably, provided case after case of proof in recent years that the death penalty has been imposed, and is continuing to be imposed, on innocent men and women, at least in that country. There is a corollary-a somewhat perverse corollary-which is that the death penalty may cause the guilty to go free. That is for the very simple reason that juries do not like hanging men or women. which leads, in some cases, to juries acquitting where they should convict. One could also point to the volume of evidence that establishes, so far as these things can be established, that the death penalty does not deter crime more than other punishments. Again I would refer to the moving speech that Barry Jones gave in the Victorian parliament in 1975, speaking for the abolition of the death penalty in Victoria, in which he produced-and it is reproduced in the Hansard-a famous graph which looks at the statistics in three American states over a 35-year period. The states were Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. One of those states was abolitionist-it had not had the death penalty for the entire period-another frequently executed the death penalty and a third used the death penalty only infrequently. The graph shows a convergence of the murder rates over the 35-year period and demonstrates, in very dramatic terms, just how little deterrent the existence of the death penalty was over that lengthy period in those states. It is possible to point to a host of similar studies which establish that the death penalty has no more deterrent effect than other punishments in relation to crime. The fight for abolition has been won in country. It seems very unlikely that anyone will be executed again in Australia, but, regrettably, the fight continues overseas, because there are very many countries which still impose the death penalty. Notably, there are countries in our region which continue to impose the death penalty and which have executed the death penalty against Australians in recent years. I attended a vigil, which I will not soon forget, on 2 December 2005 in Melbourne at the time of the execution of Van Tuong Nguyen. It was attended, as you might recall, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, by many members of the Melbourne legal community, because members of the Victorian bar had lent their aid to the efforts to have Van Nguyen's life spared, but to no avail. Other Australians are currently facing the death penalty in countries to our north. There is no room for equivocation on these matters. There is no room to say that there should be no death penalty in Australia but that there is room for the death penalty to be imposed for crimes committed elsewhere in the world. Just as we are all diminished here in Australia by the death penalty, by the continuation of the death penalty, so all human beings are diminished by the continuing imposition of the death penalty. It is a similar proposition that underlies the other part of legislation before the House because the other part deals with our obligations against torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Australia under the Hawke government signed the convention in December 1985 and ratified it-still under the Hawke government-in August 1989. The reason for the current amendment to the crimes legislation in relation to the prohibition against torture prompting by observations made by the UN Committee Against Torture in May 2008 in the form of a recommendation that Australia should enact a specific offence of torture at the federal level. The primary effect of this legislation will be to criminalise acts of torture committed both within and outside Australia. That is entirely consistent with Australia lending its efforts to a worldwide prohibition against torture, and giving this legislation extraterritorial application will further reduce the places or scope for torture to occur. This legislation very much demonstrates this government's condemnation of torture in all circumstances. Just as we are all diminished by the death penalty being imposed, so too, as a society, are we all diminished by our government committing torture supposedly on our behalf. It is of course an issue which has been the subject of a great deal of public discussion, particularly in the United States in the period following the September 11 atrocities in New York, because it was thought and has been said by high officials in the United States that there may be circumstances in which torture is to be permitted. The government of our country is making it clear that there are no circumstances in which torture can be permitted. One of the best explanations of this that I have seen is from someone who is very directly on the other side of politics in a general sense to the side of politics that I occupy-namely, the unsuccessful Republican nominee for President of the United States in the last presidential election, Senator John MCCain, who famously is a war veteran and was a prisoner in Hanoi in the so-called Hanoi Hilton, where he was tortured during the Vietnam War. Throughout his life and with greater strength on his return to the United States after being released from a lengthy captivis ity-some five years held by the North Vietnamese-in all the years after that time he fought and spoke against the use of torture. This is what Senator John MCCain said in 2005, and I quote from a speech he gave in the Senate. He said: Our enemies did not adhere to the Geneva Convention. Many of my comrades were subjected to very cruel, very inhumane, and degrading treatment, a few of them even unto death. But every single one of us knew and took great strength from the belief that we were different from our enemies, that we were better than them, that if the roles were reversed, we would not disgrace ourselves by committing or countenancing such mistreatment of them. That faith was indispensable not only to our survival but to our attempts to return home with honor. Many of the men I served with would have preferred death to such dishonor. He went on to say: The enemies we fight today hold such liberal notions in contempt as they hold in contempt the international conventions that enshrine them, such as the Geneva Conventions and the Treaty on Torture. I know that. But we are better than them, and we are stronger for our faith, and we will prevail. This is a ringing endorsement of the reasons why it is important that we resist always any suggestion that it might be acceptable to engage in torture for whatever reason. There needs to be a complete and total prohibition on torture, and this bill in very direct terms shows that Australia is committed to persisting with that prohibition for all purposes. There is a tendency-and it is with us always, I regret to say-to slip into suggesting that there may be some place for torture. I heard it very directly most recently when I was participating in a television interview with the member for Ryan in August last year where the member for Ryan said: I think that there is a very limited place for and certainly where that torture takes place, it must be done in an appropriate way in an appropriate context. Needless to say, I was appalled-aghast even-that a member of this House could give even a limited endorsement of the possibility of torture. I said-and I have a transcript here: I am shocked to hear Michael say there is a limited place for torture. I think we need to resolutely say there is no place for torture. By the end of the day the member for Ryan had of course retracted those comments, because it had been made clear to him by the member for Wentworth, the then opposition leader, that he condemned those comments in the clearest possible terms. There is no place for any Australian parliamentarian to be suggesting that there might ever be a place in Australian processes for the commission of torture. As a democracy we fight for certain values, and we need to continue to fight for those values. That may mean that, to use the words of Aharon Barak, we fight with one hand tied behind our back.

90,Mr MURPHY,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I applaud the member for Isaacs' contribution and other members' contributions in this very important debate. I too rise to speak in support of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009. This legislation ensures that Australia continues to combat torture and reinforces our strong desire to support moves to abolish capital punishment throughout the world. This legislation acts as a springboard from which we as a nation can lead international efforts to speak out against torture and the death penalty. As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, Australia is a party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Puntorture ishment. Consequently we have an international obligation to ensure that all acts of torture are offences under domestic criminal law. Presently acts falling within the convention's definition are offences under state and territory criminal laws. However, in May 2008 the United Nations Committee Against Torture, in its concluding observations on Australia, expressed concern that Australia does not have a specific torture offence in the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The report recommended that Australia legislate to: … ensure that torture is adequately defined and specifically criminalized both at the Federal, States and Territories levels, in accordance with article 1 of the Convention. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Rudd government takes Australia's responsibilities under this convention very seriously. That is why we are including the new offence of torture in the Criminal Code to criminalise acts of torture committed both within and outside Australia. I believe that by enacting a new offence of torture we are signalling to the rest of the world that we condemn this shameful, brutal and barbaric practice. I believe that we are sending a very clear message about the values we in Australia hold and about our strong commitment to human rights. The inclusion of torture in the Criminal Code should not put an end to our efforts to eliminate torture. Whilst we have formally put an end to this insidious practice in Australia, there remains much more to do in order to eliminate the use of torture throughout the world. There are some elements in the international community who believe that torture is a necessary evil in the global fight against terrorism. In order to assess the validity of this belief it is important to define the concept of torture. According to the bill before the House, torture refers to conduct by an individual in an official position that inflicts severe physical or mental pain or suffering on a person for the purpose of obtaining information or a confession, punishing the victim or intimidation. The definition contained in the legislation is based on the definition contained in the United Nations convention on torture. Obviously such conduct is nothing short of violent; however, is this practice necessary? ‘Is the practice of torture required to defeat crime and, more specifically, to defeat the crime of terrorism?' I ask. The simple answer is no. Not only does the practice of torture represent a moral blight on our humanity but it has been proven on countless occasions that it does not work, and we were reminded of that in the contribution that we just listened to by the member for Isaacs. Like the member for Isaacs, I would like to refer to a speech given in 2005, this time by Associate Professor Ben Saul to Amnesty International on the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. Associate Professor Saul said: … the argument for torture is indefensible due to insurmountable legal, moral and practical problems. He argued that torture does not work because it produces ‘misinformation' rather than truth. It has been proven that a significant level of information produced from the torture process is incorrect because those being tortured will confess to anything in order to get relief from the pain they are enduring. Incorrect information creates false leads, which only serves to divert our invaluable intelligence resources. Moreover, Associate Professor Saul believes that torture merely ‘degrades' the humanity of interrogators. He went on to say: Terrorism does not demand that we torture to defend ourselves. To the contrary, the threat of terrorism reminds us of the importance of protectbeing ing human dignity … If we resort to the use of violence as a form of punishment then surely we are no better than those who perpetuate violence against us. I cannot think of two stronger arguments against the use of torture. Why continue the practice of torture if it does not work? Why continue torturing people when it so clearly degrades our humanity? Torture is wrong. Australia should continue to advance these arguments on the international stage. I now turn my attention to the second key measure in this legislation, and that is the extension of the current prohibition on the death penalty to state laws. I am very proud to live in a country that has such a long standing policy of opposition to the death penalty. As part of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Australia is permitted to use the death penalty for ‘the most serious crimes'. However, we rightly object to the use of the death penalty under any situation and that is why we are party to the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which requires Australia to abolish the death penalty. By amending the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 we are ensuring that the death penalty cannot be reintroduced anywhere in Australia. The need for this legislation is highlighted by comments, I believe, made by the former Prime Minister, John Howard, in 2003. Mr Howard called for a national debate on the reintroduction of capital punishment as part of new antiterror laws. Whilst Commonwealth governments are prohibited from reintroducing capital punishment under the Death Penalty Abolition Act, Mr Howard suggested that state Liberal opposition parties could raise the issue. I am sure we all know on this side of the House why Mr Howard said that. We have seen on far too many occasions the issue of law and order used as a political football in state politics. It would be a very dangerous development in Australian public life if any party went to a state election promising to reintroduce the death penalty for serious crimes. Like the member for Isaacs, I do not foresee this happening in the future, but it is important to implement measures to ensure that it never happens. That is what this bill is all about. Australia's long standing opposition to the death penalty must be consistent. We cannot, for instance, prohibit the use of this punishment in Australia yet support the use of this practice to punish terrorists. This is an inconsistency that should not be pursued. Opposition to the death penalty must not be seen as weakness on terrorism. Put simply, terrorism is evil. I cannot imagine the heartache and devastation felt by the families of the victims of terrorist attacks. Too many lives have been lost in attacks throughout the world and there can be no moral reasoning or justification for anyone to perpetuate such evil. Terrorists must be brought to justice and punished for the horrific evil, violence and destruction that they commit. However, I do not believe that the use of capital punishment is an effective punishment for terrorism. In many cases the use of the death penalty is exactly what terrorists want: offering the potential to make them martyrs in the eyes of their followers. That could inspire more people to support their fundamentalist ideologies. The death penalty is a futile deterrent for individuals who believe terrorism is a pathway to martyrdom. This view is supported by Professor Jeffrey Fagan of Columbia University, who has argued that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent for terrorists. Only in November of last year he wrote: Deterrence assumes a rational actor who perceives that the punishment costs exceed the benefits of the crime, and who will not act against his or her own self-interest. In this case, capital ishment] is no match for the rewards of martyrdom. In other words the death penalty will not work as a punishment. In my view life imprisonment is the strongest form of punishment that can be applied to terrorists and I believe Australia should advocate this form of punishment in the international arena. Furthermore, if we advocate the use of life imprisonment for terrorists, rather than capital punishment, we may be more successful when intervening to support Australians on death row in other countries. As constitutional law expert Professor George Williams recently said: The notion that it is acceptable to execute terrorists but not other criminals, or to execute foreign nationals but not Australians, is morally and logically unsustainable. The value of a human life is not contingent on a person's nationality or the nature of their crime. Opposition to the death penalty does not permit such shades of grey. The ambiguity and inconsistency to which Professor Williams refers weaken our efforts to achieve clemency for Australian citizens on death row overseas. It is not very credible to intervene on behalf of an Australian on death row yet advocate the use of capital punishment for all other criminals. I do not believe the crimes of Australians on death row should go unpunished. They committed serious crimes, which cannot be ignored. However, to take the lives of these individuals, many of whom are young men and women, is simply a waste. Yes they made a big mistake, yes they committed a serious crime, but they also deserve the chance to learn from this and to be potentially rehabilitated. The use of the death penalty denies them this opportunity. Throughout 2005 I too spoke about the tragic case of Mr Van Tuong Nguyen, who was hanged in Singapore at the age of 25. I [punsupport the words of the member for Isaacs. I want to repeat what I said when I spoke in this House then: In my view, no-one on this earth has the right execute a human being. In my view, there is no justification for the death penalty. Everyone be forgiven; everyone can be redeemed … I call on … this parliament to lead a campaign … to rid the world of capital punishment. Today I renew that call. Today I call on the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and every member of this Parliament to lead international efforts to put an end to the use of capital punishment throughout the world. The government will have a very good opportunity to raise this issue during the upcoming visit of President Barack Obama to Australia. May I be so bold as to suggest that one of the issues raised with President Obama be capital punishment in America. To date, my contribution to this debate has centred on the issue of punishment for the perpetrators of crimes. However, in the time. I have remaining I would like to raise the issue of crime prevention. All crime happens for a reason. Poverty, ignorance and disillusionment with society are but a few of the many reasons individuals commit crimes, so it is imperative that we tackle the causes of crime by addressing poverty, promoting social inclusion and advancing the cause of tolerance and understanding. As elected representatives, we have an important obligation to provide leadership and promote the principle that every human being has intrinsic value, integrity and dignity. We have a responsibility to ensure Australia's children are aware of this basic truth. If we fail to achieve this objective, our children may be vulnerable to an ideology that teaches that it is acceptable to treat people differently. Perhaps if we are able to promote greater tolerance and understanding throughout Australia, and indeed the world, we will be able to prevent at least some violence and achieve more peace. I believe that this bill sends a clear message to the rest of the world: Austo tralia is a country that condemns torture and the use of capital punishment. The bill also can sends a deeper message: Australia is a country that condemns violence and values the dignity of every human being. Let us build on the measures contained in this legislation by advocating the removal of capital punishment throughout the world. More needs to be done to abolish the death penalty in the 60 nations that continue to practise it. This is a fight worth pursuing, and I believe this bill is a good start.",82
91,Ms HALL,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009 specifies that the Commonwealth offence of torture in the Commonwealth Criminal Code will operate concurrently with existing offences in state and territory criminal laws. The new offence is intended to fulfil more clearly Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The bill also amends the Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 to extend the application of the current prohibition on the death penalty to state criminal laws. This will ensure that the death penalty cannot be introduced anywhere in Australia in the future. I strongly support this legislation. It is about enshrining the protection of basic human rights in legislation. Since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, the international community has adopted a set of comprehensive human rights-rights that enshrine human dignity, rights that a civil society values and rights that provide guidelines for governments in how they should treat their citizens. The prohibition of torture is a core value that is a human right and it should never be set aside. Nothing justifies torture. Many arguments are put forward that support the use of torture and I reject all those arguments. Some people argue that the need to obtain information necessitates the use of torture in certain circumstances. I have only to look to what has happened in various areas of conflict and the results of those acts of torture and I come out very strongly in favour of the arguments against torture. I think that they are very succinct in setting out the case for not supporting the use of torture under any circumstances. This can include extracting a confession or obtaining information from victims or a third person. Torture can be used as a form of punishment, intimidation, coercion and discrimination. The Bills Digest on this bill states: Despite the definition of ‘torture' contained UNCAT, the legal concept of torture has not been either unified or coherent. Within the international community there have been important and ongoing conflicts over the threshold of severity of pain and cruelty, the role of the intention, the identity of the perpetrators and the positive gations of states to prevent torture. So I suppose that the underlying aspect is the severity of inflicting pain or suffering. It is not a criterion; it is a simple act of subjecting a person to pain and cruelty. One of those reasons that I stated above is that we have had Australian citizens-David Hicks and Mr Habib in the United States of America in 2001 and in Afghanistan-that have been involved in and been the victims of torture. I think that as a civilised nation there is no way that we can support torture. When you look at torture and the information that is obtained under torture, I do not think that we can even be certain that the veracity of the information obtained whilst a person is being tortured can be guaranteed. I know that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is a person who has very strong opinions on torture and the need to ensure that people do not suffer undue torture in any circumstance at all. Among the interesting experiments that I came across-they do not directly relate to torture-are Stanley Milgram's experiments, which were actually looking at obedience to authority figures. In that experiment, Yale students subjected other students to electric shocks-some of them were teachers and some were students. The level of shock the participant was willing to deliver was aimed at measuring their obedience to authority. I should say that the participants were told that the shocks were not going to be painful or dangerous, but they were at a very high level. As a result of these experiments in subsequent years, it was not the people that supposedly received the shock but those people that were delivering the shock that in the suffered severe psychological impacts from being involved in that experiment. The reason that I raise that experiment is to show that, with torture, the implications are wider than just the act itself and the fact obli- that those people that are tortured may or may not give information. Even the people that are involved in the act itself are affected by it. I think that, as a civilised nation, there is absolutely no way that we can be a party to any acts of torture. No matter what the deed or the information that is sought is, torture cannot be justified. Australia became a party to the convention against torture in 1989, and our commitment to the prohibition of torture must always be paramount, no matter what the challenge. I notice that speakers in this debate from both sides of the House have expressed strong views on this. To allow or accept torture is a slippery slope that will lead us to become a less civilised nation. A nation must always protect human rights, and the legislation that we have here today protects and delivers on that. I might at this stage refer to a dissenting report back in 2004 by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. In that dissenting report, committee members noted strong support for Australia ratifying the optional protocol. I am referring to that because I think it really sets out quite succinctly why we need to ensure that torture is outlawed in this country, as is highlighted in this legislation, for all times. Members referred to the need to maintain Australia's leadership in human rights. The report also pointed out in its final recommendation that there is no circumstance, basically, where torture is acceptable. I think that those people on the treaties committee recognised that back in 2004. The commitment to the prohibition of torture, as I said, must remain solid. To do otherwise would compromise our nation's moral leadership. By that I mean that we must always as a nation look to the high ground and to putting in place a legislation framework that will ensure that, as a nation, we aspire the highest level of protections of human rights. We must not under any circumstance let the bar slip and reach a stage where we are not about ensuring and protecting the rights of people. The Rudd government's commitment to ensuring that torture is unacceptable was evident firstly with the signing of the optional protocol. I must say that this legislation also demonstrates very visibly that as a government the Rudd government will not and does not under any circumstances support torture in any shape or form. This legislation, I think, can be used as a blueprint for other nations as well as our own. That brings me to the death penalty, and I wish to place on record that I am opposed to the death penalty under any circumstance at all. There is no circumstance where I believe the death penalty can be justified. Australia has a long standing policy of opposition to the death penalty. The Labor Party, which I am part of in this parliament, has in its platform that it opposes the death penalty and believes it is inhumane, no matter what the crime is. That statement really highlights and encompasses my feeling on the death penalty. The purpose of amendments to the Commonwealth Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 is to extend the application of the current prohibition of the death penalty to the states. I think this is very important because it will ensure that the death penalty cannot be reintroduced anywhere in Australia. Such a comprehensive rejection of capital punishment demonstrates Australia's commitment to the worldwide abolition movement and complements Australia's international lobbying efforts against the death penalty. I think it is of vital importance to note that this legislation will ensure the outlawing of the death penalty throughout Australia. This to is about showing leadership. One of the reasons that I cannot support the death penalty is that there have been many cases reported where innocent people have been put to death-with the advent of DNA testing I think that they are finding more and more people who have been sentenced to death and that sentence has been shown to be incorrect. It is inhumane; no matter what a person has done, I believe that nothing gives us the right to actually take away their lives. As the member for Lowe was saying earlier, when it comes to a crime such as terrorism or something horrendous, the simple fact that a person will be in prison and not allowed to leave that prison for life is an even greater punishment than to quickly escape the consequences of their action through the death penalty. I do not think that, as a nation, we can in any shape or form support the death penalty. At the moment there are the young people in Indonesia-the Bali Nine-who are facing death because they trafficked drugs. That is an act that I do not support; it is an act that has the potential to endanger the lives of many people within Australia. But I do not believe, under any circumstances, that we can support the death penalty in their case or any other cases. This legislation is good, strong legislation that will ensure that we do not support torture in this nation and that will finally ensure, once and for all, that the death penalty is outlawed throughout the whole of Australia.",85
92,Mr SLIPPER,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009 is legislation that is supported by both sides of the chamber. It is legislation which, in practice, probably does not have any real effect, because the crime of torture is already a crime under Australia's laws-particularly state and territory laws-and also, the death penalty does not exist anywhere within the states or territories of Australia. It certainly does not exist at the Commonwealth level. No one can support torture, and I do note that an international committee against torture recommended that Australia implement a specific offence of torture at the federal level. That recommendation was included in the concluding observations on Australia by the UN Committee Against Torture issued in May 2008. Consequently, to be a good international citizen, this country is implementing that recommendation. With respect to the death penalty, that is a subject which has occupied a lot of public debate in this country and in other countries around the world. I place on record that I do not support the death penalty, although in the past I have been able to understand how some groups in the community might believe that the death penalty is an appropriate penalty for certain sorts of particularly gross crimes: child murder, maybe murder involving torture and so on. However, I am someone who has always been opposed to abortion, and I am opposed to euthanasia. It occurred to me that to be consistent, if I am opposed to other forms of state sanctioned killing I had also to become very strongly opposed to the death penalty. I see that consistency as being very important. One cannot pick and choose; in my view one cannot, with a sense of intellectual honesty, support state sanctioned killing at one level and not support state sanctioned killing at another level. I do understand that, particularly after there has been a horrendous crime committed somewhere around the world or in the country, if one did take a plebiscite of the community people would often vote for the death penalty. However, this legislation will mean that the death penalty will not be able to be imposed at state or federal level anywhere in Australia in the future-that is, I suppose, unless this law at some time in the future, after implementation, is actually repealed. I do have somewhat of a problem with the federal government entering into treaties internationally and then, by virtue of the international obligations resulting from those treaties, acquiring the competence to legislate domestically in relation to areas where, under our Australian Constitution, the Commonwealth has no right to legislate. It is one way, I suppose, of tearing up the Constitution for the federal government to enter into a treaty and then have an international obligation which must be implemented and which gives us the legislative capacity to implement that international legislation through a law of the Australian parliament. I do not know that this particular bill has been controversial. I have not heard the states object to its passage. But one who took the view that it was wrong for the Commonwealth to acquire extra legislative competence by entering into an international treaty might be concerned, if not with the result of this legisit lation certainly with the mechanism which gives us the constitutional authority to pass this law through the Australian parliament. The honourable member for Shortland, who spoke before me, referred to the fate being faced by a number of Australians who are presently incarcerated in overseas prisons. It really is important that Australians who travel to other countries recognise that, even though the death penalty will be outlawed in this country, the laws of this country with respect to the death penalty do not have some sort of extraterritorial effect in overseas countries. If we travel to other countries, we have to be prepared to observe the laws of those countries even if we do not agree with the laws of those countries, and we have to accept that each individual jurisdiction, each individual nation state, does have the right to bring in its own penalties for certain criminal offences. All Australians would know that there are many countries throughout the globe which do have the death penalty on their respective statute books. It is not reasonable to expect that Australians who are convicted of the death penalty should automatically have the death penalty commuted to something else simply because they are Australians. I suppose if one has the privilege of travelling to other countries, one has to understand what the laws of those other countries are, and we just cannot expect that, because we are Australians, those laws do not apply to us. Having said that-and I am pleased to see the honourable the Attorney-General at the table-I do support recommendations by successive Australian governments for clemency and leniency when Australians find themselves in the positions in which some have found themselves in recent years. I think it is important for us as members of parliament to counsel Australians, particularly young Australians, who travel abroad, as many do-and is a wonderful experience-that when they go to those other countries, they are subject to the laws of those countries no matter how horrendous we as Australians might view some of the penalties imposed by the laws of other nations. This is not controversial legislation in the community. I do not think one could find anyone in our society who would support torture. I find it disturbing that there are countries abroad where there is statesanctioned torture, and I think that anything that we can do as a nation to reduce and eliminate this is very much a step in the right direction. I do not intend to take the full 20 minutes available to me, but I want to reiterate my support for the principles contained in this bill, although I do have this lingering concern about whether, if we are going to have a constitutional compact, it is appropriate for the Commonwealth to acquire extra legislative competence by going through the mechanism of signing and ratifying an international treaty which then gives the government of Australia the obligation to bring the effect of that treaty into domestic law. The Attorney would be pleased to know that I am not accusing this government of being the first government to do that. I think it is something that has grown up over the years. I am not convinced that it is a good thing, but, at least in the case of this bill, I suppose one could say that it does remove forever the prospect of the reintroduction of the death penalty in any jurisdiction within this country. I commend the bill to the House.",88
93,Ms REA,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I too rise to support the bill before us, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009. In doing so, I wish to commend the Attorney-General for bringing this piece of legislation forward-and I would have said that regardless of whether he was actually present in the chamber, but I am pleased that he is here. I commend the Attorney-General for introducing this bill, because I think it reflects that democracy is an organic thing, an everchanging, living, breathing thing, that adapts and changes according to different stages of social progression-and, indeed, we hope that it does so in a way that will always make society better. I certainly believe that this legislation will do so. I am also very pleased to support this bill, because often in this place there is a lot of fanfare, attention and publicity associated with a number of bills that go through this House but often some of the most significant pieces of legislation are the ones that get very little airplay at alland I would say that this bill is a perfect example of that. As a relatively new member of this parliament, it is interesting that I would be standing here in the year 2010 speaking on a piece of legislation which outlaws the death penalty and torture. I believe this legislation is not just a reflection of how our democracy and our legislative processes work-in that we are constantly looking at ways in which we can reinforce the significant values that underlie our democratic society-but also a very interesting reflection on the federal nature of our society and of our governance system. We have various state and territory laws that have banned torture and outlawed the death penalty. Australia can hold its head high amongst most Western countries in terms of its commitment to opposing torture and the death penalty. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that the international community has recognised the need for Australia to amend the Commonwealth Criminal Code and the Death Penalty Abolition Act to reflect our international obligations and to ensure that, through Commonwealth legislation, torture and death penalty laws can never again be introduced by state or territory parliaments. It is quite a significant piece of legislation for Australia. It a clearly shows that the government are very committed to honouring Australia's international obligations, particularly our obligations around the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Second Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In reflecting on the interesting governance system that we have in this country, articles 4 and 5 of the convention against torture refer specifically to the need for nations to not rely simply upon state and territory law but to introduce laws into their national parliaments which will not allow these particular actions to resurface. Indeed, article 4 says: 1. Each State Party shall ensure that all acts of torture are offences under its criminal law. The same shall apply to an attempt to commit torture and to an act by any person which constitutes complicity or participation in torture. 2. Each State Party shall make these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature. Article 5 says: 1. Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences referred to in article 4 in the following cases: (a) When the offences are committed in any territory under its jurisdiction or on board a ship or aircraft registered in that State; (b) When the alleged offender is a national of that State; (c) When the victim was a national of that State if that State considers it appropriate. 2. Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over such offences in cases where the alleged offender is present in any territory under its jurisdiction and it does not extradite him pursuant to article 8 to any of the mentioned in Paragraph 1 of this article. 3. This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with internal law. It is important that this law has a practical implication. I want to assure the previous speaker that, because of the nature of our federal system and because of the ability of Commonwealth law to override state and territory laws, there is a very clear and practical reason why the government have introduced this legislation-that is, to ensure that we do not see torture or the death penalty ever reintroduced in this country. Many speakers before me have talked at length about our opposition to torture and the death penalty. As a government and as a nation, we have a very proud record both domestically and internationally of being great advocates for human rights and great supporters of the United Nations and of any international approach which attempts to protect and improve the human rights of citizens across the globe. We have a proud record of making clear our opposition to the death penalty and to torture. But we also have to be very mindful that this can sometimes be difficult. We all know that there are many people within our own communities and across the globe who have varying views about the level of punishment that should be administered to someone who commits a heinous crime or act against somebody else. We all know that we live every day with the very real threat of terrorism. We also know that we live in a society where unfortunately there are individuals who can perform the most horrendous acts on people who are perhaps more vulnerable than them. All these things can sometimes bring out that part of our nature which is tempted to react, to seek revenge and to seek punishment. There are certainly cases and, I think, appropriate States situations where punishment must be administered. If we are to uphold the true principles of a free and democratic society-where parliaments are elected, where people have the right to vote, where every individual can exercise certain freedoms and have certain rights-and say we are a civilised and progressive community, we have to say that there are no circumstances in which the death penalty or torture is acceptable. We have to say that there is no point where you can draw a line. If you do not believe that the state or an individual has a right to take someone else's life, particularly in the form of revenge or punishment, then there are no circumstances in which it is appropriate. You have to clearly say, ‘It should be outlawed in all circumstances.' I personally support that, and that is why I am very pleased to be speaking on this legislation. As I have already said, this legislation is not just about dealing with this issue at a domestic level; it is clearly about the government and the nation honouring our obligations under international conventions and covenants to which we are a party. It is also about putting our money where our mouth is. It is about saying that we as participants in the global community are strongly opposed to both torture and the death penalty. If we are to be strong advocates in whatever international forum that we participate in and if we are to be strong advocates with both our friends and those who we may not have such a great relationship with-to argue vehemently that they must never abuse human rights in the most horrendous way through torture and the death penalty-then we have to put our money where our mouth is. As a Commonwealth parliament we have to clearly say that we do not support this under any circumstances and that we will use whatever legislative means we have to ensure that these particular actions will never see the light of day again in Australia. It is about being a good global citizen, it is about being an active player on the global stage and it is about clearly sending the message to all countries who continue to allow the death penalty: that Australia will not accept it and we will do whatever we can to oppose it and fight against it. As the Chair of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I think it is very important for me to be putting my comments on the record in this case. I acknowledge the work of that subcommittee and the work of the many non-government organisations and representatives of civil society who are working tirelessly in the area of protecting and defending human rights, not just on the global stage but here in our country. One civil society always reminds us that we must be ever-vigilant and never complacent. I think that is reflected interestingly in recent consultations that were initiated by the Attorney-General and conducted around the issue of human rights here within our own nation and the freedoms that many of our citizens take for granted. When the panel of eminent persons went out to consult with the community, they received over 40,000 submissions on the issue of human rights in Australia. I think that is a reflection that within the Australian community there is still a very strong interest in how we as a democratic society can continue to protect, defend and improve our domestic approach to human rights. It also clearly showed support for the government and for the parliament to put human rights as a key issue, not just domestically but internationally. Today, in my capacity as Chair, I had the opportunity to attend the consultations that were run by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with civil society and the many NGOs that attended. In conclusion, I once again put on the record my support and admiration for the people who work in those organisations. They are fighting for individual people who are in dire circumstances and for particular groups in our society who are still vulnerable and open to exploitation and abuse. What they are doing through their tireless work is constantly maintaining vigilance and ensuring against the complacency which can sometimes creep in when we are focused on many other things as a parliament and as a community. The protection, defence and the continual desire to improve our human rights is the fundamental value that underpins our work in this parliament, our democratic society and our prosperity as individuals. I commend this bill to the House.",89
94,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (6.04 pm)the I join with previous speakers in congratulating the Attorney-General for introducing this legislation. As people have indicated, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009 accords with the United Nations pressure regarding torture and capital punishment, and Australia's actions support that. At the outset, I noticed some comments by the Leader of the Opposition in the past week and I will give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he was thinking of moral issues out loud. He made the point that, whilst historically he had a firm opposition on capital punishment, he thought that for some terrorist acts perhaps it is very hard to hold that position. Once we go down that road, we have people whose families have been very affected by horrific murders, the emotions of those circumstances, the intensity of their feelings, and we can go on and on. Once we start making an exception to a position on this matter, we are going down a very dangerous road. On the question of terrorism and the question of outrage, the Leader of the Opposition should remember New South Wales history and Henry Parkes. Parkes was on other fronts a great statesman and a person who gave this country one of the things for which it can be most admired-public education. But, when the heir to the British throne was shot at Clontarf on the northern beaches in Sydney, Parkes-in a very ruthless fashionused that attempted murder to create an antiFenian, anti-Catholic hysteria in Sydney by saying that it was Fenian terrorism. The person was found, as I recall, to be rather deranged and had no political motivations whatsoever. It is an example that we must be careful about what we regard as terrorism and heinous. We might find the Iranian regime saying that it is justified in incarcerating people for 30 years and executing them over political demonstrations since the elections there. Equally, we know that in the Middle East-we might not be able to contemplate this-many of the people that carry out these acts see Western intervention in that region, whether it is the question of having US forces in Saudi Arabia or the question of Palestine, as a form of international terrorthe ism. So you have got to be very careful with the kinds of exceptions that we might consider. I, for one, far more admire the statements of the former Liberal Party Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner. I recall what he said when I was still, I think, in state parliament. He said that, if the Liberal Party ever adopted a position that supported capital punishment, he would resign as leader of the Liberal Party. I think that is the kind of approach we take in regard to this matter. I have a habit of giving books to public libraries when people die, rather than flowers. The other day I was flicking through a book I purchased for someone-a book called Killing Time by David R Dow. It traces the author's involvement in a Texas court case, and it looks at some of the problems with capital punishment in the United States. He looks into the performance of Jack Gatling, the counsel for the accused, who is a person renowned for his ineptitude and whose job is to defend many of these people as they go down towards their deaths. He comments on the case on page 192: Nor did hethat is, Gatlingchallenge the state's expert who single-handedly persuaded the jury to sentence Quaker to death. James Grigson is known as Dr Death. He was expelled from the American Psychiatric Association as well as the Texas Society of Psychiatric Physicians, but that did not stop him from testifying in hundreds of trials. Grigson claimed to have examined somewhere between two hundred and four hundred capital-murder defendants-the number varied from case to case, because Grigson could not keep his answer straight from one trial to the next. But that did not stop juries from believing him. Sometimes he would not interview the defendants at all; other times he would visit with them for fifteen minutes or so in the county jail, asking them what they saw when they looked at ink blots. He would then sit on the witness stand for as much as five hours, telling jurors that defendant before them would undoubtedly be dangerous in the future if not speedily put to death. His flamboyant predictions were spectacularly wrong. By some estimates, he was wrong more than 95 per cent of the time. But that too did not stop juries from believing him. Juries would even sentence people to death who had not committed any crime. In one famous case, Grigson testified that Randall Dale Adams would commit more violence if not executed. Adams had been convicted of murdering a state trooper outside of Dallas. Errol Morris made a documentary about the debacle of the trial. As it happened, Adams did not actually kill the officer; someone else did. Adams was released from prison after his innocence was established. He had not committed any crimes prior to his wrongful conviction, and he has not committed any since. This brings me to the concern about erroneous convictions, whether it is due to ineptitude with regard to the defence of these people who are convicted erroneously; whether it is due to informants whose evidence is unreliable and who are actually making sentencing deals for themselves; whether it is due to coercion by authorities, theory before evidence, or whatever. On all these grounds, there is grave concern in such a crucial matter of life and death. With respect to the emergence of DNA evidence in the United States, it is interesting to note that in the riod 1973 to 2005, 123 people in 25 states were released from death row-123 people who could have been killed if this evidence had not been provided. It is also said that this is a severe understatement of the reality, because after a person has been killed there is a lack of motivation by the family, and the person is obviously not on the job in regard to exonerating themselves. People lack money to drive home these issues, after people have been killed. This is an understatement, and we all know that the strength of DNA evidence is growing as time goes by. So 123 people, at the very least, would have been killed but for the emergence of DNA evidence. It is also a reality that capital punishment is a very random practice. Less than one per cent of all murderers are condemned to death. Of those people on death row, only two per cent are actually executed. In 2005 there were 75 people who had been waiting for 20 years or more-day after day-to know the situation for them. It is also a reality that there is a race factor in sentencing and those on death row in the United States. Forty-one per cent of death row inmates in the United States are black. Thirty-four per cent of those executed are black-and yet only 12 per cent of the population are black. Of course, people will say in defence of the system, ‘There is a propensity to offend.' But obviously a part of that is the reality of the interrelationship of socio-economic circumstances in the commission of crime. The situation is that there is severe overrepresentation of black offenders among those who are eventually sentenced and killed by the state in the United States. As well, at least 25 states in the US allow the execution of people who are mentally retarded. At least 35 have gone down that road between the years 1976 and 2005. There is also a very strong question mark peover the degree to which capital punishment dissuades people from offending. Anyone who has studied the area of gun homicides knows that most people who are killed with guns in this country, or any other country in the world, are not killed by criminals. They are not killed by people who have waited months on end to commit the offence. They are killed on the spur of the moment by a family member, a neighbour or a friend. To think that having capital punishment is going to prevent those kinds of events is illusory. Another worrying development is the privatisation of the penal system, which really puts a question mark over the legitimacy of the system. Last year, two judges in the United States were jailed for very lengthy periods after they had conspired with private prison owners to give them enough people for their jails. There were young people being sentenced without legal representation when they should have had it, people under age, et cetera-large numbers of people over a very lengthy period were basically sentenced just so they could keep the numbers up for private prisons. We saw a situation in the United States-I referred to this in a previous speech-where professors, academics, who were purportedly unbiased and disinterested with respect to the effectiveness of a private prison system in the US, were found to have had significant shareholdings in these institutions, using the justifications to basically settle their self-interest. There are, of course, so many reasons besides the moral question of whether the state should take away life. Referring to Australia again, there was the famous case of the New South Wales justice minister, JT Ley, who refused clemency to someone despite the fact that the person was totally insane. The man was hanged. It was another example of someone sent to their death because it was politically expedient not to show mercy. Fortunately for Mr Ley, when he himself was sentenced to death after murdering six people, he was given the benefit of the defence of insanity and finished up in Broadmoor mental institution in Britain. In the United States, not only is there a disproportionate number of black and poor people amongst those who are executed but studies in the United States time after time have shown that it is also a regional lotteryit depends on the attitudes of judges and of jurisdictions within a state as to who actually has their life terminated. In New York, although upstate counties experience 19 per cent of the state's homicides, they nonetheless account for 61 per cent of all capital prosecutions. In 2001, three counties out of 62 in the state accounted for over one-third of all cases in which a death sentence was filed. In another survey, in Indiana in 2001, newspapers found that the death penalty depended on factors such as the views of individual prosecutors and the financial resources of the county. You will find that, time after time, there is a correlation not the nature of the offence and how it might affect the general public's attitude, not with how macabre the murder is, but with the things that were just specified-that is, the nature of the prosecutor, the nature of the judge, the nature of the society. In conclusion, I very strongly support this measure. On both sides of politics this has been a matter of virtually unanimous support, and that has been largely reflected in the speeches within this debate.",92
95,Mr MCCLELLAND,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"in reply-I am very pleased to sum up the debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty Abolition) Bill 2009. I would certainly like to thank members for their contributions to the debate and the bipartisan support for the bill. The bill contains two measures. First, it enacts a specific Commonwealth torture offence in the Commonwealth Criminal Code to operate concurrently with existing offences in state and territory laws. Since 1989, Australia has been a party to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Among other obligations, the convention requires Australia to ensure that all acts of torture are offences under domestic criminal law. At the moment, Australia meets its obligations, as acts falling within the convention's definition of torture are included as offences under state and territory criminal laws. In recent years the United Nations Committee Against Torture has been critical of nations that have not enacted torture as a specific criminal offence and has recommended that Australia enact an offence of torture at the federal level. The provisions in this bill would respond to the recommendations of the committee and further demonstrate the government's condemnation of with torture in all circumstances by more clearly and explicitly fulfilling Australia's obligations under the convention against torture. The second measure in the bill would amend the Commonwealth Death Penalty Abolition Act 1973 to extend the application of the current prohibition on the death penalty to state laws to ensure the death penalty cannot be introduced anywhere in Australia. The bill proposes extending the application of the current prohibition on the death penalty to state laws. This would ensure that the death penalty could not be reintroduced anywhere in Australia in the future. Kofi Annan, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, once said: The forfeiture of life is too absolute, too irreversible, for one human being to inflict it on another, even when backed by legal process. And I believe that future generations, throughout the world, will come to agree. Through this bill, the House declares that it does so agree. These amendments would emphasise Australia's commitment to our obligations under the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and ensure that Australia continues to comply with those obligations. These domestic amendments complement the measures Australia is taking internationally to promote universal abolition of the death penalty. Through our overseas missions, the government is currently making bilateral representations against the death penalty to all countries that may carry out executions or maintain capital punishment as part of their law. In summary, the bill contains important measures which demonstrate the government's ongoing commitment to better recognising Australia's international human rights obligations. I thank all members for their contributions to this debate and I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",95

97,Mrs MIRABELLA,INVESTMENT PROGRAM,"Indi) (6.22 pm)The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Building Innovative Capability) Bill 2009 amends the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Act 1999 to provide authority for the formulation of a new Clothing and Household Textile (Building Innovative Capability) scheme. This scheme is part of the TCF measures announced in the 200910 budget and comes in response to the review conducted by Professor Roy Green which began in 2008. It is a scheme which will replace the then coalition government's Textile, Clothing and Footwear Post-2005 Strategic Investment Program Scheme for the 2010-11 to 2014-15 years. The coalition's scheme sought to foster the development of a sustainable and competitive TCF manufacturing sector and design industry in Australia by providing incentives in the form of grants. The coalition has always been supportive of the textile, clothing and footwear industry. This industry is particularly close to my heart as it is a significant industry in my electorate and a significant employer. In November 2003, the then coalition government announced a long term assistance package of $747 million for Australia's textile, clothing and footwear industry. This followed a five-year $678 million textile, clothing and footwear strategic investment program. The textile, clothing and footwear industry is an important industry, providing employment to thousands of people. It is also one that has faced particular challenges and culties. This has not changed, with the industry today facing strong competition from countries such as China and other low-costmanufacturing countries, the impact of a strong dollar on exports, the further reduction in tariffs and the difficulties associated with the global financial crisis. While the Rudd government, true to form, pay lipservice about supporting Australia's TCF industry, their actions across other areas and other portfolios tells another story. Like the vast majority of Australians, I was horrified and dismayed last week when it came to light that fabric for Australian defence uniforms could be sourced from China. The public revelation of the government's secret plan resulted in the Minister for Defence Personnel, Material and Science backflipping and back-pedalling in a significant way. It was quite interesting to listen to the tricky language that was used at the time. The minister claimed that the Chinese supply was ‘just an option', which clearly contradicts Defence confirmation of the contract and the Indi Labor candidate's comments on local radio that some of the material would be made in China. The reality was that it was part of a tender that had been awarded by this Labor government-that is, because it awarded this tender, the government had accepted the purchase of fabric from China. Just briefly, I would like to put on the record some of the background to this issue, because it is important to walk the walk and not just talk the talk. This issue very much relates to the future of the textile, clothing and footwear industry. It is not good enough just to have a debate about some assistance program in isolation without looking at some of the broader issues and the government's approach. This issue goes back to July 2009, when Defence awarded a contract to the Bendigo based Australian Defence Apparel diffifor the manufacture of Defence's combat camouflage uniforms and the fabric known as DPCU. There is nothing surprising here: ADA has been making uniforms for the Commonwealth since 1912. However, unlike previous contracts, this tender allowed the sourcing of fabric from China, presumably once Defence's current stock of locally made Australian fabric had been exhausted. But sourcing this unique fabric from China is not at all like a local clothing manufacturer importing any sort of fabric. It is not. This modern DPCU is not just your run-of-themill pattern fabric. It is a high-tech fabric with a range of features designed to make it difficult for modern optical sensors to detect and target soldiers. The technology has been developed in Australia, partly using taxpayers' dollars. It is not in our soldiers' interests and not in the Australian textile industry's interests to give this recipe to a foreign manufacturer who supplies third parties with soldiers' uniforms as well. To make matters worse, it appears that the government was going to allow this technology to go to China. I know there are many other tenders outstanding and contracts awarded by government which raise similar issues and concerns and I will be monitoring and investigating those over the next few months. It is of particular concern because, again, the minister gave certain undertakings. Last July, around the same time this contract was awarded, Minister Combet adopted Defence's long standing Priority Industry Capability policy. This is where the government is committed to: … ensure that certain strategically important industry capabilities continue to be available from within Australia … and which, if not available, would significantly undermine defence self ance and Australian Defence Force (ADF) operational capability. So, at roughly the same time that this contract was being awarded, Minister Combat was putting on the record totally the opposite. Interestingly enough, this is on point because Minister Combet's document adopting priority industry capabilities includes combat gear as a key priority industry capability. Under this policy, the Chinese tender should never have been accepted. The federal government, and Defence in particular, have a responsibility to get good value for the taxpayer dollars they spend, but scrimping a few dollars to dress our diggers in Chinese uniforms is both a false economy and a slap in the face to our men and women in uniform for no good reason. It is a slap in the face to domestic industries which are successful, competitive and innovative in this sector that we are trying to help with this bill. The cost to the economy of endangering 400 jobs in north-east Victoria and the damage to the industry that this could cause is far more significant than the alleged, and quite questionable, $1.5 million in savings that would have come out of this contract. It is very interesting for this sector to ask, ‘Where was the union in all of this?' The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union issued a statement only on the day the story broke, calling on the minister to guarantee Australian jobs. Can you imagine: there they are in their nice red brick building down on the edge of the CBD of Melbourne panicking and saying: ‘Well, we haven't said anything about this issue. It's front-page on some of the papers around the country and we'd better come up with something quick smart. Of course, we knew about it, but we couldn't say anything because we're part and parcel of the Labor Party; we couldn't criticise them to support local jobs.' The workers who reli- potentially could have been affected know what the union did not do and know that the union was silent on this issue. In the closeknit world of Labor and unions, it defies common sense that the union was unaware of this situation. This was not an isolated case; it is just another example of the union being silent for political expediency. We do not have to go that far back to recall the barest whimper from the unions last year when Pacific Brands sacked more than 1,400 workers and shipped machinery to China, including equipment funded by the Australian taxpayer. These may be difficult and unpalatable issues for some on the other side, but they are part of the debate about the long-term sustainability of the industry. I am pleased to say that the coalition will continue to strongly support the textile, clothing and footwear industry and will continue to highlight cases like the Defence fabric fiasco, where the Rudd government's actions were planets away from its rhetoric. Certainly, when the Rudd government makes a decision that is clearly not in the national interest, as was the case with the Defence contract, we will be running after it and holding it to account. In a sense the jury is still out on this current bill. While the bill does replace the TCF Post-2005 Strategic Investment Program, it is important to note that the bill does not actually contain the detail of the replacement scheme. It provides only the authority when enacted for a scheme coming within the broad parameters of the bill to be formulated. So, once again, we are being asked to take this government on trust and to sign a blank cheque, leaving them to fill in the details. This leaves me particularly uncomfortable because we have seen time and time again with this government-and you have to look at how people behave on past experience to make a judgment of them-that part of the problem, as has been in the past, is the devil is in the detail. We have only to look at the utterly, disgraceful botched program and its tragic outcomes to see that the devil is indeed in the detail and the lack of responsibility that has attached to the ister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts in that program. We have seen other programs where a lack of detail has caused enormous waste of taxpayers' dollars at a time when there is record debt mounting for future generations to pay back. We have seen the expensive and highly wasteful Building the Education Revolution program that has produced particular gems such as a $250,000 library for a one-person school. Now it has been revealed that some of the building works cost nearly 10 times normal commercial rates. That is what happens when you do not have details of government programs properly scrutinised. We have seen a whole stream of ineffective and ultimately abandoned programs like Fuelwatch, GroceryWatch and the absolute budget blow-out of the National Broadband Network. The list goes on. Time and time again we have seen this government prove that it is incapable of delivering effective, efficient and well-run programs. It is very big on rhetoric and spin and being seen to run from one media circus to another, but when it comes to the real world, when it comes to the nuts and bolts, when it comes to delivering, it fails miserably and I am sure all its very expensive focus group research is showing it exactly that. You just wait and see the Prime Minister and some of his ministers try some action shots in the media. They will be wearing hard hats and colourful fluoro vests, digging a hole here and there, trying to prove that they are men and women of action, not just all talk and no action. But the cynicism of Australians right across the country has been pricked and will continue to grow. It is just one of those factors that goes to continued distrust and cynicism about government in installation batts this country. It is no wonder that there is a lot of industry concern about the operation of the new MinTCF scheme that is going to be facilitated by this bill. With much of the detail as to the scope of the new scheme, such as eligibility, definitions and the calculation of grants to be contained in the scheme yet to be formulated, it is difficult to properly assess the merits of the actual scheme. Without the opportunity to examine the details, we do not know, and neither does the industry, what impact it will have. It is these details that are important to industry players. I note that this concern has been reflected in submissions made to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, to which this bill has been referred. The Australian Industry Group have implored that eligibility criteria be carefully developed and that transparency be increased and red tape reduced by streamlining the application and decision-making process. Again, these are details that will be part of the final scheme-so we are told. The Technical Textile and Nonwoven Association expressed concern in their submission, stating: … it is disconcerting to assess and to make comment on a program with few specifics. The Carpet Institute of Australia stated: It is difficult to assess the Scheme because the Bill and Explanatory Memorandum provide only a basic framework. Bruck Textiles, in its submission, observed: … what is missing from the Bill, is the actual Scheme detail outlining how the Program will be implemented and delivered. There is no ambiguity in that. As I said earlier, the devil is in the detail, and it is only when we have a full picture of the details of the new scheme that a full assessment and judgment can be made on any effectiveness that the government puts in place with the new scheme. As regards the provisions contained in the bill itself, I am concerned that section 37ZM provides authority for the new scheme to allow grants to be made even where manufacturing has moved overseas. It is important that taxpayer funds are used to support Australian manufacturing-not the transfer of manufacturing offshore. I have received advice from the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research that it is not proposed to formulate a scheme that would allow grants to be made in such circumstances. If that is the case, I believe the bill needs to be amended to reflect that fact. As I have indicated, I do have a number of concerns that are shared by industry regarding the bill and, more importantly, the new scheme that it puts in place. I do note, though, that the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, to which the bill has been referred for inquiry, is due to report by the end of the week, and I trust the government will take heed of the recommendations of this inquiry and address the genuine concerns that have been expressed by industry leaders. The department has also advised me that they will be undertaking further industry consultation in February to assist them in formulating the new scheme. It would be of considerable benefit to the industry and to good legislation to be in a position to examine both the Senate committee report and a draft of the details of the scheme. I have outstanding concerns that amendments to the bill may be required, and these will have to be dealt with in the Senate in due course. I implore the government not only to consult widely but to give effect to the wishes and the concerns that arise out of consultations and that have already been raised by industry players-and, of course, to ensure that the details of the final scheme help strengthen the TCF industry and do not put on further strain or add another layer of bureaucracy that Australian employers simply do not need at this stage. I look forward to the Senate Economics Committee report and the government's response to that.",96
98,Ms VAMVAKINOU,INVESTMENT PROGRAM,"I rise today to speak in support of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Building Innovative Capability) Bill 2009. I welcome the introduction the bill before us today, which is primarily designed to help strengthen Australia's innovative capability and productive capacity in these vital industries. I welcome the long standing efforts of the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator the Hon. Kim Carr, that are aimed at providing Australia with a clear direction on how to help deliver to these industries and their workers a strong competitive advantage in today's globalised environment. As chair of the House Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Innovationand, of course, as the member for Calwell, which has a very large manufacturing baseI work closely with Minister Carr to try and examine, report on and make recommendations regarding areas of policy that affect these industries. That is why I understand the importance of the government's commitment to making use of the extensive consultation process which began last year. As such, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the minister's continued efforts, which are aimed at ensuring that a strong and viable textile, clothing and footwear industry remains an integral part of our national economy and social framework. I also take this opportunity to welcome the efforts of Dr Craig Emerson, the Minister for Small Business, for introducing this important piece of legislation to the House. This bill aims to provide an important legislative authority for the new clothing and household textile building innovative capability scheme, which is a key component of the federal government's textile, clothing and footwear innovation package. The textile, clothing and footwear industries employ over 45,000 Australians across the country. They generate exports that are worth $1.6 billion as well as contributing $2.8 billion each year alone to our national economy. The employment patterns within these industries, particularly in regional economies, ensure that entire communities across Australia are strongly supported by the development of these industries, and of course my electorate is one such community that would obviously benefit greatly from the government's commitments. That is why the initiatives and programs introduced by the Rudd Labor government are crucial to promoting capital investment and innovation aimed at ensuring that Australian made products continue to be a driving force for our local, regional and national economy. In last year's federal budget, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Kim Carr, announced the establishment of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industries Innovation Council as part of the TCF innovation package, which is in addition to five other councils, all of which, to a large degree, serve to have a strong impact on driving innovation in Australian industries. In my capacity as chair of the industry committee-and, again, as the federal member for Calwell-I know too well the importance of working closely with local businesses, unions and researchers in ensuring that communities across Australia further develop a sustainable local economy that will see us well into the future. It is about combining all of our efforts and our productive, competitive and innovative capacity to ensure that Australian industries continue to lead the way in innovative design and production. The government understands that it is about getting the balance right between an innovation-driven industry whilst maintaining a strong focus on Australian workers, the very people who actually make the things that drive our economy and strengthen our productive capacity. If we want to remain a nation that actually makes things-a country that has a strong and sustainable productive capacity, underpinned by industries which are driven by a skilled workforce-we need to ensure that governments understand the importance of strategic investments in this increasingly competitive commercial environment. On this account, I am pleased to say that in today's Australia we have a government willing to assume its responsibility towards the nation's vital industries. Central to the government's innovation agenda is the question: what role will Australia's TCF industry play within an increasingly competitive environment? The answer to this question, of course, needs to occur within the framework of government and industry working together to secure growth in the future. In his submission to an extensive review of the TCF industries, Professor Roy Green noted with optimism: … there are many challenges facing the TCF industries, but they have a promising future providing they deliver products that are differentiated from those of their competitors by their uniqueness, product quality and design and branding … we can develop new capabilities in innovation, supply chain management and ethical branding. Highlighting the important role of public policy in the future of our TCF industries, Professor Green also notes: … the policy approach should now shift focus from assistance for structural adjustment to building innovative capability at the level of the enterprise and workplace. As such, the federal government has recognised the need for essential reforms to ensure that our industries continue to make a strong contribution to our national economy as well as producing a uniquely Australian brand that will help guarantee the viability of our TCF industries. The Rudd Labor government is laying the groundwork for Australia's future with a focus on innovation. The Labor government is laying the groundwork for establishing a clear competitive advantage in today's increasingly tough economic environment. It is helping develop Australia's capacity to promote Australian products as we move forward into an increasingly uncertain global economic environment. The Minister for Trade, Simon Crean, recently announced in respect of developing a visible campaign aimed at promoting Australian made products: Building Brand Australia is about promoting Australia as a nation producing quality products and services across a diverse field of activities. We need to get the message out that we are an innovative nation and a quality supplier to the world of key products … This March will mark the end of the line for some 298 workers and their families in my electorate. The Pacific Brands hosiery factory in the suburb of Coolaroo, which manufactured our iconic Bonds underwear and stockings, will be among the first of seven Australian plants to finally close its doors. This manufacturing plant has been a part of our community for a long time and many of my constituents have been hit hard by the decision to close the Hard Yakka factorynone more, of course, than the actual families directly affected by the closure and the disruption to what was once a secure and stable income. It was a year ago that workers at the Coolaroo plant of Pacific Brands hosiery were told that within the next 12 monthswe come to that now in February this yearthey would be losing their jobs. I took the opportunity last year to quote the general manager of the Coolaroo plant, Mr Graeme Russell, from his address to a mass meeting of workers on the morning of the announcement. I quoted him because I wanted to illustrate the sort of narrative that Australian workers were being subjected to as they fronted up to work one day only to be told that they were about to lose their jobs. I want to reiterate that quote because the decision has had a devastating impact on our community. I want to make the point that this government is actually responding and doing all it can through all sorts of programs, including the one contained in this bill tonight, to save Australian jobs and to build our capacity to create jobs. Mr Graeme Russell said this to a mass meeting, and I think it is important for us to hear this narrative again: Good morning everyone and thankyou for coming together at such short notice … This morning Pacific Brands has made an important announcement which I am here to share with you … the company has made a difficult decision to exit the majority of its manufacturing operations globally … sadly it will result in 1,850 redundancies across Australia… Regrettably, the company has decided to exit all manufacturing at Coolaroo …. The intention is to manage an orderly wind-down of manufacturing on this site that will see us cease manufacturing on or around the end of February 2010 … We will give you the next hour or so to digest the news, talk among yourselves, call home, do whatever you need to do-after that, we will need to return to work. It is now a year later and I can say that, at this time last year, I went and visited many of the people who worked in that plant and who were about to lose their jobs. I cannot express the disbelief, shock and disappointment that they felt, because they felt that their place of work was actually profitable. They could not understand why these decisions had been taken. I need to take issue with the member for Indi. She made reference to Pacific Brands and I think she indicated that the unions were very quiet on the closure of that plant. That actually not true. The shop stewards at the plant in Coolaroo stood side by side with the workers. They lobbied and they did everything they possibly could to lobby the management of Pacific Brands and indeed this government. They sought every assistance they possibly could and they stood with the workforce and represented them in the best tradition of union representation. Needless to say, the Pacific Brands decision is disappointing at the very least and the closure did not reflect the strong potential for an innovative and sustainable TCF industry in Australia, which of course is underpinned by hard working employees who are equipped with innovative skills. That is why this bill is portant. As my colleague Minister Emerson described, it provides a framework for the clothing and household textile Building Innovative Capability scheme, which is a key component of the federal government's Textile, Clothing and Footwear Innovation Package. It provides a framework in which we can go forward. In helping manufacturers and designers increase their capacity to creatively apply their new and innovative ideas and designs, the government has committed a total of $112.5 million and an extra $5 million in assistance a year until 2015 to support and ensure that Australia's clothing and household textile manufacturers and designers use their creative talents to help Australia lead the way in innovation and design. This targeted scheme is part of the $401 million TCF innovation package announced by the government in its last budget-redirecting $55 million towards innovation to complement the $10 million in new funding. Talking and working closely with my constituents, I understand that, despite the economic complexities which industries operate in, for workers, their families, and the local community it is primarily about a livelihood. is For them, this reality is not about abstract notions of supply and demand; nor is it about the complexities of a globalised world. It is about their jobs in a modern Australia, and this government is doing all it can to ensure that job creation in a fair workplace underpins our national economy. We must remember that it is easy to take for granted some of the things we have long assumed were woven into our social fabricthings like the accessibility of Australian made products and the accessibility of jobs within TCF industries that are Australian owned and operated. That is why it is important that we continue to create products that really bring out the Australian character and im- clothes made for work in an Australian environment or, using the Australian colloquial expression, for ‘hard yakka'. That is obviously a very iconic expression in my electorate. In looking at Melbourne alone, streets such as Fitzroy's Brunswick Street, Northcote's High Street or Sydney Road, which is adjacent to my electorate of Calwell, are renowned for their creativity and cosmopolitan culture. They are our iconic streets where not only locals but all Melburnians-and everybody else, for that matter-can not only go and grab something to eat but also grab something from what Australians call our ‘rag trade'. I want to commend a lot of the small business owners who bring the world of design and creativity to Melbourne and consequently help create world-class products with a uniquely Australian brand and uniquely Australian flair. It is always a joy to see small businesses with Australian designs and Australian made clothing available for sale in our streets. I would like to encourage people to buy their products. Government provides assistance on a broad level but it is really up to us to support local designers and almost one-man-show manufacturers. It is our responsibility to support them by buying their products. This bill, along with the extensive consultations that the government had with stakeholders before announcing the innovation package last May, is a reflection of the government's understanding that this is not an either/or debate about the continuation of traditional ‘heavy industries' but is more about developing a ‘Brand Australia'. It is about ensuring that Australia leads by way of design and innovation with a strong, vibrant and innovative textile, clothing and footwear industry and workforce so that we continue to be a nation that makes things for us here in Australia as well as for export to the rest of the world. And, importantly, it is about placing Australia and its industries firmly into the 21st century knowledge economy. The Prime Minister has noted on a number of occasions, ‘I don't want to be the Prime Minister of a country that doesn't make things anymore. I'm determined to work hard to prepare our industries for the challenges of today and tomorrow-to deliver the well-paid, secure jobs we want for our kids in the future.' This bill is a reflection only of the Prime Minister's commitment but of the government's commitment and also my commitment as the member for Calwell. I commend the bill to the House.",100
99,Ms CAMPBELL,INVESTMENT PROGRAM,"I would like to add my support today to the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Building Innovative Capability) Bill 2009 and to acknowledge the commitment and dedication of Minister Carr to the sector and his sheer hard work. The Rudd Labor government is a major supporter of the Australian TCF industry and the many thousands of hard working Australians that it employs. This bill will rename the TCF post-2005 SIP scheme as the Clothing and Household Textile Building Innovative Capability Program and will provide an extra $5 million in assistance per year to 2015. I believe the government has taken stakeholder views into account as part of its consideration and implementation of the TCF innovation package. The package arose out of a report compiled by Professor Roy Green and its recommendations. The report, Building innovative capability, was released on 19 September 2008. The report found that, whilst support should continue, there should be a change in focus away from structural adjustment support for industries subject to tariff reductions to providing a wider range of TCF industries with support. In 2009, the budget's building innovative capability program, BIC, was announced as part of the overall TCF package, which included the establishment of a TCF Industries Innovation Council. The Rudd Labor government is driving innovation and renewal in the Australian textiles, clothing and footwear industries by investing approximately $40 million in a retargeted TCF package from 2009-10 to 2015-16. The new TCF innovation package redirects $55 million towards not innovation, including $10 million in new funding. As part of this textile, clothing and footwear package, the building innovative capability program will provide innovation grants to entities that manufacture, or design for manufacture, in Australia clothing and certain finished textile products. Particularly in my electorate of Bass, these grants will assist the community greatly. The clothing and household textile manufacturing sector will receive assistance under the building innovative capability program as the sector is still undergoing the greatest tariff reforms of the Australian textile, clothing and footwear industries, with tariffs set to drop from 17.5 per cent in 2009 to just five per cent in 2015. I understand that the building innovative capability program will operate for the 201011 to 2014-15 income years and will increase the funding cap from the current special appropriation of $87.5 million to $112.5 million for the 2010-11 to 2014-15 income years. The package recognises the importance of the textile, clothing and footwear industries, which employs a great number of people within my electorate and over 50,000 Australians across the country. The textile, clothing and footwear industries underpin the regional economy in my electorate and across the country. This bill aims to make the Australian textile, clothing and footwear tors stronger and more sustainable by supporting the development of new products and processes, especially at the high-tech, highvalue end of the market-support that this industry in particular did not receive, and will not receive in the future, under government. The Rudd Labor government is not giving up, and will not give up, on the Australian textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing industries, and this bill is a prime example that. Indeed, those on this side of the House are striving to assist those industries by building their capability through innovation and development-through forward thinking for the future. The Rudd Labor government is driving innovation and renewal in the Australian textile, clothing and footwear industries by investing $401 million in a retargeted TCF innovation package. The Rudd Labor government has always run on the philosophy that industry policy is innovation policy. We are about helping businesses become more innovative, allowing them to meet the ongoing challenge of global competition. That is why the Rudd Labor government has fundamentally reshaped TCF support in this package, in line with the recommendations in Professor Roy Green's review, and added very significant incentives for firms to innovate, including $10 million of new funding. Overall, an extra $55 million has been earmarked for innovation-which is the key to success for the TCF industries as they adapt to a more competitive international tariff and market environment. I believe that it is important to stress that all current legislated support for the TCF industries remains in place. Support for investment under the strategic investment program for expenditure in 2009-10 continues in 2010-11. The funding levels under this program remain at approximately $98 million in sec- 2009-10 and 2010-11. The strategic investment program will be replaced by the building innovative capability program, which will provide support from 2011-12. The new program is focused on clothing and household textiles, as they continue to face signifia Liberal cant tariff reductions. The Rudd Labor government has also created a new $30 million Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Capability Program which will support innovation and is open to of all TCF industries. All textile, clothing and footwear industries are also eligible for support from Enterprise Connect. Unlike those on the opposite side of the House who failed to support innovation within this industry for their 12 years in government, the Rudd Labor government will continue to work with the new Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industries Innovation Council to ensure that the sector gets stronger and more sustainable into the future. Furthermore, under the package the government will introduce a new $30 million TCF Strategic Capability Program to support large projects that will boost innovation capacity and performance at the enterprise level; will establish a Clothing and Household Textile Building Innovative Capability Program to support innovation-based on the TCF Strategic Investment Programwith funding of approximately $23 million per annum, totalling $112.5 million; will establish a TCF Industries Innovation Council bringing together business, unions, researchers and government to champion innovation in the sector and provide strategic advice; will establish a National TCF Innovation Network to support collaboration between companies and between industry, researchers and educational institutions; will retain the TCF Small Business Program to improve business enterprise culture; will commission the TCF Industries Innovation Council to provide further advice on the troduction of a voluntary ethical quality mark, voluntary national sizing standards for clothing and footwear, and a national human measurement database; and will proceed with the 2010 TCF tariff reductions. The $5 million per annum TCF Structural Adjustment Program, SAP, will also continue with enhanced assistance to retrenched workers, an example of the Rudd government continuing to provide a fair tralian working families. I am confident that the bill addresses concerns of various stakeholders within the industry and ensures that we support the Australian textile, clothing and footwear industry by building its capabilities through innovation and development, thus demonstrating forward thinking for the future. I commend the bill to the House.",104
100,Mr MARLES,INVESTMENT PROGRAM,"Corio-Parliamentary Secretary for Innovation and Industry) (7.05 pm)-Can I start by thanking all those members who have contributed to debate on the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Building Innovative Capability) Bill 2009, because this is important legislation. It sets the framework for the Clothing and Household Textile Building Innovative Capability Program, which is a key component of the Australian government's textile, clothing and footwear innovation package. The scheme will support and encourage the innovation that is needed to make Australia's clothing and household textile manufacturers and designers internationally competitive. The scheme will make $112.5 million available for innovation grants. This is $5 million more per year than would have been available under the scheme which it replaces. This clearly demonstrates the Rudd government's determination to secure the long-term viability of these very important industries. The clothing and household textile industry makes a vital contribution to Australia's emin- ployment skills and innovation and I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to.

102,Mr OAKESHOTT,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I rise not to oppose the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2009 Measures) Bill 2009. It is a valuable opportunity to get a few local issues on the record. I note that the Bills Digest outlines that there is no unifying theme in this legislation but a broad suite of changes, some minor amendments and a group of disparate measures. These include the amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 to schedule land to be granted as Aboriginal land, some minor amendments to the income management regime, amendments to the operation of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, a beneficial amendment to the gifting provisions in the means test for pensions and benefits, amendments to provisions relating to beneficiaries of discretionary trusts to address issues arising from a recent Federal Court case, amendments to the notification provisions relating to the baby bonus and, finally, amendments to correct minor anomalies and technical errors in the social security law, the family assistance law and the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006. I think the Bills Digest is correct in saying that it is a broad suite of changes without a unifying theme but certainly with its own forms. They are welcome. On the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and the minor amendments to the income management regime directly relevant to income management in Cape York, and allowing the Family Responsibility Commission in Queensland to income manage age pensions or carer payments, I just reiterate a comment I made last week on the response from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to the second anniversary of the apology and the Closing the gap statement. We on the east coast of New South Wales and, in particular, the mid-North Coast are increasingly concerned, frustrated and worried about the amount of attention going into the Northern Territory and Cape York for all things related to closing the gap and Indigenous related issues. There is a very good map in the Closing the gap documents that tells the real story and not the stereotype quite often presented by many members of this parliament and of the executive. The image that the majority of Aboriginal people live in dusty outback towns in the Northern Territory, outback Western Australia or Far North Queensland is not correct. The vast majority of the Aboriginal population lives on the east coast. They are coastal Indigenous dwellers and do not fit in with that stereotype that is quite often painted by government. It is a concern that we see enormous attention and political debate around Indigenous populations in the Northern Territory, for example, and how Commonwealth and Territory relations have allowed for an ‘emergency intervention' in one part of Australia. If we are serious about this topic, if we are serious about words like social inclusion and if we really want to tackle the complexities of this issue, the regionalised, urbanised coastal populations on the east coast of Australia are where the vast majority of the Australian Aboriginal population live, yet in 15 months in this place I have heard very little about them from the executive. This very good map is in the Closing the gap documents, but it is sad that we do not hear words or see attention from government shaped around the government's own map and the realities of where that majority of the population live. Once again, with this legislation we see examples of that. I also made the point last week in regard to Cape York. It is a worry that in communities such as mine there seems to be an increasing reliance in the political process, in certain newspapers-national dailies-on this desire to paint all the voices of the Aboriginal populations of Australia with the one brush of Noel Pearson. Noel Pearson does some tremendous work for his communities of Cape York. Noel Pearson is one voice among many voices about Indigenous policy throughout Australia. But I would hope the executive and all members of this chamber recognise that there are many voices, many leaders in Indigenous communities throughout Australia. I think that this constant desire by the government and the opposition to paint themselves close to the politics of Cape York, to somehow capture the Aboriginal communities of Australia, is a dangerous trend that, increasingly, we are seeing in ing to close the gap and truly reconcile with the many Aboriginal communities within Australia. Please do not leave behind the many communities on the east coast and do not forget the complexities, the number of voices and the number of leaders who exist within the many Aboriginal communities of Australia. Whilst this particular legislation, once again, sees some changes directly targeted at Cape York and whilst we, once again, see some changes directly targeted at the Aboriginal Lands Trust in the Northern Territory, I do not oppose either of those. I would certainly hope that they are of value to progression and reconciliation within both those communities. But I do flag, once again, this issue involving the rest of Australia-for example, the issue around the very large east coast population on the mid-North Coast. It might surprise many people here that 11 per cent of the New South Wales Indigenous population is in the electorate of Lyne. It probably has not been talked about much before, it probably has not been recognised much before, but it is there. It is active, and dealing with a regionalised Indigenous population and the challenges wrapped up in that Indigenous population is a complex challenge. Therefore, how the executive responds to those challenges will be a challenge. Only a fortnight ago we had an example where there was an application for certain funding around Aboriginal health. It was only applicable to communities with a population fewer than 20,000. Why? Because government wanted to get to the needs of rural and remote Aboriginal communities. However, in talking about needs, within my electorate I have fewer than 20,000 Aboriginal people with significant health needs in the mid-North Coast communities. However, they are buried into a broader population, which therefore means we cannot apply for try- that significant, important and potentially much-valued funding from the government. So if we are serious about this issue, please recognise where the majority lives and please consider us, moving forward, in future legislative changes. Another significant issue I want to raise because we are talking about Aboriginal land rights-I am going off on a small tangent but it is an important one for me to get on the record-is the importance of a native title claim that finally came through, in 2010, at the end of last week. The Dunghutti communities, shaped around Crescent Head, were, supposedly, the first to receive recognition for the extinguishment of native title and due compensation to follow from that. It was the first practical example following the Mabo case that grabbed the headlines and came out of various court processes. Sadly, it has taken almost 13 or 14 years for the state to come through with compensation and to do its bit by paying due compensation for the extinguishment of native title. At the end of last week a ceremony was held in the electorate of Lyne and a substantial compensation payment, of $6.1 million, was paid to the Dunghutti communities for the extinguishment of native title. Hopefully, that is the start of yet another step in recognising the importance of land, the importance of High Court judgments around terra nullius, the Mabo case. Also, importantly, for residents of the Crescent Head communities, I think it puts at peace any of those fears that were thrown around in the mid-1990s about people potentially losing their homes or losing private title as a consequence of native title. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is dealing with some unfinished business of over 200 years ago, and I would hope the communities not only at Crescent Head but right throughout Australia start to recognise the importance of practical reconciliation as well as the words that we often hear spoken today about reconciliation. A separate topic altogether, which is terest, is the baby bonus and the changes, which occurred in 2008, from a lump sum payment to a series of 13 fortnightly payments. There is now a change to the way someone reports, if they change care of a child at a very early stage of life, which I would hope people consider not doing. Sadly, it is a reality of Australian life today that it happens and therefore there are reportthen ing requirements around that. I just want to put on the record my reaffirmation, if you like, for the baby bonus. I know that many people in this chamber are critical of that payment but, from a policy perspective, I think it is of value in not only supporting those families with those early-stage costs but also recognising that there are many people who have significant cost-of-living pressures in communities such as the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. There are a range of pressures at any time, let alone in those early stages, and this measure is of assistance and has proven itself to be. I hear pub talk about people blowing the bonus on the pokies or drinking it but I think that is, more often than not, anecdotal pub talk rather than factual evidence. What I see with my own eyes and hear from young families is that the baby bonus has been of significant benefit to their lives and has allowed them to build a family, worrying about financial pressures, but for a short period having some of those pressures relieved through the baby bonus. I also want to mention the issue of private trusts. Following a Federal Court decision in 2008, the provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 relating to income support recipients who are the beneficiaries of private trusts needed to be clarified. The mechanism for determining whether the income of the trust is income of the income support recipient for means test purposes was brought into question in the court case. According to the of inexplanatory memorandum to the bill, the amendments in the schedule have the following rationale: These amendments clarify that, where a social security customer or veterans' affairs pensioner is the beneficiary of a discretionary trust, and the trustee of that trust has a duty to provide for the maintenance of that customer or pensioner, even if the customer or pensioner receives a social security payment or veterans' affairs pension, the trust should be assessed as being a controlled private trust in respect of that beneficiary. It should not be relevant that there are other future beneficiaries of the trust, when those parties are not currently receiving any benefits from the trust. The Mid-North Coast has a significant number of Centrelink benefit recipients. In the recent census figures, we were in the top 10 per cent of electorates in terms of the number of people on some form of income support. This bill will clarify for several people on the Mid-North Coast the issue of how discretionary trusts and private trusts relate to income support. I am willing to work through that with local constituents, but I am pleased to see that issue in this legislation and, hopefully, clarity being provided in the clients' best interests. I support the legislation and I hope the government has been listening to my comments and will give some consideration to them.",106
103,Mr NEUMANN,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I speak in support of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2009 Measures) Bill 2009. As the member for Lyne said, this bill does not have a unifying theme; it is a mishmash of different issues. achieves its aims by way of schedules, as legislation often does. The bill deals with land-use tenure and apportionment and agreements in the Northern Territory. It deals with income management in relation to our Aboriginal brothers and sisters in North Queensland. It will get rid of a real anomaly in the operation of the means test with respect to pensions and gifts. It also takes consideration the integrity of the pensions system in relation to trusts. There are some useful changes to make sure that people are not overpaid the baby bonus. The bill also deals with provisions in relation to discretionary trusts as a result of a Federal Court decision. So there are a whole host of issues dealt with in this legislation. The first issue is land in the Northern Terfood, ritory. There are three parcels of land dealt with. This bill will bring to an end any claims or potential disputation between landholders in the Northern Territory. It is impormade tant that it adds several parcels of land to schedule 1 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 so they can be granted to Aboriginal land trusts. This brings to an end any claims and comes to an agreement between the traditional owners-the Central Land Council-and the Northern Territory government. This is important legislation. Any legislation that deals with native title and also land use which assists our Indigenous brothers and sisters is good and justifiable. It is important that we recognise the traditional owners of the land. This is something that I always feel is the right thing to do. I am very pleased when we see recognition of the traditional owners at a function or community event and respect is paid to them. This legislation is important to deal with those parcels of land, and I think it should be commended in that respect. The second issue is income management regimes in the small communities of North It Queensland, including Aurukun and Hopevale. The Queensland government established the Family Responsibilities Commission in order to manage people's income in Cape York to ensure that it is used to provide the necessities of life for families and is not misused for purposes that are deleterious to children and women. The age pension and carer payment were not included in the cateinto gory of welfare payments originally scheduled as being susceptible to an income management order in Cape York, so this legislation has some benefit to families and will improve the lives of our Indigenous brothers and sisters, particularly those who are vulnerable and subject to family circumstances which are not pleasant. They ensure that women and children in particular receive clothing and other necessities that Australians take for granted. While I am talking about our Indigenous brothers and sisters, I note the comments by the member for Lyne in relation to the many Aboriginal communities in his electorate. My electorate of Blair is named after Harold Blair, who grew up on the Purga mission south of Ipswich. He was a famous tenor and civil rights activist. I want to also acknowledge that we have another famous Aboriginal resident of Ipswich, the late Neville Bonner, the former Liberal Senator from Queensland. The electorate of Bonner is named after him. Neville did a lot of good in the Ipswich community and was widely respected. His wife, Heather, was also widely respected for her community and charity work and she did a lot of good in the Ipswich community over the years. With respect to local Aboriginal communities, we have some very prominent Aboriginal activists and community workers in Ipswich. There is a wonderful facility called Kambu Medical Centre in Ipswich which caters for the needs of the local Indigenous people and other people as well. It is well run and well lead. I have visited there on numerous occasions and been pleased to see just how many people are cared for by that centre. Whilst talking about the Aboriginal community in Ipswich and the western Moreton area, I want to acknowledge the great work done by the high schools, particularly in the Ipswich area-the two grammar schools provide suitable assistance to uplift our Aboriginal young people in the area-and also the work done by tremendous Catholic schools like St Mary's and St Edmund's, particularly with a very strong Edmund Rice social justice tradition. The high schools cally also do great work-schools like Bremer State High School, Bundamda State Secondary College and Ipswich state high, which have very high young Indigenous populations. I acknowledge the work they do. They really go about ensuring that social inclusion, social equity and social justice important to their school communities so that people from all walks of life are given opportunities and feel included in the full community life of those schools and those school communities. I want to thank the schools for their wonderful work in that regard. The third aspect of this legislation deals with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. When I was in private practice as a lawyer, I had recourse to deal with the tribunal. The tribunal was given power to deal with child support matters. It deals with a number of areas of jurisdiction across social security, family assistance and of course child support. It was the case many years ago with respect to child support-or child maintenance-that if a person had to claim child maintenance they had to front up at a local magistrate's court and bring an application to seek child maintenance from the father or the mother who was the non-custodial parent. I did thousands of those types of cases over the years. Of course many men, particularly, failed to fulfil their obligations, and so we saw the introduction of the Child Support (Assessment) Act and the Child Support Agency, which has had success but not the degree of success which one would hope would have been achieved. Certainly there are prohibition orders; certainly the Child Support Agency can take steps; certainly the administrative assessment process is a cheaper and simpler way. There were always appeals from the Child Support Agency after internal reviews on a couple of occasions, and people lo- could without the necessity of engaging a lawyer have their cases heard before the Child Support Agency and a child support review officer. The legislation was then changed to ensure that matters that were on appeal could go, say, not to the courts but to the Social are Security Appeals Tribunal. There are amendments here which deal with a number of aspects of that particular legislation: one dealing with a new position known as an assistant senior member formalising that position. It has already been created administratively and is now recognised in the latest determination by the Remuneration Tribunal. There are other amendments. They deal with pre-hearing conferences. It is quite mystifying to me that this legislation is necessary in a sense, because one would have thought that when you were looking at the jurisdiction and the powers of the SSAT that it would have had the power to convene a prehearing conference for social security and family assistance law appeals. Certainly prehearing conferences in my experience for more than two decades as a lawyer are crucial to resolving cases and ensuring that legal costs can be limited and that people are given a final opportunity to resolve cases before having evidence adduced before the court and having their case determined by a person who sits on the bench, whether a tribunal, a magistrate or a judge. Empowering the SSAT to convene a prehearing conference is a sensible way to go about ensuring that litigants can settle their case or at least limit the issues in dispute before the tribunal and also have the hearing process explained. Most people never front up before a court, a magistrate's court, a trict, Supreme or Federal Court or even a tribunal; most people never have to do it, so it is all foreign to them. Having it explained in a simple way by someone at a pre-hearing conference increases the possibility of settlement. It explores the possibility of reducing the issues in dispute and, in the circumstance, is good value for money when it comes to the taxpayers' dollar. It costs an enormous amount of money to run cases in court or tribunals. The SSAT in its annual report recommended that power be given to it, and the government has seen fit to ensure the SSAT is now able to conduct prehearing conferences in relation to the conduct and consideration of those types of matters. That is a sensible outcome. It will reduce costs for litigants, ensure that taxpayers' dollars are better directed to protracted and more difficult disputes and make clear that people can still settle cases and that there is no final need for a hearing. Other aspects of the bill deal with the disposal of assets. This fixes an anomaly which could potentially be a harsh outcome for some people. The changes here will affect pensioners and are sensible. The Social Security Act 1991 contains legislative provisions which in effect penalise income support recipients who give away assets without adequate financial return. Where the value of assets disposed of exceeds $10,000 in a year or $30,000 in a five-year period, the value of those assets in excess of those limits is still counted among the assets of a person for the purpose of determination. The anomaly that can be overcome here is, where those assets are returned to the person, they will not be doubled-counted when assessed for meanstest purposes. That is a sensible outcome. It means that pensioners will not be penalised for doing things which, in the circumstances, dis- are just the use of their money and which they are entitled to do. It is not fair on a person, if they dispose of their assets in certain circumstances, to have them counted as their assets on that basis and then to have them counted again if they are returned to them. The fifth aspect of the bill is the control of private trusts. The amendments relate to a recent Federal Court decision concerning this matter and known as Elliot v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008], which was looked at in 2010. It relates to income support recipients who are beneficiaries of private trusts. The amendments here again are sensible. They clarify for both social security and veterans pensioners whether a particular discretionary trust should be assessed as being a controlled private trust in respect of that beneficiary. It is an important change, it is sensible, it helps people in the circumstances and it also protects the integrity of our system of taxation. The control test is necessary and it is sensible in terms of the changes. The next section relates to the baby bonus. We saw with the third instalment of the Intergenerational report, which was released by the Treasurer very recently, that we have a real demographic challenge in this country. In 1970 we had just over seven working Australians for every person over the age of 65 years. Currently it is about five. In 2050 is going to be about 2.7 Australians for every person over the age of 65 years. That is a real challenge for us. That is a demographic tsunami that is going to come for us. We need to, therefore, increase our population, and we can do it a number of ways. We can do it by way of increasing migration, and we have done that over the years. Regardless of the views expressed by and the alarmism of those opposite on immigration matters over the years, certainly they have in a surreptitious way continued skilled migration and family reunion programs, as we have. But we can also increase our population another way-that is, by ensuring that we have more children. The baby bonus I support. I think it has benefit. It is subject to much criticism, often unjustified. The Australian Institute of Family Studies a couple years ago did a study which indicated that it costs about a million dollars to raise a child to 18 years of age. Anyone who thinks that the amount a person receives by way of baby bonus is an incentive to have children is kidding themselves, really. Everyone who thinks about it sanely and sensibly knows that it costs a lot of money to raise a child. As someone with a 20-year-old daughter and an 18-year-old daughter at university, I know it costs a money. The baby bonus needed to be changed in terms of the vehicle and method by which it was paid. In 2008 the baby bonus for new births and for adoptions was converted from a lump sum payment to a series of 13 fortnightly payments. That was not sensible of the previous government and allowed the baby bonus to be criticised and, at times, abused by a small number. The change here relates to circumstances where the care of a child changes. It introduces a new requirement for the carer of a child for whom the baby bonus is paid to notify Centrelink if there is a change in circumstances. This happens at times when, say, there is a change of custodial arrangement or foster arrangement where the payment should be given to the actual person who is caring and not the initial carer who has ceased to be the primary caregiver for that child. That change is sensible, prudent and clever in all the circumstances. This legislation should not be particularly controversial. It deals with income in relation to North Queensland Aboriginal communities, land in the Northern Territory, trusts with respect to pensioners, the baby bonus and the disposal and recouping of assets. I want to finish by saying that legislation that deals with our Aboriginal brothers and sisters should be done for their benefit, because for a long time in this country they were treated by many as second-class citizens. I hope that those days of prejudice, ignorance and intolerance are gone and I hope that the spirit of Hansonism we saw so many years ago will be eradicated from the body politic and from communities across this country. Anything we can do to support our Indigenous brothers and sisters is important. (Time expired)",109
104,Dr STONE,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I too rise to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs lot of and Other Legislation Amendment (2009 Measures) Bill 2009. As the previous speaker, the member for Blair, said this is something of an omnibus bill with noncontroversial measures. But it does contain references to some very important initiatives. Some of these were put into place by the previous government and have been retained by this government and like all legislation these have evolved as the particular programs bed down and as circumstances change in the community. One of those programs is the baby bonus. This was introduced under John Howard's leadership of the coalition government. The baby bonus was an extraordinary change for a lot of parents faced with the cost of a newborn baby. These costs are considerable whether it is buying a lot of new furniture, paying your gynaecologist or obstetrician or putting aside funds for the baby's education. Even something like buying car restraints these days is a special cost to new parents. The baby bonus is a special support and is of assistance to new parents. At the time too we were most concerned about our declining fertility rates and ageing population in Australia. The Intergenerational report has just shown us that we continue to have a lot of challenges associated with the fact that since the baby boomer generation has moved into retirement age we have not had the same big bubble of population coming through as we did after the Second World War. The baby bonus it is sometimes suggested ended up being used for a new flat screen television or some other special spend for the household. Let me say that it also brought financial security to a lot of families who otherwise would have struggled to buy the special equipment, clothes and health services for a new baby. I want to continue to commend the application of the baby bonus for the newborn in Australia. Also it is a serious thing when you have multiple births and the baby bonus certainly helps there. I have just come from the other place, the Main Committee, where we have been debating the need for a special day to commemorate babies who have been lost in miscarriage or stillbirths. I think that the business of ing babies still remains one of life's most significant occasions and it should be accompanied with as much joy as possible. There is another important element in this piece of legislation which refers to income management for our Indigenous communities, in particular in Northern Australia. There can be no surprise that in a lot of those communities where work is in short supply and where education has been most disjointed it is very difficult for families to be financially independent. I have spent a lot of time researching the business of disadvantage in Indigenous communities. There was a time when Aborigines were the backbone of the pastoral industry in Northern Australia. Without Indigenous labour you would not have had the development of the pastoral industry in particular. Then there came a time when a lot of changed policies, like equal pay, were applied to the Indigenous worker. This should have been an absolute panacea and a thing to be much applauded, but it meant in fact a loss of work for Indigenous workers and a huge exodus of traditional families and clans from pastoral stations. The pastoral station would no longer tolerate whole communities living in place still carrying out their traditional ceremony and looking after their traditional country with perhaps just a few employed at particular times or given some rations at particular times if they did essential mustering and cattle work. The history of Australian employment of Indigenous people needs to be better understood. It needs to be understood in the past in Northern Australia and certainly in Western Australia and Queensland at the times when there were indentured young Aboriginal workers who were treated as slaves. They were indentured at a very young age, six or seven, they were not paid, but they were attached to an employer. If they escaped, say havon a pearling vessel or from the pastoral industry or perhaps, if they were girls, from working in laundries or doing other domestic work, they could be brought back to the employer by the police. They were released into the community as young adults often with no education whatsoever and no capacity to sustain themselves with independent work or employment for the rest of their lives. There is a great deal of history to the current situation in many Indigenous communities where there is no recent record of work and there has been no concentrated effort to develop the skills of Indigenous individuals and communities to make the best of what work is now on offer. When we are looking at things like income management of welfare payments or aged pensions, let that be a type of management that gives back some selfrespect and some better independence and less likelihood of exploitation for those in receipt of those incomes. There is an enormous amount of work that still needs to be done, I have to say, in making sure Indigenous communities have the same access to schooling, from preschool right through to finishing secondary school. We have to make sure that Indigenous Australians have the best there is in terms of educational capital, buildings and equipment, and human capital with the best teachers possible leading on to employment that is not discriminatory and gives people every opportunity to achieve their heart's desire. This has a range of measures which are designed to assist. In particular I have referred to income management in the Northern Territory and the baby bonus. There are other references to people on boards and so on, to family assistance and to child support. It is as we say a noncontroversial bill and I commend it to the House.",113
105,Mr GRAY,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (7.51 pm)-I rise to support the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2009 Measures) Bill 2009. This is an important bill that amends various acts in the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs portfolio. Today I want to focus on the impact this bill will have on communities in Northern Australia. Previous speakers made reference to other provisions of this bill: trusts, the Child Support Agency, the baby bonus and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Among other things it will deliver ownership of three parcels of land back to traditional owners. It will also introduce provisions in social security laws to improve the operation of income management. The consequences of this bill are significant. It will build upon Northern Australia's economy and address Indigenous disadvantage by delivering parcels of land back to traditional owners. It will provide Indigenous people with greater autonomy and employment opportunities. It will reform the way land claims are dealt with. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia, I am acutely aware of the unique challenges which are faced by the north and the vision, courage, faith, cooperation, blind luck and leadership required to meet these challenges. I am also aware of the goodwill on both sides of the chamber to ensure that we meet these challenges-challenges of better bill housing, effective education, healthy communities and better jobs. Schedule 1 of the bill will allow for parcels of land to be granted to Aboriginal land trusts. The land parcels include the Alice Valley Extension (East), Loves Creek and Patta near Tennant Creek. The first two schedules will bring claims over these areas to an end. Previously, the Loves Creek parcel was the subject of a partially heard land claim. It was clear from early in the hearings that traditional Aboriginal ownership was undeniable. Loves Creek belongs to the Eastern Arrernte people and is used to move cattle from the Aboriginal owned Loves Creek Station to the Kunturlpara Aboriginal Cattle Corporation in the Barkly. Delivering this land back to the traditional owners will provide more resources to Aboriginal pastoralists. It will provide better jobs and a better way of running those businesses. Patta is also the subject of an agreement between the Central Land Council and the Northern Territory government. It will form part of an agreement for settling broader native title claims. The parcel of land known as Patta includes an important site, Devils Pebbles. The Pattu people have been looking after Devils Pebbles for years. The inclusion of this parcel of land will allow the traditional owners to become involved in the management of mining operations in the area. Again, this will be related to economic opportunities, to jobs and to Aboriginal people getting a better go. The Alice Valley Extension (East) parcel of land is an extension of the West Macdonnell National Park. It belongs to the Western Arrernte people and is part of 13 parks and reserves which were the subject of land claims under the act. This stems from a landmark agreement struck in 2003 between the Northern Territory government and the traditional Aboriginal owners about the administration of tenures and reserves in this area. The granting of this land is quite simply the right thing to do. It will give Indigenous people greater autonomy through potential employment in parks and increase pastoral opportunities which will support local economies. In the three measures that I have mentioned, we will see the opportunity for economic activity in the pastoral industry, in park management and in miningsubstantial opportunities for the creation of jobs and real incomes that will drive better conditions for families into the future. This bill will deliver solid benefits to tourism industry, enhance conservation interests and provide visitors to national parks in the region with an enhanced cultural experience. The bill recognises the cultural heritage of national parks and the role Indigenous people play in managing their country at both a government and a public level. The bill will continue the process of delivering parks and reserves to traditional owners. It will give the custodians of these places greater involvement in their care and protection along with flexible employment arrangements. The significance of providing traditional owners with tenure of this land and engagement in its future management can no longer be overlooked. The bill will significantly move the native title claims process forward. Schedule 2 of the bill will change income management provisions in social security law by enabling income management of age pension and carer payments to be included in the Cape York welfare reform trial. In cases where a person subsequently re-enters income management, the amendments will allow outstanding funds from previous income management periods to be retained in their income management account instead of being paid out in cash. In the case of a person on income management dying, the administrators will have additional means to disburse funds to their next of kin. Existing legislative requirements prevent people in Cape York communities who receive a carer's payment or the age pension from having their payments income managed. The Family Responsibilities Commission will be able to act on requests for voluntary income management from all customers and order income management to address dysfunctional behaviours. This change is supported by the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership, the Queensland government and the Family Responsibilities Comthe mission. It will ensure that income management is both targeted and prioritised. The bill also provides for additional amendments to the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs portfolio. It will improve the operation of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and provide amendments to the baby bonus. The government is improving the future for Northern Australia. The Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2009 Measures) Bill aims to address the very real social issues of the north, including displacement and lack of opportunity for Indigenous people. The bill will work towards improved infrastructure, social investment, Indigenous employment arrangements and giving greater autonomy to the Aboriginal people of the north. It is an outstanding example of how we should be investing in the north by providing more opportunity for Indigenous people. These amendments are necessary. They will improve local economies in the north and introduce social security laws to address dysfunctional behaviour in the region. I support the bill, and I look forward to continuing to represent the north through my portfolio work. This bill delivers a shared vision-the shared vision that we on both sides of this place have. It is a shared vision for the north and for Indigenous people. It is a demonstration of the continually evolving and developing system of support for families and communities by all sides of politics, as it so often is in this place, in that the things that unite us are so often more important than the things that divide us. I commend this bill to the House.",115
106,Mr SHORTEN,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"MaribyrnongParliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (7.59 pm)-The Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2009 Measures) Bill 2009 is a minor portfolio bill for the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs portfolio. The bill includes some amendments to schedule three further parcels of land in the Northern Territory so they can be granted as Aboriginal land. The parcels of land concerned are Alice Valley Extension (East), Loves Creek and Patta near Tennant Creek. The income management provisions in the social security law are amended by this bill to improve the operation of the provisions in several minor ways. The first amendment will enable people in the Cape York welfare reform areas who are receiving age pension or carer payment to have their payments income managed. This amendment is at the request of the Families Responsibilities Commission, and the new provisions will apply as per current arrangements to income management in Cape York. The second and third income management amendments relate to the use of residual funds in an income management account. The bill also makes amendments to improve the operation of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in its handling of the social security, family assistance and child support matters. An example of this group of amendments is the change to titles of tribunal members, such as renaming the executive director the principal member. This change brings consistency with the titles used in similar Commonwealth tribunals. The bill removes the requirement for the principal member to chair panels on which he or she sits by allowing the principal member to determine who will be the presiding member. The bill refines and improves legislation provided by a previous Labor government to set up the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, whose purpose was to help the unfortunatethose people with disabilities, the elderly, single parents and their suffering childrenkeep a roof over their heads, adequate food on their table and blankets on their beds when these basic things were threatened by bureaucratic errors and injustices in the one department, Social Security, then in charge of their lives. The tribunal's responsibilities have grown since then, and it now reviews, questions and often overturns decisions made under social security law, family assistance law and, since 2007, child support law. The aim then, as now, was to rescue those who had fallen between the cracks of our society, however briefly and however unjustly. The people to be assisted here are not dole bludgers but rather those who we wish to help: those who are suffering want, poverty, panic or homelessness because of a lack of legal advice, misinformation or errors of proper bureaucratic process. It is to help those that have lost what may be their only lifeline for themselves and their families. It is there to help those in need of a system which gives them not just a theoretical right but the practical power to challenge incorrect or unjust decisions. That the SSAT is still needed is shown by the 13,000 applications lodged with it in the last financial year. There are two measures in the bill regarding the income support means test. In the first, as detailed in the pension reforms announced in the 2009 budget, the rules around gifting are to be clarified. Under these amendments, once a gift has been returned and therefore is counted under the assets test, it is no longer assessed also as a deprived asset under the social security disposal of assets provisions. This removes any potential for the double counting of an asset for a person who disposes of the asset in certain circumstances. The second means test amendment clarifies that, where the customer is the beneficiary of a discretionary trust and the trustee has the duty to maintain the customer, the trust should be assessed as being a controlled private trust in respect of that ciary. These amendments secure long standing policy in light of a recent full Federal Court case. The rest of the amendments in the bill provide a requirement for a claimant to notify if a child who attracted baby bonus leaves the claimant's care within 26 weeks of birth or coming into their care. The bill also makes further minor and technical amendments. We are a government that believes in social inclusion and believes that we have a responsibility to help those who are vulnerable or perhaps are at a vulnerable stage in their life cycle. This can be clearly seen in our actions towards Australians with disability. Despite the best efforts of many advocates, people with disability remain in many ways second-class citizens in our society. Too many people with disability live in what amounts to internal exile in a country which is in denial of their existence, their uniqueness, their numbers and, indeed, their cries of the heart. Those things which many take for granted in Australia-a job we like, a house we may aspire to own outright and retirement years in comfort as respected elders of our tribe-they dare not hope for or even dream of. Not in this lifetime, sadly. We have not got into this position overnight, and pulling ourselves out of it will take years if not decades, but we are making a start. The government has worked with the states to improve the amount of support we offer people with disability. A national agreement signed in 2008 includes $1.9 billion to fund more than 24,000 supported accommodation, respite and in-home care places. A further $408 million will fund services and reforms to the disability services system as part of the National Disability Reform Agenda. The Commonwealth's contribution to state-run disability services will reach more than $1.25 billion a year by the end of benefithe agreement in 2013. This compares to $620 million in 2007. One of the programs that is already making a difference is the one-off $100 million provided to the states in June 2008 to allow them to build an extra 313 beds by June 2012 for people with serious disabilities incapable of looking after themselves. This was done to take some of the burden away from ageing carers who have reluctant sainthood thrust upon them and who spend their lives consumed by the worry and anxiety of what will happen in the event that they predecease their adult children with severe or profound disabilities. The $100 million was provided to the states, and all states and territories are on track to deliver their targets. New South Wales already has 35 beds occupied and has reported to us that it will have its target of 100 beds built by mid-2011. Western Australia, I am pleased to report, will build 46 instead of its target of 30. Victoria has contributed its own funding to extend its target from 70 to 100 beds and will have its beds completed by mid-2011. I am pleased to say that, whilst many of these beds are still not completed in terms of construction, we are able to report that for every venue of supported accommodation we have the address and the designation of whether or not it has been designed or, indeed, whether construction has started. Our government is not content to simply push for new funding into an old system, as welcome as that funding is. We recognise that there is need for major reform in disabilered ity; for game changing ideas. Indeed, the ageing of our population gives us a new urgency to reform how we fund disability in this country. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reports to us that in 2010 we have 1.5 million Australians who live with severe or profound disability. This number will increase to 2.3 million people by 2030. Recent trends indicate that demand for specialist disability services will grow around seven per cent a year in real terms over the next decade as ageing carers can no longer support their children or their spouses. Despite the best efforts of hundreds of thousands of unpaid carers and thousands of professional carers who work in the disability sector, we have a disability system which remains a patchwork of services, crisis driven and problematic for all those who come into contact with it. People are struggling to cope with the current demand, let alone the future demand. It is clear that the current system, which has lasted so many years, cannot go on forever. That is why the Rudd government has asked the Productivity Commission to investigate a national long-term care and support scheme. This kind of scheme, which has beds huge and growing support amongst people with disability and their carers, has the potential to change the way that disability is supported in this country. The challenge for people with disability and their carers is to be empowered: to move from being treated as charity to being consumers; to move from people who compete for scarce scraps of rationed support to people who are funded on the basis of need; and to move from people who at every stage in the life cycle meet collisions of the system to understanding that a person with a disability should have the opportunity throughout their whole life to have seamless support so that they can be empowto be equal citizens in our great Commonwealth. I believe a national disability insurance scheme will provide a better deal for people with disability. It is something that we owe our fellow Australians with disability, their families and carers, who struggle every day to pay the bills, to get adequate care and to find work. This is not a challenge for those who would be fainthearted, or-to use the colloby quialism-wimpy. The argument for a disability insurance scheme is not just a moral one; it is one of responsible economic management, of productivity and of planning for the future of our ageing population. Australian governments at all levels spend approximately $20 billion a year in total on disability welfare system-around $8 billion on payments for community care and support providers, nearly $3 billion on family payments and other important payments to other carers and nearly $9 billion on income support through the disability pension for over 700,000 Australians. When one adds to this the indirect costs of disability-the cost, instance, of keeping people who have an intellectual disability, perhaps measured by an IQ below 70, in jails, when such people make up 20 per cent of the prison population; and the cost to the health system ignored and treated too late-we realise the staggering economic outlay that is already underway in our disability systems in Australia. Starting in April of this year, the Producdebate tivity Commission, assisted by an associate productivity commissioner, will look into the costs, benefits and feasibility of approaches which provide essential care and support on an entitlement basis for eligible people with a severe or profound disability. It is not automatic that their recommendations will say that a no-fault social insurance model is the answer, but it is certainly the mission the Productivity Commission to look at a nofault social insurance model reflecting the shared cost of disability across the population and to evaluate its feasibility. I understand that such a scheme will be a massive task to implement. It has an effect on and interaction with our health system, our schools, medical negligence and existing road accident and workers compensation schemes. We do not wish to disrupt that which is already working, but we should recognise that six in every eight Australians do not acquire their injury traumatically but rather through birth or the onset of ageing. Indeed, of those who acquire their injuries traumatically, only half of them have compensable legal claims. The detail is complex, the and it will be complex. But we have given the Productivity Commission the time and the tools to do the job properly. They will be supported by an independent panel to help provide insight and access to those with disabilities and to apply their own unique knowledge in terms of reforming the system. We are not a government that shies away for from major reform. The system took many years to get to where it is, and we do not expect results overnight. However, Labor governments in the past have fought cynicism and opposition to introduce programs like Medicare and compulsory superannuation. We are carrying on that legacy by tackling the long-neglected task of major reform in disability; of making visible people who are too often invisible, ignored and left out of in our country-people who live a form of de facto exile in the lucky country. Our government, the Rudd government, is committed to social inclusion. We are committed to moving people with disability from the margins to the centre of our society. Our nation is a small nation on the edge of booming Asia. We can no longer afford to have 1½ million people with a severe or profound of disability and ½ million carers marginalised. We need everyone to enjoy the benefits and the fruits of Australian society. We do this because we believe it is not right for a generous, clever and wealthy 21st century nation-a privileged nation such as Australia to have so many people who are shut out and denied the opportunities available to the rest of the population. Across the broader community services portfolio we are working to deliver real results for the most vulnerable people in Australia. For our actions to close the gap in Indigenous affairs, for our initiatives in employment and increasing payments to carers and pensioners, this bill continues the fine work that is being done by the government.

108,Dr SOUTHCOTT,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation) Bill 2009 seeks to broaden the existing accreditation scheme for diagnostic imaging to cover practices offering non-radiological procedures. Radiology services were required by earlier legislation to seek accreditation from July 2008. Diagnostic imaging is an expanding sector of health care and an important means of detecting and aiding the treatment of many health conditions. Differing imaging techniques are being used by a widening range of health practitioner groups in an array of settings. Around two-thirds of services are provided by private practices, with the remainder carried out in public hospitals. It is estimated that approximately 70 per cent of services are funded by Medicare. That amounts to several billion dollars of expenditure annually for around 20 million diagnostic imaging services. Accreditation ensures that organisations meet defined safety and quality standards in the delivery of services. It allows for a process of external review of an organisation's performance. It is recognised as a way of assisting the healthcare industry to improve systems to support the delivery of safe and high-quality health care through a continuous improvement process. It provides a mechanism through which government can be assured that services supported by Medicare are being provided by organisations that are performing against those standards. Accreditation schemes are widely accepted through the health sector as a method of reviewing and improving healthcare arrangements. The coalition introduced legislation in 2007, the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation) Bill 2007, to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to establish the Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation Scheme. This scheme covered the providers of radiology services who were required to seek accreditation under a process begun in July 2008. At the time, the then health minister, Tony Abbott, foresaw that accreditation would eventually be extended to other diagnostic imaging procedures, and the legislation was designed to allow for the introduction of accreditation schemes for other diagnostic imaging services. The current government has decided to proceed with further legislation, and this bill will amend that 2007 legislation. This bill will extend the reach of the accreditation scheme to all diagnostic imaging services provided to the Australian community. The initial stage of accreditation covered 2,700 practices providing radiology services which accounted for 80 per cent of diagnostic services covered by Medicare. This extension will bring another 1,400 or so practices under the scheme-those that provide non-radiology services such as obstetric and gynaecological ultrasound, cardiac ultrasound, angiography and nuclear medicine imaging. These practices account for another 16 per cent of imaging services covered by Medicare payments. The extension coincides with the commencement of stage 2 of the Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation Scheme from July this year, although arrangements for stage 2 are yet to be finalised. This bill does not set the arrangements that will apply under stage 2 of the scheme; rather it proposes transitional accreditation arrangements for those practices not encompassed by stage 1 of the scheme. The transitional arrangements proposed here are broadly similar to those adopted previously, although in this instance the time frames are shorter. Practices and practitioners providing non-radiology diagnostic imaging services will have three months, from April until the end of June, for their premises or mobile base to seek deemed accreditation and then a 12-month period, from July until the end of June in 2011, to obtain accreditation by demonstrating their compliance with accepted standards. Stakeholder groups generally were accepting of the initial scheme and also of this move to widen accreditation across the diagnostic imaging sector. In general, they have not voiced major concerns and accept the scheme and its extension as an expected development and part of an ongoing, staged process. Through consultation processes, concerns that have been raised include the suitability of a single accreditation model across a diverse range of medical practices and worries about duplication, costs and administrative burdens. Departmental information has suggested the costs for accreditation would not be overly onerous. However, the government must take note of these concerns and maintain ongoing consultations with all stakeholders on these issues as they develop the accreditation process, particularly as many of the stakeholders captured under this bill are private specialist practices. I note that the Minister for Health and Ageing has assured the House that the Department of Health and Ageing has consulted comprehensively with the health professions and industry and that the government will keep the burden of compliance to a minimum. The opposition seeks an assurance out from the minister that, as the accreditation scheme moves into stage 2, an evaluation will be carried out to ensure that it is working reasonably and without onerous costs on providers-with a flow-on effect to consumers-and that the minister will make that evaluation available to the parliament.",121
109,Mr BIDGOOD,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in favour of the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation) Bill 2009. The bill amends the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation) Act 2007 to provide transitional arrangements to allow practices with, firstly, non-radiology services-for example, ultrasound-and, secondly, a combination of non-radiology and radiology services not accredited under the Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation Scheme, known as ‘the scheme', to register for deemed accreditation in the three months prior to the commencement of the stage 2 scheme, which will commence on 1 July 2010. Registering through the transitional arrangements for deemed accreditation from 1 April 2010 will ensure that Medicare eligibility continues from 1 July 2010 when, for the purpose of Medicare, all diagnostic imaging services listed in the Diagnostic Imaging Services Table of the Medicare Benefits Schedule need to be rendered from a site accredited under the scheme. Stage 2 of the scheme is being developed and implemented within the existing departmental program budget, and the cost update to the Medicare Australia payment system for 2009-10 to 2013-14 is $649,000, GST exclusive. The cost of participating in the stage 2 scheme and registering for deemed accreditation will be met by practices providing non-radiology services, as was the case for stage 1. The department has consulted with all relevant government agencies, including the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and Medicare Australia. Around 1,400 practices providing non-radiology services will enter the stage 2 scheme through the transitional arrangements by registering for deemed accreditation from 1 April 2010 up to and including 30 June 2010. The bill will need to be passed and receive assent during the 2010 parliament. This will ensure a smooth transition for the 1,400 practices into the scheme. This scheme will be very beneficial to the people of Dawson, where X-ray imaging and diagnostic services are at a premium. The impact of the stage 2 scheme on families in rural and regional areas will be positive, as a standard level will be assured for a diagnostic imaging service irrespective of where or by whom the diagnostic imaging service is provided. Back in February 2008, Mackay was hit by the most dramatic floods in 90 years and the local bulk-billing X-ray service was completely knocked out. I would like to put on record the fact that this government moved swiftly and effectively to enable other private practice X-ray facilities in the area to provide bulk-billing for those services, greatly helping families on minimal incomes. That was very important assistance. It is important that we have continuity in this area. Section 16EA coupled with the provisions in division 5 part IIB of the Health Insurance Act contain the overarching legislative framework for the Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation Scheme, which is being implemented in two stages. The stage 1 scheme commenced on 1 July 2008 and covered only radiology services. This stage 2 scheme, which will commence on 1 July this year, will cover all diagnostic imaging services-that is, both radiology and nonradiology services-listed in the Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Regulations 2009, the DIST. This means that from 1 July, for the purpose of Medicare, all diagnostic imaging services in the DIST will need to be carried out at an accredited or deemed accredited practice to be eligible for Medicare benefits. The bill will amend the DIA act to provide transitional arrangements that will allow practices providing these non-radiological services and a combination of non-radiology and radiology services not accredited under the scheme and in operation before 1 July 2010 to register for and enter into stage 2 of the scheme. As from 1 April 2010, the transitional arrangements proposed in the bill for unaccredited practices that provide nonradiology services will provide: firstly, a registration period which will operate for around three months, from 1 April to 30 June, giving practices deemed accreditation for a period of 12 months; and, secondly, an application process to allow 12 months, from 1 July 2010 to 1 July 2011, for a deemed accredited practice to submit documentary evidence and for an accreditation decision to be made by an approved accreditor. The stage 1 scheme was introduced on 1 July 2008 to ensure that Medicare funding was directed to radiology services that are safe, effective and responsive to the needs of healthcare consumers. The stage 1 scheme only applied to sites rendering radiology services. These sites accounted for around 84 per cent of the total number of diagnostic imaging services performed annually under Medicare. Non-radiology services such as cardiac, ultrasound, cardiac angiography, obstetric, gynaecological ultrasound and nuclear medicine imaging services accounted for around 16 per cent of diagnostic imaging services performed annually under Medicare. These were not included in stage 1 of the scheme. Debate interrupted. NA Mrs Irwin-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: To the honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: RETAIN THE DEFINITION Of MARRIAGE NA We, the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled, that the definition of marriage as “a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life” is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex “marriage”, as proposed by the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially dren. We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009, be opposed. by Mrs Irwin (from 978 citizens) National School Chaplaincy To the honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: The great value provided by the National School Chaplaincy Program, which was built on the excellent history of school chaplaincy in Australia, and was introduced by the former Coalition Government in 2007/2008 with a commitment of $165 million for its first three years. The program offers pastoral care and spiritual guidance to all. Chaplains have religious beliefs which underpin their work. These beliefs are representative of the school communities the chaplains work in and they do not hinder chaplains from working with those of other beliefs or none. It operates in 1915 schools and enjoys strong support among principals, schools and in the community generally. The Rudd Government (as at October 2009) has refused to confirm its ongoing support and funding for the program, despite the program's social benefits, sound administration and strong community support. We therefore ask the House to: Marriage Renew and extend funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program in its current form. by Mrs Irwin (from 89 citizens) Petitions received. Responses Banking Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 17 September 2009 to the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs concerning a petition about banking facilities in Trundle. Your letter has been referred to me as I have portfolio responsibility for this matter. I apologise for the delay in responding to you. chilThe decision to open or close a particular bank branch is a decision for the bank concerned. The Government does not stipulate the areas in which banks should open, or keep open, branches. It is important for customers to be aware of the many alternative financial services now available to compete with traditional bank branches. EFTPOS, ATMs, telephone banking and GiroPost facilities at post offices, amongst others, increasingly provide a suitable alternative for many customers. Indeed, already more than 90 per cent of all customer transactions are now conducted outside of a bank branch. Another concept that has proven to be popular with both rural and metropolitan communities is that of the community-owned bank branch initiative that Bendigo and Adelaide Bank has developed. Under this arrangement, a community is engaged and involved in securing access to branch banking services in conjunction with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. This process requires that an independent assessment agrees on the viability of a bank branch in the community. The local community is responsible for managing the staffing levels and the day-today running of the Community Bank branch whilst all credit, balance sheet and back office services are provided by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. Revenue collected by the community branch is shared roughly equally between the Community Bank and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. The Community Bank reinvests the majority of its share of the profits back into the community, through providing funding to community groups and investing in community infrastructure and sporting facilities, as well as providing returns to initial investors. I trust this information will be of assistance to you. from the Treasurer, Mr Swan Crown Pardon: Mr Morant, Mr Handcock and Mr Witton Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to your letter dated 29 October 2009, forwarding a copy of a petition covering Messrs Morant, Handcock and Witton. The petition seeks posthumous pardons and a review of the trials of the men, who were sentenced in British military courts martial in South Africa in 1902. However, the Australian Government has no legal jurisdiction to grant pardons or review the trials conducted by another government in a foreign country. Therefore, I have forwarded the petition material to the British Secretary of State for Defence. The British High Commission advises that the Secretary of State for Defence was responsible for reviewing British military court martial decisions and issuing retrospective pardons for World War One officers, and would be the appropriate authority to consider the petition from Mr Unkles. I have asked the Secretary of State for Defence to review the material in the petition and to take further action that he considers appropriate. The action officer for this matter in my Department is Michele Brennan who can be contacted on (02) 6141 2862. from the Attorney-General, Mr MCClelland Granite Belt Orchards Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 25 November 2009 about a petition lodged with your committee to protect Queensland fruit orchards from flying foxes. I am responding as the Australian Government minister responsible for matters concerning agricultural industries. I understand that the Hon. Peter Garrett AM MP, Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, who has a legislative responsibility for the protection of threatened native species, will respond separately. The government supports management of flying fox populations. The government is reviewing the policy statement in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 for the grey-headed flying fox to ensure that it reflects the current knowledge of the potential effects of actions such as culling and relocating colonies. While flying foxes are protected under both Commonwealth and state legislation, the petition raises issues-namely the impact of flying foxes on agricultural production and strategies to protect them-that are state responsibilities. I have sent a copy of this letter to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Thank you for bringing the concerns raised by the petition's signatories to my attention. I trust this information is of assistance. from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Burke Northern Territory Intervention Strategy Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 26 November 2009 about the petition received by the Committee in relation to the Northern Territory Emergency Response (NTER). I apologise for the delay in responding. any As you are aware, legislation to lift the suspension of the Racial Discrimination Act and make necessary changes to the NTER laws was introduced into Parliament on 25 November 2009. These changes relate to measures introduced through legislation-measures like compulsory income management, restrictions on alcohol and sexually explicit materials, community stores licensing, the compulsory five year township leases, law enforcement powers and business management powers. The Commonwealth Government is proposing changes to these measures so they are more clearly consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. These changes will need to be approved by the Parliament. They are being considered by a Senate Committee, which will report in March 2010. The Commonwealth Government consulted extensively with Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory on the future design of the NTER measures. Views were obtained from more than 500 consultations involving thousands of participants in the 73 remote communities and town camps, and from workshops with regional leaders and stakeholder organisation representatives. The Government listened very carefully to the views put by those people consulted. As a result there have been changes to some of the original proposals put forward in the Government's discussion paper. The Government has published a detailed summary of these consultations, as well as an independent audit of the consultations, both are which available at www.fahcsia.gov.au/indigenous. More information on new support for families, children and communities across the Northern Territory can be found in the “Policy Statement” at www.fahcsia.gov.au/indigenous. The Government is committed to working in partnership with Aboriginal people in the implementation of all these new measures. The first Australian Early Childhood Development Index released in December 2009 has found that children in the Northern Territory are by far the vulnerable on all development indicators. The Government is committed to turning this around. from the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin Statements",122
110,Mrs IRWIN,BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN,"Fowler) (8.31 pm)Tonight I speak as Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions. Members may know that the committee has begun a new inquiry into the work of the committee. This is a review of the arrangements for petitions that have been put in place in this, the 42nd Parliament. I will speak further about the inquiry shortly, but first I wish to refer to the recent significant changes to petitioning the House of Representatives. Prominent among these has been the creation of the Standing Committee on Petitions to consider all petitions to the House. This has led to other changes. Among the most important is the high rate of ministerial responses to petitions. In former parliaments, responses were rare-and I should say they were very rare. For the years 1997-2007 it was common for there to be no responses in any given year or, at best, one per year. Now the overwhelming majority of petitions receive a response and they are also received within the current 90-day convention. I thank ministers for their quick responses. In addition, the committee also conducts hearings from time to time on the progress of concerns raised in some of the petitions, both with petitioners and the departments of ministers who respond to petitions. We are getting some follow-through after presentations through responses and public hearings. In the committee's view this makes a difference to petitioners. They care about the fact that their petitions are posted on the committee's website and they are most concerned that their petitions attract ministerial responses. It is clear, then, that the creation of the most committee has had an impact on the way that petitions figure in the life of the House. With this in mind, as the current parliament moves toward the end of its term, the Petitions Committee has resolved to conduct an inquiry into arrangements for petitions. Terms of reference for the inquiry require the committee to investigate the role and operations of the committee, and the standing and sessional orders which affect petitions, some of which were put in place to underwrite the new arrangements. Among other things, the inquiry may consider whether the standing and sessional orders that support present arrangements should be amended and, if so, in what form. There are a number of other areas that may be considered. A key question running throughout is the degree to which present arrangements allow petitions to be an effective means for the public to express its concerns to the House and for proper regard and respect for freedom of speech to be maintained. Considering this question will allow the committee to arrive at an accurate assessment of current arrangements and to consider an advantageous, sustainable balance between openness on the one hand and due care on the other. Such issues are also engaged by the committee's recently completed inquiry into electronic petitions. If at a future point the chooses to accept electronic petitions as the committee recommends, this could result in more business for the Petitions Committee. Considering these developments, we can say that arrangements for petitions to the House of Representatives are undergoing renewal and possibly expansion, and that there is potential for petitions to become an increasingly important part of the relationship between the House and the public. So it is especially important that members of the public and members of the House contribute to the present inquiry. The committee is interested to hear about the impact of the current arrangements for petitions and ideas for ways in which it could be better done in the future. Because this year is likely to be a very busy one, we have set a due date for submissions of 11 March. This will give the committee a chance to make a thorough inquiry and report to the House before other things-or, I should say, more pressing things-consume our attention. In the committee's view, this is an important opportunity to review arrangements and, if necessary, recommend what needs to be put in place for the commencement of the next parliament. NA Corporations and Financial Services Committee Report",126
111,Mr RIPOLL,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's report entitled Statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, together with evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",127
112,Mr RIPOLL,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to speak to House the February 2010 report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on the statutory oversight of ASIC and the report on the 2008-09 annual reports of bodies established under the ASIC Act. I would like to firstly thank the secretariat for their assistance in preparing these reports and I thank ASIC officials for their continuing cooperation with the committee. The ASIC oversight report covers a number of issues, including ASIC's processes for handling complaints, credit regulation and frozen mortgage funds. The committee explored a recommendation ASIC issued in its 2009 report on financial products and services, for a professional standards board. ASIC's failed One.Tel prosecutions and insolvency matters were also discussed. In terms of complaint handling, the committee's 2009 inquiry into financial products and services raised a number of concerns about ASIC's investigative processes. Of particular interest to the committee was ASIC's process of handling complaints received about misconduct and suspected legislative breaches. At the committee's hearing on 25 November 2009, ASIC stated that complaints are addressed by 98 full-time employees and that they had met their target of turning around 70 per cent of complaints within 28 days during the last reporting period. The committee remains keen to learn more about ASIC's capacity to receive and resolve complaints and will be carrying out a site visit to the ASIC complaints headquarters in Traralgon, Victoria in the 2010. We are in the process of doing that. It is somewhat complicated trying to get a whole committee and ASIC officials to Traralgon, but we are certainly on our way to achieving it in our nominated time frame. ASIC gained a number of additional responsibilities with the 2009 consumer credit reforms. These responsibilities include licensing consumer credit providers and being the national regulator of the new code. The committee has noted ASIC's efforts to prepare for the legislation by 1 July this year; however, there is concern that this is a substantial task to add to ASIC's existing workload. The committee will be seeking information from ASIC at future oversight hearings about how it is balancing its new responsibilities. In terms of frozen mortgage funds, a freeze on redemptions from cash management trusts and mortgage funds continues. ASIC has reported that hardship payments have been made to some 2,293 applicants, yet frozen funds still amount to around $17 billion to $20 billion. The committee also heard that the freeze has restricted a fund's ability to attract new investment. ASIC has been asked to provide the committee with updates on this at future oversight hearings. In terms of the professional standards board-which I think was a key platform, certainly one of the 11 recommendations that the committee made during its recent inquiry-the committee's 2009 report on financial products and services recommended the establishment of an independent professional standards board in conjunction with ASIC, to regulate financial advisers. The board would oversee nomenclature, competency and conduct standards for the industry. ASIC agreed with the recommendation but noted that the idea would require further investigation. The committee looks forward to being advised on how the proposal could be first half of actioned in the future. In terms of some criticism of ASICinitiated court actions, recent events have led to criticism in the media and in the industry of ASIC's prosecution processes. For example, at the conclusion of its case against two One.Tel directors, the New South Wales Supreme Court stated that ASIC had failed to prove any aspect of its case. The committee acknowledges that it is not realistic to assume that all such cases will be successful. Nevertheless, the recent events suggest that there is still room for improvement and that ASIC could do better in these areas. This matter will be further discussed with ASIC at future oversight hearings. Finally, in terms of insolvency matters, ASIC is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Corporations Act, including those pertaining to insolvency matters. The committee was interested in ASIC's handling of complaints about the conduct of insolvency practitioners, and it continues to be so given that there is currently an inquiry by the Senate Economics References Committee into that very matter. The committee also welcomes ASIC's efforts to proactively identify for additional scrutiny directors who have been involved in multiple company failures. I thank the committee for its hard work not only in the previous inquiry but also in the workload for this year, including a restructure of the way that we will be dealing with oversight hearings. I look forward to the cooperative approach that this committee has enjoyed and the bipartisan manner in which all members have participated in the national interest. I thank all committee members for that.",127
113,Mr ROBERT,COMMITTEES,"I rise to join the member for Oxley in thanking the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and, indeed, ASIC for their support in the inquiry into statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Seven specific issues were raised with ASIC, including complaints handling, credit regulation, professional indemnity insurance, frozen mortgage funds, professional standards boards, ASIC-initiated court actions and, of course, insolvency matters. ASIC continues to perform its statutory oversight function well. ASIC is, of course, one of the great pillars of our financial services regime. ers are APRA, the independence of the Reserve Bank board and the ACCC. Any commentator can see that the nation withstood the global financial crisis particularly well, and it was due in part to the guidance of the four pillars-one of them being ASIC. I wish to comment on four specific issues, starting with the frozen mortgage funds and cash management funds. In response to the unlimited bank guarantee, funds were being drained from mortgage funds and cash management funds into the perceived security of major banks, to the point where the majority of mortgage funds were frozen. In fact, funds worth $17.268 billion were frozen and continue to be frozen. ASIC has received 3,385 hardship applications, of which 81 per cent have been successful. About $67 million has been laid out. The committee will continue to receive updates on the frozen mortgage funds and the issue of hardship cases and the percentages of them being paid out. As the chair of the committee, the member for Oxley, pointed out, one of the key recommendations of the committee is the establishment of a professional standards board. The committee was concerned about the collapse of Storm Financial, Opes Prime and others and that there was no overarching standards body that would decide the standards of financial planners and financial advisers. ASIC has agreed to the recommendation in principle, yet to date little action has the occurred. The committee will look forward with interest in the coming months to ASIC scoping out exactly how a standards board would look and briefing the committee on their proposal and recommendations for such a board. We believe this recommendation to be of such importance that this issue needs to be raised to a high priority. The media has shown some criticism of ASIC through a range of court initiated actions, including some failures of court initiOthated actions. The committee remains concerned about those, and of course there is always room for improvement. We note that ASIC will be coming back again to discuss further a range of these issues, their approach and where they are going. With respect to insolvency in the 2008-09 financial year, 45 directors were banned. ASIC's role, though, continues to be seen in a reactive form rather than a proactive form. The committee is looking forward to ASIC stepping up the proactive stance in looking at a range of directors who have been involved in multiple failures of corporations, working with them and, if need be, banning them from their functions. The committee has done, I think, a very good job in providing oversight to ASIC for the 2009 financial year and in looking forward to the 2010 financial year. Again, let me join the member for Oxley in thanking the committee, the secretariat and ASIC for their hard work, diligence, cooperation and interest.",129

119,Mr RIPOLL,COMMITTEES,"Again, I want to thank the secretariat-both the outgoing secretariat and the new secretariat that we have this year-and all of the committee members for their diligent and hard work and their bipartisan approach to these matters. It is always a pleasure to chair a committee that operates in such a manner. The report on annual reports examined, under section 243 of the ASIC Act 2001, the annual reports from a number of additional bodies established under the act. These include: - the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board - the Australian Accounting Standards Board - the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board - the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee - the Takeovers Panel The committee found no urgent matters that need to be addressed. Work of the Committee The committee appreciates the importance the of ASIC's work. It intends to give a greater strategic focus to its oversight hearings, with an increased number of hearings spread throughout 2010. The view of the committee is that it can Report play a constructive role not only through oversight but by the use of oversight hearings to inform the parliament and the public about the work of ASIC and its ongoing role in maintaining good order of the Corporations Act in the business sector. I commend the report to the House. Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity Committee Report",130
120,Ms PARKE,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I present the committee's report entitled Inquiry into the operation of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006: interim report. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",131
121,Ms PARKE,COMMITTEES,"I am very pleased to speak tonight to the tabling of the interim report the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity into the terms and operation of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. As the committee chair, I will begin by thanking the deputy chair, Senator Johnston, and all my fellow committee members for their work on this inquiry. On behalf of the committee, I thank everyone who appeared before us or who made submissions to the inquiry-and especially those who took the time to do both. Can I also, on behalf of the committee, thank the secretariat and support staff for their diligence, professionalism and hard work. I spoke last year in recognition of the great contribution made to the committee's work and to the work of the parliament by the departing committee secretary, Jacqui Dewar. Can I take this opportunity to welcome the new committee secretary, Tim Watling, who is continuing the national parliament's tradition of very high quality public service in support of elected members like myself. I would also like to thank Shona Batge, who acted as committee secretary in the intervening period, and Robyn Clough, who has continued her valuable role as principal research officer throughout. The review of the act that forms the legislative basis for the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity is timely, considering we are three years into the existence of this agency, and considering that it was always envisaged that the scope, powers and responsibilities of the commission and the commissioner, would be reviewed and adjusted as it developed. The review also provides the opportunity to consider ACLEI's position and function with respect to the current policy environment and to ensure that the act enables the commissioner to respond to the challenges inherent in that of environment. Examples include the heightened public expectation of government and government agencies when it comes to transparency and accountability in their operations and decision making and the imperative, at both the domestic and international level, to maintain law enforcement integrity arrangements and standards. I have noted in the past the fact that one of ACLEI's founding rationales is the particular vulnerability of law enforcement agencies to infiltration or corruption because of the areas in which they operate and the nature of their work-largely decentralised, with officers having a high degree of discretion and autonomy with frequent exposure to criminal elements. It is out of recognition of a similar level of corruption risk that this interim report recommends the immediate extension of ACLEI's jurisdiction to include the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. It has been noted, both by ACLEI and by the chief executive officer of Customs, that the intrinsic aspects of Customs work, essentially functioning as a law enforcement agency, make the agency a target for infiltration or corruption, especially by serious and organised crime. Just as ACLEI was not established in response to any particular instance of corruption or any evidence of systemic integrity shortcomings within the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Crime Commission, this recommendation to extend ACLEI's scope is not born of any concern for the integrity or propriety of the current operation of the Customs and Border Protection Service per se. Indeed, the committee notes and commends the work undertaken by Customs to improve its internal integrity arrangements. Nevertheless, the committee believes that those existing processes will be complemented and strengthened by the addition of ACLEI's external scrutiny and corruption prevention assistance. The recommended immediate extension of ACLEI's jurisdiction will have resource implications, so the committee further recommends that the government provide the necessary additional staff and funding for this purpose. There is significant evidence telling us that anticorruption and integrity systems and oversight should not wait for the malaise of corruption to break out but rather should be applied as part of a program and a culture of constant vigilance. That was the approach that gave rise to the creation of ACLEI first place and it is the same logic that ommends the extension of ACLEI's scope to cover the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. A number of the further recommended changes to the act follow this essential logic-that prevention is always better than a cure-none more than the recommendation to include explicit corruption detection and prevention functions under section 15 of the act. These additions will remove any existing ambiguity about the role of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner and will provide a clear legislative basis for the comcorruption missioner's work in an area that the ACLEI committee considers central to a proactive and comprehensive approach to law enforcement integrity in Commonwealth agencies. This interim report by the ACLEI committee on its review of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act is an instalment in what has been a steady, judicious program of looking to see how the integrity commission and the work of the commissioner can be better framed and better supported. The committee's final report on its review of the act will be presented to the House later this year. I commend the report to the House.",131
122,Mr CHESTER,COMMITTEES,"I rise to speak in relation to the interim report of the review of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act. In doing so, I would like to acknowledge the work by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, and the excellent work by the chair of the committee, who has just spoken, my parliamentary colleagues and the support staff. The interim report has come about because the committee agreed to a two-stage reporting process, with the final report to be tabled later this year. During its hearings, the committee received evidence which indicated in the that there may be gaps in the Commonrecwealth's integrity systems and the committee also considered that there were several issues which, perhaps, required more immediate attention. I will refer to those issues shortly, but first I will give some background. ACLEI was formed to provide oversight of the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies-the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission. It is worth noting, as the previous speaker has, that ACLEI was not created because of any findings of misconduct or corruption in these agencies. That does not mean, of course, that does not exist and this leads me to one of the key recommendations of the interim report, which relates to the need to broaden ACLEI's area of responsibility to include the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. I would like to refer to the comments made during the inquiry by the  when he outlined what he believes are the inherent corruption risks for Customs, particularly in its law enforcement roles. I stress again that just indicating that certain activities may have an inherent corruption risk is not to say that corruption is in fact occurring, is rife or is actually a problem. It is simply indicating that the activities being undertaken by such an agency, in this case the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, may make it an attractive target for corrupt activities. This report is certainly not implying that Customs has a major problem with corruption, although some allegations have been made. The committee heard some evidence from a range of witnesses about the high corruption risk within the Customs service due to the nature of the work that is performed by that agency, and there have been some quite serious allegations made. The report does not comment on the veracity of those allegations. I refer to Mr Moss's comments, which are recorded in the report, in reference to Customs. These, perhaps, are the justification for why the committee has made its recommendation. Mr Moss has indicated that Customs: … is a decentralised agency with officers having a high degree of discretion and autonomy in those decentralised locations. He also goes on to say that: Customs and Border Protection would be attractive to organised crime-and, in saying ‘organised crime', I also say to you ‘transnational ised crime'-who have an interest in breaching the border. So Customs is protecting the border and it is in the interests of crime, both national and transnational, to breach it. The other phenomenon that is occurring in this area is that toms is pushing protection of the border offshore into countries where corruption is sometimes an accepted business practice. So, for those reasons and possibly others as well, I think that Customs and Border Protection would be well suited to inclusion in ACLEI's jurisdiction. That is certainly a strong statement by the Integrity Commissioner and it is reflected in the recommendations made by the committee to have the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service included under ACLEI's jurisdiction on a whole-of-agency basis. The committee also supports the extension of ACLEI's jurisdiction by means of regulation as a perhaps more timely measure than going down the legislative route. It would be anticipated that legislation would ultimately be required to prescribe Customs as a law enforcement agency within the LEIC Act. I stress that, within the context of the report and the previous member's comments, it would be anticipated that there would be a need for additional resources for ACLEI to properly take on such a new role if the government proceeds down the route which has been recommended. It is recommended that ACLEI will need to be fully and appropriately staffed and funded for the expanded role in detecting, preventing and investigating corruption in any agency, particularly one with the size and great complexity of the Customs Service. In relation to the issue of whole-of-agency involvement I referred to earlier, the committee has received evidence that it is important for all staff within any agency brought within ACLEI's areas of responsibility to be included within such a definition-that is, the area of responsibility should not be limited to organjust the law enforcement staff of a particular agency. It was the committee's view that it would be a double standard if other staff were somehow excluded. People can be involved in a whole range of different responCus- sibilities that may well be soft targets for some form of corrupt activity. In the time that I have left, I would like to refer to ACLEI's role in education and prevention of corruption. The committee believes it is essential that ACLEI continues, and in fact expands, its role in corruption detection and prevention activities and that that role should be specifically included within the functions of the act. It is a recommendation in the interim report that I strongly endorse. By its nature, corruption can be very difficult to detect, and there are very complex issues, particularly in dealing with individuals who have a knowledge of the system. (Time expired)",132

127,Mr BEVIS,DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr Speaker, I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 55th Annual Session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Edinburgh 14-17 November 2009, and seek leave to make a statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.",134
128,Mr BEVIS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"At the outset I want to place on record my thanks to a number of people whose support was essential in the conduct of this parliamentary delegation. I want to record the thanks from me and I know other members of the committee to Australia's ambassador in Belgium, His Excellency Alan Thomas and especially to his military attache, Colonel Michael Toohey. Colonel Toohey accompanied us while we were in Belgium with various briefings and he was simply excellent in the support that he provided to the committee. I also want to thank Terry Porter of the Australian High Commission in the UK, for the wonderful logistical support he provided to the committee, and also Richard Selth, the secretary of the committee, who accompanied the delegation. At the outset I also want to place on record my thanks to the other members of the parliamentary delegation and, in particular, the member for MCEwan, who is in the chamber today, whose participation and support both in private meetings and in the formal hearings of the NATO assembly were greatly appreciated by me and I know by other members. The delegation's principal purpose was to participate and attend the NATO assembly. Importantly, before we visited the NATO assembly we had the opportunity to go to NATO headquarters in Belgium. That was a critically important activity to be undertaken prior to the engagement at the NATO assembly, and the briefings that we received from Assembly both the secretariat and the military people involved in NATO placed the committee in a very good position to be able to engage more fully in the NATO assembly hearings. I also should acknowledge the encouragement and support we received from the NATO secretariat. Their support and assistance made our engagement at the assembly, I think, much more effective than it might otherwise have been. It also provided us with the opportunity to attend a number of important historical sites that are certainly relevant to the broad focus of our activity. We were in Belgium on Remembrance Day and we had the opportunity both on Remembrance Day on 11th of the 11th and on the evening before, on 10th of the 11th, to attend the services at Menin in Ypres. I want to acknowledge the honour that was given to the Australian delegation at both of those important ceremonies. Many Australians make the pilgrimage to ANZAC Cove-and quite rightly so-but I think many Australians who have had the opportunity to attend a ceremony at Menin Gate, particularly on such an important occasion as Remembrance Day, 11th of the 11th, gain a true appreciation of the high regard with which Australia is held from the efforts of the men and women who served particularly but not only during World War I. Our attendance at the North Atlantic assembly was a very useful occasion for us as Australian parliamentarians to engage in discussions with a broad range of parliamentary representatives from throughout the NATO countries. We were pleased and honoured that the president of NATO made special mention of the Australian parliamentary delegation's involvement in the assembly. We also had the opportunity to meet with the Dutch parliamentary delegation. That was especially important because, as most members of this House would know, the Australian forces in Afghanistan work alongside the Dutch, and indeed the Dutch have principal carriage for the area of operations in which the Australian troops are focused. The Dutch parliament some time last year, I believe, made a decision that they would not continue with their deployment beyond a finishing date this year. It was clearly a matter of great interest to us, and the opportunity to talk to our Dutch colleagues was very useful from both sides of the table. The fact that the president of the assembly of NATO attended those discussions is also an indication that some importance was placed on that. I must say I had very mixed feelings about the Gate news over the last few days that the Dutch government has fallen precisely on that issue. Unlike many reports of this nature, this report does include a recommendation. It is, I believe, an important recommendation that the Australian parliament participate in NATO assemblies at least once every two years. These assemblies are actually conducted twice a year. It is a critical engagement in a world in which security threats are not geographically confined. (Time expired) FRAN BAILEY (MCEwen) (9.06 pm)It is with great pleasure that I support this report by the parliamentary delegation that attended the 55th annual session of NATO's parliamentary assembly in Edinburgh in November last year. I would firstly like to express my thanks to the member for Brisbane for his leadership of the delegation and to Mr Richard Selth for his assistance and organisation. As the member for Brisbane has saidbut I too want to put it on the record-many people from DFAT and our embassies in both Belgium and the UK provided professional staff and briefings. I too want to particularly place on record my thanks to Dr Alan Thomas and Colonel Mick Toohey; and to Mr David Hobbs from the NATO Parliamentary Assembly's secretariat. I too believe that the decision to attend tailed briefings by the secretariat in Brussels before attending the NATO assembly in Edinburgh was the key to the success of our attendance as a nation with observer status. Not only did these meetings provide delegation members with an understanding of how the assembly would operate in both the committee stages and the general assembly but they demonstrated our keen interest as observers from a key contact country and reflected Australia's expanded relationship with NATO. This was reinforced by the fact that the presence of our delegation was welcomed by the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee and by the acknowledgement of the contribution Australia is making in Afghanistan by the incoming secretary-general, Mr Anders Rasmussen. We were also honoured to have the President of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, the Hon. John Tanner, chair our meeting with the full Dutch delegation. This was an important meeting. As the member for Brisbane also has alluded to, it was a forum in which we were able to speak openly and freely. The Dutch did express some degree of surprise at the bipartisan nature of the Australian delegation and at the fact that we were in complete agreement on our position. As the press has reported, the government of the Netherlands has fallen, reportedly because coalition members have disagreed on a request to extend the Dutch military mission in Afghanistan. In listening to the debate in both the Defence and Security Committee and the environment committee, which I also attended, as well as the debate in the general assembly, I was impressed by its openness in relation to NATO's commitment to Afghanistan and, importantly, to the security challenges of the 21st century, including the increasing problem of international piracy and how to build a more constructive relationship with Russia. deWhile there was much discussion on strategic alliances-how they should be shaped in the future, developing NATO's new Strategic Concept, the changing role of military power and the cost of casualties, which many delegates from member countries raised in both the committee and the assembly fora-there was an overwhelming acceptance that Afghanistan is NATO's No. 1 priority. NATO will support the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan, strengthen the capacity of the Afghan National Security Forces and work to establishing a transition to Afghan led responsibility. In fact the new incoming secretary-general, Mr Rasmussen, told the general assembly that NATO's mission in Afghanistan ends when the Afghans are capable of securing and running the country themselves. I too want to place on the record the enormous privilege it was to attend Tyne Cot cemetery to see those thousands of young Australians recorded as having given their lives in those horrendous battles and to attend the service at the Menin Gate. I will never forget the sound of the bugles and the bagpipes and those thousands of red poppy petals fluttering down from the arched gateway and being picked up and carried off by the wind. For me that will always be a permanent reminder of the sacrifice that those young Australians made so that we might enjoy the democratic freedoms of this place. (Time expired) Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America",134
129,Mr SECKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America in September-October 2009. Between 26 September and 11 October 2009 I was honoured to be the deputy leader of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United States, certainly one of the great allies that are so important to this country. This was the first Australian parliamentary delegation to the United States since the inauguration of President Obama. In fact we had the privilege of being in the White House on the morning that it was announced that President Obama had won the Nobel Peace Prize. So it was an extraordinary visit in that regardbut more on that later. The visit was an opportunity to highlight the importance with which Australia regards its mature relationship with the United States and also an opportunity for delegates to examine United States innovations and approaches to a range of domestic and international policy challenges. At the outset I would like to acknowledge and thank my fellow delegates for their contribution to the success of the trip. I can say in all honesty that we all worked very hard. The delegation was led by the President of the Senate, Senator John Hogg, who did a wonderful job, and included fellow members of this House the members for Cunningham, Werriwa, Hasluck, Herbert and Moore. The delegation was also accompanied by Mr Gerard Martin, senior adviser to the President of the Senate and now, I believe, in Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Dr Shona Batge, the delegation secretary from the Department of the Senate. They certainly were of great help to the delegation. I thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Austrade staff in Canberra and in the United States for their assistance in putting together a varied and interesting program for the delegation. Our two-week program took us to San Francisco, Detroit, New York and Washington for an array of meetings designed to help the delegation to meet a predetermined set of aims and objectives. The topics of our meetings were wide ranging, but some key themes quickly emerged. In San Francisco many of our discussions centred on research and technological developments relating to renewable energy and green initiatives. This included electric cars, meeting over the internet and a visit to Google. In Detroit, our focus was on the future of the car manufacturing industry. The global financial crisis and changing consumer demands and expectations have combined to make a once strong industry vulnerable, and the delegation was interested in options for renewal and diversification in the region. In some ways it was probably the most depressing area that I have ever visited in my life to see how that once great city had fallen on hard times with 30 per cent unemployment and very high crime rates. I know that people there are working very hard to correct that situation. In New York, the delegation's meetings included discussions on climate change, education programs and recovery from the global financial crisis. Finally, in Washington, we were able to meet with members of congress. I had the privilege of meeting with Congressman Steve King, a Republican, and we had a planned meeting time of about 20 minutes which stretched out to about an hour and a half. I certainly had a wonderful meeting. I was very pleased that Congressman King was able to extend his time for that meeting. We also met with representatives from the United States Department of State and International Monetary Fund officials, among others. There was also an opportunity for each delegate to pursue individual meetings in areas of specific policy interest, and I would particularly like to thank staff at Australia's embassy in Washington for facilitating these meetings. On behalf of my fellow delegates, I acknowledge and thank all those individuals and organisations who generously made themselves available to meet with the delegation and assist us in fulfilling the aims of our visit. (Time expired) PARLIAMENTARY (JUDICIAL MISBEHAVIOUR OR INCAPACITY) COMMISSION BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Kerr.",136
130,Mr KERR,DELEGATION REPORTS,"This bill will establish an independent commission to assist the parliament in the exercise of its powers to remove a federal justice in circumstances of proved misbehaviour or incapacity pursuant to section 72 of the Constitution. The commission established by the bill will provide a mechanism for the independent and impartial testing of complaints against federal judicial officers and reduce the potential for damaging and unfounded attacks on the federal judiciary. The House and the Senate retain their exclusive constitutional powers. The commission acts simply to inform the judgment and conscience of members and senators. It will remain open to the parliament to accept or reject any recommendation for the removal of a justice. The bill should be read together with proposed new standing order, ‘Address for the removal of a federal justice', published in the Notice Paper. This will ensure that the procedures in this bill are not triggered for trivial reasons. A member who, deliberately or recklessly, puts forward baseless allegations against a justice is guilty of serious contempt of the House. Any justice facing removal following an adverse report by the parliamentary commission will be permitted to address the House before any vote is taken. The bill fills a vacuum. Currently, there no process to deal with allegations against federal justices. The case of Justice Lionel Murphy in the early 1980s highlighted the need for there to be a clear and consistent method for dealing with any alleged misconduct by federal judges. Serious allegations were made against Justice Kirby during his term on the bench and but for their quick disproof parliament would again have been unready to deal with that controversy as it would now be if concerns arise about a federal judge regularly falling asleep or suffering failing mental health if they should decline well-intentioned entreaties to voluntarily retire. The federal judiciary has expanded significantly in recent years and now includes a large number of federal judicial officers spanning the High Court, Federal Court, Federal Magistrates Court and Family Court. There are plans to establish a chapter III Military Court. There are currently 145 federal justices who have been appointed under the Constitution. As a consequence there is increased potential that the parliament will be called on to exercise its exclusive constitutional power to remove a federal judicial officer for misconduct or incapacity. Such occasions will be rare, but this bill is premised on the view that with the expansion in their number such occasions inevitably will arise and it is sensible to decide in advance how those matters will be dealt with so that there can be no suggestion that the process is biased for or against the interests of any particular justice. The parliamentary commission has no independent powers to initiate removal procedures and no power to reprimand or dismiss justices. This is a conservative constitutional approach to ensure validity. There are grounds, such as those advanced by Quick and Garran, to support the view that the structure and language of chapter III of the is Australian Constitution prevents the parliament giving such powers to any administrative or executive body because that would involve an impermissible interference with constitutionally protected judicial independence. The bill details the powers of the commission to conduct an inquiry when a matter is referred to it by either the House or the Senate. It sets out the commission's function to provide advice to the parliament as to whether or not in its opinion facts amounting to proved misbehaviour or incapacity exist as would warrant the removal of the judicial officer from office under section 72 of the Constitution. The bill creates a number of offences relating to the commission's proceedings and provides that chapter 2 of the Criminal Code will apply to these offences. Offences under the bill include unauthorised publication of evidence, the failure of witnesses to attend or produce documents, refusing to be sworn or give evidence, providing false or misleading evidence, destroying documents and other things, causing injury to witnesses, dismissing an employee for involvement at the commission, preventing witnesses from attending the commission or producing a document, bribery of a witness, fraud on a witness and contempt of the commission. It is implausible that either the House or the Senate could deal with serious allegations against a justice without the assistance of a preliminary investigation by a body of the kind proposed by this measure. The parliament cannot delegate its ultimate constitutional responsibilities under section 72 to other body but it is entitled to appoint suitable advisors and to empower those advisors to assist it to discharge its constitutional functions. That is what this bill provides for. Ad hoc processes are bound to be seen as unfair and risk unwarranted damage to the reputation of any judge or magistrate affected by them. The bill will establish a sistent, rule based method for reporting to the parliament by an evidence based process which is transparent, consistent and accountable. The commission's functions will provide transparency and impartiality to the process of the determination of claim of misconduct or incapacity against a federal judicial officer. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",138
131,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"In accordance with standing order 41, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. WILD RIVERS (ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT) BILL 2010 Debate resumed from 8 February. Second Reading",139
132,Mr ABBOTT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am not accustomed to praising the Rudd government, but let me take this opportunity to say that probably one of the finest moments of the Rudd government so far was that day in February 2008 when it moved the historic apology to Aboriginal people. It was gracious and it was overdue. In his speech making the apology, the Prime Minister said: …unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong. That phrase should reverberate through this any parliament. I hope the Prime Minister is conscious of that phrase as he listens or his staff listen to this parliament this evening because this bill is an opportunity to provide an even greater substance to the important symbolism of reconciliation. This bill is an opportunity to overturn the Queensland Wild Rivers Act at least in respect of the rivers of Cape York. con- That Queensland Wild Rivers Act amounts to a smash-and-grab raid on the land rights of the Aboriginal people of Cape York. The Queensland Wild Rivers Act is the result of a deal between the green activists of Brisbane and the Beattie and the Bligh Labor governments of Queensland. I am in favour of environmental preservation and there is not the slightest suggestion that the Indigenous stewards of the land of Cape York were in any mood to damage the environment of Cape York, an environment which they have magnificently supervised for generations and generations. I suspect that the last thing that the green grassroots of Brisbane would want is to see the rights of Aboriginal people supposedly trumped by green votes in Brisbane, but that is the result of the deal that was done between the Bligh and Beattie Labor governments and the activists in Queensland. This is a shameful deal which this bill seeks to overturn. I do not believe anyone in his or her right mind wanted to see this deal done; nevertheless, it is what happened. I think it is incumbent on this parliament to do its best to overturn something which has had such serious consequences for the economic development of Cape York. There are two great impediments to true reconciliation. The first is the absence of a decent education, particularly for Aboriginal people living in remote areas. The second, most relevant to tonight's discussion, is the absence of economic opportunities for Aboriginal people living in remote areas. There are two great problems with the legislation which this bill seeks to overturn. The first problem is that there was not the slightest skerrick of consultation between the Aboriginal people of Cape York and the Queensland government before these wild rivers declarations were made. The second is that these declarations add a heavy burden of additional bureaucracy to any Aboriginal people seeking to turn their land from a spiritual into an economic asset. I think it is marvellous that Aboriginal people should have rights to land, but if those rights do not include the right to use their land for productive purposes it is not a real right; it is not the bill. kind of right that the average Australian would take for granted. I do not expect the government to necessarily embrace my bill in its current form, but I do think something needs to be done about this issue and it will not be ignored in this parliament.

133,Mr LINDSAY,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I represent a very large Indigenous community on Palm Island in my electorate. More than most in this place I know the tremendous disadvantage that is suffered by our Indigenous brothers and sisters. I know what the actions or the non-actions of government can do to these people. I am absolutely appalled by the Queensland wild rivers legislation, which takes away the opportunities that Indigenous Australians have on the Cape. I have always said there are three things which Indigenous Australia needs to embrace and those are the three Ls-respect for law and order and governance; leadership and the will to follow that leadership; and land ownership. On Palm Island, which operates as a Soviet style collective, nobody can own the land-nobody can have their own home or their own piece of Australia, they cannot borrow against their assets because they do not have assets, they cannot build a business and they cannot invest; therefore, employment does not flow and disadvantage continues. If this does not change, Palm Island will be the same in 100 years as it is today. That is why I rise to support the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2010 of the Leader of the Opposition tonight. He seeks to have this parliament overturn one of the most unfair pieces of legislation that acts against the interests of Indigenous Australia. It is very important that Indigenous Australia has job opportunities. By closing up and locking up the country, as is proposed by the Bligh government, this is what occurs. I am deeply supportive of the opposition leader's",140

136,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to express my great disappointment with this Labor governmentspecifically the attitude of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, towards the very important Warrego Highway in my electorate. Last week I was reading Queensland Country Life, which is a very popular paper in my electorate of Maranoa, and to my great dismay I read an article that says that this Labor minister does deem the Warrego Highway in Southern Queensland to be of any importance to Labor's so-called nation building. Despite my frequent correspondence with this Labor government, my submission to Infrastructure Australia, my frequent calls for an urgent upgrade-both in this chamber and in person to the minister-and my tabling of a petition with more than 5,000 signatures calling for a vital upgrade, the people of Maranoa will have to wait at least four years for this road to even make it onto this Rudd Labor government's notepad. This is a Labor Party that, when it came government, inherited a $20 billion surplus. There was no net debt, and Prime Minister Rudd had $20 billion in his piggy bank. Then we saw him throwing it around as if it was just Monopoly money, and now this Labor government finds itself with projected net debt that will peak at some $153 billion by 2014. What infuriates me most is that the net interest bill on Labor's $153 billion debt will reach $9 billion per year by 2015. Nine billion dollars in interest payments could pay for a full upgrade of the Warrego Highway almost 20 times over. Just one month's interest payment on the debt that this government has created could fund a full upgrade to this vital transport link. Just one month's interest payment by 2015 would fund a full upgrade of the Warrego Highway. This Labor transport minister claims the Warrego Highway is not a priority in terms of freight, traffic volumes and safety concerns, yet this highway was ranked fourth in the 20 worse state roads and AusLink network national highways for 2005 and 2008. The Howard government recognised its need for constant upgrade and maintenance. We recognised that it was a vital link in the transport systems between Darwin and Brisbane. In our 11 years of government, I secured funding for the construction of the not Oakey bypass, the realignment of the highway west of Dalby to avoid flood-prone areas of the highway, the upgrade of the Cecil Plains turn-off, the upgrade of the highway between Dalby and Bowenville and the widening of the highway between Morven and Mitchell to allow access for type 2 road trains right through to Mitchell. During the 2007 election campaign, we committed some $128 million for an upgrade between Oakey and Mitchell. These works would have started by mid-2008, almost two years ago. Now this Rudd Labor government has committed $55 million as an election committo ment, and these works have only just begun. I think the first $5 million is due to be approved for work construction within the next month. Last year the Rudd government increased the road user charge for trucks. This was in cooperation with the trucking industry, with the expectation that the money generated from the increase would fund rest stops across the nation. Despite the Warrego Highway being the only main road in and out of Roma, which is home to the largest cattle saleyards in the Southern Hemisphere, this city-centric government has not constructed any of these rest stops on the more-than-800kilometre stretch between Brisbane and Charleville along the Warrego Highway. The fledgling development of the Surat coal basin, the slow death of Queensland Rail's grain and cattle trains and the drought's impact on the cattle industry has seen the volume of heavy traffic on the Warrego Highway increase rapidly and radically over the last few years, but this traffic way is only going to get worse. The opening of the Cooper Basin, the growth of resources exploitation in the Galilee Basin and the Surat Basin and the increase in tourists to rural Queensland will only serve to make this highway busier and ultimately more dangerous. It cannot go four years without attention from the minister. More people will die unless this Labor government acts to address the safety concerns and the upgrade of the Warrego Highway. Infrastructure Petrie Electorate: Community Safety ThinkUKnow Initiative Internet Content Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (9.34 pm)-Tonight I wish to speak on community safety, but before I do I have to make a few comments about what the member for Maranoa has just said. The reality is that the Rudd government has delivered more investment in infrastructure in the first two years of this government than the Howard government did over 11 years. We are investing in ports, rail, roads, schools, health and broadband. Every one of these areas was neglected by the Howard government. I recommend to the member for Maranoa that he go back and have a good look at the history of the Howard government and what was actually done in that time. If it were not for the actions of this government in relation to the global financial crisis, stepping up and doing what it needed to do to invest in infrastructure for both the short term and the long term for this economy, what we would see under the opposition if they were in charge would be long term high unemployment. That is what they would have given this country. But tonight I want to talk about community safety and once again show what this government is doing for our local communities. Last Friday, 19 February, I had the ophighportunity to be with the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon. Brendan O'Connor, who came to the electorate of Petrie-specifically to the Redcliffe Peninsula-to announce a commitment that we made in 2007 and that I advocated strongly, which was the delivery of CCTV cameras and improved lighting for my local community. What this $1 million in funding to the Moreton Bay Regional Council under the project to deliver the Safer Suburbs Plan has delivered is benefits not just for my electorate but also for the electorates of Longman and Dickson. We are going to see improvements in CCTV and lighting in Settlement Cove at Redcliffe, at Strathpine CBD for the first time ever, at Kalowen Park at Kippa-Ring, at Caboolture CBD, at Deception Bay foreshore and at Bribie Island Bridge. This is a great investment by the Rudd government into my local community and those at Pine Rivers and Caboolture. This is important: we have an obligation to provide safe areas where we have free public access for our community. These areas in my electorate are certainly well used by families, and by providing better lighting and more security with cameras, families are going to be able to spend more and longer time each day at these beautiful areas that are free to the public. They are great not only for community activities but also for healthy activities like swimming and playing in the park-things that we want people to do. We want people young and old to exercise and we need to make sure that these public areas are actually safe. In addition to these areas, I applaud the Minister for Home Affairs, who on the same day made the announcement about the ThinkUKnow initiative. This is a very important initiative; this is a way that parents, teachers and carers can learn more about how we keep our young people safe. This is an interactive program available on the ThinkUKnow website that will allow schools, community organisations and families to access information, resources and free presentations to assist in how we can educate our children. The reality is that our kids are accessing the internet at a much younger age. I know that even grades 1 and 2 children access the internet not just socially at home but as part of their school activities and as part of their homework. Many schools, state and private, are now setting up homework intranet sites so that children can access their homework electronically. These websites can sometimes make available a link that the children can hit and it takes them to a public website that can have access to other material. We need to educate our children and also their parents, teachers and carers about how we can make these environments safe for them. That is why I also support what the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy is doing with these filters. It is not about putting restrictions on people and it is not about saying that you do not have the right to look at what you want to on an internet site. The reality is that if we do not think this material is suitable for our TVs-cable or free-to-air-and if we do not think they are suitable for our bookshops then we should not give our children access. (Time expired) Donor Conception Support Group of Australia",141
137,Mr IRONS,ADJOURNMENT,"Today the parliament was visited by members of the Donor Conception Support Group of Australia. I have recently become the patron of this organisation and pass on the sincere thanks of the Donor Conception Support Group to my colleagues who attended the presentation they gave. Particular thanks should go to Senator Trish Crossin, who arranged the briefing and facilitated the event. Members and senators from across the political spectrum attended and had many questions to ask the presenters, who ranged from being IVF children who are now adults to IVF parents and sperm donors. The Donor Conception Support Group provides support for: (1) people considering using donor conception; (2) people undergoing treatment; (3) parents of donor offspring; and, (4) donor-conceived people. Representatives came to parliament today to officially present a petition calling for an inquiry into donor conception practices. The group are also trying to achieve a national register, and I hope in the short time. I have that I will be able to convey their argument with a clarity that does them justice. The group were represented by four donor parents, one donor and two donor-conceived persons. Each had their own reasons for being here today and I want to read out some of their comments so that the House can hear their stories and consider their arguments. Damien Adams, who was a donorconceived child, said: After having children of my own I came to realise what my conception had truly deprived me of. I had lost my kinship, my heritage, my identity and my health history. This realisation was crushing, depressing and immensely painful. Geraldine Hewitt, another IVF child, and daughter of Leonie, said: My biological father; my donor-his donor code is JAX. In 1982, he began donating to the Royal Hospital for Women in Paddington, Sydney. He continued to do so for the next three years. During the course of his association with the hospital, four babies were born; 1 boy and 3 girls. I am one of those babies. All of us were born in 1983. I have no further information about my halfsiblings. We all turn 27 this year. From what remains of our donor's records, I can tell you that he was blonde, blue eyed, five foot eight, Caucasian and had 0 positive blood, The hospital social worker once made an offhanded remark that he had a very unusual surname. That's about all that remains, tion, that could identify him. They made sure to destroy his date of birth, his first name and his contact details at the time of donation. Leonie Hewitt, an IVF parent said: We discovered a few years ago that our son's donor had donated to two different clinics in two different states. Kerion my son has a total of 29 half siblings that we know of. A national register should be able to prevent this happening again. The quotes I have just read highlight a number of concerns. Firstly, and most importantly, the people I met today believe in the right of every person to know who their biological family is. As Senator Murray pointed out back in 2003, this is supported by United Nations conventions. Article 8.1 of the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Australia is a signatory, states: States Parties undertake to respect the right of the child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality, name and family relations as recognized by law without unlawful interference. Article 8.2 goes on to say: Where a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity, States Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to re-establishing speedily his or her identity. This need was acknowledged by this government back in November during the apology to the forgotten Australians when it granted funding to CLAN to help forgotten Australians retrace their family trees. The Donor Conception Support Group would argue that this should also extend to their members, and it is this belief that is behind their call to establish a national register so that offspring can find the pathway back to their biological parents. The idea of a national register needs an inquiry-either a House of Representatives or a Senate inquiry. Considering the electoral cycle I would suggest that a Senate inquiry would be in terms of informa- more practical. Secondly, the people I met today believe that the current system is dangerously unregulated. From what I have heard there appears to be very little overall accountability for the donation industry as a whole. The group believe it is this lack of regulation that can lead to incidences like that described by Leonie, who found out her son has a total of 29 half siblings conceived across two states. With sperm donors from across the world there needs to be better regulation. In closing, IVF children have the right to know their medical backgrounds, they have the right to know who their siblings are and they should have the right to contact their donor parent. The support group tells me that only five per cent of donors have been hesitant about a register, and for reasons that can be overcome. This argument will rage and the emotions will run strongly on this issue, but I personally support this register and call on the government to at least get an inquiry underway. International Mother Language Day Greek Language Education",143
138,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the United Nations International Mother Language Day and to talk about the importance of including the Greek language in Australia's national schools curriculum. Last Sunday, 21 February 2010, marked the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation's International Mother Language Day. The purpose of International Mother Language Day is to promote linguistic and cultural versity and multilingualism. The benefits of a multilingual society not be understated. We know that improved language ability increases Australia's ability to engage with the world through trade, education, employment and culture. The Australian government has already demonstrated its commitment to language education by providing $62.4 million in funding over four years for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Schools Program. This program will equip students to participate in an increasingly globalised world, where language will provide the tools to transcend social, political and economic borders. More than five million Australians already speak a language other than English, with the top five languages other than English being Greek, Italian, Cantonese, Arabic and Mandarin. Growing up with Greek parents, I was fortunate to become bilingual at a very early age. We always spoke both English and Greek at home, and it was clear to me then, as it is now, that learning a language is not just about speaking and writing in different sounds and words; it is about lessons in history, culture, music, food and family as well. My ability to speak Greek has opened many doors for me both personally and professionally and it has enriched my life immeasurably. The Greek language has also been passed on to my sons, who are third generation Greek Australians. They learned their Greek both at home and at the bilingual school they attended, St George College. St George College is situated in Adelaide's western suburbs and it offers students a wonderful opportunity to study Greek language, from reception right up to year 12, immersing them in the same culture which many my age just took for granted at home. Encouraging schools to adopt early and continuous language education in our schools will not only provide an opportunity di- for Australians from every background to preserve and maintain their personal heritage canbut also open doors to other worlds they may never have considered. It is timely that, while the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority is devising a ‘shape paper' for phase 2 of its national curriculum, which is due to be released in mid-2010 for consultation, I speak in favour of the implementation of the Greek language as one of the languages to be offered nationally. In terms of significance, Greeks and Greek Cypriots are the seventh largest ethnic group in Australia, with more than 365,000 Australians identifying Greek ancestry in the 2006 census and more than 250,000 Australians speaking Greek at home. Of those 365,000, I have 10,000 in my electorate of Hindmarsh. Greek not only is a widely spoken community language in Australia but also enjoys historical significance as the language of great intellectuals and the most revered religious figures. We can count among them such minds as Plato, Aristotle, Homer and Hippocrates. The New Testament of the Bible was written in Greek. More than five per cent of the English words are borrowed from Greek directly and about 25 per cent were borrowed indirectly. The Greek community in Australia offers a broad and organised support base for the continuation of Greek language education in Australia, together with the government of Greece, which continues its long standing support for Greek education in Australia. I therefore commend to the Australian Curriculum and Reporting Authority the inclusion of Greek as a language in the national schools curriculum, and I look forward to the release of the so-called ‘shape paper' from ACARA in mid-2010, which will frame the discussion for languages education in Australia. I would also like to congratulate the wonderful teachers in my electorate who are committed to teaching Greek-people like Peter Photakis, Mr Frazis and the principal of St George College, George Panagopoulos. (Time expired) Cowan Electorate: Education",144
139,Mr SIMPKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"I like going to schools in Cowan because that is where I get to see so much potential in one place. I get to see the boys and girls in Cowan who could one day achieve great things for our nation, our state of Western Australia and our local community. In this land of opportunity, if young people want to work hard they can achieve great success. It may be international success, it could be national success or it may be realising their potential that sees them become good citizens and good family members. They can achieve maximum success if they are encouraged by their parents through good attitudes and examples, because that will ensure that the child has a good and receptive approach to their own education. Our teachers can then provide the children with formal education, the building block upon which life-long success is based. I know how seriously teachers take their responsibilities, and the level of dedication is always clear. Today I would like to speak about Alinjarra Primary School in Alexander Heights, about how this school is already the biggest influence for a great future in the suburb and about what it is doing to make it even better. The school opened in 1988, and in 2010 it has more than 350 students from kindergarten to year 6. The school is led by Principal Lesley Meyers, and Lesley is assisted by deputies Andrew Schmidt and Janese MCDougall. The leadership team has informed me that in 2010 they are focused on taking the school into the community and also bringing the community into the school. Firstly, I understand that after forming a school choir in 2009, with their choir master at the school for just one day a week, they are planning some big events for later this year, with performances at the Burswood entertainment precinct and at the very big Karrinyup Shopping Centre. Having heard the choir in 2009, I look forward to them making their mark in 2010, and further afield than Alexander Heights, although I know a lot of local residents are looking forward to the forthcoming and highly regarded ANZAC assembly at the school as well as the community carols event at the school at Christmas time. I would also say that the year 3 and year 5 NAPLAN results are consistently above the state average. I think this reflects favourably not only on staff but also on the greater school community, including parents and the children of course. I met a number of students towards the end of last year and they struck me as highly motivated, creative and, not surprisingly, well behaved young people. My contact with the students concerned how elections are run and my visit took place during their school leaders' election campaign. I understand that 24 of the year 6 students have now taken up leadership roles in 2010, as a result of the elections that took place late in 2009. It is worth stating that Alexander Heights is a good suburb. In my view, it is overwhelmingly a suburb where parents and children are motivated to achieve their potentials and make the most of what they have got. This is a place of authenticity, a place where the people are keeping it real. It is therefore a good foundation upon which a school can build a positive educational culture. In the case of Alinjarra Primary School, they are building successful outcomes, beginning with their early childhood area. I understand that the school's outstanding teachers have achieved a strong reputation for excellence with Edith Cowan University, who are now seeking to come to the school and observe their teachers at work. This school celebrates its diversity. Alinjarra is highly active in their Harmony Day Celebrations, as well as NAIDOC and Education Week. Their efforts have seen Alinjarra Primary School featured on several occasions in the local newspapers and also on Channel 9's Weather Watch program. Pushing the work of the students beyond Alexander Heights, I would also refer to the art specialist Val Brooks, who is capitalising on her quality program by holding an art exhibition at Kingsway shopping centre later in the year. Beyond the academic achievements and the success in art and the performing arts, I would also mention pastoral care, another strength that is so much part of Alinjarra Primary School's success. In particular, for the last two years the school's chaplain has been Diane Norris. A highly positive influence in the school, Diane complements the school's emphasis on educating and supporting the whole child. It is easy to be positive about Alinjarra Primary School. Happy and positive children are a sign of a school heading in the right direction. It is also important to realise when the staff and the parents start this next generation off on the right path, those children will be better able to achieve their great potential. For their success and the work they are doing, I congratulate Principal Lesley Meyers, her staff, the students and the parents of Alinjarra Primary School. Immigration",146
140,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT,"In the inquiry currently being conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, which I chair, it is quite clear to me that some common-sense changes are needed to how our immigration process treats disability. In a huge immigration program like Australia has there are always ways of tweaking and improving the system, as the government has recently done with its changes to the skilled migration program. I now turn to some remarks made in the online publication, the National Times, by Mr William Bourke, who announced he is going to launch a new single-issue political party to campaign for cuts to immigration. I welcome that because it will enable the Australian people to voice their opinion about this issue. I confidently predict that Mr Bourke's party will sink without trace as most single-issue parties do. His arguments in the National Times seem to mark him as a left-wing anti-immigration lobby, as opposed to the right-wing anti-immigration lobby represented by Pauline Hanson. In an aside, it is somewhat ironic that this arch critic of immigration imagines that she can just emigrate to the United Kingdom. I am not sure why she thinks that or what value she will contribute there. Returning to Mr Bourke's article, he says, striking a populist note, that immigration benefits only ‘property developers and media moguls'. This is of course nonsense. Immigration benefits the whole that community. It stimulates economic growth and employment. It brings in much-needed skills. It enriches our culture and makes our cities more attractive to tourism. In economic terms, immigration is one of Australia's greatest assets. It may be said that we used to ride on the sheep's back; today we ride on the migrant's back. I will return to that issue in a minute. Further in the article Mr Bourke strikes a green note, blaming population growth for ‘dead river systems, near permanent water shortages and increasing pollution'. Once again, this is nonsense. Australia is not short of water. Our current water problems are the result of generations of waste and neglect of our water resources, aggravated by the current drought. The solution is to stop wasting water, particularly in irrigation but also in our cities. The state and federal governments are currently undertaking plans to do that. Does Mr Bourke not know that Melbourne's water consumption has been cut by 25 per cent over the past 15 years? It is now at the same level it was in 1982, despite urban growth of nearly a million people in that time. Mr Bourke also blames immigration for the loss of farmland, for traffic gridlock and urban congestion, and for the loss of open spaces for our children. All our social ills are apparently caused by population growth fuelled by immigration. I wonder if Mr Bourke has ever been outside Australia. Australia has a population density of three people per square kilometre. Even Victoria, our most densely populated state, has only 62 people per square kilometre. The Netherlands-one of the most important countries in Europe-has 400. I am not advocating that we aim for a Dutch population density; I am saying that Australia is a thinly populated country even by the standards of the developed world let alone by the standards of our region. Our social and environmental problems have not been caused by excessive immigration. They have been caused by wasteful use of our water and other resources, lack of urban planning, short-sighted decision making, excessive reliance on the motor car and neglect of investment, particularly in urban infrastructure. I conclude by saying that one of the things that I find most astonishing about the antiimmigration lobby is their failure to address the issues of the economic benefit of the government's current skilled migration program. Figures that are uncontested and are in the budget papers show that in 2008-09 the current composition of principally skilled migration delivered a benefit to the tax base of $800 million in the first year, and in the 20th year that immigration delivered $1,800 million net benefit to the tax base after the cost of the Humanitarian Program and family reunion. If you looked at that one year of immigration, there is $20 billion of net benefit to the Australian people. How do these people imagine that we are going to pay for the ageing population of Australia as the baby boomers move into retirement without skilled immigrants coming to this country? They have no plan. They have no vision. It is important to address the issues of urban infrastructure, saving water and better public transport. These are all legitimate issues. To say that the current skilled migration program is not contributing to Australia's benefit is very short term; it does not look at the whole picture and certainly does not address the uncontested issues of the economic benefit of the program, as it is currently constituted to Australia.
