2,Mr JENKINS,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is an unexpected pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill. Mr Speaker, as you know, this is a very important matter and I take cognisance of the personal explanation you made last night and the context of the comments you made on behalf of the government at the time of the original legislation. had the pleasure of being on the committee that you chaired, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, when it inquired into sports funding and administration. I was a party to the inquiry entitled 'Can Sport be Bought?' That puts me in a difficult situation on this legislation. I support the legislation. I am disappointed that the opposition, while supporting the legislation, has continually taken the opportunity that this debate gives to chastise the government, saying that this is yet another piece of legislation that has been brought in simply to repair problems that have arisen. In the opposition's eyes, the original legislation was put in in haste. I do not think the government has anything to be ashamed of. In regard to the operation of legislation, the government comes into this place to make the necessary improvements to ensure that legislation we have enacted is achieving its aims. I listened with interest to a number of the contributions last night. Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to review all the contributions, but I found myself in agreement with many of the points that were made by speakers on both sides. (Quorum formed) I thank the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) for ensuring that I have an audience. The issue of tobacco advertising is important. As honourable members mentioned in the debate last night, throughout this parliament we have put in place-as in an overwhelming number of public buildings-a 1995 ban on smoking. I am a little disappointed that some of my colleagues have not necessarily heeded that ban. I do not want to be described as having a Stalinist attitude to this issue, but if it is good enough for other people who work in this building to do the right thing, under the directive of the Speaker and the President, then honourable members should see their way clear and not put themselves above that sort of ban. I was interested in a number of the comments the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) made last night. I was a little shocked and worried that I found myself in I agreement with some of the things he said; Mr Bevis-It is a real worry.",11
3,Mr JENKINS,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is a worry. He has had his left wing clipped, and it is a real worry. The observation he made about the quality of air in this place compared with the quality of air outside wm an observation I made in the last week of sitting. I was shocked, having decided to do the right thing and get out of the airconditicned building, when walking across a number of the courtyards, to find the air outside, e-pecially immediately outside some of the doors of this building, was of an inferior qualit:1 to the processed air conditioned air insid e. Perhaps I c(uld be so bold as to suggest that we need t() look at some way of providing better faci! ities than alongside the doorways of this blilding for those who wish to go outside to f moke. I have got no problem with people (oming to their decision to partake in tob- cco, but one of the real problems of tobac'-o smoking is the secondary effects of that ,moke. Honourable I i1embers might be interested to know it is a di ;cussion that I have often had with my prede< essor. It makes it a bit difficult because I am a bit one-out in my family. Both my parents weI e smokers, although, fortunately, my mothel is no longer a smoker. My brothers are sm0kers, and in family gatherings I ain't got the mmbers, but I try valiantly to fight the fight. One of the arguments that is always put to me is that if I were not to partake in alcchol perhaps they would stop smoking. Mr Snowdo.l1-Gerry Hand did it, didn'the? Mr JENKIl' S-As the honourable member for the Northern Territory reminds me, another ex-member besides my predecessor whom I have a great deal of admiration for is the former melilber for Melbourne. He had a similar view. f ,t some stage down the track, measures-pel haps not to the same extent as the measures we have for tobacco-for alcohol might )e required to be put in place, but it is somet ling that we need to look at. One of the things that people get excited about with tob [cco advertising is its relationship with sport Fortunately, we see that being phased out. k, you know, Mr Speaker, that was one of the central issues that we looked at on the fina Ice and public administration committee. \,'hilst your associations are different from mine, the importance of association with sport were acknowledged in the report. For instance, the AFL club that I have some connection with-not directly in its administration but certainly an emotional attachment-is the Fitzroy footbaH club. It has been sponsored for a number of years by the Quit campaign. That has been a very important and successful association in the public relations and education role. The club has not been as successful on field as it should have been, but that is beside the point. Having clubs such as Fitzroy and others sponsored by the Quit campaign is an important association. Mr Bevis-The Soccer Federation.",11
4,Mr JENKINS,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"--The Soccer Federation, which is an important sporting group, came before the inquiry. It had consciously made the decision to have that association, because it saw that as important. Soccer is a sport that is proud of its junior development, and the federation saw it as an appropriate program to be associated with. Likewise, the national basketball team that I have some emotional attachment to, the North Melbourne Giants, has had a long association with various health campaigns. In fact, its association has been on the side of appropriate use of alcohol. For some years, the sponsorship was with the 'Booze less' campaign and now they are associated with the 'Rage without alcohol' campaign. It is important to note that those in the health foundation that provide the money see that it is valuable to be associated with sport. We are attempting to not only put forward and challenge some of the views of adults in our community but also ensure that younger people in our society are exposed to a range of values that can be important down the track and in later life. It is intriguing to have a look at the purpose of tobacco advertising. Whilst we have the argument from the tobacco companies that promotion of their separate products is either to protect their market share or to readjust their market share, I would contend that promotion of tobacco in any way must continue to influence especially younger people considering taking up the habit of tobacco smoking. That is a difficulty. That may not be the intention of the companies but there is evidence that it is a consequence of their activities. That is why the legislation we have before us in amending the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 is important. It is an important way of sending signals to our younger generations that there is a downside to adopting a habit that they might associate with some sort of glamorous lifestyle. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) set out in his second reading speech, looking at the Australian situation, nearly 19,000 deaths in the year that the original legislation was passed were directly associated with tobacco consumption. As he stated, tobacco consumption costs our country approximately $9.24 billion each year in health, social and economic costs. Interestingly, last night the honourable member for Moreton (M!' Gibson) developed that argument in putting a case to double the amount of excise because he recognised that there was an economic downside to people's continued consumption of tobacco produ-ts. In the report of the US Surgeon-General Preventing tobacco use among young people, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, in her introduction to the report, quoted the statistic for America when she said, 'Smoking kills 434,000 Americans each year.' Taking that American figure and considering activities in other countries around the world, we have a problem of huge dimensions. There is always some direct, but mostly anecdotal, evidence of the way some tobacco companies behave because of contracting markets in more developed countries and their marketing activities in Third World countries. A number of those Third World countries have enormous health problems as it is and they could well do without the pressures of tobacco consumption. So it is important that we view Australia's action in an international dimension. Australia has taken a number of measures at national, state and territory levels which have been seen by overseas countries as important examples of what can be achieved. For example, actions by the Victorian and Western Australian governments highlight active involvement in a wide range of health programs, including those such as the Quit campaign, that try to give people the necessary tools to kick the habit. A number of people I know who smoke acknowledge that they are not doing the right thing by themselves but, because of the addictive nature of the habit, it is very difficult for them to kick the habit. As I have already exposed the attitude of the previous honourable member for Scullin about smoking, in fairness to him I should say one of the contradictions that were brought to my attention on a number of occasions was that in his career as a medical practitioner, one of the first things he quite often did when advising people was to tell them to stop smoking. When I was down the street or around a polling booth, which is when it seemed to happen a lot, people would come up to me and talk about having visited Dr Harry. They said that one of the things that intrigued them was that whilst they felt so much better now that they had been able to kick the habit-(Quorum formed) To finish that anecdote, the contradiction of course is that the former honourable member for Scullin continues to smoke. I might add that at his time of life, all things being equal, it is probably not a real problein to him any more in that any damage has been done. The fact that the habit enables him to be comfortable is a consideration. This is an important piece of legislation. It is an important activity of government to ensure that problems like tobacco consumption and its effect on the health of the nation are addressed. As the figures set out in the second reading speech show, this is a major problem that needs to be addressed. (Time expired)",12
5,Mr CAMERON,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"Stirling) (9.53 a.m.)Today we are debating the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill which seeks to restrict the right of companies to advertise a product which they can legally sell. I think it is ironic that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is associated with this legislation. She is seen by many as a person that many young people would look up to in Western Australia, in fact all over Australia. Mr Johns-They do, too.",13
6,Mr CAMERON,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am sure they do. It is ironic, therefore, that the minister was shown in the Sunday Times newspaper in Perth not so long ago indulging in the unhealthy habit of smoking. In the paper was a photo of 'Puffing Carmen' with a smoke hanging out of her mouth. What a great advertisement for the tobacco companies to have had the then Premier puffmg away on the front of a widely read family newspaper! She is looked up to by many people. I believe the minister has now given up the filthy habit, for which I congratulate her. Nevertheless I hope the fact that she was seen puffing away did not encourage others to smoke. We also had a photograph on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald of a gentleman who is not flavour of the month with the Australian Labor Party at the moment-Kerry Packer---on his way to rugby league headquarters, puffing on a cigarette. One would have thought with his recent health problems that that was not the way to go. If he keeps that up perhaps he will not be a threat to the media of Australia. Two years after the minister for health was seen promoting a habit she was addicted to, she legislates to prohibit its promotion. I speak as a father and grandfather and as one who does not smoke. I have two daughters who used to smoke but, thankfully, they do not any more. One of my daughters is a nurse and she knows of a person who has had all four limbs amputated as a direct result of smoking. Yet, with the stumps of her arms, this woman was still able to put a cigarette her mouth and smoke. This highlights the harmful effects of smoking, the obvious difficulty with forcing people to quit and the definite need to prevent people from taking up the habit. Once people are addicted, it is terribly difficult to break that addiction. There is no doubt that smoking is a death warrant. A cigarette is a lethal, slow killing drug. It is important for us to reduce smoking amongst all Australians. A report of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, entitledAustralia's Health 1994, stated that a most alarming trend is the rapid rise in female lung cancer since the 1960s. The age-standardised death rate rose 5.7 per 100,000 in 1966 to 17.5 per 100,000 in 1992 as a result of women's increased cigarette consumption since the 1940s. There have been declines in lung cancer death rates in men but they remain three times those of women. The proportion of men smoking declined through the 1980s and into the 1990s, and it is expected this will reduce men's lung cancer death rates over the next decade. Smoking rates in women have also declined, but at a slower rate, which may curb the increase in women's lung cancer death rates. There is no doubt about the dangers of smoking. Worse is the frightening statistics about the number of potential cancer victims: that is, young people who smoke and are therefore at a greater risk of getting cancer. The Centre of Behavioural Research into Cancer recently reported an alarming increase in smoking among 13to 17-year-olds. There are now 260,000 secondary school children smoking about 330 million cigarettes, which is costing them $49 million. The Minister for Human Services and Health made us aware of these awful statistics during question time on Monday. Teenage smoking, after initially falling, is again on the rise. The question is: why do people smoke and what starts them smoking? Is it advertising? Is it peer pressure? Is it the tastethough I doubt it---or is it part of all of those and other factors? If it is not advertising, this bill and the act it amends will be useless because, three to five years down the in track, young people will still be smoking. Men and women will still be dying from smoking. I am confident that anti-smoking campaigns and promotions do work and should be continued. In fact, I believe they could be a bit more forthright, like many of our drinkdriving advertisements. They could go along the lines of, 'If you smoke, you're a bloody idiot and you're going to die.' You have to spell it out that bluntly. It is an effective advertisement to stop drink-driving and it would be an even better anti-smoking advertisement. I am not sure whether this bill or the act it amends will be effective. How many kids are influenced to smoke by looking at a sign at the cricket mentioning a brand name of some cigarettes? How many people are actually encouraged to smoke because they have seen a glossy advertisement in the Women's Weekly of a young man and woman on the beach with a cigarette in their hands? Frankly, I do not think cigarette advertising encourages smoking to the extent that perhaps some people think. I am prepared to support this bill if the government thinks it will discourage smoking, and I will support most measures to discourage the habit. In saying that, let me also stress my concern about the inhibition of freedom of speech. I am a great believer and supporter of freedom of speech. While I have no trouble supporting this bill, I still feel a touch hypocritical supporting a bill which prohibits the right of a business to sell a legally available product. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) last year was condemned for making similar comments. She was condemned by the minister for health, the AMA and the Doctors Reform Society. The latter group would perhaps be better known as the Association of Labor Doctors. I had some sympathy for the member for Mackellar. The minister for health was sprouting the dangers of smoking, saying that we need to prevent smoking, that cigarettes are deadly drugs which cost the whole community and so on. Well, if she is so concerned about it, why is she not campaigning for tobacco to be an illegal product? Why ban the as? It is the smokes that kill, not the commercials. It comes back to what the former member for Wentworth, John Hewson, talked about on Monday: honesty and politics. If we are all honest with ourselves, smoking would be illegal.",14
7,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,She doesn't smoke any more.,15
8,Mr CAMERON,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"I believe she has kicked the habit. But, being politicians, we need the money from taxes on smokes and we are afraid we will lose votes if we prohibit the sale of tobacco. As well, we will simply create a big black market for the sale of cigarettes like there is for the more illicit drugs. However, the point I am trying to make is that, if we are to make a significant inroad into preventing smoking, it is not the prevention of advertising of tobacco that will achieve itthough it may make a small contribution. If the minister for health was honest about the facts, it is smoking that should be prohibited, not the advertising of it. By prohibiting smoking advertising, are we reducing the number of people who smoke? Do not get me wrong, I do not like smoking. If prohibiting tobacco advertising saves lives then, notwithstanding my support for freedom of speech, I will support the bill. But, at the end of the day, will the measure be effective? Will it greatly reduce smoking? A survey of Victorian school students in 1992 found that the most prevalent drugs used by students were licit drugs-pain relievers, alcohol and tobacco--which were also perceived by students as the least dangerous drugs. It is unfortunate that people so young are taking up the habit, in the belief that smoking is not dangerous. The survey also revealed that, by year 11, 78 per cent of students had tried smoking and 24 per cent were. regular daily smokers. In year 9, females smoked proportionally more than males. However, by year 11, the gender difference had disappeared. These statistics are certainly a worry. It is therefore important for the government to do its utmost to discourage smoking by all people, in particular to prevent young people taking up the habit. Such preventative campaigns are much more effective than prohibiting companies advertising a legal product. Many advertisements in Western Australia have been aimed at discouraging smoking. I believe the falling number of smokers is a result of them, and I am more comfortable supporting these campaigns first. I conclude by making a number of points to prevent my being misrepresented. I fully and unequivocally support free speech. I do not like smoking and will support most measures to reduce smoking and therefore save lives. lone day hope that the vast majority of, if not all, Australians choose not to smoke without the need for prohibition. Having enunciated my reservations with it, I nevertheless do not oppose this legislation.",15
9,Mr HAVILAND,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am pleased to support the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill, which amends the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992. The amendments to the principal act are, as we have heard, technical in nature-arising from a court case-and seek to clarify the meaning of the act. Tobacco smoking is now widely acknowledged as the major cause of preventable death and disease in Australia. A staggering 19,000 Australians each year die from smoking related illnesses. Tobacco consumption costs Australia the enormous amount of over $9 billion a year in health,social and economic costs. It also causes cardiovascular disease, which is Australia's biggest health problem, and is the largest cause of death from cancer in Australian males. The national health policy on tobacco has the support of all state and territory governments as well as the national government. All governments have a responsibility to take a strong stand towards reducing tobacco consumption, which is why limiting tobacco advertising is so important as we try to discourage young people from smoking. I note with interest that many of the speakers in this debate have related their own personal history of whether they have smoked and how they feel about smoking. I have always considered myself very fortunate in this respect because I have never been a smoker. I have never had any desire to be a smoker. Neither of my parents smoked. I recall that in my very early years my parents influenced me on what a dirty, filthy habit it is. I certainly believe today that it is a dirty, filthy, disgusting habit but, unfortunately, one which some people-including friends of mine-are addicted to. I feel sorry for them. My father smoked for a brief period during the Second World War when he was in the air force but he quickly gave it up after the war. My mother never smoked and, unlike a lot of other children my age at the time, I never had any desire to smoke. In fact, I have always had a very negative view of smoking. In 1960 I was in grade 3 and eight years old. I remember we were shown a film at school which, for the times, was fairly graphic. It showed the lungs of a smoker compared with the lungs of a non-smoker. (Quorum/armed) As I was saying, when I was eight years old, I saw a very graphic film about the evils of smoking, which certainly had a lasting impression on me. It is not as though I needed to see the film because, as I have already explained, I never had any desire to be a smoker. I guess there was a time when, like most teenagers, I was a bit curious about smoking. When I was out with friends, I had a few puffs on a cigarette but, whenever I inhaled, I doubled over and nearly choked. Two or three times after that I tried it again, and the same thing happened. That certainly reinforced my view that smoking was not for me. Because of my total aversion to smoking and my incapability to smoke, I have never had any desire to smoke marijuana. A lot of honourable members have probably tried that from time to time, and I do not pass judgment on them. I have certainly never tried marijuana, for the same reason that I do not smoke cigarettes: inhaling smoke is something that I find repUlsive. All that was back in the 1960s, when I was a teenager. In those days there was not as much public awareness about smoking and the damage that it could cause. There were some reports saying that smoking could cause lung cancer, and we all know that is true. As was revealed the other day in the House, the Menzies cabinet had the opportunity to place restrictions or a ban on tobacco advertising smoking but its members did not think it was necessary. They were more concerned about the profits of the tobacco industry than that of public health in Australia. Like much of what happened during the Menzies years, that is to be regretted. During the 1970s and certainly the 1980s the term 'passive smoking' was introduced into the debate. I think the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) talked about passive smoking. As smoking is not allowed inside this building, a lot of people can be found smoking outside, where the air is more polluted than it is inside. That is a bit of a worry. Basically, even if you are a non-smoker, you still inhale smoke as a result of other people's smoking. During the 1980s there was quite a bit of legal discussion about passive smoking. I recall that one or two workers claimed compensation in the courts for becoming ill as a result of passive smoking. An Attorney General's opinion indicated that an employer may be liable if an employee suffered an illness or a disease as a result of other employees smoking in the workplace. That was a matter of some concern to employers. I remember vividly that in 1986 the federal Department of Health-which is quite appropriate-decided to take the lead and smoking was banned in all the department's workplaces from 1 December 1986. That was the first time this had happened in Australia and the federal Department of Health was a leader in the field. The department's action caused a bit of debate at the time, but it was the decision. Over the years that decision has been confirmed. I was a union delegate in the department in those days. My union certainly supported a smoke free workplace, but we had union members who smoked. There was an attempt to reach a compromise whereby smokers could go off and smoke in a smoking room or whatever. The department took the view that, as the boss had to pay for that, it was not a good way to spend public money. In retrospect, I guess that was the correct view. In 1988 the Australian Public Service as a whole adopted the smoke free workplace, and once again it had the support of the trade union movement, despite the fact that some union members were smokers and had some difficulty with the ban. The anti-smoking debate-particularly the debate about tobacco advertising-was also the subject of some colourful debates within the Australian Labor Party. I can recall that on at least two occasions at the New South Wales annual conference of the Australian Labor Party-which can sometimes be colourful events-a couple of very vigorous debates about tobacco advertising occurred. At the New South Wales conferences most debates are decided on factional lines, no matter what the topic might be or how controversial it might be. The smoking debate was not decided on factional lines. It was a very closely contested debate. The numbers were unusually close in a couple of those debates. There must have been a lot of support for the Left's hardline position on tobacco advertising in those debates. I was an alderman on the Campbelltown City Council and I recall that we had a difficult situation in relation to the Campbelltown sports ground. The Labor council, with the support of progressive independents, wanted to ban smoking in all council buildings-which it did-and wanted to ban advertising at council owned venues. That created a difficulty at Campbelltown sports ground because it is the home ground Of Western Suburbs Rugby League Club. That club plays in the Winfield Cup competition. The club had to have tobacco advertising at right Campbelltown sports ground as part of its qualifications for playing in the competition. That created all sorts of legal and political problems. They were not satisfactorily resolved at the time. The advertising continued. I believe that the passage of this bill and the subsequent phasing out of tobacco advertising will resolve that problem. I support this bill because it is important that we do everything we possibly can to encourage young people not to smokeparticularly in the context of sporting sponsorship. Cricket all over Australia, and rugby league in half of Australia, are amongst the most popular sports, both from a participant and spectator point of view. It seems to me to be unsatisfactory that for many years both of those sports have been sponsored by tobacco companies. I know from experience that both cricket and rugby league administrations have been proud to be associated with the sponsors. They have been loyal sponsors and have provided a lot of money to allow those games to develop. They have been very supportive. Despite that, I believe that it is a bit of a national disgrace that two of our most popular sports-we must remember that sport is about promoting health and fitness and healthy activity-are sponsored by tobacco companies. I will be pleased to see that cease as soon as practicable after the passage of this legislation. Sport is about health and about our future. I believe that not only will the cessation of tobacco advertising for major sport be good for the health of the nation and a positive and progressive step for our health overall but I also believe it is in the long-term interests the sports. Maybe with pay television and the debate surrounding it-with the megabucks coming into carry sport on television-some of this debate might be irrelevant in a few years time. Nevertheless, I think it is in the long-term interests of the sporting codes as well as the health of the nation that. we get tobacco sponsorship out of sport. I know that sponsorship for major sport, especially these days, is very important. Many major sports would not survive without it. But for their long-term benefit, for their long-term ability to survive as sports that attract young people as players and as spectators, it is in their interests not to be associated with products like tobacco. I am very pleased to support this legislation. crops. Hopefully it will clear up some of the problems that seem to have arisen from previous legislation. I commend the bill to the House.",16
10,Mr LIEBERMAN,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"Indi) (10.16 am.}- Mr Deputy Speaker, I represent the people who grow tobacco in the state of Victoria. As many honourable members know, there is a very large section of the rural economy in north-eastern Victoria-mainly in Myrtleford and the valleys surrounding it-where, for many years, hard working families have grown tobacco. Many of them were from other countries originally, from Italy particularly. They are very highly respected and good citizens of our nation but they have been the meat in the sandwich in the debate surrounding the use of tobacco in Australia. In fact, until recent changes to the law, could not grow tobacco without having a quota licence, which was issued through the Victorian parliament. We have had this odd situation where, on the one hand, governments, state and federal, have been attempting to persuade people through various ways not to smoke tobacco; on the other hand, federal and state. governments have encouraged farmers to invest their capital and time in farming operations to grow tobacco. So we can see there is something of a paradox there. I have had the difficult task of trying to represent those citizens as they are entitled to be represented, both in my previous life as a state member and now as a federal member. of I wanted to put that on record t6 let honourable members know that there are a lot of very decent people in Australia-farmers who grew tobacco in the past and farmers who still do-who, it should always be remembered, are innocent bystanders in a way and whose rights should be protected and respected. I welcome moves by the state governments and the federal government in the last year or so to assist many farmers to adjust out of tobacco. There is now a complex arrangement between federal and state governments and the manufacturers whereby funds are being made available to assist tobacco farmers to get out of growing tobacco, to sell some of their smaller quotas to larger farmers so there will be fewer growers, and to readjust into other In my area of Indi-in the Myrtleford area and the valleys-we are very excited because of the alternative crops that are now being researched and developed, such as grapes for wine. We already produce the best wines in Australia---':'Milawa, Brown·· Brothers and Rutherglen, which we all know-and now some of the tobacco farmers, some of them third and fourth generation, are plucking up the courage to get into a new crop, and they are doing very well. I predict that the Ovens and King valleys will become very famousmore famous than they are now-as producers of fine wine. We all wish them well. We also have a new industry being developed whereby mint oil is produced. Most of our supplies are imported. Our needs for they confectionary and perfume are virtually all supplied by imported mint oil. Farmers in my electorate in both the areas I have mentioned plus in the upper Murray and Corryong are having a go at producing mint oil. They are doing quite well and it is a fantastic situation. We hope that these farmers who have worked hard in the tobacco industry will find a livelihood and a future for themselves and their children with that crop. It will help our balance of trade figures if we can replace the imported mint oil with Australian produced mint oil. We are also seeing the emergence of high quality vegetable crops. There were some experimental crops of cauliflower grown last season in the Myrtleford area. I amtold that the quality was absolutely phenomenal-the sugar content in all the cauliflowers was amongst the highest that has ever been prothis duced in Australia and the crop ripened couple of weeks earlier than the traditional crop in Australia. Our hope is that enough farmers will work cooperatively, with the assistance of federal and state governments and with some advice and research, to duce sufficient quantities of high quality vegetables so that we can supply some of Australian domestic markets and also win some export markets-flying our fresh tables directly from north-eastern Victoria the Asian markets. There are lots of good things going on. I wanted to weave that brief summary of what is going on and to remind members that there are some pretty decent people involved in this debate. I had a lot to Cancer Council of Victoria as a former After that dateassistant minister for health and minister for health in the state of Victoria. I always appreciated that Dr Nigel Gray always tobacco made it absolutely clear that his campaign to support. have action taken to dissuade people from using tobacco was not directed against the tobacco farmers in any shape or form. I have always appreciated that because it is important for morale and for what is right that these people be treated with great respect. It is in that context that I wanted to mention that, for the last 35 years in Myrtleford, there has been a very famous festival called the tobacco, hops and timber festival. It is a coming together of the community, which is also a centre for the timber and hops tries. The community celebrates its hard work through the year and uses the festivities of festival to raise money for local charities. It is good fun, and everyone gets involved in it. The concern of the festival committee is that, with this legislation-and Susan Bums, the coordinator, has written to me-it will not be possible to continue the festival, firstly because of the name of the festival, the tobacco, hops and timber festival; and, secondly, because the festival's success has been able to be carried on only with the support of some limited, but substantial; sponsorship by the tobacco manufacturers. As you know, the act this bill amends and bill deal with the future ability of people a to acknowledge sponsorships. I have written to the government-the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)-on this issue on behalf of the festival and the community. I prothank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr the Theophanous) for his letter of 7 February 1995 in which he says that the existing act vegedoes not prevent the acknowledgment of into sponsors of tobacco manufacturers in the festival. However, it does say that that is the case until the end of 1995. The question the community wanted to raise was: what is the position for the future both under the existing act and the amending bill? I thank the parliamentary secretary for his letter of 7 February do with the Antiin which he stated: shadow that is, the end of 1995companies could still sponsor the Festival receiving in return limited acknowledgment of thei; It seems that the government, through the parliamentary secretary, is acknowledging the relevance and historical nature of the event. The government acknowledges that it will be possible for the festival to continue to be sponsored in part, at least, as I understand it, by the tobacco manufacturers and, for that matter, the tobacco growers that will remain in that area, because it is the governmenf s policy that there will still be tobacco growers in Australia. That is quite firm. Both state and indusfederal governments confirm that. The situation should be cleared up. I would the like the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns) to talk to the minister and also the parliamentary secretary in order to give some further clarification to the future arrangements so that the people do not unwittingly commit a breach of the law. They do not want to do that: they are very law abiding citizens. It is important that we get the position right. I have asked the festival committee to let me have a draft of what it anticipates its program would look like for 1996, a copy of which I propose to send to the government. I will ask the government to have some input into the preparation of the program, because I think we all need to work together to come to a satisfactory conclusion. When I was in the Victorian parliament I assisted in the drafting of an amendment to the Victorian act dealing with the control of advertising of tobacco products. Section 9 of the Victorian Tobacco Act 1987 provided: Nothing in this section shall apply to the annual festival known as the Myrtleford Tobacco Hops Timber Festival. I am very happy to say that the parliament of Victoria almost unanimously supported the continuation of this very important, historical and cultural event. That is still the law in Victoria, despite the changes of governmentthe Cain-Kirner government and now the Kennett government. There is certainly precedent for parliaments to give special acknowledgment to this sort of festival without undermining the basic thrust of the legislation dealing with advertising generally. I felt then and I still feel now that there is a lot of hypocrisy by the governments, past and present, in this debate. They are very quick to take vast sums of money each year by way of tobacco excise tax levies--ever increasing. They use that to fund their basic budgets now. Those taxes are not allocated directly to the health portfolio so that we can expand our health programs. They are gobbled up by the general consolidated revenue appetite, and under Labor, an ever increasing one, and there is no way that this government-and to be honest, there is no way that a government that I hope to be part of soonwill be able to afford to give away in the next decade or so that vast sum of annual income. On the one hand, the government wants to keep the income coming in from the sales of tobacco through excise taxes but, on the other hand, it wants to go through these health programs to persuade people to better look after themselves, and I obviously support those programs. There is no quarrel from my point of view about the need for Australians to improve their health and to avoid activities that will diminish their health. But there is hypocrisy. I found it offensive, to be honest, to be a local member representing tobacco growers in the state parliament and now the federal parliament now that it is legislating to exclude national sporting functions, such as the cricket, that so many Australians enjoy, from application of the prohibition. The legislation provides that these sporting functions can continue to be advertised and sponsored by tobacco companies. But when people who are the salt of the earth, hard working people in and the farming communities, want to seek an exemption for little festivals like this, it is not on. I appreciate the government's response through the parliamentary secretary, but I asked him, 'Why won't the government give a specific exemption like the Victorian act does?' But, no, it seems we cannot do that. We are not allowed to. Translated, that means Myrtleford is too little. It is not significant and it does not have the big muscles of the cricket national television coverage which is allowed, under the present act, to have tobacco sponsorship. I find that hypocritical. I do not accept it as being right. It is time that the parliament picked up the opportunity to be fair to everybody, small fish or large fish, and acknowle,dge that there are some functions, such as the national cricket and other famous sporting events that attract so many visitors to' A ustralia, where there will be a continuation of some sort of sponsorship by manufacturers. The Myrtleford tobacco and hops festival should be treated in the same way. I wonder whether the minister will take that message to his colleagues? It is given in good faith. I am not trying to make it more difficult for government in these matters but it is right, as the local member, that I put the request on record. I think there is a damned good case for the Myrtleford tobacco, hops and timber festival to be given a specific exemption, rather than its having the vagaries of deciding whether from year to year the program is drafted correctly so we do not have to face prosecutions in years to come. Let us try to help these people because they are damned good people and deserve that help. In conclusion, I extend a very warm invitation to all members of parliament and their families to come along on the Labour Day weekend-on 11, 12, 13 and 14 March-and enjoy the festival, the hospitality and the friendship of the people of Myrtleford, and to see for themselves the results of these people's hard work over many years and their contribution to Australia.",18
11,Mr MARTYN EVANS,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"-It is very good to see the degree of bipartisanship which is part of the flavour of debates of this kind. It has always been my experience in health debates revolving around the prohibition of tobacco advertising, to a greater or lesser degree, in the state parliament and now in the federal parliament that there is a significant degree of bipartisanship about these matters. There are certainly arguments at the margins about degree and about the extent of exemptions, for example. But with the exemption of one or two opposition spokesmen in the recent past-and I think that situation has now changed quite significantly-both sides of this House and both sides of politics in country agree that tobacco sponsorship, tobacco advertising and tobacco consumption generally are a serious threat to the health of Australians at large and, in particular, a serious threat-albeit a deferred one-to the health of young people. Those are some of the issues I would like to canvass in my contribution to this debate today. Any debate about smoking and tobacco consumption and the historical context must be considered over a very long period of time. I think the harsh reality is that history will judge Sir Walter Raleigh very sharply. I would not be surprised to find that he becomes known as one of the greatest mass murderers in history. In defence of his memory, I would have to say that, at the time, there was no way he could have known the consequences of his bringing tobacco to the Old World and starting the spread of that substance-that drug-throughout what we now know as Western society and, increasingly, to developing countries. I think it is very important to see just what the consequences of his actions will be. Recent studies have shown and latest estimates indicate that by the year 2025 cigarettes will be killing 10 million people a year. It is not too far off-some 30 years from nowthat 10 million people a year around the world will die from smoking. That eclipses anything which any other person involved in trying to kill human beings has ever achieved. I think that kind of tally is something which we have to take note of. The statistics come in thick and fast. I know many of my colleagues on both sides of the House have indicated in this debate just how terrible some of those statistics are. But if we look a few years into the future we will see this on a global basis, which is the only real way of doing it when looking at the impact of tobacco smoking, and realise that it will be the cause of death of some 10 million people a year around the world. That really puts this kind of debate in perspective. If we examine this at a more mundane and economic level, in both the United States and Australia, because they are the two countries for which more precise figures are available, this we can see that the cost in dollar terms-not in terms of people's lives but dollar termshas reached a staggering $US52 billion per year, which includes all the cost of things like fire insurance, damage and health related costs put together. In the United States, the economic cost of tobacco is in the order of $52 billion a year. This puts into some perspective the comments of the previous speaker about governments and their revenue raising requirements. I intend to say a bit more about that shortly. When we look at revenue from tobacco products, we have to take into account the very enormous costs to society and to governments at large of tobacco smoking. If we look at that $52 billion in more personal terms, we will see that it puts the cost of tobacco smoking at something like $8,000 per smoker per year. Of course, there are costs which go beyond the direct economic costs. Those people who smoke are likely to have 6.5 days greater absenteeism from work each year than a non-smoker. That has enormous productivity flow-on costs right throughout the economy, both private and public. We also have the impact of deaths from passive smoking-the environmental tobacco smoke question, which is far more uncertain and subject to much more debate these days. In the United States alone, the latest estimates indicate that 3,000 to 5,000 people die each year from environmental tobacco smoke. We can translate many of those figures into the Australian context and look at the impact of 20,000 deaths alone in Australia per year. When we translate those figures into a more personal measure that each of us in this House can relate to, we find that we are talking about something like two of our constituents per week dying from tobacco related illnesses. If we think of it in that context-that is, two constituents per week dying from tobacco related illnesses-we realise the real cost of smoking to Australia and to the families in our area and the way in which that impacts not only on their own personal lives--on income forgone for that family, lost opportunities and the loss of loved ones-but also on Australia, the dramatic personal cost to Australia and the economy as a whole. The reason for the legislation that we have before us today relates to recent High Court decisions and the need to ensure that this legislation remains viable and is not able to be attacked at a straightforward level by the tobacco companies. The changes we have seen in the High Court recently have meant that we have to be ever much more vigilant about the way in which our legislation is cast. Something which would have been quite clear and unchallengeable a while ago is now subject to challenge on some very interesting grounds. The recent political advertising case certainfew. ly brought out the interests which we must seek to protect in legislation of this kind, which, in my view, do not go to freedom of speech. The reality is that this is a debate about preventing ill health, about saving the lives of Australians, young and old, and is not a debate about political free speech. Nonetheless, I acknowledge that the High Court is capable of finding those issues in legislation of this kind. Therefore, it is essential in protecting that greater good that this parliament ensures the legislation, so far as possible, is beyond attack in the courts. It is very instructive to have a look at some of the words of the High Court in relation to those issues. The justices who looked at this matter-in fact, all six justices who were present on that case-held that freedom of political discourse was the subject of an implied constitutional protection but that this freedom was not absolute. Their Honours recognised that this freedom, although important, may be subject to more important competing interests such as national security, the administration of justice or other laws necessary in an ordered and democratic society. In order to determine which interests should prevail, obviously a balancing process must take place. The court indicated quite clearly that parliament was the organisation which should seek to find that balance in the first instance and that the role of the court would merely be a supervisory one where parliament had exceeded its authority. Justice Brennan in his decision stated: The balancing of the protection of other interests against the freedom to discuss governments and political matters is, under our Constitution, a matter for the Parliament to determine and for the Courts to supervise. The role of the court in judicially reviewing a law that is said to curtail the freedom unduly and thereby to exceed legislative power is supervisory. It declares whether a balance struck by the Parliament is within or without the range of legislative choice. In a society vigilant of its democratic rights and privileges, it might be expected that the occasions when the Parliament deliberately steps outside the range of legitimate choice would be It is also important to note the judgment of Chief Justice Mason where he says: ... only a compelling justification will warrantthe imposition of a burden on free communication by way of restriction and the restriction must be no more than is reasonably necessary to achieve the protection of the competing public interest which is invoked to justify the burden on communication. I think this legislation does just that. The kinds of facts which I and speakers on both sides of this House have discussed-in relation to the burden on the health of Australians and the vulnerability of young people in regard-more than justify the prohibitions which this act imposes and the further prohibitions sought to be imposed by these amendments. However, they do contain a number of exemptions designed to ensure that, where there is a legitimate right of free speech to exercised by tobacco companies, they are a position to do so and that the law does not necessarily burden or constrain which the High Court would find would impinge against the right of political free speech. This is not a US first amendment freedom as such; this is a right of speech which must be balanced against other interests in our society. In this case those interests overwhelming. They relate to the health of the nation and to public safety. No interest, from perhaps national security, could be more important for this parliament to defend. When we look at this legislation, it is important to take into account the reasons why we seek to prohibit advertising. It is instructive to look at the undertakings of the tobacco companies themselves. has been the most profitable company in the United States in recent years. Its profitability reaches a staggering level. In 1992 Philip Morris was the seventh largest industrial corporation in the US, with $US50 billion annual sales. However, when these corporations were ranked according to profit, in 1992 Philip Morris, with a profit of $US4.9 billion, more money than any other company in the United States, which reflects the fantastic ettes. level of profits which cigarette manufacturers enjoy. The product is very cheap to produce and, of course, can be sold at quite high prices. With very small increases in the price of the cigarettes, they are able to substantially increase their profit margins even further. But the fact that a company like Philip Morris should be able to tum in a profit of $US4.9 billion trading-as it does-almost exclusivelyon the health, ill-health and, indeed, the death of individuals in our society, is something which should make this House and this parliament take very strong notice of. I hope that it is an issue which would also weigh this very heavily on the justices of the High Court, were it to be required to judge this matter. The impact of tobacco advertising is quite significant, and we can follow its trends over recent years. Indeed, in 1925 the average consumption was of the order of 1,000 cigarbe ettes per adult per year, which translates into in one pack of 20 a week. That grew very steadily and the main trigger for that growth them in a way was World War I. Over the course of World War I, tobacco consumption went up 1Y2 times and then fell because of the Great Depression-thus reflecting the economic uncertainties of the timesbut then grew steadily again until World War are II started in 1940, at which point we were on 2,000 cigarettes per adult per year. However, apart by the end of World War II, we were up to nearly 3,500 cigarettes per adult per year. From that point onwards, it continued to grow until it plateaued in about 1960-65 at something over 4,000· cigarettes per adult per year-a very substantial growth from 1925 to 1965, from 1,000 to just over 4,000 cigarettes Philip Morris per adult per year. That growth was clearly driven by a couple of things: the rise of the mass consumer marketing society which that period reflected very substantially; and the increasing wealth in of ordinary people over that period, which was quite a significant factor. Also the contributions of World War I and World War II could not be understated in that context. made However, the increase also reflected the increasing power of addiction of those cigarOnce smokers start that habit, it is very hard to give it up. I have never tried myself, so I cannot comment on the reality of that. But those I know who have tried to give up smoking-the efforts of the Quit campaign, of medical practitioners and of smokers forced to resort to nicotine patches and the like-all testify to the difficulties involved. Consumption remained very high until about the mid-1970s when it began a downward spiral. As at 1990, we had dropped to just below 3,000 cigarettes per adult per year. These figures reflect a number of changes in society as well: the non-smokers rights movement which started back in 1975; the massive increases in federal and state taxes which took place during the 1980s; and the health warnings and the massive publicity given to the health risks associated with tobacco over that period, which resulted in a significant downturn in tobacco consumption. Looking at the impact of cigarette advertising, we see that tobacco companies, very wisely from their point of view, focus it quite clearly on young people. It is their intention to secure a market at a very young age, knowing that that will give them consumers for a very long time---consumers who will be quite insensitive to changes in price. If we do not ensure that young people are not caught by the tobacco habit at a very young age, we will never succeed in altering the health and smoking habits of older Australians. While we have had very significant prohibitions on tobacco advertising in this country for some time, there are very few effective case studies-although if you look at the way in which young people pick up particular brands of cigarettes in different states, which reflects the outcomes of different promotional campaigns in those states, you can see the effectiveness of tobacco advertising. One of the most striking examples of why we must vigilantly seek to maintain this ban is that of the Camel cigarette company in the United States. It is quite interesting to look the data from that case. The Camel cigarette advertising campaign clearly has children as its principal target group. In 1988, with Camel sales declining, RJR Nabisco launched a marketing campaign featuring Old Joe Camel-a smooth character, presumably modelled after someone like James Bond. In the adverts, Old Joe rides motorcycles, shoots pool and associates with attractive women while smoking Camel cigarettes. Three years into the campaign, surveys showed that 14 per cent of adults over the age of 18 identified Camel as the most advertised cigarette brand in the United States, whereas 29 percent--double the number--ofteenagers 12 to 17 years of age and a staggering 34 per cent of 12to 13-year-olds believed Camel was the most advertised brand. Even more striking is another survey which showed that 30 per cent of three-year-olds and over 80 per cent of six-year-olds are able to associate a picture of Old Joe Camel with a packet of cigarettes. Among six-year-olds, the same percentage associated the package of cigarettes with Old Joe Camel as were able to associate a picture of the Disney channel logo with Mickey Mouse. Those kinds of statistics indicate very clearly the pattern in advertising which has been adopted in the United States to target young people in particular. The fact that those as young as three and six years old are able to so clearly identify with the brand of a particular packet of cigarettes is a very frightening statistic indeed. The cigarette companies have continued to pursue those policies right throughout the world, and particularly in developing countries where they hope to develop further campaigns which will ensure that young people in those countries with substantially higher population bases are addicted to the product as well. The tobacco companies have never ceased to deny the risks associated with tobacco smoking in a way which I think is quite reprehensible. Indeed this has brought about a trend in the United States where the state of Florida has initiated very interesting legislation, which I understand is now being picked up by the United States Congress and which at may eventually have to be picked up here. Florida has adopted an amendment to its legislation which insists that cigarette makers can be sued by the state itself for the health costs of tobacco related illnesses. In the case of Florida, it is suing the tobacco companies for reimbursement of about $300 million a year in Medicaid expenses for smoking related illnesses. That legislation is through the Florida parliament, it has been enacted by the governor, and legal cases are already pending in Florida. It represents a very significant legislative change in the way in which these matters are administered. If we are to be serious about tobacco control and tobacco legislation, it is essential that we pursue the kinds of advertising regulations and restrictions which this act encompasses. I certainly commend to the House, and indeed at some future point no doubt to the courts, the benefits of this legislation to the Australian people. Debate (on motion by Mr Beazley) adjourned.

17,Mr TICKNER,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (10.56 a.m.)-I move: That Senate amendments Nos 1 to 3 made in place of request not pressed, and further amendments Nos 4 to 17,23 to 27, 31 to 33,35,41 to 4-, 45 to 48, 51 to 56, 63 and 65 (Group 1) be disagreed to. Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to speak again on what the government believes is a historic piece of legislation. I want to begin by again putting on the record the government's motivation in bringing this legislation before the House. In 1992 the High Court of Australia brought down the historic Mabo decision. That decision changed for all time the position of i-digenous people in this country. It recogmsed that there were still some indigenous p-ople wh? could trace back their relationship wIth certam parts of land for time immemorial-long before non-indigenous Australians ever came to these shores. But, as we all now know, the extent of the existence of native title is finite and is, in the government's view going to be far more limited than was expected when the Mabo decision first came down. To his great credit and the credit of the nation, in the historic Redfern speech made in Redfern park in Sydney, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made it clear that the Mabo decision was to be a historic turning point. He made it clear that it was to be the basis of a new relationship between indigenous and nonindigenous Australians, and that it was going to make a very significant contribution to the reconciliation process. The government then put in train a series of consultations and negotiations, which went for an extended period. As a result of those negotiations, the government developed a three-stage response to the High Court decision in the Mabo case. The first stage was the Native Title Act. That 48, act will remain for all time as one of the great achievements of our federal Labor government. I believe that with the passage of time that legislation and the protection it gives to ' , native title will gain the full endorsementindeed, the unanimous support-of this parliament. Regrettably, it did not pass through the parliament with that unanimous support on the first occasion, but I am confident that the tide will tum and that, before the end of the decade, unanimous support will be forthcoming. The second stage of the government's response is the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994. I will tum in detail to that in a moment. That bill has been the subject of considerable debate both inside and outside the parliament. The third stage response has been referred to as the social justice package. That offers both the coalition and the government an opportunity to start afresh. It offers us the opportunity to look at the reports that come from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, of which the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) is a member. It enables us to look at the report coming in the month ahead from ATSIC and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. Those reports will raise challenging i-s.ues for both the government and the oppoSItIOn. Since the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is in the chamber, I want to say to him and the shadow minister, with all the conviction and sincerity I can muster, that the government will be seeking the greatest degree of cross-party support for the way in which we deal with that social justice package. It will raise some very challenging and difficult issues, but I am confident that, if allow a proper process of consultation and discussion of these issues, we will be able to achieve a large measure of cross-party support. Despite what the Leader of the Opposition may occasionally think of me-and the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), would confirm this to him-I come to this portfolio with a genuine commitment to achieve cross-party cooperation. I hope that we can move back to a far greater degree of cross-party cooperation, if it is at all achievable. The amendments the government is not supporting have been referred to by Senator Evans as the seven deadly sins, and we are not supporting the other amendments for good reason. May I take a bit of the House's time to refer in a measured and considered way to our reasons for not supporting the amendments. The government will be supporting a very large number of amendments and, even as late as yesterday, Senator Evans was prepared to accept another amendment, which was picked up with the motions that were moved this morning. This matter came on for debate in the Senate yesterday. My good friend Senator Teague missed the original vote and, as a further demonstration of the government's bona fides, the matter was recommitted. One of the amendments concerns the requirement that priority of land allocation be given to the most disadvantaged in relation to their access to land or to those who are unable to gain substantive title to land. A number of amendments are opposed by the government because we believe they are contrary to the fundamental principles of the bill. For very considered reasons, other amendments are opposed because the government believes that they would make the bill unworkable-and this is one of the amendments the government considers would have that effect. I pose the question as to what the definition of access might be. Is it to be defined in some physical sense? In some states and the Northern Territory, guaranteed access to pastoral we leases exists in legislation. Can that be compared with the rights conferred by full ownership? To the Aboriginal people in New South Wales, I pose the question: is the word 'access' to be defined in some structural sense-that is, access to land acquisition programs or possession of legislative rights to claim land, regardless of whether the claim would be successful? If that were the interpretation adopted, Aboriginal people in New South Wales would go to the absolute bottom of the queue. There is a further difficulty in relation to people who may be unable to gain substantive title to land. In relation to people who have made a native title or other claim to land which they ultimately may not be able to prove, the question arises as to how they fit into this amendment. There is a great deal of uncertainty which would lead to great difficulties in the operation of the fund. Of further concern is the matter of assessing priority in the allocation of land fund moneys. We believe that should be left to the Indigenous Land Corporation board, which in the absence of legislative prescription will be able to take into account the diversity of the needs of indigenous people. I tum now to the issue of grants to individuals and trustees. I ask honourable members to think very seriously about this matter. This amendment was supported by the coalition and by the Greens. Again, we ask the coalition to think very seriously about it. We think it amounts to a radical-I use that word advisedly-and adverse change in relation to Commonwealth grants to indigenous people for the purchase of land. If the parliament carried the opposition's view, it would be the first time in the entire history of Commonwealth legislative action in respect of indigenous people since the 1967 referendum that grants would be made to individual people. We do not think that is good policy. It is certainly not the policy of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The coalition's stated rationale for the amendment is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be treated like other Australians who are not required to incorporate in order to have title to land. At first blush, that argument has some substance. However, there is a counterargument which we believe ought to prevail; that is, other Australians do not have access to the land fund. This is a special case of positive discrione mination designed to address past injustice. The land fund provides an avenue for indigenous people in addition, to that which is available to other Australians. No-one on this side of the parliament has ever suggested that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should not be free to pursue ordinary means of acquiring land. Please do not suggest or think that we suggest everything for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia must be communal. One of my great hopes, which I am sure is shared by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), is to see an increasing number of entrepreneurial individual Aboriginal peopleand I think we are already seeing thismaking a success of investment, land ownership and business.· But that is not the purpose of this fund. Again, that is one of the reasons why we do not support the amendment. The Senate committee established to look into the matter purported to assert that individual ownership was traditionally accepted in some indigenous communities. The committee referred to evidence given by Mr Donald Whaleboat, a Torres Strait Islander. When I looked closely at the evidence given, I found that the Torres Strait Islander was not asserting principles of individual ownership but principles of family ownership. Of course, that is a characteristic of indigenous land ownership in the Torres Strait. In fact, it was precisely the kind of communal or family ownership that was recognised in the Mabo decision itself. I turn to the amendment relating to health, education, social and cultural needs. There has perhaps been more public debate on this amendment than any other. The government would agree, as I certainly do, that very much of the debate has been symbolic. The questions we pose are: 'What is the amendment intended to specify? How will the needs be assessed? How will we quantify the difference that the land acquisition will make?' Either the needs must be assessed and the benefits quantified-in which case it undermines the whole philosophy behind the bill, which is of returning the bill-or, if that is not what is meant, it is effectively windowdressing. At this time it is important to make the point that the government believes passionately that one of the greatest social justice issues confronting this country is Aboriginal health. We have already had some debates in this chamber about that matter, and I am sure that we will have a lot more.",35
18,Mr HOWARD,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,We will.,37
19,Mr TICKNER,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition joins in that. Can I say to him that I think he will have to judge the government on what it does on this issue. I ask the House and the people of Australia to have regard to the Prime Minister's recent speech at Hopevale in the electorate of Leichhardt where he made the point that the government had moved in respect of native title to establish the land fund and the next priority was clearly that of health. There is much work to be done on that. Again, I would hope that, whilst we might debate the best means of addressing the issues, we ought to, on this issue, strive for our future directions with the greatest degree of cross-party cooperation on what might be done. Again I turn to a good basis for doing that, and that is the unanimous report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs called Rhetoric or reality. I am getting some signals that suggest that it is in the interest of the parliament that we move more expeditiously. I do not think we have ever been so eager to accommodate each other as on this occasion, but perhaps that is not a bad thing. I turn to the amendments that relate to the Indigenous Land Corporation pursuing a policy of not requiring any consent for the disposal of land. Of all the issues that are likely to arouse enormous public opposition and public concern in the wider Australian community, it has to be this one. I have to say frankly that the government thinks it very bad public policy that we would allocate funds, perhaps, to an individual person and by law of the parliament effectively give that person a blank cheque authority to be able to dispose of the land the very next day. I pose a challenge for the coalition. I am not aware of any area in any portfolio responsibility in the Commonwealth where there has been such a policy. It has never been coalition policy before. Mr Tim Fischer-EMDG-xport market well in practice. development grants.",37
20,Mr TICKNER,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"Interest in land, I pose to the Leader of the National Party? It has never been coalition policy and it has never been government policy to allow that kind of effective abdication-and I think a rather cavalier abdication---of our responsibility as a parliament to stand up for important princiCourt ples of public accountability. The government clearly cannot support that amendment. I draw the coalition's attention that the Aboriginal Development Commission legislation, passed by a coalition government-I think Fred Chaney was the minister there, although I may be wrong-contains a provision prohibiting the disposal of land in the way that the government is advocating this bill. Section 21(3) of the ATSIC Act makes it clear that no disposal of land will permitted in relation to A TSIC funding without the consent of the commission. I put on the public record that the ATSIC legislation has now enjoyed the unanimous support of the parliament. That is very welcome. The question I pose is: why would we want to ditch what has been agreed to be a fundamental principle of public accountability? There are other amendments that I could refer to. Honourable members would apprecithe ate that it is rather difficult for me when on my feet to appreciate the tenor of what the opposition might be about to do. I think I have anticipated the opposition correctly-at least I hope so. I want to conclude my remarks by saying a number of things briefly about this legislation from a government perspective. This proposal to establish a land fund is something that has been an objective of mine for all the time that I have been in the parliament because I think it is very important that the nation address the dispossessed position of Aboriginal Australians. It is legislation that comes forward with all the hallmarks of good legislation. We have principles of public accountability enshrined, and we believe that we have all the necessary checks and balances and safeguards to make the legislation work Above all else, the government sees this as the historic second stage response to the High Court decision in the Mabo case, and I want to take this opportunity to place on record the magnificent role that the Prime Minister has played in realising what had to be done to deliver social justice in response to that High decision. This is the second stage of the government's response. The third stage will be the social justice package. Before that, in relation to the budget, obviously health will to the fact have a high priority. Mr Speaker, this is further reason why we on this side are very proud to be members of the Australian Labor Party. I would urge the coalition to think again in relation to its past in opposition to the government's proposals and to have this legislation passed through today be with the unanimous support of this chamber and that of the Senate to achieve the unanimous passage through the Australian parliament that it deserves.",38
21,Mr HOWARD,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND," Mr Speaker, I enter this debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 for the opposition to say a few words as to our general approach to the whole question of the government's land fund legislation. Let me start by saying that we in coalition believe very strongly that the I a'll amendments that were inserted into the original land fund bill were justified amendments. They would, if adopted by the national parliament, deliver a better land fund, a fairer land fund and a land fund that recognised the rights of individuals as distinct from the rights of groups and corporations. I also want to take the opportunity to acknowledge particularly the contribution made by my Senate colleagues Senator Ian Campbell and Senator Chris Ellison. Over a period of months, they worked extremely effectively in order to insert these amendments into the legislation. Leaving aside any detailed explanation of the constitutional technicalities and the times from which deadlocked provisions begin to operate, quite obviously we have reached a stage where there is a deadlock between the two houses of parliament. The Senate wants a piece of legislation that it believes, and I believe, is superior to that wanted by the government and, clearly, by the House of Representatives. If that deadlock were to continue, the people who would suffer most would be the people the legislation is intended to benefit. For those reasons, the coalition has decided that, although on the motion of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) it will maintain support for the Senate's amendments, next week, when the second piece of legislation introduced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is presented, it will not vote against the passage of that legislation in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. We do that on a number of strict understandings that I want to make clear from the very beginning. The first of those is that on the election of a coalition government, which will inevitably occur whenever the election is held, we will vote to amend the land fund legislation to bring it into line with what was resolved by the Senate. I want to make that very clear: we will amend the legislation to bring it into line with what was resolved by the Senate. It seems to us that that is the most intelligent way of handling this issue. The consequence of that will be that the Aboriginal community will not be denied the benefit of the land fund provisions but, equally, the inadequacies of that legislation will be excised upon a change of government. The second set of circumstances in which I make these remarks on behalf of the coalition is to say something generally about our approach to Aboriginal affairs. There is an enormous amount of rhetoric about Aboriginal affairs. There is an enormous amount of breast beating. There is an enormous amount of-how should one put it?-preciousness when it comes to possession of moral authority and compassion. In relation to Aboriginal affairs, no side of politics in Australia has a mortgage on compassion. There are many men and women of goodwill on both sides of the parliament who have been very concerned about the plight of Australia's indigenous people for a very long time. The fair-minded amongst those opposite will acknowledge, going back over the years, the contribution of many people on our side of politics to a sensitive understanding of the difficulties faced by the Aboriginal people. It is not an easy issue. I detect in the Australian community a general desire to see the condition and the state of Australia's indigenous people improved. There is a recognition by most Australians that, as a group of people, Aborigines are clearly the most disadvantaged within our national community. There is also within the Australian community a growing impatience with what seems to it to be the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars, with precious little advancement and, in some cases, actual regression. Whatever the government may say, whatever the minister may say and whatever the Prime Minister may say, the reality is that, after 12 years of government and the expenditure of hundreds of millions of additional dollars, the condition of Aboriginal health is worse than what it was when you came to power, in many crucial respects. That is the fact. If we are to have an intelligent debate about Aboriginal affairs, it ought to focus on issues like that and not be distracted as to who is taking the most morally superior position when it comes to responses to Mabo or responses to the land fund. We can talk for days, for weeks, indeed months, about that and if, as a consequence, the most wretched amongst our number are not advanced or not promotedMr Dodd interjecting",38
22,Mr HOWARD,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"We hear lots of speeches about how every so often those who represent the people of Australia in this building ought to look beyond the short-term political point or the political advantage. We have done that. We are acknowledging that, if the deadlock continues, you opposite will not suffer and we over here will not suffer; but the people the land fund is meant to develop will suffer. We are not going to be a party to that. We are, therefore, going to take the course of action that I have indicated. I want to make it clear to those who sit opposite that they do not have a mortgage on compassion. As my colleague the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), the shadow minister for health, said yesterday, it is not a problem that additional dollars alone can solve although, obviously, financial provision is tremendously important. It goes to a lot of other things as well. There is an obligation on all of us to address those other things, but addressing those other things has to occur within a number of important guidelines and understandings. One of those guidelines and understandings so far as the coalition is concerned now, and will always be so far as the Liberal and National parties are concerned, is that Aboriginal affairs has to be addressed within the concept of a single, undivided nation of which all Australians, whether indigenous Australians or other Australians, are treated equally, governed by a common set of laws to which all of us are equally accountable and governed by a number of common values and common principles as Australian citizens. be part of the policy of the Liberal and National parties to see the development of Aboriginal affairs policy within the concept of the tribalisation or fragmentation of this nation. We are one people and one nation, with one future, and one common obligation to treat each of us with dignity and respect. I hope that the debate on Aboriginal affairs from now on will focus on policies and measures that improve the dignity, the independence, the lifestyle, the health, the education, the employment prospects and the family stability of Australia's Aborigines. It ought not to be distracted by arguments as to who is more compassionate. It ought not to be distracted by challengeable concepts of intergenerational guilt. Of course injustices were done to the original people, but those injustices were not committed by current generations of Australians and, so far as I am concerned, I am not going to be a party to the gUilt industry, but I am going to be a party toMr Tickner interjecting",40
23,Mr HOWARD,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"I am glad the minister says he is not a party to the gUilt industry. I am delighted to hear that, and I hope his acknowledgment is recorded. What this parliament has to do is to embrace common sense, contemporary policies to improve the conditions of Aborigines-to improve their self-respect, their independence and their self reliance. Those policies have to be developed not within the context of notions of intergenerational guilt and not within the context of the fragmentation of this country but within the context of the unity of this country under a common set of Australian values and a common body of law. Finally, what the coalition has decided to do on this legislation is against a background of press comment about a double dissolution. I would love to have an election at the present time, and all of my colleagues over here would love to have an election at the present time. The only people who do not want to have an election at the present time are those who sit opposite. So this decision taken by the coalition has nothing at all to do with question of the timing of elections. We would love It will never to have an election. If the Prime Minister wants to have an election on this or indeed any other issue he only has to hop in that flagless white car of his and go out to Yarralumla and advise the Governor General to grant him a double dissolution. This decision has absolutely nothing to do with that. This decision has been taken by us because we believe that, given that there is a clear deadlock between the two houses of parliament, the people who will suffer from that deadlock will be the Aboriginal community of Australia. In those circumstances, the sensible, proper thing to do, having regard to the interests of the Aboriginal community of Australia, is to do what the coalition has resolved to do. We will maintain, by voting against the minister's motion, a demonstration of support for the Senate amendments. But when the bill introduced by the Prime Minister comes on for debate next week, we will not vote against that legislation in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. Upon the election a Howard-Fischer government, whenever that occurs, we will act to amend the land fund legislation to bring it into line with what been passed by the Senate. In that fashion, not only serve the interests of the Aboriginal community but we also produce better legislawhat tion and, most importantly, we return debate on Aboriginal affairs to areas of government accountability where it ought to be. We will also return the general political and economic debate of this community to the other failings of the government and all the other areas of government accountability. If any members opposite imagine that the behaviour of the Prime Minister and the government over the past few days on this issue has been some kind of clever political tactic, I think they are sadly wrong. We will get the debate back to where you are weakest and, in the process, we will look after interests of the Aboriginal community.",40
24,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"Northern TerritoryEvans Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (11.28 ty. a.m.)-I am pleased that the opposition has at last seen the importance of passing this piece of legislation, however disingenuous that support might be. To hear what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has said this morning must confirm in everyone's mind how disingenuous the opposition is in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander we affairs-without question. What these people have done today is to indicate to the parliament, to the people Australia, that they are prepared to acceptthe proposals put forward by the government in the context of the land fund bill on the basis that when and if-in the very unlikely event-they be elected to government they will immediately move to amend the legislation in accordance with the principles of the amendments passed by the Senate. There, in its entirety, is the message to the Australian community. These people are absolutely disingenuous. What is also interesting is that whilst the of Leader of the Opposition has spoken about the need for a cohesive approach to this particular issue, an issue on which we join has him-we would say there is a need for a we cohesive approach, that we should have a national bipartisan approach to these issueshe has demonstrated in his contribution is an absolute and fundamental misunderstanding about the thrust of the land fund bill. What he has done by supporting the proposals which have come from the Senate is to indicate absolutely that he has no idea about the importance of land and its relationship to Aboriginal people. The Leader of the Opposition has entirely ignored the evidence put forward on any number of occasions by royal commissioners, Aboriginal leadership and politicians. The government has indicated in the Senate that so clearly is it committed to the idea of bipartithe sanship that it accepted 29 amendments proposed in that other place. But it has, quite rightly, chosen to reject what Senator Gareth has called the seven deadly sins. It was the opposition leader's support of the seven deadly sins that should have us concerned and should be of concern to the whole communiI want to refer to those points but before I do I want to make a general observation about the proposals in the opposition leader's speech on the One Nation concept-the idea that we are all governed by a common law. We all understand that; no-one questions it. But what are arguing is that we need to deal specially and differently in some cases with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They need to be given special recognition in law as of a result of past injustices about which he spoke. We acknowledged their alienation from their land base by passing the Mabo legislation and, prior to that, the land rights legislapeople. tion in the Northern Territory; and we are looking at this land fund bill and the social justice package. We acknowledge the need to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people special treatment. We acknowledge the need to address special needs. We acknowledge the need to address the principles in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander law. That is the difference. The relationship with land is integral and key to that. The Leader of the Opposition has also said the opposition is not about a guilt trip. No-one is; but he refers to the injustices of the past without acknowledging the injustices of the present. That is another key failing of his contribution and of the proposals which have been put by the opposition. He has a fundamental lack of understanding about the injustices to which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are subjected in this nation today. The Leader of the Opposition has said he looks forward to a very good debate-and no doubt a volatile debate at times-about Aboriginal health and housing issues. He says that should be the primary debate. Let me just point out to him that, as we know, the government has already rejected the amendments in the Senate which refer to tying the proposals put forward in this legislation to the questions of disadvantage and health and housing. I will go to comments by a member of the Liberal Party, a person who I understand is up for preselection for the Liberal Party, Brendan Nelson. Dr Nelson, along with purports Barbara Flick, has published a document Aboriginal entitled Land, Rights, Laws: Issues of Native Title. In it, they talk about rights and entitlemunity-by ments. They have acknowledged the primacy of Aboriginal interest in land and the need to address that land issue quite separately but conjunction with issues to deal with health and housing. They understand that, unless address this land issue, the possibility of getting a fruitful outcome in health and education is more difficult. That goes statements which have been made by various Aboriginal leaders over at least the history Australia's occupation by non-Aboriginal When I look at the contribution which the opposition leader has made. I become alarmed that he has demonstrated no understanding of these things. If we are going to express bipartisan support, we must at least agree on the fundamentals. It is difficult to understand what fundamental agreements we might have, if we have a basic disagreement about the importance of land to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the way it ought to be dealt with. In talking about how land should be dealt with, I note that the opposition has said that it should be made available to individuals and trustees. I wonder why the opposition has not had the wisdom to read what the various reports, which have been presented to government over the last 20 years by learned people in the form of royal commissions-the Woodward commission, the Seaman inquiry for the Western Australian government-have said about the nature of land, land ownership and title. What all of them have done is reject the notion that land should be made available to an individual. In fact, they have said-as they have committed themselves to understanding the nature of Aboriginal association with land-that land ownership must be inalienable; it should not be sold; it should not be dealt with in a way in which nonAboriginal people deal with land. Land is fundamental to Aboriginal spirituality, yet it is something which the opposition Dr will not understand. The opposition still to be dealing with the interests of and Torres Strait Islander people--indeed the interests of the Australian comgoing down this path. It says that people should be able to deal with this landwhich, after all, is recognition of their spiriin tual attachment-as if they were real estate agents. They are not real estate agents. I have we lived and worked with Aboriginal people for many years and I have not heard one Aboriginal person put this view. We have had the to land rights act operating in the Northern Territory since 1976-inalienable freehold of title. Not one Aboriginal person that I have spoken to in the Northern Territory has put the view that they want individual ownership. Then we have the position with regard to ATSIC. It is very important that we understand this. What the opposition is doing by taking the approach that it has taken thus and by adopting the approach that the Leader of the Opposition has put forward this morning-that, in the unlikely event it were to get power, it would turn over this legislation-is absolutely pulling the rug from underneath any semblance of recognition of ATSIC and the authority it might have in the Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander community. We should be very aware of the position of ATSIC. The ATSIC commissioners have made their position abundantly clear on numerous occasions. Lois O'Donoghue and Charlie Perkins have, at various times",41
25,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"Ha, hal",43
26,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"You laugh. What are you laughing at? That absolutely ignores the reality of what A TSIC does. It absolutely ignores the structures of ATSIC. I was at a regional council meeting of ATSIC last week in the Northern Territory. There was a group of representatives from across the top end of the Northern Territory, each one of them representing a view of their communities. They were a representative group. You might not like it, but they were representative. The fact is that ATSIC is representative. You don't like it, but it is. What you ought to is acknowledge that and say that they do represent and speak on behalf of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There is no point taking this argument to the point of saying that because there are some administrative difficulties with ATSIC-and there may well be-you throw the baby out with the bathwater, which is what you have done. You do not acknowledge at all the role of the leadership in ATSIC as representing the general interests of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities across Australia. The opposition should understand what it is doing. Not only are you disparaging this land fund bill; you are also disparaging the reprewhich sentative nature of ATSIC, the ATSIC commissioners and the prestige with which they are held in the Aboriginal community. This is what you are doing. We have the shadow spokesperson basically saying that ATSIC leadership does not consult and does not represent Aboriginal people. Is that not what far you are saying? The ATSIC leadership has made it clear where they stand on the land fund bill. They have said to the government that they want this bill, not your bill, and you should support it. But what you are saying is that if you get into government you· will totally undermine the basis of this legislation. How disingenuous are you? The opposition has now felt the blowtorch to the belly and caved in. That is what this is about. As Senator Gareth Evans said last night, we have now achieved the result we wanted, because our primary objective was to get the land fund bill through. You would not have supported this land fund bill if you did not think there was going to be a double dissolution. That is very clear. The opposition leader almost said as much this morning. I want to finish my contribution by saying to the House that this is a very important day for the Australian community. We have got the opposition falling to pieces, falling away, in terms of its attitude to the land fund bill in this parliament. But it is saying to the Australian community that, if and when it is elected, it will change this bill.to reflect the hideous prospect which was proposed by the do Senate. The only reason that they have come in here today to give in, if you like, is not, as the Leader of the Opposition says, the interests of Aboriginal and Tories Strait Islander people; it is as a result of self-interest. That needs to be properly understood. Nevertheless, self-interest is a legitimate interest and we accept the support of the opposition on this piece of legislation.",43
27,Mr TIM FISCHER,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"I rise in support of the very statesmanlike comments made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) with regard to this measure. I want to point out at the outset that we could have done better than have the comments the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) has just made. He ignores, for example, the contribution of the New South Wales Land Council to this particular debate, which was strongly at variance with the view put by A TSIC. So there is a diversity of opinion amongst Aboriginals with regard to Labor's land fund legislation. Mr Dodd interjecting",43
28,Mr TIM FISCHER,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,You might just spend a bit of time working on the problems of Kowanyama in your electorate and explain to them how the legislation before the House this day is going to lift equality of opportunity for education and the health and housing circumstances of the people of Kowanyama. Have you been to Kowanyama in the electorate of Leichhardt? Mr Dodd-Of course I have.,44
29,Mr TIM FISCHER,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"I am pleased to see that you might have been there. It is a pity that you have not tried to rectify some of the tremendous problems that exist in that particular community. We are considering this legislation on the eve of another major ruling by the full bench of the High Court of Australia in relation to Mabo. I think in November the High Court finally took oral evidence, and some additional evidence was given after that. I managed to sit in for some of the full bench hearings here in Canberra on the Western Australian legislation and, inter alia, the federal Mabo legislation. The High Court is about to revisit the Mabo issue for the first time since its original decision. I point out to the House that that may well have ramifications for the core Mabo issues. It may necessitate another Mabo bill of one kind or another coming forward from the government. However, that remains to be seen and I am certainly not categorical about that. What I place on the public record is that, as we consider all the ramifications of the Mabo issue with regard to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their health, education and housing circumstances, we need to be conscious of not only the parliamentary deliberation but also the fact that the High Court is about to revisit this issue. I understand that there will be a further ruling sometime between now and the end of April, at the latest. The second point is that in government we will review the core aspects of Labor's land funding apparatus for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I want to make it very clear that it would be part of our proper decision to relate the legislation to members of Aboriginal communities in very diverse circumstances. I quote in part from the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill: A corporation is not an appropriate vehicle for the managementof modern [Aboriginal] communities. It is another imposed regime ... That evidence was taken from Rosemary O'Grady, the spokesperson of the Kamali people. Mr Tickner-She's a non-Aboriginal lawyer.",44
30,Mr TIM FISCHER,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"But you will concede she was representing the Kamali people. I think that we ought to maintain a degree of reasonable standards associated with this debate, and I have always done so. In that context, when we review this legislation in government we will look forward, hopefully, to the support of the Australian Democrats and the Greens (WA). Hopefully, better still, the votes will be such that we will have a working majority in both houses of parliament so that we can get this right in the interests of Aboriginal people, in the interests of Australia as a nation as a whole. I praise the members of the committee and the senators who worked hard on this issue across the board. The committee was chaired by Senator Ian Campbell. In addition to the senators who were members of the committee, a senator for the Northern Territory, Senator Grant Tambling, and others certainly put in a huge amount of effort to bring forward responsible, reasonable amendments which have enjoyed a degree of support. I do not say more than that. I say that those amendments enjoyed a degree of support in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait community. Once in government, we will pursue those amendments and, indeed, will this day vote one more time for them in the deliberations of the House on this measure. On the legal side, it is worthy of note by members of the public and others that this bill is back before the House this morning because of section 57 of the constitution, which states: If the House of Representatives passes any proposed law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree ... It goes on from that point. Ultimately, late yesterday, the Senate passed the government's original land fund bill. The government construes that it was so amended that it did not constitute a passage of the government's original measure. But that has to be then tested on the floor of the House of Representatives today in accordance with section 57 of the constitution. If we had taken a view otherwise, it might be said for the record that, in broad terms, the trigger mechanism would have commenced from this day. But we do have the other complexity of the government arguing that the 1951 convention applied. The government lost that argument-in fact, Minister Evans ran up the white flag on that particular argument last night when he conceded he was wrong in saying that the trigger started back on 28 November. There was a very good reason for saying that. That 1951 convention involved a bill that was deadlocked between the House of Representatives and the Senate and was resubmitted after a three-month period. On the second time around, the Senate referred that particular banking legislation to a committee. At that time, Governor General MCKell construed that as a failure to pass on the second time around and the double dissolution then applied. On this occasion, the Senate is yet to deal with this legislation a second time around. For the benefit of clarification, that ought to be placed very clearly on the record of proceedings here today. In many ways this is a very unsatisfactory circumstance. As we speak here today there is a degree of agony, a degree of absolute unacceptability with regard to the actual conditions that exist across Cape York, western New South Wales and the Northern Territory. I am pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has come into the House because he went to Cape York, I think, last weekend and perhaps saw first-hand some of those conditions. But I am sorry that the Prime Minister did not go to Kowanyama and see the conditions there. It takes a quantum leap of imagination to think that this particular measure will, within a short period of time, greatly improve the health, housing and educational circumstances of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders right across Australia. At the end of the day, that is what members on both sides of the House should be about, as those are the real issues of concern. The coalition has taken a very responsible position throughout the course of this debate for reasons that have been well stated by the Leader of the Opposition and, shortly, will be again by the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). At the end of the day, we will be quite properly reviewing this in government.",44
31,Mr KEATING,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"When the government introduced the response to the High Court decision in relation to Mabo, it introduced a bill for an act to give meaning to the notion that there was a basis in the common law of Australia arising from Aboriginal custom and tradition to accept that there was a title available to those who maintain a traditional connection with the land, and to establish who was entitled to that land, how it would be allocated, how it would be decided and what those rights might be. It was thus a historic piece of property in cultural law. At the time of its introduction the government made clear that though this established in law a very great principle it would apply to those people who were still able to establish a traditional connection with the land and it would not apply to those who had formerly been dispossessed. Hence we said in the response to the High Court decision, to make clear the government's commitment to justice for Aboriginal people, that we would also introduce a land fund bill that would give Aboriginal people a capacity to buy land, particularly in areas where title may have been extinguished, where there had been a grant of interest for a short period-a pastoral lease or something as we saw recently in events alluded to in the remarks by Justice French. In those circumstances Aboriginal people could actually buy land and they would have a secure title to it. It was and remains a central matter in the dispensing of justice to Aboriginal people. The government was determined to get the Mabo bill, the native title bill, through. We stood our ground against intransigence in the Senate, we wore the admonition of the then Leader of the Opposition that it was a day of shame, we withstood the attenuated pressures of the opportunism of the coalition parties in the Senate, and during that period the Western Australian Greens, and said that we would campaign for this, in the country if necessary, were there a failure to pass it. Our determinawith tion to get our way, our way being justice for Aboriginal people, paid off for them when the bill was passed at the end of 1993. In accordance with the commitment we made we then said we would introduce an Aboriginal land fund bill, and we did this. According to our commitment we proposed that bill to the House of Representatives, and then it went to the Senate in September of last ual year. From September until yesterday and today the Senate dallied with the bill, behaved proposals opportunistically towards it, sought to under- though mine the central tenets of it, and then intro- capacity duced a long, drawn-out process supposedly of consultation which only revealed what a sham process the Senate had embarked upon under the stewardship of the Liberal and National parties and the Western Australian Greens. . Yesterday, Mr Speaker, the Senate passed the bill, and it passed it with the amendments whiCh the government objected to. Those amendments were to give priority now to those Aboriginal people who suffer the most disadvantage-as though, of course, there it back here. could be any secure test of the relative disadvantage of people or the relative dispossession. If one is dispossessed, one is dispossessed. The notion that the courts would then be asked to make judgments about these things was, of course, simply only a device and a sleight of hand. The second problem with it was that they wanted to see a reference to grants to individuals and trustees being made possible, encompassing the whole notion of the traditional connection of Aboriginal communities with the land, and the protection of that land in the hands of communities being put asunder. The third problem was that another requirement, that grants of interest in land have regard to health, housing and so on, meant that the character of the bill changed from being a land fund bill to an appropriation bill that was interested in health, housing and other things. That completely denied the bill its integrity in terms of dealing with land. The fourth problem was that they required the ILC, before acquiring land, to consult those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who had traditional or historic links to the land in question. The device there was that, without any resolution of some of these issues, the body itself would not be able to conduct its affairs in an executive way. It discusses the removal of the ILC power to control effectively the disposal of land; in other words, it deals with the right of individpeople to hold the land and actually dispose of it. It also referred to a group of relating to regional strategies, as they should in some way impair the of the fund to actually do what we require of it. This week the opposition parties had every chance to make a decision in favour of Aboriginal people without these devices, tricks and sleights of hand, and after this attenuated period, and send the legislation back with integrity to the House of Representatives for passage. They did not do this. They had the chance to decide on issues of justice. They denied themselves the chance, they denied Aboriginal people the chance, and they sent The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) today made it very clear that, were he to be the Prime Minister of this country, the coalition would seek to again run these amendmentsamendments which would tear the hell out of the bill. It is again said with insincerity towards the lot of Aboriginal people and that which is required for them. The government will today decide how to present the bill to the House-a bill which the Leader of the Opposition now says he will agree to have passed in the Senate. We will present a bill that will reflect the integrity the bill first proposed to the House of Representatives and the Senate.",45

Mrs Gallus-Have you?,47
39,Mr KEATING,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"Too right we have. Let me make it clear: by standing firmly for justice for Aboriginal people, we got the native title bill through. If coalition members were to refuse the passage of the bill and we sought to exercise the provisions of the constitution, that would allow ultimately a joint sitting of both houses to pass its opinion on this legislation to again grant to Aboriginal people that which is just and decent. As a consequence and in the face of that, the coalition decided to send to the House yesterday a bill which in no way maintains the integrity of the original bill. But, in sending it back, the Leader of the Opposition of understood that he started the three-month metre ticking.",47
40,Mr HOWARD,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,I am not worried about that. I'd like it fast forwarded.,47
41,Mr KEATING,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"Yes, I know about you, brother. We put the challenge up to you, and you buckled.",47
42,Unknown,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,Opposition members interjectingMrSPEAKER-Order! The Prime Minister has the call.,47
43,Mr KEATING,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"The empirical test is that we put up the challenge and you buckled. You are now saying you do not like the bill. You had a chance in the Senate to do justice to Aboriginal people and you did not. You sent the bill back full of these shoddy and appalling amendments. When we faced you up to it, you decided to say today that you would pass the bill but that when you became a government-and if you had your wayyou would put all of these amendments back into the legislation. In other words, you would deny Aboriginal people that which this parliament would have given. You have proved by your actions that you have not changed your view. The· Leader of the Opposition said that he is taking the decision to pass the bill because of the risk of a deadlock between the houses. Again, I repeat the point to make it clear: he will alter it if he gets into government. He said that he detected in the broad Australian community a desire to solve the problem. He is not about leading in the resolution of the problem; he is only detecting and following a desire to solve the problem. Instead of standing on some principles, he says that he will pass the bill but then if he gets into government he will seek to amend it in ways which would render it completely inoperable. The Leader of the Opposition also said that nobody has a monopoly on virtue in respect of Aboriginal affairs. This is true, but those in the coalition who have been virtuous about Aboriginal policy are not on the front bench; they are either on the back bench or out of the parliament. There has been no virtue on your front bench. Fancy talking about playing politics after your shabby performance. You have done nothing but play politics. We saw how influential you were with John Hewson. You just sort of backed awayand faded away when the Right of the Liberal Party said they would not have the native title legislation. The people on that side of the House who have a keen commitment to justice and compassion for Aboriginal people are not on the front bench; they are either out of the parliament now or on the back bench. It falls on the government again to stand resolutely in favour of those things which are just and decent for Aboriginal people.",47

48,Mr KEATING,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"Let me say a couple of things about the bizarre behaviour of the Western Australian Greens on this bill. They made an unholy alliance with the coalition in the Senate and abstained from the Senate vo.te yesterday. They do not deserve to be taken seriously. They have played games with the lives and interests of Aboriginal people for their own shoddy political reasons. This should be duly noted by all those Australians who are interested in the welfare of Aboriginal people and by Aboriginal people themselves. It will be a great day for Aboriginal people when this bill goes through, and it is getting through because of the resolute strengths of the government to see that justice is done. When the coalition faced up to the fact that the government would take it on and run it up against a double dissolution of parliament and we would propose this at a joint sitting of both houses, it buckled.

49,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"Hindmarsh) (12.05 p.m.)I am sorry that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is leaving. Never before have I been so disappointed with a Prime Minister of this country carrying on in such a way. He is totally and utterly incapable of getting out of the gutter. Those opposite with grinning faces should really look at what they have put up as the Prime Minister of this country. He cannot under any circumstances get out of the slime or the gutter and miss an opportunity to play politics. He made a political speech in Redfern about how much he cared for Aboriginal people. Ever since then, he has been playing Aboriginal affairs as a political football. He has done nothing else. The Prime Minister had an opportunity today to come into the House, as did our Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), and say, 'This is what we are going to do. Let's address the issues that are really hurting people out there. Let's get behind those Aboriginal people who are dying. Let's look at .the serious problems. Let's get this over and out of the way.' What happened? He came into this House and made the most feeble political points that he could make. He could not resist doing that. There is not one inch of statesman in your Prime Minister. He comes from the gutter, and he is determined to stay in the gutter. Let us look at some of the comments of the Prime Minister. He seemed to be a little confused in relation to which bill he was talking about. I am not surprised at that, considering the number of bills running around at the moment. Let me make this clear: we will not be voting for the A TSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994; we will be voting in support of the amendments moved by the Senate. We are doing this because we do not want Aboriginal affairs to become a total political football and we do not want bills to be going backwards and forwards. It is time to start addressing the most important issues. Let us look at some of the issues we have brought up in the Senateissues which the Prime Minister believes have 'gutted' and 'undermined' the bill. He referred to the Senate committee 'dallying' in relation to this bill. The committee travelled 12,000 kilometres and listened to 224 people. What did the Prime Minister do? He rushed off to one community. When the second bill is brought down next week, it is. with great regret that we will put it through without the amendments asked for by members of the Aboriginal community at large. They have said, 'The government did not consult.' I draw the attention of the House to words of the minister when he introduced the original bill. He said, 'We have consulted extensively, more extensively than ever before on this bill.' What did we find when we went around the country? Aboriginal group after Aboriginal group said, 'We were not consulted. This government does not reflect our community; it reflects the community over there.' Aboriginal people are not homogeneous. There are different Aboriginal communities around Australia, and they were excluded by this government from participating in this bill. Mr Ronaldson-They were not consulted?",48
50,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"They wer,e not consulted. When they wrote to the government asking for consultation, they were sent the completed bill. This government failed to consult. We consulted with Aboriginal people, and the government did not. I turn to our amendments. Those opposite are obviously not interested in what I have to say. I will continue my remarks for the benefit of those in the gallery who perhaps have a genuine interest in Aboriginal affairs, unlike government members, who have an interest in disruption and in playing political football. I turn to some of the amendments that we are supposed to be discussing-these so 'horrific' amendments. First of all, let us address the so-called health and housing amendment which we are saying is changing the nature of the bill. That amendment says that when the ILC is giving grants to Aborigi- Leichhardt. nal communities buying the land it should look at what is going to happen with that land. Will the people be able to provide housing on the land? Will they be able to provide sealed roads? One of the big problems in Aboriginal health is the dust from the unsealed roads getting into people's eyes. Where there is not sufficient water for continual washing we get infectious diseases. Thatbrings up the second point. Should the ILC buy a piece of land where there is no available good ground water-there may be water that is too brackish to use-and where there is no piped water? How is that going to affectthe health of the Aboriginal people who move into that community? It means that we are going to see more pictures similar to those that we. saw when Graham Richardson went to Central Australia. We saw Aboriginal people living in humpies in a state of health that is reminiscent of Third World countries. I do not know how the people in the gallery feel about that but, as an Australian, I am absolutely appalled and ashamed that we have people in Australia who live in that condition. I might remind those opposite that these people live in that condition after 12 years of Labor government. Our amendment did not say to the ILC, 'Don't buy the land.' It said, 'Look, when you are buying the land for heaven's sake take these things into consideration: is there sewerage; how is that land going to be serviced by water; are you going to buy apiece of land that Aboriginal people will move on to and then find that they do not have water to wash?' The kids will be playing in the sewerage and will come up again and again with those infectious diseases that the rest of Australia has not seen since the last century. Was this such a terrible amendment to this bill? It was an amendment that did not say, 'Don't buy the land'; it simply said, 'When you buy the land look at what is going to happen afterwards and think of the health of Aboriginal people on that land.' It was an essential amendment. Mr Dodd-Ten per cent cut in Fightback.",49
51,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,Order! The member for,49
52,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"It did not gut that bill; it made it better. That is what those opposite cannot accept. If those opposite were serious about Aboriginal welfare and the land fund bill, Mr Speaker, what do you think they would have done? Would they not have said, 'Okay. You have some concerns from talking to Aboriginal people. Let's sit down and discuss your amendments'? No, they did not. Mr Gibson-You made up this amendment without any consultation whatsoever.",49
53,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"Before the amendments were introduced to the House the Prime Minister was out there in front of the television cameras saying, 'We will not agree to any of these amendments.' He had not even seen them. Mr Dodd interjecting",50
54,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,Drder! I warn the honourable member for Leichhardt.,50
55,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"What happened when it got to the Senate? There was a little bit of difference in the Senate. Suddenly the amendments were not so bad and the government agreed to pass them. That was a nice backflip on the part of the government which the Prime Minister has not mentioned. I would like to get on to some of the other amendments that are important. I refer to the attitude about individual trusts. The government has tried to mislead the Australian public by saying that our amendment meant that we would be handing land to individual people. If the government would care to read the amendment it would find that it said that the Indigenous Land Corporation, the body that buys the land, can give the land to corporations-which is in the bill at the moment---or individuals or trusts. It does not say that the ILC has to do this; it simply widens the options. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) read from a quotation which indicated that corporations are not a natural form for Aboriginal people. For most of those people family trusts are a much more understandable form. We did not even say, 'You have to give it to family trusts.' We we would widen the legislation to allow the Indigenous Land Corporation to provide for family trusts as well as corporations if that was what the Indigenous Land Corporation so decided. The amendment was simply to give the ILC more power to consider those Aboriginal people who are not comfortable with corporations. Does that surprise people? How many here today really understand corporations? When you ask an Aboriginal community, with an overall extremely low level of literacy and a non-understanding of what goes on in the commercial world, to form a corporation, you are really asking it to do something which is alien to its whole traditional culture. Yet that is what this government says is the natural form for Aboriginal people. It has. decided that that is what is right for Aboriginal people and to hell with the rest of the community, and to hell with those Aboriginal people who came to us saying, 'The government did not consult with us. We cannot live with the bill in this form. Would you please get the bill amended so it applies to us?' The government is very sensitive about our proposal for the extra $3 million. Most of the Australian public, despite our efforts to get the information out, are not aware that the coalition and the Greens in the Senate actually voted for an extra $3 million to go into the land fund for administration. The request was rushed into this House so quickly that I do not think that members on the other side even knew what was happening. It was in and out in a few seconds. There is a land fund. We thOUght that it was important that the money in the land fund be spent only on land and not be eaten up in administration, the way so much money is in these areas. We said that we would vote $3 million into the fund for administration but that that was all that could be spent on administration; the rest of the money would be for the purchase of land. What did the government do? It said, 'No way.' It rushed that request out of the Senate arid into the House without any warning. I was in my room at the time. If I had not been said able to run as fast as I can, I would have missed it altogether and would not have been able to tell this House what our position was. The Whip was given one minute's notice, and that is how long it took me to get out of my room. It was a despicable act on the part of the government, getting the request back into this House without allowing for proper debate on the extra $3 million. What did the government do then? It marsh circulated amongst the general community not that we had voted an extra $3 million for administration, but that we had simply wanted to cap administration expenses. There was mention of the extra money. It sent out letters to Aboriginal people, misleading them on this whatsoever. point, saying that we wanted to cap administration and that it thought that was an unreaamendments sonable fettering of the ILC. I turn now to the issue of traditional ownerin ship. One of our amendments was designed to require the ILC to consult with traditional owners prior to the acquisition of land or making a grant for the acquisition of land. thought it was an extremely sensible amend which ment and we are yet to discover why the government knocked it back. If the ILC is buying land for one group of Aboriginal people, it makes sense that, first of all, the traditional people be consulted with. If it is buying land for traditional people, that is fine. But what happens if the ILC believes that it is buying land for one group of Abopeople, riginal people while there are other Aboriginal people who have traditionally used that land-people who may not have a claim under the Mabo legislation because the land affairs. was subject to a pastoral lease? Their Mabo claim has been wiped out, yet they have been traditional owners. What will be the result for those two tribes of Aboriginal people? The result will be fighting, argument and bloodshed. Yet the government, because it refuses to consider sensible amendments, purely for party political reasons, totally refused that amendment. In conclusion, I sum up my reaction as one of incredible disappointment at the way in which the government has decided to use Aboriginal affairs not only as a political football but as a way of scoring political points when out there is one of the most serious problems facing Australia today. (Time expired) Mr GmSON (Moreton) (12.20 p.m.)-The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), appealed to the gallery during her speech. appeal to the gallery to discount everything has just heard from the member for Hindonly because she has just engaged in a total rewrite of history. Let us not forget that most of the amendments we are discussing here today were amendments that she brought into no this House before she had had one ounce of consultation with any Aboriginal people One of the major reasons why most of the were rejected by the government in the first place was that she had not engaged any sort of consultation. In fact, she was told very clearly right across the board that most of her amendments were not acceptable to Aboriginal people. The opposition then set We up this farce of a Senate select committee spent a week at Christmas time running around desperately trying to get a few people in Aboriginal Australia to back its opinions. It did manage to find a few people who would say, 'Yes, I agree with this one,' or 'I agree with that one.' But the fact is that the Senate has absolutely no expertise in Aboriginal affairs. It is great at bagging Aboriginal it is great at knocking ATSIC and it is great at engaging in political campaigns against Aboriginal interests, but it has not done any real hard work on Aboriginal The only really good intensive discussion of Aboriginal affairs in a balanced and reasonable way occurs in this House. We have the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which has been in existence for 17 years, and which I am proud to be the chair of at this time. It has a long history and, because of the work of that committee, we actually engage in much greater consultation amongst Aboriginal people. Over the last five years I have been on that committee, I have visited probably over 100 Aboriginal communities and have spoken to thousands of Aboriginal people-a hell of a lot more than the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs has done. I know a lot more about Aboriginal affairs than the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs says. I would like to make just one point. The I coalition was able to get away with a lot of it the amendments it put forward in the Senate because of the unholy alliance it had with the Western Australian Greens. It greatly disappoints me that the Western Australian Greens were willing to sell their souls to the coalition on this deal. They put this bill through months of delay, forced through the Senate a whole pile of amendments and then did not even have the guts to stand up in the Senate and vote for it. They avoided it. They abstained from the vote. That is how strong their commitment is to Aboriginal people and how strong their commitment is to the amendments. They did not even have the guts to vote on the bill when it went into the Senate. That just shows you exactly what the Greens are worth. It is a worthless organisation, and the miserable two in the Senate at the moment will be decimated at the next election. Regardless of the cowardly motives of the opposition in wanting to avoid a double dissolution and facing the people of Australia where they know they are going to be beaten, I am pleased that the coalition has agreed to vote for the second government bill when it comes to the House next Tuesday, because I am sick of the unnecessary delays that have occurred. I am strongly in support of this land acquisition fund. I believe it is a very important hew initiative in social justice for Aborigichamber. nal people. I just wish the people on the other side would really start talking about accountability and start targeting state and territory governments. Let us not forget who has the major responsibility for the provision of health services throughout this country-state and territory governments. Who is responsible for building housing, building roads and putting in water supplies? State, territory and local governments. It is they that have been failing in their responsibilities. The opposition never talks about or accepts that. It comes in here and talks about states rights all the time, but it never talks about states responsibilities. It is about time states responsibilities in Aboriginal affairs started getting an airing in this House.",50
56,Mr NUGENT,COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND,"I came into this chamber this morning from the middle of a meeting with a subcommittee of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation where we are working on the council's recommendations to the government for the social justice package. I would like to spend the few minutes that I have available to me this morning perhaps trying to move away a little from some of the hot air, self-righteous indignation and accusations that have been flowing around and talk about some constructive things for our indigenous population. I would urge the government to grasp the opportunity that is now clearly before it that this legislation is going to go through the parliament. The fact that we are goil)g to vote against this particular piece of legislation this morning to support our Senate colleagues but have indicated quite clearly that when the second bill comes on next week we will not oppose it gives the government an opportunity not to have to put lots of its effort, energies, time and rhetoric into that piece of legislation but to now turn its attention to doing some constructive things in so many other areas of urgent and desperate Aboriginal need. There is no question that we all accept the importance of land to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The way in which that is expressed might vary from person to person or community to community, and there may be different strengths and views within this BuUhe fundamental recognition is there and the coalition has accepted that principle with this bill throughout. I think we also need to be conscious that there are a number of areas where, unfortunately, the government's good intentions-and I accept that the minister has acted with good intentions for a long time in so many other areas of Aboriginal disadvantage, such as health, housing, education, employment and so on-have not borne the fruits that we would all like to have seen. The reality is that health is still a major dIsaster in this country. The one statistic that comes back to me repeatedly is life expectancy-IS years less for an Aboriginal male born today compared with somebody in the wider community, and for females it is 15 years. If we look at the housing situation, we are talking about $2 billion just to catch up on the backlog. If we ·Iook at levels of education, we realise it is not just education but it is all interlinked. Health impacts on that as well with so many of our Aboriginal children going to school with middle ear infection that they have not got a hope in either the health or the education stakes. And unemployment is so much worse in the indigenous community. We clearly have a number of problems with the A TSIC experiment. Without bucketing, in any sense, ATSIC-and I have been one of its strongest supporters in this place-there are quite clearly a number of areas that need addressing, and the government should be giving it that attention. I urge the government in dealing with these matters to go out and consult with the Aboriginal community on a far wider basis than it did with this land bill. I think it has had a tendency to deal with Aboriginal people who are elected to ATSIC, but unfortunately they do not representthe majority. They have dealt with the land councils but there are many others in Aboriginal communities who hold contrary views and who need to be consulted. In my role since I have come into this parliament I have been to many of those communities regularly and I can assure the House that although the government is claiming its views are so unanimously supported, that is simply not the case. I am concerned that the government has chosen to take a divisive attitude in so many areas of Aboriginal affairs. To hear the Prime Minister talk about the need for cross-party support and then come in here and say, 'Now I am going to pull this second bill, I am going to introduce a third bill next week,' seems to me to be merely trying to take party political advan- Gear, G. tage. I would have thought the interests of indigenous people in this country would have been far better served by accepting that the coalition is going to not oppose the second bill and to then get on with the urgent business of dealing with Aboriginal disadvantage. The government is talking about its three tranches-the native title legislation, the land fund and the social justice package which is upcoming and essentially about rights. They are all important to indigenous people and most people in this chamber acceptthe principles. But we argue about the implementation. I really urge the government to change its priorities now that it has a guarantee of getting that legislation through and to turn its attention much more to dealing with those practical things on the ground because when I go to Aboriginal communities that is what they tell me they want fixed.",52

58,Mr TICKNER,AYES,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (12.39 p.m.)-I move: That the Senate's further amendments Nos 1 to 3, 18 to 22, 28 to 30, 34, 36 to 40, 44, 49, to 62, 64, 66, and 67 (Group 2) be agreed to. As has already been said by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), only a Labor government could deliver legislation to produce this land fund. But, in debating the bill currently before the House, we now turn to amendments which have been agreed to by the AYES government. In doing so, I must emphasise that the government has, once again, shown its bona fides and its good faith in agreeing to some 29 amendments made by the Senate to the land fund bill. What we are not prepared to do is agree to amendments which are bad law and that NOES would make, for example, grants to individual people on one day and allow the land to' be sold off the next day with a total absence of accountability. However, the 29 ame,ndments that we are accepting is evidence of our commitment to try to achieve the greatest degree of cross-party support. The coalition is now indicating that it will support the Prime Minister's bill because of the fear of a double dissolution. As the minister, I welcome the support for whatever reason, although the point about the coalition's motivation, which has been made in a very telling way, shows how scared the coalition is to face a full Senate election. Notwithstanding the government's concern on a number of issues about the Senate amendments, we think that the additional operational burdens on the Indigenous Land Corporation are survivable if these amendments are accepted. We believe ,that one of them - a Democrat amendment-clearly improves the bill. It is the so-called 'top-up' amendment, No. 57, which provides that, if at the end of a 10-year period the land fund does not reach the investment target expected of it, an extra amount will be paid from PAIRS consolidated revenue to top up the land fund. That is a very important guarantee which ensures that after the initial 10 years the fund will be self-sustaining. A number of other amendments which the government is prepared to accept are technical ones. For example, the title of the bill has been changed, the minister will be required to table the national strategy in parliament within 50, 57 15 days of receiving· it and the terms and conditions which the Indigenous Land Corporation may impose on a loan is spelt out rather than left to the discretion of the Indigenous Land Corporation. Still other amendments have been accepted by us .because they do not fundamentally offend the spirit of the bill and, of course, those amendments are incorporated in the new bill that the Prime Minister introduced into the parliament. An example of that would be the provision that the ILC must report to the minister if its obligations not to reveal secret material affects its functions. In view of the prolonged debate that this bill has received, and the fact that the government is accepting the amendments that I am currently speaking about, I will truncate my remarks and allow opposition speakers to make a contribution.",54
59,Mrs GALLUS,AYES,"Hindmarsh) (12.43 p.m.)I will also make my comments brief because the government has decided to shorten this debate. I know there are many people on my side who would have a lot to say but, unfortunately, they will not be able to do so. May I clearly point out to the minister sitting at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), that we would like nothing more than to go to an election right now. You know what would happen to you: you would be so far out there that you wouldn't get a look in. Can I say that, as a member with a marginal seat, an election right now would be great, because I can see myself adding to my margin by another 10 to 15 per cent. Let us have no talk about the coalition being scared to go to a double dissolution. The coalition would be delighted to have an election today, tomorrow or whenever you would like. Can I also point out that the coalition is more interested in getting this place running properly and having good government rather than' having a government that is run by the larrikin that you call a prime minister, who cannot see beyond the cheap political trick. Everything the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says has to be political point scoring, and that is why we are in this state with the government today. When we refer to Aboriginal affairs, after 12 years of this government there are Aboriginal people still living in humpies, dying and without access to water. On these amendments that the government has accepted, after they appeared in the House of Representatives the government, through the minister at the table, said, 'We will not pass any of these amendments. These are all terrible amendments. We will not touch them with a barge pole. Get them out of here. We will not consider them.' But, 10 and behold, what happened when it got to the Senate was that 23 of them were suddenly not so bad after all and the government said, 'Okay, we will pass 23 of them.' That is how much you can put on the word of this government: one day they are untouchable amendments; the next day, when they get to the Senate, 23 of them are passed. What does that say about the integrity of this government? What does that say about the sincerity of the government when it originally saw the amendments? It says that the government has no sincerity in this area. It is not interested in anything else except politics. So we have these 23 amendments to which the government agrees. Obviously, we are going to agree to them in the House. One amendment provides that at least two members of the ILC board must have business expertise. We moved that amendment in this House when the bill originally came up, saying that two members of the ILC board must have business experience, otherwise you could have a board with no business expertise running a $1 billion land fund. We put that to the minister in this House and the minister ridiculed it. The minister said, 'No way. We will not consider this amendment. It is a terrible amendment.' He could not tell us why, of course. What has happened? It has come back from the Senate and the government has agreed with that amendment because it is obviously essential. What does that tell you about the minister sitting at the table and his ability to judge this area correctly and to be sincere in the area?",55
60,Ms HENZELL,AYES,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994. I was shocked and horrified to hear an appalling statement by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). One of the Greens (WA) senators, Senator Margetts, described our new bill as a 'sham'. The only sham revealed has been the incapacity of the opposition to get its act together. Today, the Leader of the Opposition came into this House and said, 'We don't agree with this. We supported the holding up of the legislation in the Senate for all this time, but we don't want a double dissolution, so we're going to let this go through.' And he confidently said, 'When we get into government.' I do not believe that confidence is based on a great deal. A week is a long time in politics, and the next few weeks will show the difference. The Leader of the Opposition repeated what his predecessor said. When he was in Western Australia, I believe the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said, 'We're going to change the native title legislation.' Today, the Leader of the Opposition has come in and said, 'We are going to vote for this legislation but when it'Mr Nehl- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: perhaps you could direct the member for Capricornia to speak on the bill before the House, not the Native Title Act.",55
61,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,"The honourable member for Cowper, I think, has been here through the whole of the debate. Some latitude has been given to the matters that have been raised under this. I will extend the same latitude to the member for Capricornia.",56
62,Ms HENZELL,AYES,"-What the Leader of the Opposition said typifies the sort of leadership we can expect from the member for Bennelong. He said, 'We are going to vote for this legislation and, if we become the government, we are going to vote it out again.' What can the people of this country expect? They can expect the same sort of shillyshallying that they got from the former leader over other aspects of Aboriginal policy. In this debate, once again, the opposition has no planned policy on Aboriginal affairs. Opposition members get up and criticise us because we have not been able to fix the wrongs of 200 years. But we have demonstrated a commitment to righting the wrongs of 200 years. It is indeed the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who has shown true leadership on this issue. In response to the motion on the previous amendments, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'We're not in the guilt industry.' I want to comment on this issue because these land fund measures are about Australia taking responsibility for its past. As a collective, all the present citizens. of this country have a collective responsibility for past wrongs just, indeed, as I hope we would see that Germany has a collective responsibility for its wrongs done to minorities during the Second World War and just as we would expect the Japanese to have a collective responsibility for the wrongs done to our POWs. To say that we will not have any truck with the guilt industry is an absolute disgrace. It is my view, very strongly held, that until we as a community accept our ·responsibility for these issues and acknowledge them, as indeed has been done by the Prime Minister in his Redfern speech, in his second reading speeches on the two land fund bills before this parliament and in his speech at Hopevale, there is no real chance of reconciliation. This bill is about land and is about the Aboriginal people's spiritual involvement with the land. There will only be a change in all the other issues that concern both sides of the House in terms of Aboriginal welfare and the need for infrastructure and an economic basis for development if Aboriginal people have some access to the land. The aim of this bill is to make sure that for those communities who cannot get justice through the Mabo legislation there will be access to land, independence and a return to their spiritual roots. I certainly support the comments of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner).",56
63,Mr NEHL,AYES,"I must indicate my thanks to the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) for finishing early and allowing me some time to speak on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. Having thanked her, I must refer to her statement that the government has demonstrated its commitment. The government has demonstrated its commitment to failure of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. If we look at the areas of health, education, housing and employment-everywhere we look-it is a record of failure. The government has been in office for 12 years. What has happened in those 12 years? Aboriginal men still have a life expectancy 18 years less than me. In fact, probably almost every Aboriginal man born the year that I was born is dead already. That is the likelihood, and that is a disgrace and a shame. Aboriginal women have 15 years less life expectancy than my wife. How can we, and my friends on the other side of the House, talk about responsibility, commitment and guilt? If there is to be any guilt in this parliament today it is guilt for the inactivity and failure of the last 12 years-.:.not for the last 200. We have to be concerned about what is happening now and in the future. We should learn from the past, but we cannot live there-we have to go forward; . What is absolutely unkind about this legislation is that it cruelly raises the expectations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I ask the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) at the table: what is in this bill for Torres Strait Islanders? I would be pleased if it could be demonstrated to me that there is one single benefit for Torres Strait Islander people in this bill. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was speaking. I noticed that he made mention specifically of Aborigines. I wonder whether the Prime Minister, in all the 25 years he has been here, has ever made a specific reference to the problems of Torres Strait Islanders and the Torres Strait without just tagging it onto the ATSIC label. I have been through Hansard as far back as 1981. Perhaps it has been mentioned in answers to questions, but certainly in speeches the number of times the Prime Minister has mentioned the Torres Strait could be counted on the fingers of both hands, and then it has only been tagged onto Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I do not think that is good enough. I flag this particular point because the Torres Strait is an area of great interest to me personally. I have a lot of friends there, and I go there from time to time. I am really concerned about what this bill will do for people in the Torres Strait. I said that this bill will cruelly raise expectations. Technically we are talking about $1.5 billion being made available over 10 years. Nobody should believe for one second that $1.5 billion will be there to buy land. That is not the case. It will be put in a trust fund and invested, and the interest-about $45 million a year-will be made available for land purchases. I believe that this bill is a sham, and I have believed that ever since the bill was introduced. It cruelly raises expectations. Already, $21 million a year has been provided to A TSIC for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to buy land, so there is a net increase of only about $24 million. I hope the minister will be able to inform me if I am wrong. I hope I am wrong because I do not believe that this sort of confidence trick on the indigenous people of Australia is at all appropriate. The Prime Minister spoke about justice for Aboriginal people. They are being denied justice in the important areas of health, housing and education. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) spoke about the ATSIC leadership representing all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I do not think for one second that the ATSIC leadership represents the people in my electorate who live at New Burnt Bridge. The minister at the table will recall visiting New Burnt Bridge with me. I have praised him many times since then for going and I do so again. I also applaud his commitment, as he provided $2.3 million for it. But I come back to the fact that, although the money has already been provided, years later not a single house has been built and people are still living in disgraceful Third World conditions. They complained to the Ombudsman because of a dispute with the regional office of ATSIC at Lismore. What has ATSIC done? It has taken out injunctions to stop the Ombudsman's report going to this minister, the Prime Minister and this parliament. I do not believe ATSIC enjoys the confidence of all Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people at all. In fact, I know that to be true. I will complete my remarks so the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) will have at least a couple of minutes to speak. This bill is not what it seems. It provides ° about an extra $24 million a year in new money for 1 years, and it is not going to do what is required of it. I come back to the point that we must solve the health, housing, education and employment problems. We have had 12 years of failure by the present government. It should face up to the event. I say this to all of those on the government who talk about elections: if you want an election, bring one on now. We are ready and we will beat you.",56
64,Mr LES SCOTT,AYES,"In the couple of minutes available to me, I would like to respond to some of the silly criticisms made by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Neh!). In this debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill we really should not be making those sorts of criticisms. We should take a bipartisan approach to assisting Aboriginal people. It is all very well for the member for Cowper to blame everything on the last 12 years, but I suggest we should look at what has happened in the last 200 years or so. That is the big problem. Until all of us in this place sit down and work together on this issue-instead of the nonsense opposition members have been going on with over the last few months-we are never going to assist the Aboriginal people in this country. It really is disgraceful Crosio, J. A. that opposition members have carried on in the manner they have. They have dragged out this whole process and then have come in here today and caved in. They should have done months ago what they have done today, even though, as the Prime Minister and other speakers today have said, they have done it only for their own political reasons. Opposition members really carryon in a disgraceful way. They have been dishonest throughout this whole process. They have been dishonest with their own constituencies and certainly the people of Australia. Some of the stupid amendments put up by opposition members-such as having land entrusted to people in their individual names-would not achieve anything this bill is trying to achieve. That is why we have been trying to convince them all the time. They are not being honest with the people of Australia on this, and it is about time they were. It is about time they really worked in the best interests of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia.",58

Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It is a matter of clarification. This is the first time in many years that this particular motion has been before the chair.

Mr Tim Fischer-We dealt with those matters this morning because of section 57 of the constitution which says that we had to make a determination on the Senate amendments. We have now, by motion, set it aside.

68,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,The advice I have is that it is now discharged from the Notice Paper. NA Shipping in and around the Great Barrier Reef,59
69,Mr BRERETON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I rise to make a statement about shipping in and around our unique national treasure, the Great Barrier Reef. Presently, ships use two routes to traverse the reef. What is known as the inner route travels from the Torres Strait in the north, to Gladstone in the south. The alternative route-the outer route-comPAIRS mences in the Prince of Wales Channel, leaves the Torres Strait at Bligh Entrance, and continues southwards through the Coral Sea to Sandy Cape, just south of Gladstone. All ships entering and leaving the inner and outer routes have to cross the Torres Strait. At present, pilotage is compulsory in the inner route between Cairns and the Torres Strait for all oil and chemical tankers and liquid natural gas carriers, regardless of size, and all other ships over 70 metres in length. The most hazardous parts of the reef to by navigate are in the. Torres Strait and in the northern section of the inner passage. Narrow channels, strong tides and the presence of fishing boats all enhance the risk of a ground- crew. ing. Furthermore, in the case of the outer route, the process of skirting the reef and the largely uncharted waters pose a similar risk of grounding. With some 87 million tonnes of international trade-mostly Australian exports-shipped through the region annually, this ever present danger is a matter of great concern. Altogether, there are some 2,100 local and international vessel movements annually, including 1,700 through the inner route, 600 of which do not call at any Queensland port inside the reef. This leaves some 400 vessels using the outer. route. Whilst pilotage in the inner route is, as I said, mandatory for all and chemical tankers, liquid natural gas carriers and other ships over 70 metres in length, it is not compulsory in the internationnised al waters of the Torres Strait. Each year, 30 loaded oil tankers enter the Torres Strait and transit the inner route, a similar number travel north along the inner route under ballast. Twenty tankers transit the outer route southward. The government considers that there is no compelling reason for those 30 tankers not to join the 20 tankers using the outer route southward. Few Australians would think of the Great Barrier Reef as a shipping lane. It is seen by most as a precious natural asset-and, indeed, it is. That is certainly the view of the governfinalised ment, and that is why we are determined to take all reasonable steps to minimise the potential for shipping disaster. But in doing so we must strike a balance between protecting the natural environment and maintaining viable shipping lanes. The government has already taken a number of significant steps to safeguard the reef and to improve safety in shipping. Last September I announced new administrative procedures for issuing single voyage permits to foreign vessels. This places an obligation on shippers to undertake thorough safety checks before chartering foreign vessels. This condition came into effect this week. In addition, shippers applying for permits involving bulk carriers and all types of tankers must now certify vital information on the condition of the ship, as well as the qualifications of its As part of the government's response to the House of Representatives Ships of shame report, targeted inspections have doubled and now more than one in two foreign flagged vessels are subject to inspection when they call into Australian ports. This rigorous inspection regime has unquestionably deterred substandard shippers from calling into Australia. Today we can boast the toughest inspection regime in the world; one in which monthly ship detention reports are published to bring substandard shipping to worldwide attention. In terms of the reef itself, by introducing a oil regime of compulsory pilotage for the inner route in October 1991, Australia made this transit route one of the world's few recogcompulsory pilotage areas. More recently, in October 1993, the government announced a detailed review of shipping while in the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait. We did so to ensure that the management of shipping operations maximises environmental protection and minimises the risk of accidents and pollution. This review has been conducted in conjunction with the Queensland government. A wide range of interested parties, including the shipping industry and environmental groups, has been consulted. The report is presently being and will be released by the government soon. Nevertheless, today I want to announce a number of initiatives that will improve the safety of shipping in the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait. The initiatives involve minimising shipping pressure on the inner route; additional steps to improve the safety of ships that use the inner route; improved navigational safety in the Torres Strait; and improving the safety and the reliability of the outer route. We are undertaking these initiatives in the knowledge that many vessels use the Great Barrier Reef inner route because of a lack of suitable charting of the outer route through the Coral Sea. In order to improve the charting of the outer reef, I can today announce that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA, will provide funding for the production of these charts. The task will involve surveying that will begin at Bramble Cay in the eastern approaches to the Torres go down the Queensland coast to the end of the reef just north of Fraser Island, a total distance of some 2,000 kilometres. Once this charting is done, those vessels not calling at Queensland ports that currently use the inner route, will, unless there are exceptional circumstances, have absolutely no reason to do so. Simultaneously with this charting, AM SA will proceed with the introduction of a mandatory ship reporting regime for the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait. AMSA will also seek to implement a reporting system with the agreement of the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, and will aim to have the measures in place before the end of this year. Meanwhile I can assure the House that the Queensland government has been cooperating with the Commonwealth in moving towards the introduction of a vessel traffic system to cover both the North East Channel and the Torres Strait. The Commonwealth is very grateful for the Queensland government's assistance with this task. Together, AMSA and the Queensland government have been looking very closely at initiatives to improve maritime safety in northern waters. Extensive studies by consultants of potential high-technology solutions the navigational problems of the region have now been completed. AM SA and the Queensland government are now negotiating joint ventures to ensure these initiatives can be introduced at the earliest time and in the most cost-effective way. One of the first stages of this cooperative approach will be the introduction of a vessel traffic system to cover the Torres Strait, the Great North Eastern Channel route near Cape York, and the inner route. Extended coverage of this radar traffic system will provide accurate real time information and reduce the prospect of ship collision and groundings. This will be a vast improvement on the present situation where authorities rely on positions radioed in from vessels. It will provide cover of, and information relating to the important 'choke' points - where channels are narrow and the hazard to shipping is Strait and greatly increased. Furthermore, it will assist the Australian and the Queensland agencies involved in vessel traffic to enhance safety by monitoring vessel movements more closely. Extension of the compulsory pilotage area in the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef to cover the Torres Strait area would further reduce the risk of groundings and collisions. After all, human error is the greatest risk to safe shipping. The Torres Strait is an important and busy international shipping lane and Australia must be cognisant of the role of our neighbour, Papua New Guinea, and the international maritime community in seeking ways to improve safety in this ecologically vulnerable region. As the Torres Strait is a recognised international waterway, the extension of compulsory pilotage will involve comprehensive international negotiations. A successful outcome· to these negotiations will be far more difficult to achieve than for the Barrier Reef, which lies totally within Australian waters. I have asked AM SA to pursue the question of compulsory pilotage in the Torres Strait. Indeed, it will now become AM SA 's highest international priority in negotiations through the IMO. It is pleasing to note that around 70 per cent of shipping that is currently transiting to the Torres Strait already uses marine pilots on a voluntary basis. Yet there are a number of foreign flag vessels which place commercial considerations before their .environmental conscience. We now intend to seek international acceptance of the need to carry pilots in these waters. While insisting on the greater use of pilotage in the marine environments, we recognise that technology is constantly offering new ways to improve safety. The latest differential global positioning systems, DGPS, offer improved navigational safety. With DGPS, positioning accuracy is better than 10 metres. This technology is now available and is being trialled successfully by AM SA in Bass Strait and off the Pilbara. Today I announce the establishment of new DGPS broadcasting station on Hom Island in the Torres Strait. It will be by October this year and will greatly improve the accuracy of ship positioning and assist individual ships to navigate safely in these difficult waters. With the establishment of this station AMSA will insist on the compulsory use by pilots of transportable global positionmodel ing equipment. This will ensure that all ships being piloted do so with the benefit of the improved DGPS navigational services. The next few years will see the introduction of computer based charting systems that rapid response. provide further improvements to all navigational systems on all types of vessels. As now, a large amount of work has ;ilieady been completed on this technology. The develophave ment of such a system can and should have implications beyond just the reef. It has the capacity to extend to all of our precious Australian coastline. That makes it a huge undertaking. Such technology is costly develop but it is an investment that Australia must make in the interests of our marine environment and the safety of shipping. To this day, shipping oil spills greatest threat to our coastline. They are a constant threat over which we must be forever vigilant. Vigilance will help prevention or, the event of an unavoidable spillage, the ability to minimise the damage to our marine environment. The Australian government is in the process of negotiating a memorandum of understanda ing with Papua New Guinea on cooperation and assistance in the event of a marine pollution incident affecting either country. of particular relevance to the Torres Strait. There is already considerable cooperation with Papua New Guinea involving AM SA providing significant assistance to the PNG government. Following a major review of· Natplan in 1993, some 30 recommendations were made to improve planning and the capacity to respond to a major spill. Twenty-six actions have now been implemented and the remainfrom ing four are to be completed by the end of 1995. Actions relevant to the Great Barrier Reef include: the positioning of additional a equipment in North Queensland and training for its use; development of a MOO between opened AMSA, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, GBRMPA, and Queensland for safe havens for disabled or damaged ships; priority for research funding going to a bioremediation· proposal to be managed by the GBRMPA; and extension of the on scene spill to cover the Ribbon Reefs area. Reefplan, the regional version of Natplan, is currently undergoing its own review, which will be completed in mid-1995. The emphasis will be on prevention, on planning and on a When taken together as a package, all these of federal government measures enhance shipping safety in this most sensitive of areas. We a great responsibility to current and future generations to protect what is the world's biggest and most beautiful reef, one of the world's great ecological treasures.

They are balanced initiatives, yet initiatives with foresight. I commend the remain the statement to the House.",59

76,Mr SHARP,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Thank you very much, Mr in Deputy Speaker, for your guidance. There no doubt that, for those of us who have had an interest in this issue, this does advance the cause of protecting the Great Barrier Reef. number of people in the chamber today would have heard debates going back over the few years; there has been a great deal of concern and interest from both sides of the House. Indeed, I was going through my own by speeches from the last few years and I that, on 28 November 1988, I said in this House: Talk of damage to the Great Barrier Reef is great concern to Australia, not just from a recreation and aesthetic point of view, but also from economic and employment point of view. In May 1991, we had the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill introduced into the House, and it introduced compulsory pilotage. Unfortunately for the those of who wanted to debate the issue, the guillotine was applied and only the minister's speech was allowed to be heard in the House at the time. Certainly, on that occasion the opposithe tion supported the compulsory pilotage that was put forward at the time. There have been a number of issues in that recent times. We have had bills about oil pollution at sea. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has spoken, I think, on virtually all of these. In relation to the port Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, I said: I personally support the amendments that relate to the prevention of pollution from ships. Another was the Protection of Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill 1993. I refer to speech I made when I represented the opposiplough tion on that matter. We supported attempts, that time, to investigate alternative routes outside the reef. Indeed, it is an interesting point. The minister might like to consider the fact that, at the time, Caltex offered an $80,000 sponsorship to assist in studies on alternative routes outside the reef. I was listening to the minister's speech today, and there was no to mention of that. I wonder whether that sponsorship was ever taken up. Perhaps, if it were, it would be a nice thing to thank Caltex the process. Many people think that our is shipping companies are not as environmentally responsible as people would like to think, yet there have been instances, as is the A case with Caltex, where not only have they tried to be responsible but also they have put last their money where their mouths are. Indeed, Shell is another example. Shell's oil tankers have been travelling outside the reef now for quite some time, in an attempt made Shell to ensure that it creates minimal risk noticed of damage to the Great Barrier Reef. So, there have been a number of shipping companies and oil companies doing their very of best to assist in ensuring that we do not have the any accidents on the reef. Of course, there have been many others who have not, but at least it is worth noting those who have been helping. Throughout all of this, from the opposius tion's point of view and, indeed, from the government's point of view, we have been very keen to do the utmost to protect the reef. The reason the minister is bringing this into House today is that, whilst it would seem logical to have all ships go outside the reef, other than those ships which have to call into ports along the reef, there have been concerns the shipping lanes outside, to the east of, the reef have not been adequately charted. Many old salts will tell you that the original Transcharting that was done many years ago was done very poorly; some, apparently, was not done at all. A lot of the navigational aids are very old and not up to the task today. Of course, that has been a concern, because, if you do not have properly charted waters so a that you can be confident that ships can through those waters without running at into anything, it is probably safer to have ships going inside the reef where there are proper charts. With proper navigational aids and compulsory pilotage, that was probably safer than going outside the reef, at the time. There is no doubt that the initiatives announced today by the minister will ensure that, over time, channels outside the reef become a lot safer, with the addition of proper charting and more navigational aids. That is something that I think will advance a cause that both sides of this House would support: making sure that our Great Barrier Reef is protected as much as it can be. The compulsory DGPS through the Torres Strait is really an essential element. I have actually taken a boat, many years ago now, through the Torres Strait, and at that point you get the Indian and Pacific oceans meeting. You get currents that clash at that point-they go in different directions-you get whirlpools; it is really quite dramatic if you go through that part of the world in a boat. It is a very dangerous waterway. The channels are very narrow, those channels are quite shallow as well, and there is quite a lot of shipping that goes through. So it is really vital that, if we are to advance the cause - ll of u- in this House support, we get that mternatIonal agreement, if you like, with compulsory DGPSs for ships going through that part of the world. It is something that we should promote as quickly as possible. As the minister has pointed out, computer based charting is something that will further enhance our attempts to protect the Great Barrier Reef and it should be seen as a great priority. I hope I am quoting the minister correctly where he talks of the time span for these things over the next few years, and I would hope that we could be more definite. Rather than just saying 'over the next few years', we should actually set ourselves a particular schedule that we could work to so that this gives people the impetus to get on with the job, because when you say, 'We are going to do it over the next few years,' you can never be confident that all the bureaucrats and diplomats that are involved in achieving these things are working at maximum speed. Many of us, as I said earlier, have taken a long and deep interest in this issue. I have visited the oil spill centre in Geelong. For anybody who has an interest in this matter and who has not visited that centre I think it is a very worthwhile thing to do. is sponsored by the oil companies. It is one of our front-line .defences if we do have an oil spill. will That remmds me of the Auditor-Geheral's report No. 9 of 1994-95, which wa- tabled some time ago now. That report looked into ?ur ability to respond to a major oil spill, and m the process identified the Great Barrier Reef as a high risk area. I quote from the report's conclusion: The ANAO considers that with the technology c-lITe-tly availabl-there is no certainty that a major Oil spill can be dispersed before it impacts on the shoreline. This is something that we need to be looking at also, that we must have the equipment necessary to ensure that we can deal with a major oil spill in this part of the world. The downside to travelling outside the reef is that if you do have an oil spill occurring at that point, . the winds and the currents along that coasthne are such that you actually will drive the oil, or whatever chemical spills out of the that ship, across the entire width of the reef whereas, as happened in the past, where yocome up through the middle of the reef you run the risk of putting oil over only half of the - e-f, if you like. That is a simple analogy, but It IS roughly right. By going outside the reef we do increase !h- - rea potentially affected by an oil spill, so It IS Important that we also do what we can to ens!l-- that we have g?t oil spill recovery facIlitIes to ensure that If something does go wrong we can do our very best to mop it up. The one thing that we all worry about, apart from the ecological damage, is the television news reports around the world that would - isplay ou- Great Barrier Reef in a very poor hght, and It would do our tourism industry a great deal of harm. We all have memories of the Exxon Valdez going down in Prince William Sound and the oil spill that was portrayed for weeks after that on the television. It promoted a bad image. We all remember the Kirki, and we were very fortunate that that did not do much damage in the long term because the oil broke up and evaporated. So we really need to make sure that whatever oil spill response we have is adequate to the task ahead of us, and from the Auditor-General's view there is some doubt that we have adit equate equipment to meet that task. I have got a book somewhere in my shelves which I acquired from the seamen's union; when 1. went on board the Trans-Tasman trader from Brisbane to Auckland some years ago they kindly gave me a book, a history of their union. I must admit it took me an hour and a half of getting my ear bashed in order to be awarded it. Rather diplomatically, I might add, I came second in the darts competition, allowing the leading trade unionist on board the vessel to actually win the darts competition. So I won this book. At any rate, there is a chart in the book which highlights the number of known wrecks there have been over the years along the coastline of Australia. It is amazing to see the number: hundreds, in fact, and many of them on the Great Barrier Reef. It is worth making the point that, just because there is an accident at sea with an oil spill, it does not necessarily mean the end of the world: the oil can evaporate and break up, and the reef can recover. There has been a tremendous amount of oil spilt on the reef, particularly during Second World War, so all of these things need to be taken into account. The opposition supports these sensible moves-as it has done over the past several years-to ensure that we are doing everything that we can, through this parliament, to protect the Great Barrier Reef, the jewel in our national tourism crown. This is something that I am pleased to see that the Australia shipowners and the various oil companies support. With a sensible approach, we can be doing our best to enhance the safety of the Great Barrier Reef. I can assure the Minister for Transport and the House that the opposition will again be supporting the government initiative on this issue. New Directions in Australia's Overseas Aid Program",63
77,Mr BILNEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Kingston-Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs)-by leave-In my last annual report to parliament on the aid program, which I tabled at the end of 1993, I set out the government's approach to poverty alleviation through its aid program. In that report, I emphasised the importance of sustainable economic growth and social development proceeding in tandem. The report I am tabling today highlights significant new directions in Australia's aid program in the social sector and in the area of humanitarian relief. The report also covers the major achievements of the aid program over the past 12 months, and I shall begin my comments by outlining some of the most important of these achievements. Despite the need for continued budgetary restraint in order to consolidate the economic recovery in Australia, the government demonstrated its commitment to international development by increasing Australia's aid program by 3.6 per cent in real terms. This meant that we were one of only four of the 21 OECD donors who increased their aid programs in the last year. As a result, Australia continues to remain above the average for donors in terms of the aid to GNP ratio. Aid volume apart, there have been significant changes in our region, not least in Indochina and the South Pacific. Further afield, the transition to democracy in South Africa will change the the nature of economic relationships throughout southern Africa. I draw attention now to significant developments in Australia's relationship with the South Pacific. During the run-up to the South Pacific Forum-which was held in Brisbane in August last year-I gave a speech to the Foreign Correspondents Association, highlighting the need for policy reforms in the. region. The overriding theme of my address was the need for the region's governments to develop improved national policies to encourage sustainable social and economic growth. I am pleased to say that this theme was taken on board by regional leaders and, as a result, the forum generated an unprecedented level of commitment to improve economic and environmental policies, particularly in forestry. Just recently, a code of conduct on logging was agreed by officials from forum island countries, and only last week a meeting of the region's finance ministers took place in Suva, at which crucial policy issues were discussed, including fiscal, forestry and civil aviation matters which have been identified as priorities by island leaders. In Papua New Guinea, we have agreed on a radical transformation of the aid program. By the end of the decade, the program will have completely moved from budget support to jointly programmed project activities. In Indochina---one of the poorest regions of the world, where annual incomes per head are less than $400---our aid program is panding rapidly. In May 1994, we announced a four-year, $350 million package, targeted the high priority areas of health, infrastruction ture, education, human rights and the strengthening of legal institutions. One of the most visible examples of the effectiveness of our development assistance is the Mekong River Friendship Bridge. It is the first road link between Laos and Thailand and will yield substantial economic benefits to both countries. Moreover, as one of the highest profile aid projects undertaken by Australia in recent years-and incidentally, project completed ahead of schedule and under budget-the bridge is an invaluable showcase for Australian capabilities in major infrastructure design and technology transfer. I wish to draw members' attention government's response to the tragedy of Rwanda. The government has so far contributed $35 million to support the relief effort there, a contribution matched by an extraordiway nary public response of over $30 million. Australia's response was one of the earliest and, from my observations, one of the most effectively targeted of all donors. At the same time, and despite our limited resources, have begun an increased program to support the peaceful transition to majority rule in South Africa by providing assistance of million over three years. This program has been designed to meet the objectives of the Government of National Unity's reconstrucon tion and development program, including through building up capacity in areas such planning, economic policy and the media. There have also been important developments in the sector focus of Australia's aid program. In particular, we have continued expand environmental assistance, and in this financial year, we will spend around $120 million on these activities. Amongst other things, this funding will cover the establishof ment of what we are calling 'Green DIFF', part of the highly successful development import finance facility which has been the catalyst for many Australian companies to become involved in the region. Green DIFF will help to finance environmental projects in areas such as pollution control and energy exefficiency, gaining wider exposure for Australia's environmental expertise. The last at budget also heralded an Australian contribuof nearly $43 million to replenish the global environment facility, as well as an increase in support for the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. A vibrant private sector is an essential part of the development process. Initiatives such as the private sector linkages program, which last year saw its budget allocation double to $10 million, are targeted at this sector. In addition, the informal sector is now recoga nised as a fundamental resource for social and economic development. Australia's aid program is reflecting this with an increased allocation of funds to micro-enterprise development, with a two-year $1.3 million package for development in the South Pacific and to the South-East Asia. The change in the role of the private sector in development is just one example of the that the aid program has adapted to remain relevant and effective. Another excellent example is provided by this year's launch of the policy document Towards a sustainable future: ecologically sustainable development we through Australia's development cooperation program. I am sure that the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Mayo $30 (Mr Downer), would agree that this is a catchy title. Australia's policy in this area fully takes into account the UN Conference Environment and Development in Rio by defining the importance of integrating the as economic, ecological and social dimensions of development. The past year has also seen the government continue to pursue policies on human rights to and good governance through the aid program. On human rights, Australia's policy is to maintain a consistent and principled stand against abuses, while stressing the importance continued engagement through dialogue and institution building. On good governance, Australia's policy encourages the effective management of social and economic resources in developing countries in a manner that is open, transparent, accountable and equitable. As you can see, over the past year we have continued a process of review and adaptation which will ensure that Australia's aid program continues to be of the highest quality, responpopulation sive to the needs of developing countries and appropriate to Australia's place in the world. I would now like to turn to new developments in our overseas assistance in the social sector. The government's policy framework for poverty reduction has three components: firstly, encouraging sustainable economic growth; secondly, investment in human resources through education, health, capacity building and social sector development; and thirdly, provision of safety nets and poverty targeting, including humanitarian relief. The social sector provides a crucial contribudget, bution to sustainable social and economic development. Recent World Bank reports have highlighted the major role that government commitment to social sector development, particularly in education, has played in the rapid growth of many Asian economies. Reflecting this importance, the past two budgets have seen a significant upgrading of the already high priority given to the social sector in the aid program through the introduction of major population and health initiatives. In the 1993-94 budget, we trebled expenditure on the population sector with a four-year, $130 million initiative. To ensure the effectiveness of this initiative, the government commissioned an independent inquiry into the links between population and development. This was one of the most comprehensive surveys of population and development issues ever undertaken, and its conclusions have been vital in highlighting the complex links between population and development. The results of this inquiry have helped AIDAB to develop a range of principles which now guide our aid program's population activities. Among the most important of these principles is that access to safe and effective family planning services is a fundamental right, and that women should have access to a wide range of reproductive health services and should participate fully in defining the services they need. Above all-and I want to emphasise this as much as I cancoercion has no place in the Australian aid program's family planning activities. The priority which the aid program gives to issues was reflected in the major role that Australia played at the International Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo in September 1994, at which I was present. Helped by our efforts, the conference adopted a groundbreaking program of action for the empowerment of women and called for major increases in global resources for family planning and health activities. I would also like to refer to the significant developments in the nature of our assistance to the health sector. Funding for health was given a major boost in the 1994-95 aid with the introduction of a four-year initiative targeting four priority areas: malaria, polio, neonatal tetanus and HlV-AIDS. This initiative involves additional funding of $110 million over the next four years, which nearly doubles Australia's current spending on health under the aid program. As with our assistance to the population activities, AIDAB has developed a set of principles which will guide this new funding. These principles state that improvements in health are best achieved through an integrated approach which tackles the causes of poverty and improves the status and well-being of vulnerable groups, particularly women and children. Changes are also afoot in Australia's program of assistance to education and training. It is true that assistance to the education sector has always been a large part of the aid program. At present, the sector receives an allocation of a little under 20 per cent of the total budget. The majority of that funding goes towards assistance at the tertiary level. We are now reviewing our assistance in this sector with a view to diversifying the kinds of assistance to include increased support for basic, technical and vocational education. There is no doubt of the social, economic, health and population gains that are derived from basic education. At the same time, the primary responsibility for the provision of basic education lies with the recipient governdemonstrated ment-aid should not substitute for that responsibility. That means that our assistance to the education sector must be carefully targeted to assist and strengthen, rather than replace or duplicate,the efforts of national governments. Finally, I would like to talk about developments in the humanitarian relief program. One of the most tragic features of the past few years has been the continued increase in the frequency and the impact of international emergencies. In the past five years, over 300 million people have been affected by natural disasters and civil strife. Over the past 20 years, the number of refugees has risen from an estimated three million to 23 million, half of whom are children and most of whom are from developing countries. That is a huge cost in human terms. It is also a huge financial cost. Just to give two examples: the annual expenditure of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has risen from $US450 million in the mid-1980s to $US 1.1 billion in 1993, and the cost of UN peacekeeping operations has risen from under $US 1 billion in 1991 to over $US4 billion in 1993. And it is tragic that this trend shows sign of slowing. The forces which drive this situation are highly complex and demand an equally complex international response. Factors such as the link between poverty and vulnerability, the increase in political volatility since the end of the Cold War and the proliferation of humanitarian relief agencies have to be taken into account in providing a coordinated response. It was against this backdrop of increasing complexity and growing demand for assistance that early last year AIDAB undertook an extensive review of its refugee and relief program. The results of this review are helping the government to update Australia's response to international humanitarian emergencies. The review found that Australia's spending on humanitarian relief had not followed the rapid increases of other donors. This relative decline in funding for humanitarian emergencies is in stark contrast to the clear wishes of the ing paper: Australian public, which has repeatedly that it wants our government to respond generously to such humanitarian tragedies as those witnessed in Rwanda. AIDAB is already responding to the recommendations of the review and is also exploring opportunities for increasing funds for humanitarian relief. As Australia improves its aid response to international humanitarian emergencies, we also share a responsibility with the international community to do more to prevent disasters and complex emergencies from happening in the first place. This is a priority that requires a range of strategies addressing the underlying causes of dispute and conflict. We require improvements in prevention and response strategy through arrangements which minimise threats to security, promote confidence and trust, and create frameworks for dialogue and cooperation. We must also develop peace-building activities to ensure that conflict does not arise in the first place or, if it does, to ensure that it does not recur. That involves strategies which encourage economic and social development, environmental protection, human rights and good governance. Australia will be doing as much no as possible through the aid program to support these activities. In the years ahead, I am confident that Australia will continue to deliver a compassionate and effective aid program that has a real impact on the lives of millions of people throughout the developing world. As I have said before, Australia's future, and the Australian people, demand nothing less.",65
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Mr Nehl)Before I call the honourable member for Mayo, Minister, in your second paragraph you made reference to a report to be tabled today. Do you actually intend to table something or were you referring to the statement you just made?",68
79,Mr BILNEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"And here it is. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Your attention to detail demands commendation. For the information of honourable members, I present the followNew directions in Australia's overseas aid program.",68
80,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the issue of overseas aid. As I think the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) would be aware, on this side of the House we· believe that the purpose of foreign aid is to provide for basic needs in two respects: first, in terms of humanitarian assistance; and, secondly, in terms of assisting with sustainable economic growth. It is important, though, in the context of this debate to outline what aid should not be. It should not be some kind of high level bribery or foreign policy instrument which is cynically used to advance a political interest rather than to advance those basic needs that I spoke of earlier. Secondly, aid should not be used as a way of circumventing GATT rules on international trade and subsidising exports. That is not what our aid program is supposed to be about, and in too many countries around the world aid programs are used for those objectives rather than the fundamental objective of the provision of basic needs. We on this side of the House have for many years emphasised the need for community based project aid and have expressed in general terms our reservations about what often become big, white elephant, so-called infrastructure projects. Some of them are fine, but we have expressed reservations about there being too much emphasis in our aid program on those sorts of projects. I wish to address three or four of the issues that arose from the minister's statement. The most controversial issue involves how much aid the government provides. In his statement, the minister claimed that the government demonstrated its commitment to international development by increasing Australia's aid program. That statement is completely disingenuous and the minister knows that it is. That statement can be measured against three sets of standards: firstly, the standards which the Australian Labor Party set itself before the last election; secondly, world standards; and, thirdly-and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) likes to do this in relation to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard)-the standards of the previous government. During the 1993 election campaign the Labor Party promised to achieve an aid target of 0.4 per cent of GDP by 1995. Mr Bilney-What is your policy?",69
81,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Forget our policy. Do you remember your own policy, Minister? Do you remember going out there and promising that you would reach the 0.4 per cent target? Of course the minister remembers it, and of course the Prime Minister remembers it. How has the Labor Party measured up to its own standards? According to the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, the Labor government's pre-election pledge to achieve 0.4 per cent of GNP by 1995 was broken only six months after the election. So the government set a standard, recklessly and deceptively, knowing that it would never achieve it. What it has achieved is 0.34 per cent-from my recollection of last year's budget, that was the figure. It would just about crack 0.33 per cent, in fact. That is well short· of what the Labor Party promised Australians at the last election. So, according to its own standards, the Australian Labor Party has failed in this area. The government did something that it should not have done: it said one thing to the Australian people and, on being re-elected, went off and did another thing. If the government intended to reduce aid as a proportion of GNP, why did it not tell the people? Why did it tell them something else? Why did it try to get the votes of the aid groups in the community and of all those Australians who are interested in aid-which is quite a lot of people-by telling them one thing and doing another? You can get away with it once, but you will not get away with it twice. What about the government's performance against the standards of the rest of the world? Interestingly enough, it was AIDAB which gave me these very good charts. Here is one which deals pretty effectively with the minister's claim that somehow Australia has performed well by OECD standards. This chart shows movements in aid to GNP ratios, conveniently from 1982-83 to 1993-over the life of the Labor government. Of all the countries on the OECD Development Assistance Committee, Australia comes second last. Only the United States has a worse record than Australia in that period. That information was given to me yesterday by AIDAB. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table the chart so that the House has the opportunity to peruse the work of AIDAB and the record of this government: a record which does not match its rhetoric. Leave not granted.",69
82,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The shame of it. I will make sure that this is circulated to the offices of all Labor members because I think they should read it. The government should not say one thing and turn around and do another. The minister claimed in his speech that Australia is above the average for donors in terms of aid to GNP ratios. That is funny. The information from AIDAB shows the unweighted average and the weighted average in 1983. Obviously, the unweighted average should be used. In 1983, Australia was not far above the average, but we were above it. Today, according to AIDAB, we are there and the average is there. It is way below. Here we have the mystique of the weighted average where just about the whole of the weighting is taken up by the United States and Japan; it is under the falsest of all ways of trying to measure your generosity in terms of aid. You know the unweighted average is the only intellectually honest average to use. You are trying to tell the aid community that we have a target of 0.4 per cent. When an election comes you abandon it. You are saying that we are being very generous and that we are above the OECD average because we have worked out some sort of construction of a weighted average which, if I may say so, is the most fanciful piece of actuarial work that I have seen in a very long time. On the basis of the unweighted average, we are way down. But the most crippling piece of evidence for the Labor Party is that, according to AIDAB itself, our record was the second worse in the OECD over the last dozen years-that is, while Labor has been in office. Against the standards of the previous government, I do not really need to elaborate, except to say in 1982-83, when we were above the OECD weighted and unweighted averages, Australia's aid was 0.5 per cent of GNP. During the life of the Fraser government, we had a record that has never been closely matched by the Hawke and, of course, now Keating governments. If I could turn to some of the program issues and make a few points about them, first of all, given that the Jackson report was many years ago, there should be a full and independent review of Australia's cooperation development program. I do not know whether the minister and the government are planning to do that in the near future, but it would be a constructive initiative. If it does not do it within the next year, we will do it during 1996. The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs can look forward to reading about it. In your particular case, you will be lucky to know anything about what we are doing in government unless you read the newspapers because you will not be a member here. Kingston is a seat that we look forward very much to taking. Mr Grace-Promises.",70
83,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"We have certainly nearly won it on several occasions, and we have been creeping up at every election. It got very close last time. The second point, though, is in relation to educational assistance and development. The government and the minister claim that nearly 20 per cent of the total aid budget is spent on education. That sounds quite good when you put it that way. But, as the minister pointed out, the vast majority is in fact spent on scholarship assistance at the tertiary level. To be fair-and I always am fair-the minister's own statement of the need to review assistance in the educational sector, to use his words, 'with a view to diversifying the kinds of assistance to include increased support for basic technical and vocational education' is a good statement and is very much in line with coalition policy. The more you read our statements and start to implement them, the more support you will get that from us. There will be no hypocrisy from us. My third point relates to Australian sponsored training scholarships. In the ASTS scheme, the recipient government nominates students, who are usually officials in key positions in that country's public sector, to study in Australian tertiary institutions. The minister concedes the point that, with so much weight given to that program, our contribution in terms of education is not as effective as it could be. I was. glad to read what the minister had to say on that count in his speech. As far as health is concerned, the Australian Council for Overseas Aid says that only 3.6 per cent of bilateral aid is spent on health. I do not know whether the government agrees with that figure. Over the years, health has been a seriously neglected aspect of our aid programs, so we would welcome the greater focus on that issue. There are things that are good and there are things that are less good in what the government has been doing here. I tum to the issue of aid and human rights. The link between aid and human rights must be reviewed very carefully. Obviously, we have to avoid hurting people who are the innocent victims of regimes which show no respect for human rights. That is a very important point to make. The answer I suppose is to decrease the reliance of government to government aid in those circumstances and to increase aid delivery to the community level through AIDAB and non-government organisations. This government basically rejects the link between aid donations and human rights. That has been the rhetoric of the government and, on many occasions, certainly the activity of the government. However, the government has suspended aid to Burma until the SLORC makes clear-cut reforms. Is the government, in rejecting any link between aid and human rights, turning around and saying that it has a different policy in relation to Burma? Or is it conceding that there is a role for human rights and decisions about aid volumes and directions? The government cannot have it both ways. I think the government needs to make its position on that issue much clearer than it is at the moment. The government has shown a great deal of enthusiasm for increasing aid to Vietnam. When the Prime Minister visited Vietnam, he announced a very substantial increase in aid. That country, which is now by far the largest recipient of Australian aid in Indochina, does not have a great record on human rights. Vietnam's record on human rights has not been of much concern to the government. But, quite rightly, the government has been concerned with Burma's record on human rights. The government needs to think through-as I think it does generally with its foreign policy-a lot more carefully where human rights fit into its aid policy so as to articulate a clear and coherent policy. Then those opposite can escape from charges of hypocrisy as everybody will know where they stand. The problem with so much of this debate aboQt aid is that the rhetoric comes out to suit the moment, but the principles underlying the policy are never clear. I think we have established that matter pretty clearly in the course of this debate. I would like to raise many other matters but, to be fair to the other honourable members, time does not permit. In summary, the coalition welcomes the fact that this statement has been made. It provides an opportunity for some discussion on this crucial issue. We urge greater focus on basic health, education and other community level developments in our aid program. We have been concerned about some of the massive infrastructure projects, of which I spoke earlier. We have to be very careful about the way in which those things are handled. We need to be particularly cautious about the downstream economic benefits that might flow to the recipient country. We need to review the trade subsidy levels as a percentage of the aid budget. Those levels look high-although I understand the economic arguments. I think a great deal more thought needs to be given to that matter. We need to clarify and implement human rights principles in our aid program that are coherent and consistent. As I said earlier, we also need a comprehensive review of a development cooperation program in this country. It is well overdue now, as many years have past since the last independent review was carried out. We need further debate in Australia about the nature of our aid, its direction and its underlying principles rather than just one question being asked of the amount of aid provided. Obviously, you cannot be trusted in relation to the amount of aid provided. It does not matter what you say before the next election because, in the unlikely event of your getting re-elected, what you actually do will be totally at variance with what you say. Forget making any promises on that front, because nobody will believe them. If you address some of those other issues, I think the aid program might start to come together a little more coherently.

Ordered that the report be printed.",72
86,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The First Corporate Law Simplification BilL1994 was referred to the committee by the House on 8 February 1995 for consideration and report to the House by 27 February 1995. On 27 February, the House agreed that the time for presentation of the committee's report be extended to today. The bill amends the Corporations Law and is the first bill under the corporate law simpliraised fication program. The bill deals with share buybacks, proprietary companies and registers. A feature of the bill is its plain English style and language. Following its referral by the House, the committee examined the bill, having particular regard to matters raised during the debate on the bill in the House on 8 February. The committee referred matters raised in debate in the House to the corporations law simplification task force and other interested bodies for their response. On Wednesday 22 February, the committee conducted a public hearing on the bill in Melbourne. The witnesses who appeared before the committee included representatives of accounting bodies, the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Finance Conference and the simplification task force. On Tuesday 28 February, the committee held further discussions with the simplification task force and with Mr Leigh Hall, chair of the Corporations Law Simplification Consultative Group. The committee acknowReport ledges the considerable effort of all those who have participated in the task force's consultative process and those who have provided the committee with submissions or who appeared before the committee at its public hearing. The committee notes that an extensive consultative process has been undertaken Report during the preparation and drafting of the bill. The bill has received general support from the investment, professional and user groups interested in the bill. The starting point of the committee's report is that, subject to specific matters mentioned in its report, the committee considers the bill should be passed by the parliament. Having said that, in relation to a number of concerns raised with or by the committee, where strong or different views were firmly held by individual members ·of the committee, the committee endeavoured to be of most assistance to the House by seeking to find as much common ground as possible and openly make on-balance judgments and leave some issues for consideration by the Attorney-General and debate in the parliament. I deal in turn with some principal issues about the bill which the committee has examined in some detail. The first concern was whether the division of proprietary companies into small and large companies as proposed by the bill be adopted, or whether a reporting entity test proposed by the accounting bodies be adopted. The committee found this a difficult matter to resolve. The committee concluded on balance that the test proposed by the bill should be adopted, as the reporting entity test does not provide a test of sufficient certainty to allow an objective assessment to be made of whether a company falls within the reporting entity test when compared with the small-large distinction provided in the bill. Particularly in view of the Australian Securities Commission submission that the test in the bill provides a simple and objective test which, from a regulator's and a company's view point will not lead to any uncertainty about whether the requirement to lodge accounts applies, the committee concluded that the small-large test be supported over the reporting entity test. By way of aside, I should make the point that on this issue Senator MCGauran has provided the House with a dissenting report. The second concern was whether the criteria proposed in the bill for distinguishing between small and large proprietary companies be adopted in whole or in part. The test proposes that a company would move from a small to a large proprietary company when it had two out of the following three criteria: more than 50 employees, a gross operating revenue of more than $10 million, and assets of more than $5 million. The simplification task force indicated that the effect of using a one out of three test would cause more companies than desirable to fall within the large company category. The practical effect of setting up a one out of three test would negate the intended effect of the scheme, namely, to reduce the unnecessary regulatory burden on small business. The task force also indicated that the effect of setting up a three out of three test would be to impose an unnecessarily restrictive test which would undesirably limit the number of large companies that would be obliged to prepare accounts. The committee has found the resolution of questions about an appropriate test for defining a small or large proprietary company extremely difficult. The committee believes that, of the three criteria provided in the bill, the tests of assets and turnover are far and away the most important. The committee believes these two tests must be included in criteria for distinguishing small from large proprietary companies. The committee was much less convinced that a necessary test for distinguishing a small company was whether a company has more than 50 employees. The committee was unable to reach an unqualified view on the test, and believes that the Attorney-General should give serious consideration to two options, namely, that the 50 employees criterion should remain, or that the test of more than 50 employees be deleted from the bill and the test for a small-large proprietary company be on the proposed assets and turnover criteria. The third concern was whether a register of debenture holders as provided in the bill should be public. The committee considered that convertible debentures should be treated in the same manner as shares and options and that the bill not be changed so far as it relates to convertible debentures. However, there seems to be insufficient reason to automatically treat other debentures in the same manner. The committee recommends that a register be kept of debentures, other than convertible debentures, but that access to the register should be subject to the same Australian Securities Commission power of exemption as at present, together with the privacy regime implemented by the bill. A range of other issues were considered in some detail by the committee. One was the number of shareholders and directors in a proprietary company. In relation to the creation of single member proprietary company, as proposed by the bill, the committee has accepted that there should be single member companies. This change will particularly do away with the perennial problem of twoperson companies where a company has two directors, with one director an 'active' director, and another director--often a spouse or partner-a 'silent' director. The silent director has usually taken no actual role in the running of such companies. The situation which has arisen all too often is that a company fails, due to no fault of the silent director. The resulting financial problems for a silent director, who is usually jointly liable for the failed company's liabiliASC ties, is often referred to in the case of spouses as 'sexually transmitted debt'. The bill proposes the incorporation of small business guide in the body of the Corporations Law. Some members of the committee had significant reservations about this method of drafting, believing, as a matter of principle, that material not forming part the law should not be included in legislation. The committee believes the inclusion of the guide in the Corporations Law is an innovation tive measure, and considers that any risk poses is outweighed by the benefits it promisconscious es. The committee has, however, recommendconsultative ed that inclusion of the guide in the act itself be subject to review by the Attorney-General after it has been in operation for a reasonable time. In relation to provisions governing the audit of accounts of proprietary companies, the committee would be concerned at any waterthis ing down of prescriptions as to who can audit the financial records of a registered company. The committee does not consider that the matters raised by the accounting bodies requires an amendment to the bill, but expects that the problem highlighted by the accountwill ing bodies in their submission and evidence will be addressed by the audit and accounting working party set up under the simplification process. The Corporations Law confers considerable discretion on the ASC in its power to require preparation of financial reports, and in many other areas. The ASC already publishes policy statements indicating the way in which it will administer the Corporations Law, practice notes for the guidance of practitioners on reporting and compliance matters, and class orders modifying the law in relation to classes or persons. However, the committee does not believe that a broad examination of the use by the ASC of its discretionary powers is approthose priate in the context of this bill. Given that the ASC intends publishing its guidelines in respect of requiring small prostarted prietary companies to prepare accounts, the committee considers that the bill should passed in its present form in this respect. The committee, however, also believes that the should prepare a quarterly report to the Attorney-General stating the reasons it has given in the relevant quarter for requiring a small proprietary companies to prepare accounts, and that the report provided to the Attorney-General be tabled in parliament. I wish to make some concluding comments about the simplification process itself. As part of of its statutory duties to monitor the national scheme laws, the committee has monitored the establishment and progress of the simplificaprocess and the consultative process it which that has involved. The committee is that, due to its extensive nature, the process will occasionally give rise to provisions that do not meet the approval of all groups in the process. The inquiry has shown the committee a number of examples of such a situation. However, in the light of recent discussions with the task force and during the inquiry into bill, the committee is satisfied with the effectiveness of the task force's consultative process. Indeed, the committee is strongly of the view that the process followed by the task force is a great improvement on past practice and supports its continuation. The committee continue to monitor the simplification and consultative process as part of its role of scrutiny of the administration and development of the national corporate law scheme.",72
87,Mrs BISHOP,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I came to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities as a newly appointed member after the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill had been introduced into the House. My initial concern, as I said at the time, was that one of the intended consequences of the bill could well have been that the Labor Party would have the opportunity of no longer filing accounts for its operative companies which deal with its money, finance its elections and deal with its property. I set concerns out in my speech in the second reading debate. When I came onto the committee and to look at the bill in totality, I saw that there were some matters of quite considerable be concern that needed to be investigated to a greater extent. The report as it is being presented today, recommending that the legislation be passed, has dealt with some of the concerns in a satisfactory way, but some remarks need to be made to indicate that there are ongoing concerns which may have to be dealt with in the future. Clearly, the most contentious issue was the decision to introduce a new test for which proprietary companies should be required to lodge their accounts and returns with the Australian Securities Commission and which companies should not. This is not a novel proposition in that the situation already exists where companies are broken into those required to file and those not required to file. The old test was the exempt and non-exempt test-a complicated test. The simplification process should be commended, but there are some examples in the bill where, in an attempt to simplify, we are perhaps slipping into some shoddy practices. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) may address some of those in his remarks, as he made the point quite well during the committee hearing. There are one or two others as well. To turn to the most contentious issue: the introduction of the new test of when you shall be required to file accounts and when you shall not be required to file accounts is now known as the small-large test. That means that, under the current bill, if you are a company and you meet two out of three criteria set down in the bill, you will be excused from filing your accounts. I asked: why were these three criteria chosen? What sort of evidence was presented to the consultative group or, indeed, to us as members of the committee that said that this is a good way to proceed? Or did somebody just wake up one day and say, 'This looks like a good idea'? The answer seems to be that there was a paper prepared for the consultative group. In evidence the chairman of that group---and he spoke with the committee-said that there is such a test in operation in the United Kingdom and New Zealand and he thought in Canada but he could not remember. Upon further inquiry it became apparent that the United Kingdom had the two out of three test, but New Zealand, which has more recently introduced a test for large and small, has a two out of two test. The chairman of the committee has already addressed the fact that we had a large number of submissions dealing with a different form of test altogether. But once the committee had decided that it was interested in recommending the largesmall test, the question of what criteria should be met became a focus. It is important to say that what became apparent is that the system we are introducing has been lifted from the United Kingdom system. When I asked the following question of one of the members of the task force: 'Was our system just like the United Kingdom system?', he said, 'It's very close, but we had to make some adjustments on money.' I will go into that in a minute. When it came to the New Zealand question, we had no evidence at all. We do not know why New Zealand chose two out of two instead of two out of three. We do not know whether or not the test in the United Kingdom works well or works badly. We saw no evidence. None was brought to the committee. On this very point, I feel that perhaps we should have been in a position to do a more thorough job. I will go to the three criteria that are listed in the bill. They state: A proprietary company is a small proprietary company for a financial year if it satisfies at least 2 of the following paragraphs: (a) the consolidated gross operating revenue for the financial year of the company and the entities it controls (if any) is less than $10 million (b) the value of the gross consolidated assets at the end of a financial year of the company and the entities it controls (if any) is less than $5 million (c) the company and the entities it controls (if any) have fewer than 50 employees at the end of the financial year. If your company complies with two out of the three criteria, you are excused. That is the position in the United Kingdom. The New Zealanders have said that, if you have consolidated operating revenue for the financial year of a set sum of dollars, around $10 million, or if the value of your gross consolidated assets at the end of the year is less than a certain figure-we say $5 million; they have a figure of their own-then you are excused from filing. If it is greater than those two figures, you must file. In this country, if you are a large company which has a gross operating revenue of $12 million a year-so you are above the testand gross consolidated assets at the end of the financial year of $10 million, above the $5 million, and if in the month of May you have 60 employees on your books, you would be caught. You would have to file. But if you decided to fire 15 employees or of the 60 people you had working for you only 45 were employees, the rest were casual, contract labour or the like, you could drop one of the really substantive tests and say, 'We have got fewer than 50 employees, so we are excused. We do not have to disclose what our returns are.' I think that is a test which militates against employment and against allowing sunshine onto the accounts and the affairs of corporations. When we said that we could not form an unqualified view, that is a perfectly accurate statement. It certainly was an unqualified view. We have asked that the Attorney-Generallook further into this matter. In fairness, it would be very sensible if the Attorney-General could take a very good look at the New Zealanders' experience and assess why they rejected the United Kingdom test which we have adopted and how well or how badly it works for them. There was some confusion even in the mind of the chairman of the consultative group. When I said, 'If you meet three out of three, more people would be caught,' he expressed a contrary view. That was cleared up later. But the bottom line is that it remained a matter of some ,confusion as to why it was the right or the wrong decision. A couple of other things were quite important. There was an effort originally to show that the professions that were affected by this legislation were all gung-ho and in favour of it. That is not true either. The Law Council of Australia was split. The insolvency committee said: To suggest to people in business that certain advantages are available only while their companies remain ""small"" is short sighted and counter-productive. However, the corporate committee of the Law Council of Australia thought it was a great test. So there is confusion in the ranks. The Institute of Chartered Accountants and the CPAs said they did not like the test and wanted another test. There is still a lot of debate out in the community. The other thing it is important to say is that, whilst we are introducing simplified legislation, let us do what we say. We are moving to have legislation that says when Fred Smith, businessman, or Joanna Smith, businesswoman, picks up a piece of legislation, he or she can see what it really means. But, still, in the body of the drafting we have definitions by implication. We have a list that we have defined within the body of the legislation as to who can be a proprietary company, who is eligible to be subject to the large-small test and who is not. A public company cannot be a proprietary company; but we do not say what it is to be a public company. A note to me this morning from the corporations law simplification program said that there will be another bill coming in. I look forward to that. By implication, the bill defines what you have to be to be a proprietary company. If you do not fit that, you are a public company. But then there is an additional definition saying that a company which is limited by both shares and guarantee may not be a proprietary company. That is new, but it makes it clear. I think it would have been sensible to add that a company that is limited by guarantee alone is also a public company. Somebody who picks up the legislation could then clearly read it rather than having it implied from the new section 116 which, by implication, defines a public company. This bill is a good start and the work of the committee of this House is going to be more important as we proceed. One of the implicit difficulties with moving to plain English in an attempt to simplify the law is that you can create uncertainty instead of certainty. By moving away from certain set legal phrases which have defined meanings we could move to new phrases which have undefined meanings; and uncertainty can result. That is why I felt very sympathetic to Mr Tanner who has concerns about putting the small business guide into the act. This is a beginning. I commend the idea of making law readily available to people because I have a fundamental problem with the concept that the law shall be the law by which we are bound but ordinary folk find it incomprehensible. For the same reason, I hope to goodness that one day we will move to some sensible simplification in the area of tax law. But at least in this area we have begun, with the requirement that the Australian Securities Commission will now flag its guidelines as to when it will require additional proprietary companies to file. We are starting to see some accountability return in that area as well.",74
88,Mr TANNER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I, too, applaud the work of the corporations law simplification task force and also the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in heading down this path to simplification of the Corporations Law. I will make a couple of comments on some of the matters raised by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). With respect to the absence of any reference in our report to the company being limited by guarantee, we have a difference about that. In my view the position is perfectly clear elsewhere in the legislation, in section 116, which she referred to. It was unnecessary for us to make reference to that. This issue, to the extent that it will be dealt with in any way by simplification processes, will be dealt with in a subsequent bill. It should be noted that this is the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994 and deals only with certain sections of the law. I would also like to refer to the question of the so-called small-large test and, in particular, the limb with respect to 50 employees. I disagree with the suggestion of the member for Mackellar that that militates against employment. I think it is beyond comprehension that any company will be so motivated to avoid the need to report or to file returns that it would dismiss employees or go through all sorts of convoluted arrangements in order to bring itself below the 50 employees. I do not agree with that concern. However, it is fair to say, as the committee reported, that this particular limb of the test is clearly of lesser importance than the other two limbs. That is, in my view, primarily because it is actually less certain when you consider factors like having full-time and casual employees who may work only every now and then--every few weeks or every few months. Clearly, it is less certain than the other tests with respect to assets and turnover. For that reason, the committee has reported that the Attorney-General should give consideration to the merits of this particular limb of the test. However, the broader point that does prevail on this issue is: where do you draw the line? At one end of the spectrum, we have large proprietary companies that should be filing accounts and reporting. That is obviously in the community's interest. At the other end of the spectrum, we have very small companies for which filing accounts and reporting is an onerous obligation and one that really does not serve any great community or public purpose, but puts the people who are running those companies into expense and difficulty. What we are seeking to do here is to meet two ultimately competing imperatives, and in the middle there are companies in a borderline situation where it would be difficult to have an obvious answer as to whether or not they should report. The trick is to develop a test that is certain. The reason that we ultimately supported the simplification task force's test, rather than the so-called reporting entity test as proposed by the chartered accountants, was the greater certainty of the simplification task force's proposed test. A test should also have companies falling on the right side of the line, depending on whether it is in the public interest that they report or not report. The ironic thing about the view expressed by the honourable member for Mackellar is that-given that she has, in the past, put herself forward as a strong defender of the rights of small business-if it were actually enacted, it would lead to at least some small businesses who, under the task force's regime, would not have to report actually being make included and having to report. They would then be faced with the problem of additional expense, paperwork and a bigger bureaucracy. The intention of this legislation is to relieve that burden. Although I do not question the motives of the honourable member for number Mackellar, I think an unfortunate consequence of her position---or one that may well be-is that people in small business are actually exposed to a greater obligation of unnecessary, at least in some instances, reporting and providing accounts. The final comment I make is with respect to a matter that the honourable member for Mackellar gave me glowing praise for, which, no doubt, I will find difficult to live downlegislation that is, the issue of the small business and its inclusion within the legislation. It fair to say that this is something or innovative step in that a document which purports to be advice about the content of legislation and about what it means-a user's guide-is actually being incorporated as part of the act of parliament. At first blush that offended my notion of what an act of parliament is about. In my view, it is there to create obligations, rights and laws that apply to all of the community; it is not to advise the community about what the law actually is. There are some inherent dangers in that with respect to both judicial interpretation of the law and the rights and obligations of professionals who are advising users of the law. A blurring of the distinction between an act of parliament and advice about an act of parliament is a worry. However, in the spirit of cooperation, I have been prepared to give this the benefit the doubt. Therefore, I feel that the committee's recommendation that the Attorneymade General review the operation of this section of the legislation, at a subsequent point, worthwhile. I would like to place on record that, if this typ- of approach to the process of system. legislation is to spread to other areas, I may not be quite so generous.",77
89,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"by law. leave-First, I would like to re-emphasise a point that has been made by a number of speakers. Simplification of laws should not law unintelligible or difficult to identify. It worries me that we have identified in this advisory report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill the share buyback provisions, for example, more on the of words than on the degree to which they are understandable. Not only is simplification something that is needed but also it is a matter of consolidating the law. I have long been concerned that, as in this instance, we are adding another bill to the heap instead of consolidating the law and making the law understandable by reference to one bill alone. I would hope that, at the end of this review process, one piece of is introduced which incorporates all guide the amendments, thereby making it a lot is easier for those who need to turn to the law of an unusual to know what the law is. I would also like to compliment the members of the Corporations Law Simplification Consultative Group, particularly Mr Leigh Hall, and the members of the simplification task force. It is essential that, if law is to be changed, those who are practitioners in the field are consulted so that it is not just a matter of modification within the Public Service in Canberra. In that sense the reference to the committee was valuable, although it is very difficult with the sort of inquiry that we made to take account of the views of those who operate proprietary companies, as they are now formed in the exempt category, and to be sure that the new requirements meet the bill. In some respects I am still unhappy with the of version we have reached on the definitions of 'small' and 'large'. Earlier speakers have some reference to the three criteria. I am one of those who believe that the number is of employees really should be excluded because I cannot see how it adds to the New Zealand has moved far further than Australia in modification of their corporations It seems to have learned from the American practice rather than relying peculiarly on our British heritage. I am interested to see that the present Australian government, which seeks to set aside its British connection in so many respects, prefers it in this area. For my part, I would have preferred to follow the New Zealand practice and thereby have only two obligatory criteria. The criteria are the gross operatingrevenlle and the assets of the company, and the number of employees should be excluded. In the report itself we have left the conclusion on that point a little ambivalent. For my part, I am not at all ambivalent; I think it would be far better if we excluded that criterion relating to the number of employees and maintained the requirement that all companies who exceed the gross operating revenue and the assets test figures that are set in the bill to file their accounts. There are several other aspects of the bill which I want to address. The first one that is mentioned in the report is the number of directors. I am concerned that the conclusion has been reached that only one director will be sufficient for a proprietary company under this new category of a small company. I believe that the recommendations of the insolvency committee of the Law Council of Australia, which suggested there was still an advantage in retaining two directors, should have been followed. In part, this is because I have always felt that it is necessary to distina guish a company from an individual and, to the degree to which you make a company identical, I think there is a disadvantage. For all that we refer to sexually transmitted debt in the text of the report, it is my view that having two directors places a greater obligation on an individual running a corporation. I think it would have been preferable to have taken the view of the insolvency committee of the Law Council in that respect. A number of aspects of auditing and accounting standards have been mentioned briefly. However, there is another inquiry now being conducted by the task force and the consultative group into those aspects. I look forward to the bill that will return in due course for us to consider whether or not those aspects should be included. I hope that we will be able to look at that report through the same committee structure. There are a number of aspects of accounting standards and audit requirements which I think could well be included in the legislation, and I hope they shall be in the future, once again, to make the legislation a little more understandable by both members of the accounting profession and their clients. The other two matters in the report to which I referred were, first, there is a capacity within the ASC to require that accounts should be tabled even though the company might be excluded by the criteria prescribed. The committee has concluded that it would be advisable for the ASC to table reasons, through the minister, by reporting on threemonthly intervals the reasons for those requirements. I was very pleased to see that the ASC intends to publish the reporting requirements and, generally, the ways in which it intends to administer the changes to the legislation. But it would be helpful if there were to be tabled by the minister on three-monthly intervals the practice intended to be followed by the ASC-and there is reference to that in paragraphs 283 and 284 of this report. The other matter that I wanted briefly to refer to, as I understand the matter is not to be debated in the Senate, is the fact that my colleague Senator Julian MCGauran has filed dissenting report. There was considerable debate in the committee about the reporting entity test which was favoured by the Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and by others who gave evidence to the committee. Mr Leigh Hall, the chairman of the consultative group, suggested that he at one stage had also been in favour of that reporting entity test to distinguish between small and large companies. My own view is that it becomes too confusing, and it was on that basis that I accepted the alternative. While I wanted to mention that dissenting report, the majority of the committee certainly felt that the reporting entity test was too confusing and, therefore, should not have been followed. At the same time, I repeat my assertion that the legislation would have been far better if only two of the three requirements now included in the present bill before the House were required; They are that the asset and turnover tests should be appropriate, as in New Zealand, instead of providing the opportunity for the number of employees also to be taken into account. It is important that we simplify legislation. At the same time, when there are changes as fundamental as these and when concerns have been expressed, as they have been, I would hope that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) does not feel that the legislation is necessarily written in stone. It is legislation that needs be reconsidered from time to time. I hope that when the subsequent reports from the consultative group are before this chamber, we might have an opportunity to perhaps review some of the matters and their practice in the report that is now being adopted into the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill and that, ultimately, we might have a consolidated piece of legislation which would be of far more use to the practising public.",78
90,Mr MOORE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I commend the people who have taken part· in the report from the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. When the NCSC bill was introduced, it ran for three days with two speakers; when the ASC bill was introduced by Lionel Bowen, it went for four days with two speakers; and the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill has gone for half an hour with four speakers. The knowledge and interest in company law is quite astonishing-it must be one of the few growth industries left. Along the lines of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), I purely want to add my caution to some of the developments that have come out of the report. Simplification is a very desirable path. Those who work in company law or in tax. ation law will know that in the last few years it has become an absolute nightmare to try to get to some concrete decisions and finally know where you stand. It is even more so in tax and company law. These movements are in the right direction and are full of good intent but, like all matters of good intent, they are paved with a lot of uncertainty. One of the problems with small business is management. The failure of small business in the main, while it is always blamed on something else, in very large measure is a question of management. The best tool of management is proper accounts, and proper accounts will be kept only if there is a compulsory requirement to report on them. The proposal here brings forward the concept of one director. That is a very fine concept. But a lot of people in business would ask, 'Why do you need this?' In terms of accountability and responsibility, in recent to times there has been a lot of talk about wayward creditors. We have heard about the big ones in the newspapers, but there are thousands of small ones who walk away from bankruptcy petitions under circumstances of loose accounts, no accounts at all or with pure cash situations. Therefore I would like the committee to take into consideration the creditors' and debtors' positions-it is not only the income tax commissioner's particular problem-as they relate to ordinary commerce and the desirability of going to one director rather than having two. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) referred to some matters earlier. I think she would have drawn attention to the case of a proprietary company involved in a family law action where, if it is run by one company director and a residual partner, there would be no access to those accounts so they would not necessarily know what was going on. Therefore in a normal family business it would be prudent, I would have thought, to look to those matters. Finally, on the question of audit, when the committee refers this to the expert committee involved I hope that genuine consideration will be given to finding a way to ensure that proper accounts are kept, even on the say-so of the auditor who could state that he has lodged a taxation return based on the corporate accounts. This may be beneficial towards keeping some form of management tool alive and well in small business. NA NA 1995 Second Reading Debated resumed.",80
91,Ms HENZELL,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"Capricornia) (2.52 p.m.)I have not had an opportunity to read the Hansard of yesterday's debate on the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 1995, but I suspect we will find an interesting coalescence of points of view from all sides of the House and some strange bedfellows in the debate. But that is all to the good, and I am sure that the majority of people in the House will definitely support the government's record. This amendment bill is aimed to clarify the scope of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992, and is part of a positive program by the government. We have a very proud record on legislation in this area; in fact, the World Health Organisation sees us as a world leader on this matter. An article by Adrian Bradley in the Australian on 31 May 1994 stated: The nation's anti-tobacco legislation remains forefront of international moves to ban cigarette advertising, providing the World Health Organisation with a blueprint for moves to persuade Western Pacific countries to introduce similar measures. Why is this important? It is important because the World Health Organisation estimates that three million people die each year from smoking related illnesses and it expects this to increase to 10 million a year by the year 2020. In Australia about 3.5 million Australians smoke, representing 28 per cent of people over the age of 18 years. This is falling, with 32 per cent of men and 24.7 per cent of women smoking. Part of that change has been the move away from the availability of advertising. I suspect that, like me, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott will remember the Peter Stuyvesant advertisements - London, Paris, New York-at the Saturday afternoon flicks, which is where we used to go in the world before television. Mr Deputy Speaker may not remember that; he may be too young. But, in those days, overseas travel and all the sophistication that involved was a great model for those of us who aspired to that. Part and parcel of that was cigarette smoking. We have seen a major change due to government policy and a rearguard action from some of the national cigarette companies, culminating in a High Court challenge to some of our legislation. I wish to draw to the attention of the House the need for members in this place to observe the very proper and appropriate rulings of the Speaker and the President in relation to smoking in the precincts of the parliament. There are rules that all employees of .the parliament must adhere to, and it concerns me greatly that certain members in this place feel that it is quite appropriate for them to inflict passive smoking on the rest of us. I urge .all of my colleagues to walk outside if they must smoke. We will try to get away from that cigarette smoke in the garden areas. It is very important that all adults act as effective role models. As we curtail opportunities to promote cigarette messages, one of the important issues we have to address is young people taking up smoking. In her article by the Drug Education Journal of Australia entitled 'Peter Jackson, you're lying: at the education or advertising-which message is more convincing?' Margaret Powell outlines the importance of the communicated message. She states: In our consumer-oriented society, there is another force operating in children's lives. Independence and adulthood are seen to be manifested through appealing images which are used skilfully by advertising agencies to selI products, to sell cigarettes. Despite the wide public acceptance of detrimental effects of smoking among children and their peers, smoking cigarettes is seen to respect independence, maturity, vitality, popularity and success. We find that young people, particularly those in puberty and perhaps even from grade 7, see smoking as an important rite of passage. This is something we have to address not only by removing those public images but also by sending very positive anti-smoking messages and providing children with assertiveness training. It is absolutely essential that cigarette manufacturers not be allowed to sponsor sport or cultural activities. I believe that, as we have continued to curtail this activity, other companies have taken up the slack and are now sponsoring major sporting events. I believe that, when cigarette manufacturers are banned from sponsoring sporting events; the current consumer acquiescenceto sponsorship of sport will also change. The other issue we have to address is the way cigarette companies are using value adding programs to entice young people to smoke. It is certainly something we will have to address because, often, the people targeted are those who are most likely to be affected by smoking. For instance, in the Australian of 3 February 1995, a reference is made to a Senate submission in relation to a Northern Territory individual. The article mentions a promotion being offered to stores in Top End Aboriginal communities. The promotion involves a free T-shirt with the community name on the back and a 'big country'and 'Malboro' advertising slogan on the front. All these initiatives are encouraging young people to smoke and are trying to get around our advertising bans. I look forward to continuing my comments after question time.",81
92,Mr SPEAKER,PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! It being 3.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Capricornia will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Debate interrupted. NA Current Account Deficit",82
93,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Last August when the current account deficit grew to $l.8 billion for the month, you dismissed it by saying 'It is after all only one month's figures' and that what we were 'seeing this time is a limitation in the rise'-I repeat, a limitation in the rise-in the current account deficit. Given that since then the current account deficit has risen to the highest monthly and three-monthly levels ever recorded, and given that six of the last seven monthly results have been above $2 billion, do you seriously still suggest that we are seeing a limitation in the rise, to use own words? Will you continue to dismiss each new record as just one month's figures?",82
94,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought the Treasurer made the government's position about this very clear when he announced the mid-year review and said what we thought the influences on the current account would be. I think that quoting some number after the Treasurer has actually given a considered view by the Treasury forecasters and has made it public in the mid-year review answers the point. The underlying point is that the current account deficit is up in part because of the very strong rise in the capital goods components. Mr Costello-So it is a good thing, is it?",82
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,82
96,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Just listen for a second. You might learn something. Mr Costello-Are you pleased about it?,82

98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister might wait for a moment. Question time will not degenerate into an opportunity for people to constantly interject. The Prime Minister has been asked a question by the Leader of the Opposition, who I think is trying to listen to the answer.",82
99,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Capital goods are up 23 per cent in the first seven months of the year. A primary requirement for this economy is to be able to produce goods and services. We do not have huge capital goods, producer goods, industries. All of these, whether they be mainframe computers or digitally operated machine tools, come from the large industrial economies where the economies of scale can see the development of these industries. Mr Moore-It shows you are spending money you do not have.",82
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Ryan!,82
101,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But we need them to add to our capital stock to be able to produce more goods and services. Also in that month exports were up four per cent and imports were down three. While growth in exports has your slowed in recent months, manufacturing exports have performed particularly well. An interesting number here is that, for the year to the September quarter, exports of elaborately transformed goods were up 19 per cent. How different it is that manufactured and elaborately transformed exports have been growing so strongly-and again in this month by over 19 per cent-compared with the old decaying industrial archaeology that this government inherited. But an even more important point is our ability to fund the deficit. tion is a mortgage and one's capacity to pay and meet the mortgage obligations. What are they here? We have a strong capital goods base, which is growing. We are making inroads into new markets with manufacturing and production. Our debt servicing ratio-that is, the proportion of our exports which is going to servicing our debt-has fallen from just on 21 per cent in the late 1980s to 11 per cent today at last count. That is, the proportion of the country's exports which are actually committed to servicing our debt has fallen by over half since the late 1980s-that is, from 21 per cent to 11 per cent. The other underlying strong point is that we are now 40 per cent more competitive than a decade ago. If you add up that continuing competitiveness-that is, the low inflation and the high productivity, the very large real depreciation of the exchange rate over the last six or eight years, the growth in manufacturing and manufactured exports, the growth in exports as a proportion of GDP from 14 to 21 per cent and the decline in the debt service component from 21 to 11 per cent-you can see that they are unambiguously bald points about Australia's capacity to service its debt. Another point worth making can be found in the latest bulletin of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Measuring Australia. It looks at our net debt, which it shows as being about $160 billion, but it also shows something which we never hear from the opposition: that is, Australian investment abroad is $120 billion. Of that $120 billion",82

If we take from that $120 billion of Australian assets abroad, the Reserve Bank's official assets abroad, about $80 billion of private investment abroad has occurred since this government removed exchange controls in 1983-84. There was no investment abroad before 198384. It has risen from virtually nothing to $80 billion by the current year. Dr Kemp-It is less.",83
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Goldstein!,83
112,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me give them the simple numbers. If that $80 billion had not been invested offshore, it would have had a huge impact on the net debt-maybe not from $160 to $80 billion but certainly of that order. Why do Australian firms invest abroad? Why is Boral the largest brick and tile manufacturer in the United States? Mr Costello-Because they cannot make a dollar here.",83
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I again remind those on my left who are interjecting of standing order 55.,83
114,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The statistician says, 'Australia's investment in foreign countries for a variety ofMrs Bishop-It is you who has got rich.",83
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Mackellar about her constant interjecting as well.,83
116,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The statistician has this to say: Australians invest in foreign countries for a variety of reasons, including the securing and maintenance of market share, sales promotion, effective marketing, avoidance of tariffs and import restrictions, securing a raw material to take advantage of cheaper inputs or higher rates of return on investments in order to spread their risk. In other words, this government removed exchange controls, unlike the former Treasurer with people in the Reserve Bank ticking little bits of paper about whether an Australian company could invest abroad. When Boral decided to become the largest brick and tile manufacturer in the United States, when the likes of CSR, Pacific Dunlop-or name them-the breweries, or the transport companies like TNT and Mayne Nickless decided similarly, they did so because they believe in the long run it is in the interests of their business to get behind these tariff barriers and get into these markets when they come to their market share in Australia. What the coalition would have us say to Australian business leaders is, 'Don't you invest abroad so you can reduce the foreign debt.' In other words, 'How dare you put $80 billion worth of assets offshore and give us $160 billion of net debt? Why didn't you keep all your investments at home and give us only $80 billion of net debt?' Let us have a bit of honesty from honest John over thereOpposition members-Ha, hal",83
117,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-about Australian investment abroad.,84
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order!,84
119,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Just so that the Leader of the Opposition cannot peddle his nonsense and say, 'I never realised that point,' when he goes around doing his stint on the radio, I will leave him this copy which very graphically shows Australian investment abroad rising steadily, as the statistician says, to billion, and Australian private equity abroad to $80 billion against net debt of $160 billion. I believe that if it came to the key question of whether the government would say to Australian business, 'You shall not invest abroad because we don't want any covering of that investment on the current account,' the answer to that is that the government has made the right decision and removed exchange controls and let that happen. Compare that, Mr Speaker, with the cloistered, closeted, frightened little economy that John Howard left them; all locked up with their market share up to optimums. They could note sell any more beer in Australia They could not go offshore and sell beer in Europe or Japan because he would not let them. Now they have gone off and done it and he says, 'Isn't it pretty. You have got all this net debt.' Mr Reith- Mr SPEAKER ",84

121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Flinders on a' point of order. Mr Reith-Yes, I rise to a point of order. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to rulings by previous Speakers which have required ministers to be relatively concise in their answers. The Prime Minister has been speaking for 11 minutes. He has well and truly moved off the substance of the question. You ought to exercise the authority in your office to require ministers to at least contain their answers to a reasonable length.",84
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Flinders knows that the chair does not have the capacity to limit answers.

126,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I have answered that. When the Leader of the Opposition goes to the Business Council of Australia next time he should tell them that he thinks they should not invest abroad because they are adding to our national debt---our stock of national debt-and he thinks it is a bad thing. If he does not take that view, let him at least include Australian assets abroad when he looks at net debt abroad. Mr Tim Fischer-I invite the Prime Minister to table the notes he is quoting from and I would seek leave to table this foreign debt chart showing the true position on the matter.",84

129,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of The claims made yesterday after the release of the January housing approval figures that the be housing industry has been closed down? Is reduces this an accurate reflection of the current state activity. of the housing industry?,85
130,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the honouractually able member for Paterson, I can say that aware of some statements made yesterday the Shadow Treasurer. When speaking on ABC radio about the housing sector he said, economy. 'And basically it has been closed down in terms of activity.' What he was talking about was the release of the January approvals figures which showed a decline of some per cent seasonally adjusted in that month. What we see with those figures is that there is quite a bit of fluctuation month by month, even though they are seasonally adjusted, and that particularly comes about because of fact that we have included in them not just houses but also medium density dwelling units in Sydney and Melbourne in particular, but also in most capital cities.",85
131,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"h, people don't live in them, eh?",85
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourIt able member for O'Connor about interj ecting.,85
133,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Approvals for those housing units have been strongly increasing. Of increases course, they happen in a lumpy way. When they come in, they push the units up for that month. When they are not there, there is a big drop. If we look at South Australia, in the month of January there was a 35 per cent increase in private dwelling approvals because of the approval of one large medium-density project in the city of Adelaide. So I think that shows you about the monthly variability, Mr Speaker. But it is also important to note that if we look at the figures for private sector housing-not medium-density units but ordinary housing-approvals for ordinary housing fell by half a per cent. Of course, that is a much different picture. In fact, looking at that picture, Mr Silberberg, of the Housing Industry Association-who is not known normally for his support of the government in any way-said: small fall in the more interest rate sensitive private house approvals suggests home buyers may coming to grips with higher interest rates, and earlier concerns of a free fall in housing So the industry is saying, 'Well, these figures give us some comfort,' whilst the I am shadow Treasurer, in normal ultra beat-up by mode, is saying that the industry is being closed down by what is happening in the Mr Speaker, that is obviously an absurd overstatement, to put it at the least. In fact, one has to have some regard, in looking at the 9.7 downturn in housing which has certainly occurred in recent times, to the levels at which it has been. Of course, it has been at record levels. The housing industry has been doing better, until recent times, than it has the ever done in the history of the country. In this upturn we have built 480,000 additional dwelling units. That is more than in any other upturn in Australia's history. So, since the economy got on the upswing again, from 1991 to 1994, 480,000 dwelling units have been built, more than any previous recovery. is housing that essentially led the economy constantly back onto a growth path. You cannot, of course, expect the industry to keep on belting away with substantial in activity year by year, particularly when it has generally been seen as running ahead of the underlying level of demand given by the rate of formation of family units in this country. Therefore, at some stage, it had to slow, and that is what we have been witnessing in .recent times, albeit assisted by some increases in interest rates. Nevertheless, let us get it clearly understood that 1994 was an enormously good year for housing. Total approvals were 189,000 units, the highest level on record-absolutely the highest level on record. The Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry is saying that for this financial year, 1994-95, it will be 160,000. So there is some downturnwe are seeing that in the figures for approvals and commencements-butthat is a downturn from exceedingly high levels of activity. In fact, the level of approvals in January, 13,200, is still above the average for the last 10 years. So we are still at above average levels of activity, going back for a decade, in approvals, and with commencements we see a similar sort of picture. Mr Speaker, it is just the most ridiculous statement-typical of the opposition's attitude of massive doomsaying about the Australian economy to the point where there is just no credibility in anything that it says-for the shadow Treasurer to say that the industry had been basically closed down. All that is happening is that it is tailoring off from the highest levels of activity that have occurred in the history of this country to levels which are still well above average compared with those of the last decade or so.",85
134,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. Since the Treasurer is so concerned about up-beat statements, I remind you, Prime Minister, in 1993 you said that exports were about to go 'gangbusters'. In August last year you said, 'We have been exporting our heads off for years.' How can this be so in the light of yesterday's balance of payments figures showing trend exports have been flat for one and a half years? Mr Howe interjecting",86

137,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How can this be so when, if you rank OECD countries by the export of services to GOP, we are 21 out of 22, and our export to GOP ratio lags at less than 18 per cent compared with an average 30 per cent for the OECD and 30 per cent for New Zealand?",86
138,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He has been having too many cream cakes at Claridges, Mr Speaker. at He is just not quite across the stuff. The reason why I have been saying that we have been exporting our heads off for years is that we have. Please excuse me for repeating that fact and that truth! I mean, pardon me! Exports have gone from 13 per cent of GOP to 22 per cent of GOP in the last decade. Just get those numbers again: exports have gone from 13 per cent of GOP to 22 per cent of GOP.",86

141,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Poor silly fellow! The member for Mayo is more to be pitied than Exports despised. When the former Treasurer was in office we had exports to GOP so low in the OECD league table, the developed league table, you would think he would hang his head in shame. As I have said before, he presided over the industrial archaeology he called the industrial landscape of Australiathe graveyard. Is it any wonder that we were right at the bottom of the pile in the OECD? As a consequence of the massive improvement in competitiveness introduced by this government in opening Australia up, in lifting our competitiveness and in lifting productivity, not only have exports gone from 13 per cent to 22 per cent of GDP, well up in the OECD league table, but as well the fastest growing component of those exports was elaborately transformed manufactures. Mr Downer-What were the cost figures?",86
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Mayo.,87
143,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How the deputy leader, talking about one month's number, can talk about exportsMr Costello--Eighteen months!",87
144,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Or even 18 months. When you look over the period of the last 10 years, a constant period of growth in exports, you would not have known what to do with the place. You quit absolutely bereft of any ideas. You scurried out of office in 1982-83 leaving behind this rotting hulk you called industrial Australia. One of the compliments I was paid in the last year or so was by Bert Evans from the metal trades who said, 'I'm a member of the 180-degree club. That is the people who change their mind completely about industrial protection and tariffs.' He changed his mind because of the turnaround in Australian industry and its success. It will take more than a reference to a month or 18 months on the part of the deputy leader to try to dull the point, to diminish achievement, of Australian business, Australian industry and Australian workers to actually lift our exports to be right up in the league table of the OECD at 22 per cent of GDP and rising.

146,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government believes that in a civilised and successful country must be genuine minimum safety net conditions for Australian workers. We have introduced those provisions and we will maintain them. These will continue to include the guaranteed provision of minimum wage rates, maternity leave, paid public holidays, annual leave, sick leave, overtime and annual leave loadings. I think that gives us cause for some genuine comparison with the opposition.",87

148,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for O'Connor has been warned. I am not sure whether you are on an early plane, but you will be.",87
149,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow industrial relations spokesman was out there a week or so ago with a smokescreen saying that theirs will be now an evolutionary policy. 'Incrementalism' was a word he used. In other words, 'Don't be alarmed. We're not going to bang you over the head like we promised with Jobsback; we're just going to have a nice soft, cuddly incremental policy.' But when Dr Hewson tendered his resignation to the House the other day, the Leader of the Opposition said in response that there had been changes of substance in Australia, and he pointed to tariffs, protection and financial deregulation, but he said, 'The other great reform left undone is the labour market.'",87
150,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hear, hear! There is nothing wrong with his statement.",87
151,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In other words, two days ago the great reform left undone is the labour the market; the week earlier it is going to be creeping incrementalism and it is going to be evolutionary changes. It used to be the wolf in wolfs clothing; now it is the wolf in. sheep's clothing-same policy, different camouflage. Let me make these points about the comparison between the government and the opposition. The Howard-Reith policy removes as a minimum, at least, overtime and annual leave loadings. We know this because the member for Flinders told us on Meet the Press recently, 'Jobsback is the thrust of coalition policy' . He also said this in a speech there to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry last week. He said, 'Our jobsback policy remains intact.' Let us get this on the record. 'Our jobsback policy,' he said 'remains intact.' So nothing has changed except the camouflage. So the opposition refused to acknowledge that the area of great exposure to Australian workers is the turnover in the labour market. In the year ending February 1994, for example, 1.6 million people changed jobs or employers-that is in a labour market of eight million. That is 20 per cent of the labour force in one year-130,000 new positions a month or 4,000 a day. In other words, that constant change in the labour market would mean that those people who line up to protect their minimums or to maintain, for instance, their annual leave loading or their overtime, would find that they were unable to secure it. Let me give you an example. A new typical part-time nurse working 20 hours each weekend would have her pay lowered by $114.80 per weekend. A new transport worker or driver on 12 hours overtime each week would have his pay lowered by $113.35 a week. When asked about this, Mr Howard said on radio 3LO, 'I don't disguise the fact that under our policy the question of whether you get any improvement becomes a matter of negotiation.' In other words, 'I am, as always, being virtuous; I am not going to hide the fact that you are going to take a big pay cut here, but I am not going to say it explicitly.' He just says, 'I am not going to hide the fact whether you get an improvement becomes a matter of negotiation.' At the National Press Club in February 1993Mr Downer-Heavens.

159,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In February 1993 at the press club the leader said: The loss of loadings and penalties might be a factor workers would have to take into consideration before changing jobs. In other words, there is a sudden. death. If you lose your job and you take a new one, you lose the option of being able to secure these under-minimums, you are back to individual wage contract, master and servant provisions of the common law, and then you are left in the position that formally the overtime or the annual leave loading you are paid goes. We often hear the Leader of the Opposition talking about families. Doesn'the think that these 1.7 million people who change their jobs at the risk of losing these sorts of sums-$100 to $120 per week-in overtime and annual leave loadings are members of that Australian families? Doesn'the think those reductions in their incomes are real? Doesn'the believe that, as he said, the labour market . reform is exactly as he described it under Jobsback, as agreed by the member for Flinders, and that the notion of incrementalism or gradualism or evolution is really just a camouflage for the old policy the opposition has always had of making sure it whacks the 1.6 or 1.7 million people who jump out of their existing job and cannot protect themselves? That is his policy. Let me say what ours is: it is a set of genuine safety net provisions, a set of genuine minimumsOpposition members-Hooray! At last!",88
160,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You know what our policy is because we have been running it for years. The $8 a week safety net is coming through now and there is protection for things like overtime and annual leave loadings-and these other issues of minimums. Let us note the point that when the Leader of the Opposition said in response to Dr Hewson's departure the other day that the labour market, as he put it, was still the area of great reform, what he and the member for Flinders mean whacking people on low incomes and knockHewson. ing $100 to $120 per week off them. That what it means. At least we can cut through the hocus-pocus, the fuzz, all the glow and all the fluffiness. It is the same old Fightback-Jobsback policy which for Flinders recorded it was on Meet the Press last week. Again, there is a stark difference. group opposite never learn anything. As if the profit share in the economy is not high enough, as if the proportion of national income going to profits is not high enough, without trying to increase it at the expense of always the low and middle income earners of this country.

It is a matter of record. The parliamentary library will have it. Just go and look at the text and see what he says. He said that 'relations between this government and the bank have always been entirely proper, but only an insider tell that this was not always so'. This was during the period you allude to when you say that I, as Treasurer, sat on interest rates during a period of a state government election. I never did, and the Governor corroborated the proper operation of monetary policy between the government and him, but he admonished you for your remarks. Award Wages",90
184,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. the minister confirm that workers on awards will continue to receive safety net wage case increases? Is it the intention of the governaward ment not to update award wages of pay for workers who cannot benefit from enterprise bargaining?,90
185,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the cornerstones for of the Industrial Relations Reform Act is maintenance and the strengthening of the award safety net. The act requires the comin mission to ensure that the award provides a secure, relevant and consistent minimum set of wages and conditions. Of course, it is backed up by accord mark which has provided safety net adjustments for low paid workers in each of the last three years-the last being the current $8 adjustpolicy ment. In contrast with this, the coalition's trial relations policy contains no safety netlobsback none whatsoever--other than four miserly of conditions that are set out in Jobsback. Earlier today in question time, the Prime Minister Fightback. illustrated what would happen to people looking for a job under the Liberal's Jobsback. It is worth asking the question: what will happen to the 45 per cent of workers who remain in their jobs for five years or more? For those people who choose their award, assuming that they are allowed to, of course, under Jobsback, the future is bleak indeed. That is because Jobsback has absolutely no mechanism to update the award. Awards will, under Jobsback, be frozen in time. The member for Bennelong said on Melbourne radio on 12 February 1993 in response to a caller who asked him, if she could stayed on her award, would she be stuck on the same wage indefinitely: Look, I don't disguise the fact that under our policy, if you disagree, you are guaranteed your current award conditions and the question of whether you get any improvement on those becomes a matter of negotiation. He then conceded on that program: The lady's question is correctly based. That is what he said. It is worth looking at Can one of the many examples of what could happen to a worker under Jobsback. Take the of a textile worker in a factory and on an rate of $349.40 per week. That textile worker, under a coalition government, if you assume that inflation was running at 3 per cent-I believe that is pretty generous to the opposition, because the last time the member Bennelong held the fiscal reins inflation the was running at 11.4 per cent-would see his or her award eroded over a three-year period, real terms, by $31.4O-a decrease of 8.3 system per cent for that worker. Pity the family of that textile worker. So 7, much for the opposition's commitment to families. Think about the family of that textile worker. Make no mistake, Jobsback is still the of the coalition. As recently as 18 April 1994, the member for Bennelong said induson radio station 2GB:· is not gone. lobsback remains the policy the coalition. There is absolutely no suggestion that lobsback has gone. lobsback was not part of Of course, that has been borne out by none other than the member for Flinders- Mr GST himself--on the recent Meet the Press program. Mr Speaker, have no doubt: Australian workers will have little difficulty in remembering that Jobsback is pure code for reducing to remain on pay and conditions. Industrial Relations",90
186,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I direct the Prime Minister to the interview with New South Wales Labor leader Bob Carr on the Sunday program and specifically to the question put to Mr Carr that he did not agree with the Keating policy on industrial relations. I remind the Prime Minister of Mr Carr's exact answer: I happen to believe that that provision (the so--led was: unfair dismissal provision) in the federal act IS a disincentive to take on labour. Is Bob Carr right? Is he trying to con the people of New South Wales with this comThe ment or are you, the Prime Minister, trying con the rest of Australia? In fact, is Bob not dead right?",91
187,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In this country we have seen record rates of employment growth which give people opportunities to take up jobs-I mean, some disincentive! We have seen 4.6 per cent productivity growth over the course of the last year, two to three per cent inflation, a 40 per cent increase in competitiveness under these policies in the last decade-what more need I say about the government's industrial relations policies?- tionsand the continuing growth of enterprise bargaining in the system so that we have within sector flexibility, award restructuring call. and the removal of the leap-frogging that used to go on with comparative wage justice, so called, in the 1970s and 1980s. They are the reforms that matter, and that was well managed. As the Minister for Industrial Relations made clear, 55 per cent of all employees dals, covered by federal awards are now signed under enterprise agreements. In New South Wales, that figure is 13 or 14 per cent. In other words, the industrial relations policy the Fahey government has been a failure, has all of its other policies. Mr Carr repeated my point that nothing happens in New South Wales. When asked by Mr Oakes, Mr Fahey said, 'Look at the railway out to Mascot, the one we are going to build out there, and the toll road.' These are all things that he promises on the state government's budget. But how many indusjoint trial projects of substance are going on in New South Wales? The answer is that there is nothing to speak of. New South Wales is a state which is stone dead. It is absolutely dead in the water. The businesses are going to Queensland because nothing happens in New South Wales. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order under 145. The quote from Bob Carr which the Prime Minister was asked about I happen to believe that that provision (the so-called unfair dismissal provision) in the federal act is a disincentive to take on labour. Prime Minister is off at a tangent on to matters which are unrelated to the question. Carr He has not even attempted to answer it.",91

They have either left it voluntarily or they has have had to leave it as the victims of scanin a scandalised fashion. It is a governup ment which has been scandalised and where ministers have had to leave. As I said the other day, the quicker Bob Carr can take this of dead on its feet Fahey government and put it as in the tumbrel, the better for all of us. Canberra By-election",91

192,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I told the House on Monday that the government would refer this push polling, or negative polling, as an issue to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I can now advise the House of the detailed terms of reference that have been transmitted by the Minister for Administrative Services to the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and I table the reference. I agree with an editorial in the Australian newspaper today which said: The Prime Minister ... is right to describe the apparent use of American-style negative polling in the federal seat of Canberra, as sinister. This practiceit goes on to say-is un-Australian, and should be banned. And it finishes: ... this legislation should be amendedthis is the Electoral Actso that push-polling is explicitly defined-and outlawed. In the Age, in an editorial opinion, it says: Until Mr Howard unequivocally and publicly denounces the way the ACT polling was conducted or denies that it was meant to change votes, his party remains open to the charge that its leaders knew and condoned what was done.",92

195,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I can only endorse this because the member for Bennelong has been whispering around the press gallery corridors that he did not really approve of this. But he will not come and say that he did not condone it, did not know about it, or does not approve of it. This comes at the same time as Mr Robb, his federal secretary, is circulating a cash and prizes sweepstake in Western Australia that the Western Australian Office of Racing and Gaming says in this morning's Australian has broken the law. In this morning's Adelaide Advertiser we see that a defunct company, Catch Tim Ltd, was the largest single donor to the Liberal Party's campaign fund of 1993 of$lOO,OOO-and the Liberal Party executive in charge of that campaign was Mr Morris who now directs Mr Howard's office. Here we are: Mr Howard is saying yes, he would run the country in an honest and upright way. How could he convince people that he would. run the country in an honest and upright way when Mr Morris, Mr Textor-the person associated with the push polling-and Mr Robb behave in the unprincipled way they do?

He cannot hear all this going on in his office. So let him come out and say that he denounces this sort of activity and that he does not believe in these sorts of policies.

Meanwhile, in his office sit three people, and in the federal secretariat, who are into this appalling push-polling. This pushpolling was an appalling process. He has not told the House whether he knew about it or whether he condones it. So the difference between me and him is that up front, straight away, I say, 'I don't condone it. I wouldn't have a bar of any of these techniques.' This compares with snide, putrid, underhand polling technique push-polling where somebody is actually criminally defamed, which is the game you tion. have been in, and then you walk around saying, 'I am little honest John.'

Is the minister aware of reported comments by Dr Bob Ratner, who is one of the world's leading aviation experts, on the current operations at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport?

230,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen Dr Ratner's comments in today's Australian and Financial Review. I think it is fair to say that his views are partieularly relevant because he is one of world's leading experts on aviation safety. In 1992 he carried out a review of the Australian air traffic services system. That review included a number of criticisms of the way Civil Aviation Authority was then operatTreasurer. We ing Sydney airport. However, in a report in the Australian today, Dr Ratner endorsed the way the CAA in is operating Sydney airport and warned against the 'reopening of the east-west runway. He did so on the grounds that reopening the runway would cut safety margins by reintroin ducing simultaneous operations on crossing The runways-that is, the SIMOPS system-for a doubtful gain in capacity. He was quite adamant in his support of the current operations. In today's Financial Review, he said: Any way you strike it in terms of throughput or in terms of safety, the parallel runway operation is the way to go. . That is what Dr Ratner had to say. Of course, those views totally go against those of that other self-appointed air space management expert, the Leader of the Opposition, whose announced policy is to reopen the east-west runway. To be fair, Dr Ratner acknowledges that SIMOPS is employed at a number of airports around· the world and that it was employed at Kingsford Smith airport until recently. In today's Australian, he says that SIMOPS operates at those airports which: ... are willing to take on a requirement for a much higher degree of vigilance-and the possibility of incidents and ... accidents-in order to move the traffic. That is his view. He went on to say: When you can avoid itthat is, SIMOPSYou've made another step up the safety ladder. We have been able to do that with the ... third runway, let's not go back. Dr Ratner yesterday referred to an incident 1991, when SIMOPS almost led to a disaster at Sydney airport. That incident involved Thai Airways DelO, carrying 167 passengers; an Ansett A320, carrying 101 passengers; a Qantas B747, which had 353 passengers board. All up, that is 621 people. As the BASI investigation-which was the official investigation of that incident-reports, 621 people were 11 metres from disaster. can see the depiction of the cross-runway configuration on the BASI official report, which was available from 12 August 1991. Yet now opposition members are happy reject the overwhelming expert advice, and they propose the reintroduction of a mode of airport operations in our largest airport-the airport that services our largest city-which is less safe than the present mode of ations. They do it all for no gain in capacity. The obvious question to put to honest John is this: why are they advocating this? What is behind it? It certainly cannot be for noise.",94
231,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,His seat. His seat.,95
232,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to that. It institutions. certainly cannot be for noise because the ing people. official figures show that, in total, 58,000 people fewer are seriously or moderately affected by aircraft noise as a result of parallel runway configuration. It certainly cannot be for safety reasons. As Dr Ratner points out, it certainly cannot be for capacity reasons. I think it is fair to record that opposipeople tion members have shamelessly tried to claim that the current operations-operations that were decided in 1989 and confirmed 1991-have been introduced to benefit my electorate. That has been their claim. Yet in 1995 we have the Leader of the Opposition proposing a policy that goes against all the expert advice but which will benefit his electorate. If he were so honest, should come out and admit his cynicism or come clean with whatever expert advice he has to support his policy. The world's aviathings tion community will be very interested to it. Unemployment",95
233,Mr CLEARY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. On 4 June 1992, in in answer to a question from me concerning dead-end jobs, you said you were no longer a content to consign our children to low paid, uninteresting jobs. In this context can you and explain what is interesting, highly paid, on challenging and value added about trucking the unemployed out to Melbourne airport to meet and greet overseas visitors, as is prothose posed by the Minister for Employment, You Education and Training? Does the Prime Minister believe that hotel touts, map sellers and bus stop bag carriers who eke out a living in airports in Third World countries are anything other than a sign that their govern to ments have failed to solve unemployment? Finally, on what date does your department predict that the unemployed in the north-west and west of Melbourne will be fully trained and, therefore, that lack of skill will no longer operbe an explanation for unemployment?",95
234,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are two steps here. The first is getting aggregate rates of employment up in this country that would take the new entrants to the labour market, including those who are graduating from school and The second is training and placThe honourable member would know that the government has now committed $1.1 the billion to the Australian National Training Authority to vocationally train young Australians. He will know that in the white paper we have made it a policy to case manage young under 18 years of age who drop out of the education system to either get them back into mainstream education or give them a job in subsidy and get them a job. The commitment to young Australians by this government is very clear for everybody to see. I am happy to say that the proof of the pudding is in the eating, with employment amongst young people picking up its share of he the growth in jobs, which has been just on 500,000 since the election. This government, as no other government before it, has done to lift participation rates in schools. read When the last coalition government left office, only three kids in 10 completed secondary school. It is now up to eight in 10-a revolution in participation. There has also been a mighty change in the participation of young women in schools and their passage through secondary school and into tertiary institutions. In fact, there were more entrants into tertiary institutions this year amongst young women than amongst young men. As a consequence of that tertiary growth, where we have added the equivalent of about 16 universities of the size of Sydney and Melbourne universities to the system since 1985-86, and now the commitment of $1.1 billion to the National Training Authority, it is manifestly obvious where the government's heart lies-with young Australians. I do not think there is any problem about working in the tourismMr Cleary-So you are sending them out to the airport. Do you like that idea?",95
235,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Tourism is an important and significant growing industry. It is an industry which is highly labour intensive and these are jobs, I am sure, young Australians appreciate getting. If he is trying to make some sort of point about data processing, where before there were lots of unskilled jobs, clerical jobs and labouring jobs, many of those jobs with machine tools and data processing have disappeared. That is our point. We are trying to train young Australians new jobs, and I would say that we are training them successfully. We are not just training them; we are committed to them. We will not let them drop out under the age of 18 without case managing them back into school or into training and work. Tell me of any other Commonwealth government that ever made that commitment. I am sure you cannot, and I am happy to say you share our view about this. That is why the tenor and tone of the question should have been more supportive than they were. ACT Elections",96

240,Mr LANG MORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Prime Minister a further question to that of the Leader of the Opposition on polling practice in the ACT.

248,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Sit him down.,96
249,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have already said to the Prime Minister that a charge of that nature is very serious and that he must be able to substantiate that chargeMr Tim Fischer-By motion.,96
250,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,by motion under the provisions of the parliament. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Keating) agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Prime Minister moving forthwith that the Leader of the Opposition has grievously and wilfully mislead House and should be censured. Motion of Censure,96
251,Mr KEATING,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"I move: Thatthe Leader of the Opposition has grievously and wilfully mislead this House and should be censured. I was asked a question by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who has been electoral embarrassed by the fact that he has not to make clear his position and, as such, has condoned the grievous and putrid tactics push polling of the Liberal Party. He sought to introduce into the House a question about which he knew the imputations to be false. the time, I was unaware of the matters and made that very clear. As I made that clear, honest John guffawed and laughed. He gave his instructions to front-bench and they all laughed and went on when I said, 'I did not know about it.' I did not know about it. I said, if it was as he described it in New South Wales, I condone it. I have since been given the That material, and what the Leader of the Opposithen tion said was a complete misrepresentation. The material states: Voting 1 Independent? . . . don't get Libalong eral/Alliance chaos in Government by mistake. Give your preferences to the Australian Labor Party. It numbers the ticket and says: Make your preferences count . . . It has the Australian Labor Party logo and then says: Put the Liberals last! It is authorised by Doug Thompson, Australsubterfuge Ian Labor Party, Belconnen. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: given the fact that electoral officials challenged the how-to-vote card, I put it to the House that the Prime Minister",97
252,Mr SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Resume your seat. I warn the Leader of the National Party about taking points of order in that way. Orders,97
253,Mr KEATING,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"This is a censure, Mr Speaker. Name him! Name him!",97
254,Mr SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,I call the Prime Minister.,97
255,Mr KEATING,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Honest John deceitfully this and wilfully got up and misled this Housejust as he deceitfully and wilfully walked through public comment in the seventies and eighties about the criminal disrepair of the tax system. He was all hearing but no knowing. Today he is trying to deflect attention from himself in respect of matters such as the federal secretary of his party being up to his neck in push polling-one of the grubbiest, most sinister techniques ever employed in the history of this country. In his office sought is Mr Morris, who we find today in the advisers box, who has been talking about the of executive who was in charge of the South Australian Liberals big donor scheme, which is called 'Catch Tim Ltd', which we found At donated $100,000 to the Liberal Party. Then I we find Mr Textor, who has been up to his dirty tricks, working on his staff-the three of them are on his staff. The Age states: the Until Mr Howard unequivocally and publicly denounces the way ACT polling was conducted or denies it was meant to change votes, his party remains open to the charge that its leaders knew would not and condoned what was done. is what I read to him. To deflect that, he makes the charge, with imputations in the question that he knows to be false and to be misleadiqg to the House, and then guffaws with his front bench. When I said I was not aware of it, I was not aware of it because it did not happen; it did not exist. The technique that he ascribes to the Labor Party did not exist. The how-to-vote card, which is around here, says 'Vote I Independent' and it then a question mark and 'Don't get the Liberal alliance chaos in government by mistake. Give your preferencesto the Australian Labor Party'. It does not look like a to me. It does not look like an independent's how-to-vote to me. It does not look as if the people holding that out are representing themselves as independents when it has the ALP logo on it and it is authorised by the Australian Labor Party. As my colleague made clear, this was not what the Liberal Party did in 1988 in New South Wales. Mrs Bishop-In 1988 in New South Wales, this was not",97
256,Mr SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,The honourable member for Mackellar has already been warned.,98
257,Mr KEATING,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"That was a completely different thing. It was to that technique that the Leader of the Opposition is alluding. Mr Speaker, glib, dishonest behaviour of this kind, which the Leader of the Opposition has specialised in for years, will not advance his interests or his party's interests, particularly when he so grievously misleads-and goes out of his way to contemptuously misleadthe parliament. I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition, getting a second chance-the second go round-would at least clean his act up and make sure that whenever something like this comes out he would nail his colours to the mast and say, 'I do not believe in polling. I think it is un-Australian. I am my party did it. I apologise for them. We will have no more of it.' Everyone would have said, 'Well, at least that is the decent thing that we expect and we thank him for saying that.' But no! He went in and told his party room-I will find the quote-that it derogated in some minor way from theirMrs Crosio-A hiccup.",98
258,Mr KEATING,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"It was only a hiccup. It was so much of a hiccup that two national newspapers have editorialised about it. Today, when not unreasonably I referred to the matter after reference from my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services, he then decides to deflect parliamentary attention from it by essentially trafficking in a lie. The Leader of the Opposition can grin. You can grin with that sort of shameful, embarrassed little grin, but we all know what lies behind it. It is just like he has been around like a spin doctor, running round the gallery saying, 'Oh, we have turned over a new leaf on Aboriginal policies.' Yes, we know how much of a new leaf he has turned over. He left all of the corrupting amendments to the bill in the House. He brought it over here and, if the government was weak enough to say, 'Oh well, look, any bill, any land fund bill, is better than no bill at all-' Mr Lieberman-I rise to a point of order. Standing order 81 says that no member may digress from the subject matter. The Prime Minister is clearly talking about allegations other than the specific allegation that he raised in his motion. He should be brought back to the particular matter.",98
259,Mr BEAZLEY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,It is a censure.,98
260,Mr SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"On a matter such as this the Prime Minister-and I am sure the Leader of the Opposition, anticipating what he is going to say-is quite in order.",98
261,Mr KEATING,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"If the government had said, 'Oh well, any land fund bill, even one which derogates from the purpose of a bill like this, is better than no bill; we will pass it' - if we weakly and meekly had agreed to that, the Aboriginal community in this country push- would be denied a land fund bill which is sorry cogent and workable. Instead of that, the government said, 'No, we will not cop a substandard piece of legislation from the Senate.' If John Howard wanted to show that he had turned over a new leaf for Aboriginal people he would have knocked those amendments out and said, 'Look, I am the leader; Downer is not the leader. I am not having these sleights of hand. They are out.' Instead of that, up comes the Downer bill, back into the House of Representatives, where the government says, 'No, we won't have it. We'll have a principal bill which does not derogate from the capacity of the fund to actually help Aboriginal people.' Then the Leader of the Opposition runs around the press gallery saying, 'I'm not following the Downer-Hewson tactic. I'm actually in the game. I'm passing the bill.' But he is only passing the bill after the government has said, 'We'll take you to a double dissolution. We'll have the technique there if we wish to exercise it, and we'll pass this bill at a joint sitting of both houses.' So after all his puffery over the polls, and the preening he has been going on with lately, when the Leader of the Opposition was faced with a bit of hard tack, out he was in a second. He gave in. 'I will pass said. Thank you, John-and thank you from the Aboriginal community of this country, who are entitled to a decent piece of law not to be had by paltry, miserable coalition politics. The government's strength on a matter of principle-not copping the Senate's view or the coalition's view on the land fund, just it did not cop them on the native title legislalater. tion-means that justice will be done for Aboriginal people. It proves this point: the nation moves ahead on principle and victories, not shabby compromises. As a consequence, the Leader of the Opposition was exposed. This how-to-vote card was challenged by the Liberal Party but cleared by the Electoral Commissioner, Mr Green. The Leader of the Opposition introduced this matter, knowing that his party has actually challenged it and was overruled by the Electoral Commissioner for the ACT. That only compounds the see misleading nature of the question which member for Bennelong proposed. Mr Speaker, the problem the member for Bennelong has is that he has been here too long and in opposition too long. He has had it. He has no ideas. He has run out of princiside ples. He is in here playing the same shabby debating games and ploys that were played through the 1970s and 1980s. He does not realise that the whole country has moved on and is looking for value, looking for change, looking for substance. Here he is, trying ask the Prime Minister of the day whether condone a polling technique-which his party first used in 1988-when he knew that the or dirty. tricks. technique employed had nothing whatsoever to do with that dishonourable, disreputable technique. Rather, it was something employed by the Australian Labor Party in the ACT after this particular how-to-vote card was cleared by the Electoral Commissioner. Then he went on about how people were dressed, as if people have got to go around decked in blue and white with rosettes. as though if you are not out there with your rosettes and blue and white on, doing a jig at the polls, you are not legitimate, that you cannot go out and say, 'Don't vote for the Independents' dressed in a pair of jeans and the bill,' he aT-shirt. So what? Mr Speaker, compare that to saying that a woman believes in the termination of pregand nancy after nine months-you hypocrites, you shabby hypocrites-ascribing to her a whole lot of social views which would demean her in the eyes of the public, trying to besmirch her reputation and then, having created that as climate, going to the polls a couple of months This is where the Liberal Party is. The fact is you are completely hollow as a party. You have no substance as an organisation. You are a party of convenience, not conviction. You have no substance. You have no policies. Your front bench is not worth a tinker's cuss. You have no strength in your back bench. Your party organisation is hollow. You keep playing this sort of carousel with leaders, thinking you are going to hit the jackpot. You are pulling the fruit machine of Australian politics, giving the handle a go to whether something will roll into the slot, the knowing that every symbol on the wheel is empty. The fact is that Australian politics deserves better than the federal Liberal and National parties, much better-and it has got it on this of the House. You can see it today in another milestone change for this society with the impending passage of the Aboriginal land fund bill. As a consequence of that, because of principle, articulation, enunciation, understanding, cooperation and consultation with to people, a good social deed is going to be I done. That is what government is about; it is not about shabby, hollow tricks, nasty tricks Look at John Hewson. He walked out of here the other day. He came in as a relatively young man, was not here for many years, got to be the shadow treasurer for his party, became the opposition leader, lost an election, was denied the right to serve in the portfolios that he was interested in and walked away. What residual feeling is there going to be It is with him for the Liberal Party?",98
262,Unknown,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Government members interjecting,99
263,Mr KEATING,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Yes, Mr Morris is briefing him. John, while Mr Morris is briefing you, tell us about the 'catch Tim' cheque donation scheme that he was managing in South Australia. Perhaps he can tell us about that in the briefing. Does anybody believe that John Hewson is going to walk away; after a long association, with warm memories, depth, comradeship and commitment to the Liberal Party? Basically, you are like some sort of auxiliary business organisation that bands together to win an election. You have no sense of commitment, social cohesion or touch with the broader Australian community; you are just a bunch of individuals who sign the party ticket, line up while your careers are on the line and walk away as though it never happened. Whereas we on this side might be sentimental about the Labor Party in or out of office, because we believe it in it, we area party of conviction. We believe in things. We have feelings about the country. We have depth and we have association with the community. We are not a hollow party without any organisational strength, any philosophic understandings or any sense of touch with the broader Australian community. There is no progression. John Howard's political growth is stunted because he comes from nothing. He is in here after all these years in parliament-20 years in parliamenttrying to trick the Prime Minister into a question about a piece of polling data which he knows to be wrong. I am supposed to say, 'Oh, a big change in the opposition. A new leader. A fresh start. A man of principle. Honest John.' I was the guy who got the Treasury job after you. I know what the tax office has said about you. I know what they said to me about the criminal avoidance in the tax system. I know what job I had to do to try to put it all back into place and build the law say thatto stop that sort of thing happening in the past. 1 understand these things. When people say to me, 'Honest John,' 1 say, 'Oh, sure.' 1 was the bunny who had five or six years wearing it on my back for his honesty in the tax system or his incapacity to deal with the 16 per cent wages growth. Sure, he is a great little guy! When he comes back and people say, 'I bet you'll be afraid of Howard,' 1 say, 'Oh, yeah!' We have seen it all before. And now the House has seen it all· again. You do not have to read the subtext. Someone in the Sunday Age said a couple of weeks ago, ' We were shown these things, these savings options,' as I said in the caucus, 'by Liberal people as if they were dirty postcards-a profit.' They said, 'Here they are, but don't say they came from us.' But the journalist had enough integrity to write it. Instead of taking it on the chin and saying that is how slick Parliament House is these days, he said, 'Hang on, I do not think it is slick. I ought to say, ""Hang on, you've offered me this. I'll say it came from you.''' But they said, 'Oh, you cannot say it came from us.' The following week I went on the Paul Lyneham program and I was asked about it. I pointed to the member for Bennelong and his attempts to undermine the budgetary process, running around with these savings options. One shot across the trench-gonedropped it like a hot scone. A day later he said, 'Oh, we'll pass any reasonable spending proposals that come on.' We have seen in a very short time how unprincipled John Howard is. It is one thing trying to score off me; it is another misleading this parliament. Misleading this parliament is a grievous offence. The Leader of the Opposition wilfully misled the parliament this afternoon and he should be truly censured for it.",99
264,Mr HOWARD,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"The former Prime Minister, whenever he thought that he had been given an opportunity to say something unexpectedly, used to throw his hands up in the air and say, 'There is a God.' I have to Mr Lee interjecting",100

272,Mr HOWARD,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Now that he is talking about what I did 15 or 20 years ago, I am going to talk about something he did 25 years ago. This is a serious motion and, inevitably, through the weight of numbers, there will be a censure motion carried against me. I accept the way this place operates. I have to say that I thought the Prime Minister would try a slightly more subtle attack. There is nothing particularly subtle about a government using its numbers to say that the opposition leader ought to be censured. How incredibly sophisticated and erudite a tactic. It must have come from that master of erudite interjection, Kim Beazley, who said that inviting your booth workers to mislead the voters was perfectly normal practice",101
273,Mr BEAZLEY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"I said it was routine Liberal practice, and so it is.",101
274,Mr SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Resume your seat.,101
275,Mr HOWARD,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Let us go back a moment to the substance. The Prime Minister tried to allege that I had asked a question that was based upon incorrect information. Let me just go through the question again and point out how, in the process of drafting the motion, the Prime Minister himself shifted his ground and ended up writing out a motion that was different from the one that he had already moved. The House should pay very careful attention to what I actually asked. You are interested in standards. Come on! You want to have a proper political debate",101
276,Unknown,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Government members interjecting,101

279,Mr HOWARD,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"This is how my question read. In view of Labor's recent moralising . about election practices, I ask the Prime Minister: is he aware that in the recent ACT elections the Labor Party targeted unsuspecting voters· by issuing its own how-to-vote cards for independents? That was completely true.",101
280,Mr KEATING,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,It's not true.,101
281,Mr SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,The Prime Minister has had his go. He will resume his seat.,101
282,Mr HOWARD,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,I will go on. I said: Is he also aware that the ALP issued instructions to booth captains that ALP workers handing out these cards should not wear any identifiable badges? I quote from the instructions: The person handing out the preference how-to-vote card should not be wearing ALP identifiers. Does he approve the technique used by the ALP when it used Labor booth workers without identification who were instructed to target votersMr Horne-It has got the ALP logo on it.,101
283,Mr SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,I warn the member for Paterson.,101
284,Mr HOWARD,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"and to deceive them into believing that they were supporting independents by distributing a how-to-vote card where the words, 'voting independent' clearly swamped the ALP logo. I never suggested there was no ALP logo. Every single thing that I said in that question was true; Despite that, Pinocchio over there will use his weight of numbers and think that is being very clever and very smart. All I can say is that I thought that a politician who has been in the national parliament for 25 years and who has something of a reputation as being a skilled political operator would have done a little better than to be so unsophisticated and so unsubtle. The Prime Minister did not bother, when he was making his speech, to refer to the ALP instructions. He said, 'The person handing out the preference how-to-vote should attempt to get the last position in the queue.' That is fair enough. He continued, '. . . not forgetting that there is a minimum distance of six metres.' Here is a sheet that says, 'Booth captains preference how-to-vote green slips.' Listen to this, Mr Speaker. It says, 'For those booths which have preference how-to-vote cards, please don't have ALP identifiable badges.' Here is the interesting thing. It says, 'We want to distinguish between those giving out ALP how-to-votes and those giving out preference how-to-votes. In other words the instructions are saying, 'We want to disguise the fact that we are trying to dupe the voters.' That was the gravamen of my question. It was true and correct in every particular. I accept that, notwithstanding, those opposite will use their weight of numbers but I take the opportunity, as the Prime Minister did, to say a number of general things about electoral matters. Sheer self-indulgence prevents me from suppressing a natural desire to go back into a bit of history. Mr Keating interjecting",101
285,Mr SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"No, resume your seat. The Leader of the House will come next.",102
286,Mr HOWARD,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"I know that I should not do it but there was a book written by Anthea Carew-listen to this beautiful quote-who said: Tension mounted. The right wanted the challenge votes counted; the left did not. The only way out of the impasse that had developed was to call the general returning officer, Lindsay North, who had the power to intervene.",102
287,Mr BRERETON,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,What year?,102
288,Mr HOWARD,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"It continues: There was no telephone in the scout hall and Brereton roared off into the night on his motor cycle to call North. The returning officer had got to bed after counting a preselection ballot in another seat and he refused to come out again. Brereton decided to go straight to the topthat is direct action, Laurieand he rang Gough Whitlam, then leader of the ALP, at his home in Cabramatta. Whitlam remembers the call. Of course he does. It continues: He. was unwilling to become involved in a preselection dispute, having always distanced himself from machine business. Time dragged on. Abuse flew between the opposing sides. Around 1 a.m. North arrived with all his pyjamas visible under his clothes and declaring the votes to be in dispute, he confiscated the boxes. But more is to come. The most interesting part of this great saga about the preselection ballot of the Prime Minister of Australia was the report into it by the then Federal President of the ALP, who is now the Deputy Premier of Queensland in the Goss Labor government-hardly a Liberal Party stooge. He is hardly on the staff of the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party, is he? This is what it said under 'Preselection': Blaxland. The preselection ballot was held on 26 October. There were six candidates. On the evening of the count, Juner polled 88 votes, Keating 81 votes and 63 went to the other candidates. When those preferences were allocated, the vote was Juner 124, Keating 108 and 49 went unchallenged. These included 30 from Condal Park, two from Central Bankstown, 14 from Bass Hill and five others. The general returning officer completed the ballot on 1 November andlisten to this, miraculously enough, amazingthe final ballot figures were Keating 146, Juner 125. Opposition members-Fraud! Fraud!",102
289,Mr HOWARD,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"But listen to this. I am horrified to say that it gets worse. This is Tom Burns, not John Howard. It continues: The action of the New South Wales executive secured the result by allowing supporters who would join the party outside of the express party rules to participate. Twenty-seven supporters of Mr Keating who were allowed to vote were admitted into Central Bankstown branch, yet they not only lived in the Condal Park area but in joining Central Bankstown branch were outside their state electorate and their federal electoral divisions. Laurie It then goes on to condemn him in quite just explicit terms. It goes on to say about the Prime Minister: The obvious stacking of branches and the sacking of branches appears to have been carried out deliberately, intending to ensure certain people gained selection. As some of these people are now federal members of parliament, these actions must assume importance in the eyes of the federal executive. I strongly disapprove of the actions of the New South Wales officers in these preselection ballots. They are not the words of a Labor majority. They are not the words of the Liberal Party stooge. They are the words of Paul Keating. I will just conclude by saying this: this country is now led by a man who rorted his preselection in order to gain entry into parliament. He is the last person who has any moral authority-either here or anywhere in Australia-to lecture anybody about honesty. As one of my colleagues said to me, he is in need of an honesty transplant but cannot find a donor on the front bench. When it comes to dirty tricks, when it comes to rorting preselection ballots, when it comes to misleading the public, when it comes to lying to the Australian people, there is no 'person better at rorting a preselection than the Prime Minister. There is no person better at telling a l-i-e than the Prime Minister. There is no person better at deceiving the Australian people than the Prime Minister. There is no person who has been more consistently up to his armpits in lying and deceiving of the Australian public than the Prime Minister. All I can say to the Prime Minister is that if he wants to fight the next election campaign on the question of honesty and integrity-oh, I could be so lucky. That is all I can say-oh, I could be so lucky. Prime Minister, please will you fight the election campaign on the issue of honesty and integrity? I would be delighted. I know they say that you do not like me, but actually I think deep down you might. Why don't you do me a real favour and fight the election campaign on the question of honesty and integrity? I will put my honesty and integrity on the line any day against yours. I could not be more delighted. I hope that you do this again. I hope that you do it every week, because it affords us a tremendous opportunity to point out what a deceiving, dishonest, lying politician you really are.",102
290,Mr BEAZLEY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Fifteen minutes, and not one word about push polling; 15 minutes, and one minute was in defence of himself on this question; 15 minutes, and not one statement about Mr Robb's shenanigans in his national office last week and this week; 15 minutes, and all of it the product of one book handed over to him by Grahame Morris, whose activities have been the subject of very considerable questioning in the media today; 15 minutes solely on a product that had been handed out, retailed, a piece of literature which has been around for donkeys years. What we have not got with John Howard is this: you are allowed to talk about 1969; you are allowed to talk about 1995; but what you are not allowed to talk about is 1977 to 1983. You are allowed to talk about 1929; you are allowed to talk about 1946; but, for God's sake, don't mention the war. Whatever you do, don't mention the war. Also, 'Do not for one minute mention how I got my name honest John.' If ever there was a lucky politician in Australia it has to be the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), because the population in general would now believe that the nickname honest John came from a reputation for public integrity during the time he was a minister. In fact, the nickname honest John was coined at one decisive point: it was coined in 1978 after the 1978 budget in which the Hobart Mercury-the most extreme in terms of its presentation, and with the rest of the AU$tralian provincial dailies all with the same theme---carried on the front page the words 'lies, lies, lies' in huge bold type. They carried those words 'lies, lies, lies' because John Howard had brought down a budget and in that budget was a direct repudiation of all the election promises he had put forward in 1977. So, from that day on until quite recently, honest was accompanied by quotation marks. That is where the title came from. This is a useful opportunity for us to provide the House with a reminder of that point. Generally speaking, in these censure debates the Liberals actually have the courage to stay in the chamber but they have all gone. They went straight out the door, except the poor chap at the table, the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who has to sit here and carry the can for his leader because somebody has to sit on the opposition front bench. The member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), who has covered himself in glory in recent days by his efforts inside the Liberal Party to deal with the issue of push polling, is also sitting here and half of the Independents are sitting here. The others have retreated to lick their wounds because this is a censure debate that they invited upon themselves. We did not start off with the intention of censuring them for this; we merely started off with the inten-:- branch. tion of pointing out a few facts. But members of the opposition said, 'Oh, please, get up and censure us' and so we did. We are obliging fellows and so we got up and censured them. When we did, there was not a single word of reply from the opposition leader to the gravamen of the point. I show to the House the how-to-vote card. I will go through it again because I think it is necessary to debate the point of the censure and argue the toss as to what that point means. If you have got evidentiary documents associated with it, then you might as well table them and go through it. Any person receiving this piece of paper could in no way be misled about where it came from because it has the Australian Labor Party logo sitting there. It has written across the bottoin of the page, 'Authorised by Doug Thompson, Australian Labor Party'. It does not carryon top of it a No. 1 preference because it is handed out in the assumption that the person receiving it is going to vote Independent No.1. It simply carries on down the list from that point onwards. So it is not a bogus how-to-vote card in itself. A bogus how-to-vote card, indeed, might have carried the number '1' upon it. The opposition failed to point out that this was taken up with the Electoral Commissioner for the ACT who, at the end of the day, approved it. I wonder, however, whether he approved this little document from the same election. This little document says: Ratepayersrevolt. Vote 1 Lucinda Spier column B on ballot. It is authorised by P. Jansen of 12 Dampier Crescent, Forrest. Is there a sign on it that says 'Liberal Party candidate'? Is there a sign on this which has the logo of the Liberal Party in Canberra? Is it anywhere on this document? Who is Lucinda Spier? Lucinda Spier is a Liberal Party candidate but there is a bogus how-to-vote card put out for her called 'Ratepayers revolt' . I am afraid, old son, when you start to sling the muck in this particular show, you never know where it is going to stickand it is sticking very solidly on you lot when it comes to the performance of the ACT Mr Howard was very keen to spend a very long time quoting from a book by Edna Carew, a book which has now been in circulation for the best part of a decade, as though anybody in politics has not yet read it.",103
291,Mr KEATING,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,I haven't!,104
292,Mr BEAZLEY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"The Prime Minister hasn't. Many others, nevertheless, will have. But we have more recent preselections to discuss than that preselection; we have the one of immediate interest to us. The Canberra branch of the Liberal Party is a pack of classics when it comes to dealing with the issues of an election. It also put out bogus how-to-vote cards with no clarity at all about the origins of those how-to-vote cards. One great thing in politics that you learn very early on is projection: when somebody comes at you, there is a 90 per cent chance that he is coming at you with a problem for himself. And if you get in behind it, you might well find something very interesting as you spend your time going through. My father is a bit of a right-winger in Labor Party affairs. He used to always say to me, which I thought was unduly fair on his behalf, 'I'm afraid to say, Kim, in a union ballot when they scream commo, you scream auditors.' Nevertheless, this is obviously a very similar case that we have here on our hands:. we ought to scream Electoral Commission, having had this particular accusation levelled at us. I have here an interesting report from today's newspaper the Canberra Times. It says 'Top Liberal candidates miss out'. There was an awful lot talked about by the Leader of the Opposition in his 12-minute readings from past literature and his three-minute defence of himself, and that was about people who get ballots and do not actually win elections. The report states: The Liberal candidate for the Canberra by-election did not top the poll of party members for the preselection, according to party informants. Others say the leading candidates who lost, on the Left and the Centre of the party, were subjected to a right-wing dis information campaign that fitted the pattern, if not the depths, of the push-polling campaign against Labor's candidate, Sue Robinson. If you go on and read the rest of this very sorry little report, you will find the statement by the Liberals, 'We don't really care what Liberal Party members feel in this area. There is a little closed purple circle and we will the opinion of the members but we will appoint whom we like at the end of the We'll put them through a poll. It doesn't matter what votes they get in that poll, rorted or otherwise, we are going to select exactly whom we desire. And our own party members article reads: that we would otherwise have thought in good standing, we will subject them to the sort of campaign that Sue Robinson has been subject Liberal to in this situation.' The Liberal Party is very fast off the mark in accusations the subject of honesty. I raised the issue in this parliament yesterwill day, in, I thought, a fairly light-hearted of way, because I do not really want to see Andrew Robb in gaol for six months; nor do I want to see him fined $2,500. I have lower ambitions. I merely wish his leader to repudidoctoring ate him. That is all. I do not want to see him in gaol. I do not want to see shape or form fined. But I would not mind seeing his leader give him a bit of repudiation every now and then. But what did we find? I mentioned it in fairly unheavy fashion because I did not know whether the Liberal Party had cleared with Western Australian lottery commission the particular raffle book that it sent to George Gear's family. I could not have told from document-unlike this document which the Liberals could tell was a Labor Party circulatalleging ed document-whether it had been cleared with the Western Australian gaming commisreason sion because it contained only reference Northern Territory and Australian Capital failing Territory licences. So I left it hanging as to whether anything untoward had happened. What happened? The old push pollers of the Liberal Party-they are no longer tors-including the leader, were up around the gallery saying, 'Beazley's overstepped himbeen self. He's finally caught himself out.' Paul Bongiorno, who runs the evening claquer service for the Liberal Party, made a statement saying, 'The government has clearly overstepped itself as far as this issue is concerned.' I was prepared to let it rest at that and to leave as an open question whether anything had happened. But one of the journalists, hear Lenore Taylor, actually had the presence of mind to ring the Western Australian gaming day. commission. What did Lenore Taylor find when examining the words of the honest push pollers, the honest Leader of the Opposition, the epitome of honesty in his office? Her However, a spokesman for the WA Office of Racing and Gaming told The Australian that the Party had broken the law by failing to include the number of its WA permit on the tickets and said that the tickets had never been seen by the over here on gaming office. ""(The Liberal Party) made the mistake and we issue them a warning letter but take no further sort action than that,"". . . As I said before, I do not particularly want any action to be taken on the matter. But I am quite enjoying the fact that the Liberals' spin has been revealed for the tissue of lies that it is, as is the case with most of their him in any way, other activities. But I do take exception to the sorts of things that Sue Robinson has been subjected to in Canberra. I take very grave exception to a those. As pointed out by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition has not repudithe ated those. The reason we have the censure motion in this place is the pathetic effort by the Leader of the Opposition to mislead this that House, in coming forward with a ticket, properly marked by the Labor Party, and that there was something wrong with it-when in fact it had been cleared. The he has done that is that he wants to to crawfish out of the consequences of his to repudiate the people on his staff and the people in the federal office for the various shenanigans that they have got up to, including that most heinous of shenanigans associatspin doced with push polling. I am pleased to say that so far there have three or four editorials on this matter. It has been considered of sufficient weight, dealing with the integrity and honesty in the Australian electoral system. It has not been brushed off by them as a slight matter of no moment. There have been editorials by three or four of our major daily papers saying that this form of activity, this form of defamation, this suggesting that a particular candidate has written books inviting people to go and burn down the houses of the burghers of Canberra-which is what was suggested by the Liberals-and that the candidate endorsed a proposition that people should be entitled to legal terminations of pregnancy at nine months, and a whole plethora of slanderous lies that were incorporated in that push polling technique, should be banned. All of those newspapers had the opportunity, and have taken it, to repudiate this activiThe ty. The only person who still thinks it is a pretty good idea-or, if he does not think it is a good idea, he has taken the view that he will just let it flick past and if the old boss cocky of the Liberal Party decides to pursue it at some point in time he will let that pass too-has been honest John, trying to cover himself with a piece of work that is purely contemptible, but a piece of work which stands in such dramatic contrast with the Liberals' behaviour. There is no doubt that, in the course of political campaigns in which there is a plethora of political parties, political parties will try to take advantage of that situation. But here the Labor Party presents an honest statement. The Labor Party says, 'Put the Liberals last. Authorised by Doug Thompson, Australian Labor Party. If you vote Independent and you want your preference to go to the ALP, this is how you do it.' The Labor Party tells people what it is doing but the 'Ratepayers revolt' put things out with no Liberal Party identification. There is no indication whatsoever where they come from. If you are in the independent minded ratepayers revolt group, just rock on out there and vote Liberal. That is the proposition put forward by the Liberal Party. The Leader of the Opposition invited his personal censure. He gave us no reason why he should not be censured. There is no doubt that, after we have heard from the next Liberal Party speaker, this House is going to take advantage of that opportunity. (Time expired)",104
293,Mr CONNOLLY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Bradfield) (4.55 p.m.}This Labor Party opposite never learns and it never changes. Any sensible analysis of the political activities of the Labor Partyespecially in New South Wales since the 1970s--demonstrates beyond any reasonable doubt that you never learn and you never change. This censure motion today is to complain that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) misled the House with his allegations about how-to-vote arrangements in the ACT. These were not allegations; these were facts. basis of the facts is none other than the documentation, which was circulated to ALP branch workers at the ACT elections and which I hold in my hand. The evidence contained in these documents shows beyond all reasonable doubt that the claims made by the opposition are absolutely correct. The important thing is that neither the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) nor the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) makes any serious attempt to explain the unexplainable. Why is it so? It is because in the ACT election we merely saw a continuation of a long line of cheating, cajolery and activities of this dubious nature that you and your party in virtually every state of Australia-whether it be Queensland, New South Wales or Victoriahave perpetrated for far too long. Let me start with Queensland. There was a by-election in the seat of Mirani. There was a Confederate Action Party candidate. This particular candidate claimed to give his second preferences to the National Party. But was the Labor Party to be outdone on this? Was there any risk to be taken? Of course not. The Labor Party put out its own how-tovote card, which said, 'Make your voice heard in the government by voting for the Confederate Action Party,' but then it said-we are told this is the Labor Party technique-' Don't support Borbidge's bickering coalition. Give your second preference to your Wayne Goss Labor candidate Graeme Hall and do not waste your vote.' Any reasonable person reading that document would say that it had been put out by the Confederate Action Party. Let me now move to what happened in Victoria. The general secretary, Peter Bachelor, issued a bogus how-to-vote card in the Nunawading by-election in the 1980s. Labor denied it but, eventually, you admitted your fault. You admitted that you were cheating. There is two out of two. Now I will move to the ACT, which is the subject of this particular debate. I suggest that in this particular case one can only conclude that the motive was deception. It was deception in its most vile form. For the benefit of those members opposite who may not want to believe what some of their colleagues get up to when they get the opportunity, this is what a preference how-to-vote card looks like a la ALP. Booth captains at the ACT election were told that booths that have preference how-to-vote cards will not have ALP identifiable badges, et cetera. I am a reasonable man. I am sure all my colleagues here are reasonable people. When they are facing a situation like that, they have to turn to that fundamental word 'motive'. If the motive of the Labor Party booth captains was to encourage their booth workers to deliberately disseminate information which they knew to be inaccurate, it is deception. There is no other way to describe it. Further, this document states, 'We want to distinguish between those giving out ALP how-to-votes and those giving out preference how-to-votes.' The key word is 'distinguish'. What was the Labor Party trying to distinguish? Was it trying to distinguish Liberal votes from Labor votes? Was it trying to distinguish Independent votes from Labor votes, or Independent votes from Liberal votes? You do not have to be more than a halfwit to work out that the Labor Party in Canberra and its booth workers knew precisely what they were trying to distinguish, because they have told us. They were trying to distinguish between those giving out ALP how-to-votes and those giving out preference how-to-votes. Why were they trying to do that? They were doing that with a deliberate intention to deceive the electors of Canberra and to make them believe they were voting independent. There it is. They are not my words; it is your document. They are not my thoughts, your intentions. They are not my desires, your deceit. There is no doubt about it. The next document has instructions for handing out preference how-to-vote cardseuphemistically and very appropriately called green slips. The first instruction is: the person handing out the preference how-to-votes should attempt to get the last position in the queue-that is, the position closest to the polling booth-not forgetting that there is a minimum distance of six metres. It was very generous of them to tell us that. Why were they doing that? They were positioning their people deliberately so that, as the electors went into the booth, the last piece of paper they would receive would be this dubious piece of bumf-this dubious piece of papertelling them that if they voted Independent not to give the Liberal!AllianceMr Harry Woods-What's it sayan the bottom?",106

295,Mr CONNOLLY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"I have been here for long enough to learn one interesting lesson: those who shout the loudest are always those who have the most to protect themselves from. If they wanted the facts, they would listen.",107
296,Mr BEAZLEY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,That's my line.,107
297,Mr CONNOLLY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Even you and I can agree on something. The second instruction gives the line to use when handing out the how-to-votes, and this is part of the real substance of the deception. It says that the line used should be something like 'Voting Independent?' Do not forget, we are dealing with people who have no badges on, no distinguishing ALP characteristics at all. Why? Because they were told by the Labor Party to take them off. If that is not deception, would you please tell us what is. People going to the polling booth took this piece of paper, believing that they had the opportunity to exercise their democratic right and vote Independent because it had the word 'Independent' along the top of it. Voters in the ACT did not know the truth; they had no reason to doubt this. They are learning what millions of Australians have learnt in recent days, and it is quite simple: you cannot trust Labor with anything. You really cannot. When you look back on its record, you find that it never learns and it never changes. 1I have demonstrated in this debate thatDr Theophanous interjecting",107
298,Mr SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Order! The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister is not helping.,108
299,Mr CONNOLLY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"I have demonstrated in this debate that, whether you are talking about by-elections in Queensland or in Nunawading, Victoria, whether you are talking about the rorting of preselections-such as Mr Keating's own preselection in Ne.w South Wales in 1970 or so-nothing changes. This mob cannot lie straight in bed. When the Leader of the House made his great contribution, he complained that my colleagues were not here to listen to him. They had much more sensible things to do. He made one most interesting comment. He talked about presenting an honest statement! The evidence is so blatant. You forgot that the word 'honesty' has a little 'dis' in front of it. It is called dishonesty, and there is a heck of a difference between the two words. A growing number of people in this country have had enough; they want a bit of honesty in government. They want to see the situation improved. They will not see that from a Labor Party which, time after time, has demonstrated so clearly its utter inability to properly improve the situation. 1 turn now to branch stacking.

301,Mr SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Order! Both sides will come to order. The member for Bradfield has the call.,108
302,Mr CONNOLLY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. A report was brought down on the New South Wales ALP. It was a report by the then federal president, Mr Tom Burns, into the administration of the New South Wales branch of the party. He spoke about the preselection for the seat of Blaxland. Who is the member for Blaxland? What is his name? Paul Keating. Precisely. The report states: The preselection ballot was held on 26 October 1968. There were six candidates ... the action of the New South Wales executive secured the result by allowing supporters who had joined the Party outside of the expressed Party rules to participate. Keating won that preselection because the central office made jolly sure that he did. His friend Laurie Brereton even had his motorbike there to prove it. The important thing is that, from the beginning to the end of this whole sorry situation, time and again this Labor Party is simply incapable of having an honest situation where it sees any prospect whatsoever of getting a benefit. Much has been said by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House about the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has not had anything to say about push polling. Mr Leo MCLeay-That's right.",108
303,Mr CONNOLLY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,I am very glad you said that. 1 draw your attention to the transcript of a public interview on the public record on 2 March. This is what he said: I'm in favour of orthodox benchmark research.l'm not in favour of what you call push-polling. Mr Snowdon interjecting,108

305,Mr CONNOLLY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"He made further observations: I've made it clear, and I make it clear to you publicly that so-called push-polling is not something that I support. That is on the record, and that is our position. But that is not the issue of this particular motion. The motion we are discussing today concerns the how-to-vote arrangements of the ACT. 1 will finish my observations by referring once again to the instructions, the important part of which states: If the polling booth official questions the validity of the preference how to vote, you should continue to hand out the how to votes and refer the official to ALP Headquarters, preferably to Richard Webb or Doug Thompson. It further states: The person handing out the preference how to vote Quick, H. V. should not be wearing any ALP identifiers ie Badge, Stickers, T-shirts or Hat. Deceit! Deceit! Deceit! That is your badge. That is the badge that you have worn for the last 13 years. It is a badge that will lead you into infamy in the political history of this country. The people of Australia deserve better. Their elections have to be above board. They expect the government of the day to honour the integrity of the political and electoral system of Australia.

My own view that we need as much as we need concerned parents home environment to reinforce the positive in schools.

The to June 1995 inclusive, consistent with the NA Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) Parenting Allowance commences 1 July 1995. The estimated average number of clients who will receive the payment in each of the financial years specified are: 1995-96-998,373; 1996-97-1,053,945; 199798-1,145,124 (1 )(b) The estimated average numbers of clients receiving Partner Allowance are: 1994-95-213,300; 1995-96--81,600; 1996-97for the Austral- 61,600; 1997-98-41,500 The decline in estimates from 1995-96 onwards is due to the effects of the introduction of the White Paper income support reforms. From 1 July 1995, Partner Allowance will begin to phase out. The number of Partner allowees will decline, with transfers to Parenting Allowance, and some people aged less than forty years, and without dependent children, will test their eligibility for Job Search Allowance. (2)(a) There will be no recipients of Parenting Allowance until 1 July 1995. (2)(b) The number of Partner Allowance recipients at 10 January 1995 was 233,935. (3)&(4) I have referred these parts of the honourable member's question to my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training as they fall within his portfolio responsibilities.

Civil Aviation Regulations (Question No. 1663) Mr Sinclair asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 17 October 1994: (1) Will he provide a list of all dispensations to Civil Aviation Regulations which have been (a) granted, (b) withdrawn or (c) varied by the Civil Aviation Authority since 1 January 1993. (2) Which of the dispensations referred to in part (1) are current. (3) With respect to each of the dispensations referred to in part (1), (a) which persons or organisations were affected by the dispensation, (b) what was the term of the dispensation, (c) on what grounds was the dispensation granted, withdrawn or varied and (d) which parties were notified of the dispensation.",152
392,Mr BRERETON,DATE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)&(2) The Civil Aviation Authority has provided the following answer: The Civil Aviation Regulations (CARs) do not provide for formal 'dispensations' as the term is used in this question. However, the CARs do allow for exemptions to be granted for the handling of special or exceptional circumstances. Exemptions which may be granted include: general and specific ex em ptions, permissions, authorities and approvals. The question may also be intended to cover delegations and appointments issued under .the Regulations. In this regard, regulation 7 of the CARs provides for the delegation of the powers and functions vested in the Authority and regulation 6 provides for the appointment of 'authorised persons'. A list of the types of exemptions and delegations, which can be granted under the CARs, is attached. (3) A comprehensive list of the exemptions granted under the CARs would take some time to assemble as, apart from exemptions under CAR 308, the remainder would have to be collated from information held by the Central Office, the Regions, and the District Offices in order to answer the question in the depth that is required. NA NA CAR 308 Exemption Regulation 308 of the CARs is a general exemption power. It provides that the Authority may exempt a particular aircraft or specified type or category of aircraft from compliance with specified provisions of the CARs. It may also exempt persons from compliance with such provisions while they are in, or associated with, the operation craft. An exemption under regulation 308 is a disallowable instrument under section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, and is subject to disallowance by the Parliament. Miscellaneous Provisions Under certain provisions of the CARs, (for example regulation 89ZD, sub-regulation 139(3) the Authority may exempt persons from compliance with the requirements of a particular CAR. Specific exemptions granted under these provisions are not disallowable instruments. Permissions Under numerous provisions of the CARs, (for example regulations 134, 143, 144, 149 and 156) the Authority may give permission for a person or an aircraft to undertake an activity which would otherwise be unlawful. These permissions operate, in effect, as exemptions. Authorised Activities Certain provisions of the Regulations (for example regulations 137,151 and 152) provide for the Authority to authorise activities for particular purposes. Again, authorisations of this kind are essential exemptions under another name. Approved Activities There are provisions of the Regulations (for example sub-regulation 163AA(2), regulation 254) under which the Authority may approve certain activities. These approvals are also exemptions by another name. . Delegations under Regulations 6 and 7 of the CARs Authorised Persons/Delegations Under regulation 6, the Authority may appoint persons to be authorised persons for the purposes of any regulation in which the term 'authorised person' occurs (for example regulation 42J, 42M, 42R and 42Y). Under regulation 7, the Chief Executive Officer of the Civil Aviation Authority may delegate to a person all or any of the Authority's powers and functions under the CARs. In the interest of administrative efficiency, many of the powers and functions referred to in the preceding list have been delegated to officers of the Civil Aviation Authority. The Chief Executive Officer has also delegated the Authority'S powers and functions as necessary, to persons outside the Authority. In particular, the Authority's powers and functions in relation to the testing of flight crew have been extensively delegated to persons outside the Authority. RAAF Base Williamtown (Question No. 1885) Mr Vaile asked the Minister for Transport, of such air1lpon notice, on 31 January 1995: What would be the total cost of upgrading the RAAF air base at Williamtown near Newcastle to . international airport capacity.",157
393,Mr BRERETON,TYPES OF EXEMPTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government announced in the 1990 Budget that it had decided to transfer remaining Commonwealth aerodromes to local authorities and to encourage full local ownership for Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan aerodromes. Negotiations on arrangements were held with each local authority involved in the program. To facilitate the completion of the program the Commonwealth provided maintenance grants to bring the aerodromes to reasonable order for the current level of traffic. RAAF Base Williamtown (Newcastle Airport) is owned by the Department of Defence. The civil areas of the airport were the responsibility of the then Department of Transport and Communications, until 18 December 1992 when the Newcastle City Council and the Port Stephens Shire Council agreed to take over responsibility for the civil areas of the airport on long term lease arrangements. The councils now operate the civil area under a 30 year lease from Department of Defence. The Federal Government provided a grant of $2,75 million from the Newcastle Economic Development Program for works at the airport at the time of the transfer. This allowed considerable development work at the aerodrome to be carried out. The councils are responsible for the management of the works and the transfer agreement provides that no additional Commonwealth funds will be provided. Any further upgrading of facilities is a matter for the councils and Department of Defence.

The Commonwealth is not considering upgrading the RAAF base at Williamtown for international aircraft operations and has therefore not sought cost estimates for such work.
