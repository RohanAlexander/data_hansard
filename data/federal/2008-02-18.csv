1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 12 pm and read prayers. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 14 February, on motion by Mr Hale: That the Address be agreed to.",17
2,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,Unknown,"I began my contribution to the address-in-reply debate just before question time last Thursday and I will continue where I left off. I referred to the emergency situation in many communities in Queensland and particularly the great local leadership that is being shown by local communities and councils in areas where the floods have occurred. I said that in Charleville the mayor was working with his councillors and the local SES-in many cases these volunteer SES people are council workers-and I stressed the importance of local government at a local level. Unfortunately, what we are going to see-and we may already have witnessed this in Queensland-is an arrogant state Labor government that is prepared to trample on democracy in Queensland and is not prepared to listen to the results of the plebiscite that was funded by the previous coalition government in Canberra. We are going to see the forcing of amalgamation of councils against the will of the people and against an overwhelming no vote on amalgamation in so many local council areas.",17

4,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,Unknown,"Members opposite perhaps do not want to listen, but I ask them to consider the examples that I put forward. Emerald has had unprecedented rain recently. Over 3,000 people have been displaced from their homes because of the emergency that arose with flooding in that area. Who was at the forefront of the organisation of the safe movement of people and their goods and chattels from their homes? It was the local council, led by local leadership-because the council is local. We did not hear much about the Bauhinia Shire Council, but that is the neighbouring shire in Central Queensland. It is suffering just as much devastation from the flooding and the water coming over the Fairbairn Dam-as we saw on television and heard on the radio in Emerald. Once again, at a time of national emergency, local leadership and the local council were leading the community and being there-because they are the local council. On 15 March this year we are going to see the amalgamation of those shires. The local government elections will be held on that date and the councils will be forced together. The Bauhinia Shire will lose its CEO and its representation at a local level. Should we have another emergency-which is inevitable-the local councils, the local representatives in those communities, will not be able to show leadership in times of emergency. The headquarters will be in Emerald, some 60 kilometres away. Jericho Shire is about 150 kilometres away. It has been forced to amalgamate with the Barcaldine Shire Council. They have had emergencies because of the flooding that is occurring in Central Queensland and have been able to respond. The local people in the region have been moved safely out of their homes because a local council understands their needs. The equipment is available locally and the local council area is able to respond and ensure the safety of its residents. The headquarters of Jericho Shire will move to Barcaldine, as will the Aramac Shire. Aramac Shire is about 150 kilometres north of Barcaldine. It is going to be forced to amalgamate by an arrogant Labor government in Queensland that did not listen to the people of Queensland in the recent plebiscite. I think in the Aramac Shire the plebiscite recorded a 96 per cent no vote on the stupidity of forcing amalgamation against the will of the people. Eighteen months ago in Aramac a minicyclone went through the town. Many houses were unroofed. Working families were without a roof on their house. Who dealt with that situation immediately? It was the local council-a mayor, councillors and workers of the council. In so many of these smaller communities the workers are also the SES, the local volunteer State Emergency Service people. That council will be forced to amalgamate with the Barcaldine Shire Council, along with the Jericho Shire Council. We are going to lose all this local leadership has been so important and effective and that has been with these communities for more than 100 years. We heard during the election campaign that the present Prime Minister was very concerned about this matter. I welcome the member for Flynn. I know he cannot interject and this may be an unfair attack on him-he has not made his maiden speechbut we saw these great advertisements in Emerald in the Courier-Mail saying that Kevin Rudd, the member for Griffith and current Prime Minister-he was Leader of the Opposition at the time-did not like it; he thought it was dreadful and he said so. He went to see Anna Bligh, the Premier of Queensland. We thought: ‘Here's a breakthrough. He'll be able to convince Anna Bligh. He's running for the office of Prime Minister of this country; he'll have some influence over the Labor Party in Queensland. After all, he is a Queenslander.' Of course, the people of the electorate of Flynn thought: ‘Okay, perhaps we should vote for the Labor Party because they will listen. They'll listen to the plebiscite results.' In the shire of Aramac, 96 per cent of people said, ‘No, we do not want this madness to occur in our community.' But where is the Prime Minister on this now that he is the Prime Minister? He is nowhere to be seen. He is silent on the issue. Against the will of the people he is forcing this madness of amalgamation of shires with no net benefit to the community. Local government is more than just roads, rubbish and rates. In these country shires it is not only about the leadership they have shown in times of national emergency; the council workers in some of these towns are also the volunteer SES people and the volunteer fire men and women. So, when there is a fire in the town, who comes to the fore? The local council workers. If you take the council out of the town and put the central office 100 kilometres away, what is going to happen in those communities where you do not have those volunteers any longer and you have to respond to a fire or another emergency? Some of these councils in these areas in rural Queensland also provide childcare facilities; they are also the local undertaker. I will never forget the big rally that we had in the now electorate of Flynn. In Barcaldine last year a lady from one of the western shires came up to me and told me she was very upset, as most Queenslanders still are, at this forced amalgamation. She said, ‘Who's going to bury me when we don't have a local council in the area?'-because they are also the local undertakers. So councils are more than roads, rates and rubbish. Mr Sidebottom-I think they voted Labor, didn't they?",17
5,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,Unknown,"I hear the other side interjecting, but these are members of parliament, recently elected, who are in safe Labor seats and live in metropolitan Australia and obviously take a very citycentric view of the needs of rural and regional Australia. We heard the Prime Minister, prior to his being elected Prime Minister, say: ‘I'm going to be a Prime Minister for all Australians.' I am sure the member for Flynn, possibly in his maiden speech when he makes it in this House, will get up and say, ‘I've been to see the Prime Minister and I have urged him to go and see Anna Bligh, the Premier of Queensland, before 15 March and say, “Call off this local government election because it is going to hurt me in my own constituency of Flynn.”' I urge him to do so and I will be right behind him, as will be the majority of those councillors in Queensland who have said they would like to have an opportunity to decide and have input into the size, shape and sustainability of their local council. They are not opposed to some form of amalgamation or sharing of services between councils. They are very happy to do that, but they want to have a say in how it occurs, the size that they could manage and the shape that it should be, rather than this madness that we have in Queensland. All I say to the Prime Minister is: ‘Listen to the people of Queensland. Use your influence and authority as the Prime Minister to stop this madness in Queensland before it is too late.' What we have seen is this Labor government demonstrating that it is uncaring, ignorant and arrogant when it comes to the situation of local government elections and the forced amalgamation in Queensland. I want to talk a bit about the issue of economic management. We have heard a lot from the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation that they believe there has to be pain in the community and pain for working families because there is this inflation bubble that is coming at us all. I say to the Treasurer, to the finance minister and to the Prime Minister, that I well remember the pain that the Labor Party last inflicted on working families in Australia when Paul Keating, the Labor Treasurer at the time, said, ‘This is the recession we had to have.' That is the sort of pain that the Labor Party knows-‘this is the recession we had to have.' What working family will ever forget the interest rates that were inflicted by a previous Labor government? Let us look at the comparison between the numbers that the Labor Party inherited from the good economic management of the coalition when we were on the Treasury benches and what we inherited when we came to government in 1996. Let us look at the current inflation rate as opposed to the inflation rate in 1996. Inflation in 1996 was 3.7 per cent; today it is 2.96 per cent. That is what they inherited: a better inflation number than when we came to government. Let us look at the current unemployment rate-another economic measure of importance for us all. When we came to government in March 1996, unemployment was 8.2 per cent; today it is 4.1 per cent. I will never forget the spectacle as, prior to the 1996 election, I was going to high school speech days and looking at all those young Australians leaving school for the first time with the hope of a job or of going on to further education. Youth unemployment when we came to government was 30 per cent. In other words, in 1996 the prospect for 30 per cent of young people was to join a dole queue. Today we do not have enough young people to fill the job opportunities that are out there. That is what we inherited when we came to government in 1996 as opposed to what the Labor Party-Kevin Rudd, the Treasurer and the finance minister-have inherited from the good economic management under a coalition government. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister are now trying to blame the US subprime market as part of the problem. I have news for the government: we went through the SARS crisis, and we managed the economy-we continued to grow it. We went through the 9-11 period, when thousands of people worldwide in tourism, the finance market and the aviation industry lost their jobs. We continued to manage the economy well. We went through the Asian meltdown, and we continued to manage the economy well and deliver budget surplus after budget surplus. When we came to government in 1996 we had a $96 billion deficit that we had to deal with. The Labor Party, the new Prime Minister and the new Treasurer-what did they inherit? No debt and $60 billion in savings that is putting downward pressure on interest rates. So when they come into this place or do media conferences and say, ‘We've got to have pain,' I ask the Treasurer and I ask the Prime Minister: do you want to inflict pain on working families like you did when Paul Keating said that this country must have a recession, and we saw a million people out of work? Is this the sort of pain we are going to see because they have an inability and a lack of experience to manage this complex economy? Don't they want the challenge? Are they shifting the blame to the coalition for our economic management? Is that what they are doing? Are they shifting the blame because they do not know how to handle it? I rather liked the cartoon the other day of the Treasurer standing there with half-a-dozen levers in front of him and not knowing which one to pull. I think that is what we are seeing-this blame game where it is always someone else's problem. They were elected on 24 November; they have the power to make sure that the economy continues to grow, that interest rates are kept low and, importantly, that unemployment is kept low. But will they take it up? Will they deliver? is a great challenge. It looks like the blame game is going to continue. It is always going to be our problem. Notwithstanding the state of the economy that we delivered to the Labor Party, they do not appear to want to have that responsibility because they do not know how to handle it. Another economic measure of the real strength of the economy and our economic management is real wages growth whilst we were in government as compared with the period when the Labor Party were in government, from 1983 to 1996. Real wages growth for working families in that 13 years of ‘hard Labor' in this country was minus 0.2 per cent. Yet under our term in government real wages growth over the 11-year period from 1996 to 2007 was 16.4 per cent. That meant families were better off, working people were better off and people were sharing the wealth of the country and getting more reward for their hard work and their effort. Compare that with 13 years of ‘hard Labor'; there was no real wages growth in that 13 years. That is another measure of the competence of the coalition government as compared to the incompetence of the Labor government when it comes to economic management. Let us also see how we shared the benefits with people on fixed pensions. We provided a 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings measure on top of the CPIwhichever was the greater-so those on pensions, veterans and war widows had the benefit of sharing in some of the wealth and prosperity of our nation. We had not only the CPI increases twice a year but also the other measure of 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings-whichever was the greater. They would benefit from that measure as well. I will continue to take the fight up to the Labor Party on their style of economic management. It is about time they realised It that they are the government and that they have to stop the blame game. If they got out of their little ivory towers-(Time expired)",18
6,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Bass, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",20
7,Ms CAMPBELL,Unknown,"Bass) (12.20 pm)Thank you, Mr Speaker and members. Mr Speaker, I too wish to congratulate you on your elevation to Speaker of this House. Already you have displayed what fine skills you bring to this place. I rise for the first time in this place to speak on the address-in reply to the Governor General's speech, in which His Excellency outlined the Rudd Labor government's positive plans for the future of Australia. I would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land we are meeting on. I also wish to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land we now call Northern Tasmania. I respect their continuing culture and the unique contribution they make to the life of our nation. It is therefore both an honour and a privilege for me to wear traditional shell necklaces handmade by Dulcie and Lola Greeno and to wear a piece of Tasmanian Aboriginal culture into the chamber. These necklaces are made of black crow and maireener shells collected on Flinders Island and at Low Head. The necklaces took six weeks to create from shells which were collected during the spring tide and then cleaned, dried and finally threaded. For both these incredible women I have the utmost respect and once again thank them. I would also like to say at the outset that is an immense privilege to speak in this place today. Putting oneself forward for public service is a challenge and a great honour, and regardless of where we sit in the House I extend my congratulations to all new members of this House. I am very humbled that the people of Bass have sent me here as their representative. It is truly an honour. I would also like to acknowledge my predecessor, Michael Ferguson, and thank him for his service to the community over the past three years. I wish Michael and his family all the best for the future. The electorate of Bass is in many ways a microcosm of Australia. Ours is a hard working, innovative and resilient community involved in traditional pursuits, such as farming and sustainable forestry, as well as new and emerging industries, such as tourism, winemaking, engineering and information based industries. Bass is also a tolerant community. It is a diverse, multicultural society. The oldest continuing culture in the world exists peacefully side by side with the culture of those who are freshly arrived from such places as Sudan, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The beauty of the landscape and the strength of our community make Northern Tasmania simply the best place in the world to live. While I am sure many members will make that claim of their homes, it is only in this instance that it is true. On 24 November 2007 it became evident that the people of Bass were indeed an excellent barometer for the mood of the country. On that day the people of Bass, like the people of the nation, determined to forge a new future for our country and our local communities. They said yes to proper funding for health care and proper investment in the education of our young people; they said yes to ensuring our innovative, local business operators will have access to the skilled workit force they will require to continue to grow; they said yes to Australia reclaiming its place at the forefront of the fight against global warming-a fight in which Tasmania has long led the way as a generator of clean, renewable energy; and they said yes to a fair go for the first Australians and for refugees. In so doing, the people of Bass demonstrated their decency and their belief in a fair gonot just for themselves but for all Australians. Mr Speaker, it is therefore truly an honour to take my place on your right and behind a Prime Minister and Australia's first female Deputy Prime Minister, who are listening to the people of Bass and who are already delivering for them. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's first act after taking his oath of office was to sign the instrument of ratification for Kyoto and attend the Bali conference on climate change. How proud we are for our country to be so ably represented on this global stage. This new Labor government has dismantled the so-called Pacific solution, which sent a message to the world that Australians do not care about people fleeing persecution for political, religious or social reasons-a message which, of course, misrepresented the view of the vast majority of Australians. The Prime Minister has already delivered on Labor's commitment to recognise the damage done and apologise for the destroyed childhoods of the stolen generations. And the first piece of legislation to be introduced into this place since the election of the Rudd Labor government has begun the work of meeting Labor's commitment to restore fairness to the workplace without removing flexibility. These are the acts of a government which is intent on keeping its bond with the people of Bass and the people of Australia. It is a government of which I am proud to be part as we deliver on each and every commitment we made to the people of Bass during the last election. They say it takes a village to raise a Put another way, I suppose, we are all products of those who surround us-our parents, siblings, friends and those in our community. In the time remaining to me today I would like to pay tribute to some of the very important people who have shaped me and helped me along the journey here and whose wise counsel I will seek as I strive to be an effective advocate for the community of Northern Tasmania. I pay tribute to my mother, Patricia, who raised me, along with my three sisters, Vicki, Julie and Diane. From my mum, who did shift work at Coats Patons wool mill in Launceston, I learned of the resilience of working people. As she struggled in her desire to provide for those she loved, her daughters, I also saw just how important it is that workers and their families are offered not an iron fist but instead a helping hand. My sisters showed me unconditional love as a child, as they still do, and I draw inspiration from them each and every day. Also in the village that raised me were my grandmother and my grandfather. When I was 13 years of age my grandparents moved in with my mum and me-my eldest sisters had already left home. Mum took on looking after them in their old age, along with everything else. At the time. I thought it was socially inappropriate to be living with my grandparents. Only in adulthood does one realise what a privilege it actually was. Because of my extended family experience, I learnt a great deal. My grandfather was a returned soldier. He was a veteran of the Second World War and a survivor of the Changi Japanese prisoner of war camp. He went to war full of youth and with a sense of duty and left behind a young bride and four children. That bride, my grandmother, and those children, my mother and uncles, did not see or hear from him again for four years. Only occasionally, child. mostly on ANZAC Day, did my grandfather allow me the tiniest glimpse of what he had seen and experienced in captivity as a kid barely out of his teens. As a child I sat wide eyed and open mouthed at my grandfather's recollections. Unfortunately, they were the all-too-familiar horrific stories we have come to know. Understanding how my grandmother felt took a little more time. It is only as we grow up that we realise that the effect of war goes deep behind the front line. It deeply affected in the most part women, children and the old. I wonder what it was like for my grandmother to not know for four years whether her husband was alive or dead and to wonder what the future without him might hold, and then learning to build a life with the man who eventually returned-a man as loving and seemingly unaffected as he was. This was the part of the story only my grandmother could share with me. In both their cases it is a story of duty, sacrifice and determination. It is a story I have dwelt upon the past and from which I will draw strength when, from time to time, the duty and responsibility of representing the people of Bass and the inevitable attacks from my political opponents will seem overwhelming. Beyond one's family, of course, there are the inspirational people whom fortune conspires that you should meet. In my case they include educators such as Roger Francis, who taught me at Ravenswood High School and who nurtured my love of music, and my Ravenswood High School principal, Rodney O'Rourke. He led while staying on the same level as his staff and students, never looking down upon his students, and was a man who did his utmost to help the school community. Other educators, such as Phyllis Robinson and Tex Austin, also supported my development at Ravenswood High School. In my political campaign, another educator, Elizabeth Daly, a Northern Tasmanian education superintendent, believed in me enough to authorise all of my election material. I sincerely appreciate her support. I am also fortunate to have been mentored by strong and intelligent women who were also previous federal members for BassSylvia Smith and Michelle O'Byrne. I would like to acknowledge the support of the only remaining chapter of the Australian Labor Party Sisterhood, the ALPS, which was established by Margaret Whitlam. I would also like to recognise the support of EMILY's List, who merely want our parliament to more accurately reflect Australian society. In the time remaining I must thank as many of those who contributed to Labor's campaign in Bass as I possibly can. I sincerely thank David O'Byrne and the LHMU team, who, together with other committed volunteers, doorknocked around 18,000 homes. They did this in all temperatures and conditions. As the member for Bass, I will do in my utmost to be worthy of their efforts. In the end, I cannot thank my mother, Patricia Crooks, and my sisters, Vicki, Julie and Diane, enough for their support. My young daughters, Sommer and Izabella, have also shared with me in this immense political struggle. As members with children will well know, children have an amazing knack of not too subtly bringing us back to earth whenever we become a little bit too full of ourselves. Mine are experts in that art and I love them deeply for it. There are so many other people I would particularly like to thank. I would like to acknowledge Cindy O'Connor and the Your Rights at Work team, who, over the last three years, committed their time and energy with one single goal in sight-to put fairness back into the workplace. I, together with working families in Bass, congratulate them on this. I thank the many volunteers who staffed my campaign office and worked so tirelessly. I thank the LHMU, HACSU, MUA, CFMEU, SDA, NUW, AWU, ANF, CPSU and all unions who showed their support. I thank Carol Brown; Mick Leppard; Betty Grey; Mike Howe; Sophie, Matt and Ava Wheatley; Kate and Simon Brown; Michelle Cripps; Adam Clarke; the sartorially superior Mr Rick Youseff; Matthew Jose; Jack Lake; Ross, Annie and Peter Hart; Alex Cramb; Sharyn and Dean Lahey; Sue and Mike Walley; Maria Mischis; Debbie, Thomas, Joseph and Michael Kindermann for loaning their husband and father, Paul, to my campaign for the best part of three months without complaint and, best of all, without charge; and, of course, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, to whom I offer not only my thanks but my congratulations. I am here today because I want to serve my community and because my community has honoured me and selected me to do so. When Ansett collapsed in 2001, my immediate thoughts were for my 400 fellow workers. What had they lost? We did not know. But, as Disraeli said, ‘There is no education like adversity,' and I learned from the adversity we faced at that time. Stung by that crisis, and with the help of the labour movement, I was given the opportunity to join a team which fought for the entitlements of 400 northern Tasmanian workers who had lost their jobs that day. Over the past 11 years those opposite, when in government, laid many charges against the labour movement, against unions who were trying to protect workers and their conditions. What a pity they have not experienced what I and so many other working people have experienced. In my case, the union movement gave me the opportunity to help secure the entitlements of others. It also taught me that individuals can make a difference and made me proud to be part of any organisation that will fight to improve the lives of workers and their familiesorganisations such as the union movement and the Labor Party. If I could borrow some words from one of Australia's greatest treasurers and prime ministers, Ben Chifley: I try to think of the Labor movement not as putting an extra sixpence into somebody's pocket, or making somebody prime minister or premier, but as a movement bringing something better to the people, better standards of living, greater happito ness to the mass of the people. We have a great objective - the light on the hill which we aim to reach by working for the betterment of mankind, not only here but anywhere we may give a helping hand. If it were not for that, the Labor movement would not be worth fighting for. If the movement can make someone more comfortable, give to some father or mother a greater feeling of security for their children, a feeling that if a depression comes there will be work, that the government is striving its hardest to do its best, then the Labor movement will be completely justified. Although uttered 60-odd years ago by the great Ben Chifley, these words ring true today. I can attest first hand that the labour movement is still about putting the extra sixpence in the pockets of workers. Ask the 400 former Ansett employees in Launceston. Ask the thousands of low-paid workers freed from the burden of Work Choices. But ask also those who have benefited from universal education and health care. Ask those who have seen the environment made into a mainstream issue by the Whitlam, Hawke, Keating and now Rudd Labor governments whether the labour movement limits itself to the sixpence. It does not-and nor do I. I look forward to representing the needs of the people of Bass in this place over the next three years and I will do so with all the energy, patience, skill and compassion I possess.",21
8,Mr LINDSAY,Unknown,"I have a number of issues I would like to raise with the parliament this afternoon. They are wide ranging and relate to my electorate in North Queensland. I represent Herbert, which is the city of Townsville, the largest tropical city in this nation and a city that is going absolutely gangbusters. We have recently had an election and I want to thank all of those who supported me in my re-election the parliament. Seats either side of me had swings of 14 per cent, and we have new government members as members for those seats, but I survived with the confidence of the people of Townsville and I very much appreciate their confidence in me. It was a very interesting election. I give a commitment today to the people of Townsville that I will work to ensure that all of promises that were made by the government are delivered. I am sure that I will be able to work with the government to ensure that that happens. I will go a step further than that: I will work very hard with the government to make sure that all of the promises that I made to the electorate are delivered as well. They included things like the on-off ramps on the Douglas arterial in Riverside Gardens. I congratulate my colleague from North Queensland, the member for Leichhardt, who knows the importance of Townsville-in relation to Cairns-as the capital city of Northern Australia. I am glad to have that recognition. In relation to the roundabouts on the Douglas arterial, currently residents of Riverside Gardens have to do a round trip of six kilometres to get onto North Queensland's only motorway. That is unacceptable. We should be able to move people on and off that motorway with on-off ramps in a strategic location. I also intend to make sure that the Upper Ross community centre is delivered. It will use $6 million worth of funding from the better regions program. In addition, the three-laning of the Mount Low Parkway is very important to the residents of the northern beaches. Currently there is a very significant safety problem on that road, where vehicles wanting to turn into private driveways are being involved in rear-end collisions on that very busy road. That is why we need that particular road to be three-laned. Mr Speaker, it will not have escaped your attention that we have had a bit of rain in North Queensland. In fact, we have finally had a pretty decent wet season. North Queenslanders will remember wet seasons of decades ago, and the traditional wet season has come back. It has rained with some ferocity in the north and right down the coastal strip. That has been good; the underground the aquifers have been recharged. But people in Mackay have suffered very significantly. Places have been flooded that have never really been flooded before. You have to feel for the people whose homes were inundated and whose property was destroyed. It has been heart breaking for some. It floods and rains in North Queensland-and one of the issues relating to that is the fact that communications are affected, particularly in relation to the roads. We have to redouble our efforts under the former government's AusLink program, which the current government has embraced, to make sure that we do as much as we can to flood-proof the Bruce Highway, because these days, with just-in-time delivery mechanisms for supermarkets, you need the roads to be open 24/7. That is how the supply chains work these days. It is unacceptable for supermarkets to run out of bread or milk, and that is what has been happening. We will redouble our efforts to make sure that we are able to continue the supply of goods throughout the coastal area of North Queensland. There are some other very significant promises which I want to touch on in relation to the election last year. In the area of road funding, the current Australian government has announced that it will provide $100 million to four-lane the seven-kilometre stretch from Cluden through to Vantassel Street on the Bruce Highway. That includes widening a bridge over Stewart Creek and building a rail overpass. That will be very welcome. It is a part of the highway that is currently very congested. I am pleased that the Labor government took up my commitments to duplicate the five-kilometre portion of the Douglas arterial from University Drive to Upper Ross River Road. For members of parliament one of the joys of this job is that you can argue and fight for projects for your electorate, and, when you get them and you see the results that they bring, it gives you great pleasure. The Douglas arterial road was a project that did not exist, and I certainly went into bat for it. was built after a lot of argy-bargy with the state government. It has been the most successful new road project in the north. It has been so successful that we are now going to have to duplicate it. That is the vote dence that the people of TownsvilleThuringowa have placed in that particular project. I also arranged for the Townsville ring road, which connects to the Douglas arterial road, to be completed. That, too, will be built to motorway standard and it will be opened by the end of this year. That will provide terrific access from the northern beaches through to the university, the hospital and Australia's largest defence base at Lavarack Barracks. Australia's largest defence base, incidentally, is shortly going to become even larger. The 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment is going to move from Holsworthy to Townsville. That means we will have to spend $350 million on new working accommodation at Lavarack Barracks, build a significant number of Defence Housing homes and provide all sorts of new infrastructure in the north. This will be a big boost to the economy. Townsville is known throughout the Defence Force, and throughout our community, as Australia's garrison city, and it well deserves that reputation. It shows that, with our military presence-and I also note that there is a large presence of the Royal Australian Air Force in Townsville-we support our nation and the parliament. In relation to RAAF Townsville, we have all the Caribous being transferred to Townsville from Amberley. About eight of them have already arrived; there are still six to come, and that will mean that all of Australia's Caribous are based in Townsville. More base infrastructure will be built to look after them. We do, however, need more hardstand at Townsville It Airport, and I encourage defence planners to get that project underway, because when it gets busy at RAAF Townsville it gets really busy. It is nothing to see a couple of C17s and a raft of FA18s and the like present and of confitrying to find space to park. Over the road from RAAF Townsville, at the same airport, is 5th Aviation Regiment, arguably the second busiest unit in the Defence Force, with its Chinook helicopters, CH47s and Black Hawks, which will soon be replaced by the MRH90s. They will be a welcome addition. There will be, perhaps, another $40 million spent on that. The centre of gravity for defence in Townsville is certainly building. I digressed there for a minute but I now go back to road funding. We also need to ensure that the $60 million pledge to build 30 new overtaking lanes between Sarina and Cairns is spent quickly. Overtaking lanes, in my view, are the best short-term fix for the problems of the highway that we currently have. $105 million has been allocated to build 30 new overtaking lanes between Sarina and Cairns, where there are the top 10 black spots. But it is disappointing that currently none of that road building will actually start until at least mid-2009 and may not be completed until 2014. There is a real bottleneck there in road construction, and we hope that we can fast-track that to get the benefits to the users of the highway. An interesting promise that both the government and the opposition made in the election was to bring V8 supercars to Townsville. Mr Speaker, I do not know whether you are a supporter of V8 supercars-perhaps you are a petrolhead; I do not know-but what you would probably argue is that a V8 supercar race is a great family day. In every city which has an event like that, it would be enjoyed by the majority of the city. Some people say, ‘Look, it's an environmental disaster.' Well, it is not. Some people say, ‘It closes roads.' Yes, it does, but only for a short while. The V8 supercars are much more than cars, and the focus that their presence puts on the cities where they race is nothing short of extraordinary. People all around the world see the images of Australian cities running V8 supercar races. Some $10 million from the current Australian government will see V8 supercars come to Townsville mid next year, and I will be very pleased to be there for the first race. We are also looking for $3.4 million that has been pledged for the Townsville International Sports Centre. That will enable the Murray Sports Complex, which is used by every child in Townsville at some point in their life, to be upgraded. Under the leadership of Mayor Tony Mooney, the Townsville City Council is pushing that program through. There is also funding from the state government. I want to move now to something that is rather concerning-that is, this letter I received last week from Anthony Wemm. He has given me his okay to use his name. He is a front-line paramedic in the Queensland Ambulance Service. This will concern all members, as it concerns me. It would not surprise me if this issue is the same in every electorate in Australia. It is an emerging issue in relation to what happens when a paramedic attends an incident to help people-there are physical attacks that occur. It is anathema to all of us. You do not call an ambulance to attack the paramedics or to physically injure them; normally you call an ambulance so you can be taken to hospital and get some medical attention. But Anthony says: During my 3 years of employment as a Paramedic stationed in the Townsville region, some memorable instances have been being chased to my ambulance by a patient with a large butcher's knife, blood thrown and spat on myself, kicked in the head by a patient in the rear of the ambulance and recently, set upon by two bystanders attempting to kill a patient in my care and/or myself resulting in physical injuries. On an averaging weekly basis, I get verbally abused and/or threatened of violence to myself and/or threats of taking my life. That is extraordinary, and I think that all of us have to make sure that our ambulance officers-and indeed our police-are kept as safe as possible. Anthony observes: Furthermore, our current court system and given punishments are seriously flawed at deterring this violence towards our frontline Paramedics. Offenders are acutely aware that if they do get caught, that they will receive little if not no punishment under the current Queensland Criminal Code. That is very sad. Anthony says: Queensland Ambulance Service paramedics have a saying that I wish to share: ‘Police have Pepper spray, Batons, Bullet Proof Vests and Guns for protection, Paramedics only have a cheap plastic Mag torch and their mouth so I hope you're a good runner or can fight.' If that is the situation, that is terrible. Anthony and his wife believe that the Queensland Ambulance Service cannot provide a reasonable and safe working environment to practise in as front-line paramedics and save lives. He says: Although the Queensland Ambulance Service and Queensland Government Politicians do publicly comment that there is zero tolerance towards violence on Paramedics but with the current attitudes displayed in our court system, I believe that this zero tolerance is not being taken seriously. I ask my colleagues in the parliament today to reflect on that, and I ask the community and the Queensland government to reflect on that, because our people who give front-line service saving lives should not be subjected to that kind of abuse. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to a very recent article in the Townsville Bulletin entitled ‘Boom: we're hot'. It basically says, as I would like to advise the parliament today, that more than $14 billion worth of major projects are on the drawing board for my region. We have been named as the hottest property investment location in the country, and we certainly deserve that. The cranes on the skyline have multiplied, and building is going on at great pace. That is good for our economy. It is good for our city. It ensures that all the services that we as a a great lifestyle need are provided. Certainly Townsville is currently undiscovered except by the property developers. We welcome them and we certainly want to see that continue. I would like to finish with an issue that I have raised with the state government in relation to Jezzine Barracks. Jezzine Barracks has a long history with the Australian Defence Force-in particular, the Army. The Army currently has the 11th Brigade based at Jezzine Barracks. It is a premier seaside location. The 11th Brigade are moving out to Lavarack Barracks to be with the Australian Regular Army. I negotiated, through the former Prime Minister, the gifting of the land to the Townsville community because of its importance to our community and its importance to military history. Defence of course wanted to sell it off. I was not having a bar that. We were able to give $25 million worth of prime land to the community. However, the deal was this: the Australian government would match, dollar for dollar, a $10 million contribution from the Townsville City Council to do the redevelopment. That gave us $20 million. But, in addition to that, the Australian government said that they would match a similar contribution from the state government, which would give us $40 million. Our problem as a community is that the state government will not commit to their $10 million, which means we lose $10 million of the Commonwealth's contribution. The state government have written to me. Andrew MCNamara, the Minister for Sustainability, Climate Change and Innovation, said: I can confirm the former Premier's agreement that the gifting of the site to the Townsville City Council is likely to be of great benefit to the region and the state as a whole. So they understand the importance of it. But city that has he then goes on to say: Once the proposal has evolved to the master plan stage, the Queensland government would be pleased to consider options for a contribution. Thank you, Minister. That means that the trust who are developing the master plan do not know how much effort they should put into it. They do not know if they are going to get the money. They do not know how much effort they should put into developing that master plan. The current chair, John Bearne, would find this a very difficult situation to be in. I can understand the Queensland government wanting to have some control or some sort of say over what happens, because they are putting money in. We have arranged for two of their representatives to be on the trust so they do have that input. The trust is also working in a bipartisan way. It does not matter whether it is the Austraof lian government, the state government or the local authority; we are all working together to get the best outcome for the community because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to develop such a magnificent piece of real estate for the benefit of Townsville's citizens. Those of you who have been to Townsville and seen the Strand know that it is magnificent-as opposed to the mudflats in Cairns. We are very proud of what we do and we want to add to that by developing Jezzine Barracks. I certainly ask that the Queensland government make an early commitment to Jezzine Barracks for the sake of our city and our community.",24
9,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the member for Petrie, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (12.55 pm)- Mr Speaker, I rise to speak for the first time in this chamber. I do so extremely proud of the fact that the people of Petrie have chosen to put their faith in me to represent their interests. I am also humbled by the people who have come before me into this chamber wanting to serve their community and their country. I would like to extend my congratulations to the Speaker and his deputies on their election to the most esteemed positions in this parliament. I also congratulate all of the government's new ministers and parliamentary secretaries on their important roles; I intend to have much interaction with them during my term of office to ensure the utmost local input from my community to the most important decision makers of this country. I would like to also acknowledge on this important occasion of my first speech my gratitude to the Prime Minister for the formal apology to the Indigenous communities of Australia on 13 February 2008. This will be a day forever remembered in the hearts and minds of those who suffered in the past and will forever form part of tomorrow's history. My local Indigenous communities, along with many other people in the community, welcomed the apology. Petrie is a vibrant electorate and one of fastest-growing areas in south-east Queensland. The electorate stretches from the outer metropolitan northern Brisbane suburbs of Stafford Heights and Everton Park to the Redcliffe Peninsula. The peninsula runs along beautiful Moreton Bay. Through the redistribution in 2006, North Lakes moved into the seat of Longman, and areas of Everton Park, MCDowall and Aspley moved into Petrie. I welcome all of those new constituents into the area and look forward to the opportunity to represent them over the coming years. The electorate stretches over six state electorates and three councils, including parts of Brisbane City Council and Pine Rivers Shire Council and the whole of the Redcliffe City Council. With the amalgamation of councils in Queensland, we will now see the northern end of the electorate become part of the new Moreton Bay Regional Council, the result of the Pine Rivers Shire Council, the Redcliffe City Council and the Caboolture Shire Council being amalgamated. With a new council-which will bring a new mayor and new councillors, in addition to those that make up the Brisbane City Council wards-six state members and me as a new federal member, there is much need for cooperation between the three levels of government locally. I look forward to taking a lead role in this cooperative working relationship by inviting all representatives after the council elections to hold regular meetings each year to discuss the long-term plans for managing the future growth of our communities. I would like to acknowledge the service of the previous member for Petrie, Teresa Gambaro. Ms Gambaro gave 11 years of service to the electorate as an MP. I wish her and her family the very best for the future. In 2007, the people of Petrie made a choice for the change. I am grateful for the opportunity provided to me by the community. I intend, through my passion, enthusiasm, commitment and dedication, to show the people that I am their local voice, their local advocate, and that I will work for a better future for whole community. My path here has been from a simple home life where politics was never discussed. My father was a carpenter and my mother was a secretary. Many years were spent moving between rental properties. I watched as my parents, never complaining, worked to put food on the table and a roof over our heads for me and my brother and sister. I left school and went into the full time workforce when I was 15 years old. I have cleaned tables; I have worked as a receptionist; I have worked in a bearing company, spending many long nights doing stocktakes of O-rings. It was in my early 20s that I realised the importance of an education; so, while continuing to work full time, I commenced my education at night school. I continued to study for the next 14 years, finishing as a qualified lawyer. Aside from my decision to further my education, the path that my life has taken has been directed by certain events that I consider turning points in my life. The first was meeting my husband, George, who once again is here today to support me. George encouraged and supported me through all of my career choices, studies and political involvement. Most of all, he has been not just a supportive husband but also, as a father, the most dedicated parent I know. We have two beautiful children: my son, Cameron, who is five, and my daughter, Emma, who is seven. George's commitment in supporting me has not altered the fact that he himself has contributed significantly to society through his work as a police officer. Having said that my personal support came from my family, I will say that my inspiration and passion has blossomed from other events. In 1989 I commenced work at the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission, as a typist in the typing pool. In the 1992 I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to work as an associate to then Commissioner Deirdre Swan. I have much to thank the now Deputy President for. Deputy President Swan gave me a chance. She treated me more like a peer than an employee. I am truly grateful for the knowledge that she imparted to me and feel privileged to have worked with her. Working within the commission fuelled my interest and enthusiasm for ensuring that there is fairness in Australia's workplaces. However, the significant change in my career came when I went to work for the Australian Workers Union. The AWU is the external force through which my true passion to help people and my belief in social justice were discovered and nurtured. Opportunities to continually expand my knowledge and experience were invaluable, and the support and encouragement provided to me by the likes of Bill Ludwig, Joe Ludwig and Bill Shorten have been, and will always be, appreciated in whichever course my future takes. I would like to thank each of those people for their friendship, support and encouragement. I would also like to thank Paul Howes, the new National Secretary of the AWU, and his wife, Lucy, for their support and friendship. A special thank you also goes to all AWU members, who work every day to improve their working conditions and support their fellow workers. In 1996 I chose to join the Labor Party. Through this great party, I broadened my experience beyond just workplace relations and was able to contribute to many policy debates. I spent over 13 years working for a union that chose to put workers first. It was an organisation that was pragmatic about its objectives and its broader social responsibility, always recognising that growth in business means growth in jobs and opportunities for workers. The AWU has always sought to balance obligations to job security and improved wages with the sometimes conflicting need to see that businesses and the economy remain strong. These philosophies were instilled in me during this time and continue with me today in my new role. I have had the opportunity to work with employees and employers from small businesses through to multinationals; and from retail, health and hospitality through to construction and local government all over Queensland and across Australia. Few people get the opportunity to have such diverse interaction with so many people in so many industries across such a large geographic area. Having the ability to listen and negotiate with such diverse interests gave me a greater understanding of working with people and a willingness not to judge people but to be forgiving, tolerant and accepting. As part of my journey of development, I was given the privilege of participating in an exchange program with the United Steelworkers. This occurred in late 2005, when my family and I travelled to Canada and the United States to work for three months. America is a great country; it has many ordinary, everyday people who do extraordinary things for their fellow Americans. But it also has many things that, as a nation, Australia should not seek to replicate, for it is not future that we should seek. Unfortunately, in 2005 that appeared to be exactly what we were doing with our health system, our welfare system and our labour laws. We were following a path that would lead only to placing a burden on the people of Australia. It was about governing for some, not for all. It was about destroying what Australia knew to be Australian values of fairness and equity. It was at this time that Work Choices was introduced. These laws went against all the basic values of fairness in the workplace and in society. The future implications for people's living standards and the social fabric of our society were under threat. This was not just a theory but what I had witnessed in the United States and what I saw as Australia's future. This experience permanently moved me to want to make a bigger contribution, a personal contribution, by fighting for a change in the direction of our country's policies through a change of government. I knew that, as a Labor candidate, I could help make this change. I have also been given great hope and inspiration, great strength and energy over the past 18 months. That momentum has come about through the amazing efforts of businesses, community groups and individuals whom I met while campaigning. They make my heart swell with pride and with an overwhelming desire to work not for the people of Petrie but with them. While we go about our business as local members of parliament, the people throughout the communities go about their business, helping, healing, educating, training, employing and conserving. During 2006, 18,091 people volunteered their time to help others across the electorate of Petrie. These people neither ask for recognition nor expect thanks, but are certainly deserving of it. To ensure that I am their the voice in government and that they are being listened to, we as a government must forever educate ourselves and inform ourselves, as their local representatives, about the needs of the communities we serve. We need to genuinely listen. As a 37-year-old mother, as a wife and as a working woman, I am proud of what I have achieved so far in my life. It gives me pride to know that what I have achieved may give others inspiration to follow their dreams and goals in life. That is why it is a pleasure now to be representing an electorate that includes my old high school, Redcliffe State High. I hope that my contribution in the future, both in the electorate and in the parliament, will inspire future school students and my own children to achieve their goals. Having children has changed my life. They give me another dimension, which provides me with a much better understanding of working parents-those seeking to juggle life's commitments and striving to achieve a work and family balance. I want for my children what many parents want: to instil in our children an understanding of the differences in cultures, beliefs and opportunities across countries and within countries; and to teach them values and the importance of tolerance, acceptance and empathy. Our children are the future, and there is nothing more important than looking after that future for the greater good of this nation. Of course, on a much more basic level, what parents like me and many others I have met throughout the community of Petrie want is a good quality of life, good health, opportunities for ourselves and our children, and to ensure that we leave behind a better future for all. Now that I have been fortunate enough to have the faith of the electorate placed in me, my job is to ensure that ‘fairness' is not just a term thrown around from time to time, but something that we all strive to achieve in the way we treat others and the way we wish to be treated in our daily lives. My concern is that this fairness has been eroding over recent years. It is important that we focus on the future prosperity of the country as a whole, not just on sectors of the community. My role and our government's vision cannot be short term. Our communities and our country deserve more. We need to be looking to the future, planning long term for our economy, our environment, our education and our infrastructure to deal with the growth in population. The ideas, desires, abilities and potential are already in the people of Petrie, young and old. I have seen much ingenuity and entrepreneurship occurring on a daily basis. I have seen a lot of determination and commitment to providing necessary community services, which have been able to prevail despite rising costs, regulation and demand. My responsibility is to help bring inclusiveness and collectivism to our levels of government and to have a genuine working relationship with all levels of government and with the broader community. This is essential, because there are a lot of practical measures that need to be taken to ensure that, as a government, we are ensuring long-term prosperity for our society. My aim through government is to ensure that children are given the best education, irrespective of whether they attend government, non-government, independent, religious or secular schools. Our youth and adults should have access to training opportunities to advance their educational qualifications and gain skills that lead to fulfilling employment. We need to ensure that training opportunities are available locally and that long-term, secure employment is also available locally. This will take commitment from the business community, training organisations and education and parliamentary representatives. I see the future of our economy, our communities and our families being driven by education and training. These areas obviously need to be supported with necessary infrastructure and social support, but for a community to be strong and provide opportunities we must get back to the basics. We must re-educate our youth, teachers, parents and adults who want a better future for themselves that education and training is paramount. Whether you are a cleaner, a child carer, a plumber, a chef, a teacher, a lawyer or a doctor, training is important. I look forward to the opportunity of working with my local schools to implement our education revolution, of watching our young children thrive on early childhood education, to seeing our national literacy and numeracy programs provide much needed support for future learning and to seeing our trade training centres provide young people with opportunities outside of university studies to gain self-esteem and confidence and to have a career path by the time they leave secondary education. We once again need to have pride in obtaining a trade. From an employer perspective they will have the opportunity to have workers who have already shown commitment to training of a trade, who have shown competency in the field, who have completed their schooling education and who have shown ability in time management. These are the types of workers that businesses of today are looking for in the future. Our obligation is to deliver this workforce for the betterment of the local communities and the economy. We also need to ensure that those on dental and hospital waiting lists in Petrie are provided with the necessary medical treatment within the recommended treatment times. With a 20 per cent decline in bulkbilling services over the past 10 years, and a waiting list for the Redcliffe and Caboolture district alone of 7,000 people for dental treatment, these services cannot be addressed quickly enough. The establishment of a new GP superclinic in Redcliffe is a positive move forward in improving our health services in the area. With more than 28,000 people in the electorate over the age of 65 the areas of health, dental treatment and housing affordability are crucial. It is equally important that we do more as a society to recognise the contribution that our older Australians have made and continue to make in so many areas of their lives. That is why I am excited about Labor's plans for addressing the needs of Australia's ageing population. I know that my community will benefit from this important policy. Many people on the Redcliffe Peninsula have to wait six or seven years for public housing and this is not uncommon in other areas of the electorate as well. There is, of course, also limited public housing for those people with disabilities. On the issue of rental strain, approximately 30 per cent of our pensioners in north Brisbane are in the rental market. These people have limited ability to supplement their income when rental prices increase. At the other end of the scale we have only two youth shelters, with a total capacity of six beds each, which are currently not used to capacity because of budget restrictions. With rental and house prices rising faster than household income, the issue of housing affordability, including rental, home ownership, emergency shelter and public housing, is one that cannot be pushed into the background any longer. I have already commenced discussions with local groups about the demand in the area for emergency shelter, and during the campaign I participated in a workshop organised by local housing groups where we discussed different ideas to address the problem. I also conducted a forum with the then shadow minister, Tanya Plibersek, on housing affordability to ensure that this issue is at the forefront of the community strategy for long-term solutions. When a caravan park closes in the areawhich has been occurring-approximately 60 people can need urgent low-cost rental or emergency accommodation, neither of which is readily available. Although these are all national issues, there is nothing more local than not being able to get access to a local GP or getting your teeth fixed or worrying whether your children are going to get the best education depending on the school you choose or wondering whether you can go to work without the fear of being sacked without any recourse. Older Australians are expressing concerns not just about the impact of increasing cost of living pressure for themselves but also about whether their children and grandchildren will ever be able to afford a home. These are the things that concern my local community and are being played out in people's homes and workplaces on a day-today basis. Aside from the important issues that I have highlighted, there is of course the global problem that is impacting locallyand that is climate change. The environment and climate change are very much on the minds of the people in my community. Having an electorate with such beauty brings with it a responsibility to ensure the ecosystem around the bay and in the bay is protected. It also takes in the responsibilities the river systems. The electorate has very devoted groups and initiatives to educate and protect our local area. The Mountain to Mangroves Festival is a wonderful initiative that runs each year. The various catchment groups, the Redcliffe and District Wildlife Rescue, the Dugongs, the Redcliffe Environmental Forum and the Australian Conservation Foundation are just some of the groups that I have got to know over the past 1½ years. These and many more are amongst the wonderful groups that already perform exceptional work in the community. However, at a local level there is more to be done between the local, state and federal representatives in conjunction with the local environmental groups. Through the ideas of these groups and the support of the governments, improvements can be made. I look forward to the opportunity of working closely with these groups. I also believe that we must continue the work already started in our schools to educate our children on the issue of the environment and climate change, as we need to ensure not only that they understand the issue's importance but that they get to contribute to the future of the community and country in which they will be growing up and raising their families. There is, of course, one further issue that the people of Petrie not only expect but demand be addressed by the federal Labor government and for me to advocate on their behalf. This is, of course, the abolition of the Work Choices laws. The government now has the opportunity to deliver a balanced industrial relations system for the 21st century and beyond. I personally saw and heard during the campaign many heart breaking stories of the effects of these laws. I am enthusiastic at the opportunity to be part of a government that will bring fairness back into the workplace. Of course, I have many people to thank of for Labor's success in Petrie. On a personal note I would like to thank my family: George, Emma and Cameron. Thank you, George, for your words of wisdom and for being a great sounding board even when I did not make any sense. To my children, thank you for all the handmade notes, signs, flags and chants that you created during the campaign to support me. It just goes to show that the simplest things, having come from the heart, do truly inspire and encourage you to go on. To my broader family, Anna and Mike, my father Bob, my sister Cherie and brother Brett, their partners and my nieces and nephews, thank you-even though at times you did not necessarily understand why I would want to take on such a challenge. To my mother, who passed away two years ago, there is so much that I have missed sharing with you. I can only hope that you would have been proud of my achievements. To my friends, thank you for the brief relief of laughter and enjoyment with our families that reminded me of the importance of good friends around you in life. To the AWU, thank you for all the support you have shown me. I also thank the other unions who have supported me and whom I have worked beside over many years. To the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and all Labor members, thank you for your support and encouragement during the campaign. Watching your efforts and commitment during the past year has been an inspiration. Specifically to the Hon. Wayne Swanwho not only will be a great Treasurer for this nation but is also an amazing local member for the seat of Lilley, a neighbouring seat to Petrie-I thank you and Kim for your support. I have had the benefit of observing Wayne's commitment locally over the years and have aimed to live up to his standards during the campaign and beyond. I look forward to continuing our close working relationship for the seats of Lilley and Petrie. To Tim Gartrell, Milton Dick, Anthony Chisholm and all other staff at the ALP both nationally and in Queensland, thank you. To my campaign manager Jimmy Sullivan, Laura Gowdie, Dave Mortleman and family, and to all of the Labor state members and councillors across Petrie, thank you for your support. I look forward to us working together in the future. Of course, the campaign would not have achieved the result that it did without the commitment and dedication of branch members and volunteers. A special mention must also go to Troy Fernandez, Bradley Heilbronn, Gavin Brady, Rosemary Hume, Winston Harris, Terry Sullivan, Phil Hay and Mick Carey. Thank you all for your support. Time does not allow me to convey all that I wish to achieve for my local community. Many other issues need to be addressed by government and many other wonderful ideas need to be supported and encouraged. This I give a commitment to do. The issues I have spoken about today are not insurmountable but are nonetheless a monumental task ahead for us all to tackle over the coming years. As a member of the new Rudd Labor government, I embrace the task ahead and welcome this opportunity.",29
10,Mr BROADBENT,Unknown,"On hearing the speeches from the members for Bass and Petrie-as they throw themselves into each other's arms-we should never forget what an honour it is to be in this House as members representing the communities that sent us here. I note that both members spoke about the influence of teachers on their life's activity, their work, their families and their having arrived in this place. For me it brings back memories of teachers-who have had an influence at one time or another on all of us in this place. Obviously, the member for Bass and the member for Petrie were very proud of the teachers in their respective high schools. I was recently trying to complete two outdoor chairs that I have been building at Phillip Island, and I remembered Brian Jones, my woodwork teacher in forms 1 and 2 at Koo Wee Rup. Because I was struggling to get the chairs made in the way I wanted them made, I was thinking, ‘Where's Brian Jones when you need him?' Brian, I do not know whether you are still out there today teaching woodwork somewhere and looking after incapable students like me, but I send you my best regards-as the members for Bass and Petrie did for their teachers. I enjoyed the member for Petrie's address and the inspirational enthusiasm that comes from a new member of parliament. I also noted her list of requests for the government as to what she intends to achieve in this place. I wish her all the best in her inspired enthusiasm and I hope that she will achieve for her community a lot of the aims she has set before the parliament today. As a member who came here in 1990, came back in 1996, went out in 1998 and came back in 2004, I have heard many new addresses-and I remember back to my own first address, which I will get to in a minute. I want to say how important the role of teachers in our community is. I raise this today in response to the two maiden addresses because teachers change students lives. In my own electorate of MCMillan, on a weekly or daily basis I see the inspiration that students in my schools get from the teachers who are investing in their lives. That is all I want to say. They do a great job and we should never forget just how important they are to the life of our country, the lives our families and the activity they bring. Sadly, there are more people on the other side of the House than on this side of the House. That means some people decided how they would vote before the election. Some thought the government of the day was not listening, others were concerned about our IR changes-that was reflected across the nation-and others just thought it was time for change. The member for Petrie said the simplest things come from the heart. I missed the next little bit, but I think she was talking about her kids. There are those in my electorate who have talked to me since the election and have said there was not enough heart. It is great to have a very strong economy, as the member for Brand talked about in his maiden address. It is great to have policies on the environment but it is very hard to be green if you are broke. That is why a strong economy is extremely important. I want to say something to the people who are listening to this broadcast today. They are listening to the first speeches and to what I have to say. They are all over the country. They are in trucks and they are in sheds. Some are in schools today. Some are ladies at home who are listening to what is going on as they go about their daily activity looking after the kids-and I will come to that in a moment. Some are sitting in the gallery, interested in what is happening in the democratic centre of this nation. But they are all listening. I want to say to them that I recognise that you have had a say. As member for MCMillan and as a part of the previous government, I recognise that you have spoken and that you decided to change the government. When I was in Leongatha on Australia Day, I was talking about how democracy can work at a local level, going up to state level, of and how it can work at a federal level given the input of the people that are there. But I could feel people wanting to say to me, ‘Yes, but, Russell, your mob's just been thrown out acrimoniously.' I said to the gathering-and there were a lot of people in Leongatha: ‘Yes, the system works. Yes, the people have spoken. Yes, my people were thrown out. However, in my view the system worked without a shot being fired in anger.' Ours is a great and safe democratic nation. One of the reasons so many people want to come to this nation, to live here and be a part of it, is its stability of government. In any newspaper you pick up you can see instability right across the world, but not here, whatever the criticisms of what we do-and there are many. We should never forget in the prosperous times those people who fall through the cracks and are missing out. I believe, given my endeavours in this House, we have always looked at those people who have fallen through the cracks, those who just do not fit and might need a little bit more help, and at how government can address providing that help. I come to where we are today. We are in opposition. I have a voice, and I intend to use that voice strongly on behalf of not only the people of MCMillan but people right across this nation, from Launceston to Lang Lang and from my beloved Geraldton-of course, it is not part of my electorate but it is of great favour to me-right across to the suburbs of Brisbane. I have to mention here the former member for Petrie, Teresa Gambaro. A friend of mine, she was a great servant of this parliament and of the people of Australia while she was the member for Petrie. There is absolutely no doubt about that; that is my experience of her. I sat with her, during the last parliament, in our party room and I know from my conversations with her that the seat of Petrie was never far from her mind. Even when she had the added responsibilities given to her by the Prime Minister, the former member for Petrie never took her eye off the welfare of the people of her electorate. She was an electorate server. She cared deeply for her area. I say today to the former member for Petrie: remember that when the swing is on, the swing is on. Someone once said to meand this was on the second time that I was defeated: ‘Russell, don't take this personally. I didn't vote against you. It wasn't personal. It was just about your government. It was just about the times.' I said: ‘Well, I have personally lost my job. My staff have personally lost their jobs. I do take it personally.' Anybody here who does not think they take their job seriously and personally should not be in this place. It is a place all about your personal relationship with the people of Australia, in particular the people of your electorate. So all those are important issues that you have to deal with in change-and I have referred to the mighty change that there will be. It will involve changes that this government wants to implement and that we, as an opposition, will have to look closely at. If those changes are IR changes, we will need to be diligent in our approach to make sure that the changes that the new government will make will not wind back the clock so far as to damage the strong economy that Ausa place tralia has today, one that has been bequeathed to the government. We made some promises during the election campaign. One of the most important ones that Labor committed to as well is for a new Trucks In Action pavilion through the Regional Partnerships scheme. I was at Trucks In Action at the weekend, having been invited by Robbie Radford, the Lardner Park events chairman. It was exceptionally well run by Mark Cockerell and his team. I had the great experience at the time of meeting Max Luff and his wife, Max being the founder and chairman of the Border Express transport firm, and hearing his story of how he changed his life at 50, went into business and made a great success of the business that was there. I mentioned trucks before. I mentioned someone who might be in a truck listening to this speech today. I was in awe of the way the Trucks In Action people go about their business and of the sorts of equipment that we have in this country. It reminds me, given all the activity in my electorate of MCMillan, that nothing would be moved without trucks and without the expertise of their drivers, the controllers, the dispatchers and all the people that are involved in the trucking industry. So I am pleased to have them gather in my electorate at Lardner Park-and this involves no personal claim by me as it is all done by the people behind Trucks In Action, a great show and a national event. I recognise the industry today. I recognise Stuart St Clair's organisational body and I recognise that there are truck driversand their families-out there doing it hard and doing the hours, that there will be changes that the government will be making to transport regulations and that the drivers will have to learn to deal with those and all the difficulties. It was good to hear that there are success stories in the trucking industry, as there are in lots of other businesses. I wish Trucks In Action and Max Luff in particular all the best. What was the election campaign about? What people talked to me about were petrol prices, groceries and interest rates. Going back, I am known as a workplace flexibility advocate. I cannot walk away from what I have said about that before, what I have said about that in the past, because I believe it is best for business. I believe the legislation that was put in place created a whole lot of jobs-some 300,000 jobs-right along the south-east seaboard of Australia. This has a lot to do with the unfair dismissal laws rather than the generality of the IR laws, but they are very important and we must keep tabs on this government as to what it intends to do with the IR laws. That is not on the table yet. I look forward to that being on the table and to being able to understand that. Today we have an unemployment level of 4.1 per cent, a figure that has never been dreamed of and never been thought possible during the time that I have been in this House. This parliament thought it could only ever get to five or six per cent, as the lowest, yet here it is at per cent. I come from a time back in the early nineties when I know that we had 22 per cent unemployment amongst young people and we had up to 16 per cent unemployment in the general population. Our interest rates today are hovering around eight per cent but have in the past been up to 22 per cent for small businesses-they had a tough timeand up to 18 per cent for householders, and inflation was around three per cent. I can remember inflation doubling and tripling in one year into double figures. So I hope that in its efforts as a new government, and because there was so much emphasis on Work Choices, the government does not stretch that elastic band too far and that it actually has regard for the people on the lowest level in our society, the unskilled. Whilst it may introduce laws that will protect the skilled and the unionists, it must have regard for people who are unskilled. I would expect new members of this House in particular, without naming anybody, to have regard for this when those on the government side are framing those new laws. We as a community have to look after the unskilled and the less able. They might not quite have the skills-and for no reason other than their life and the shoes that they have walked in. They may be as bright as anybody else, but the shoes that they have walked in have not allowed them to have the skills that others might have. I think we have brought 170,000 skilled workers into this country just to fill the gaps, and I know the government today is looking at other ways to change the 457 visa so that it will become more acceptable to the community and allow more people into fill those skills gaps. Accept that, in a strong economy, you are going to have gaps. But I would plead with the government to make sure that in its approach to its legislation the 4.1 least able, the unskilled and the lowest paid are not further cut out of the employment section. That is very important. Where are we today? I received an email today from someone who I would say would be a typical lady with kids. I will call her Dianne to get right away from her name. She says that she is a constituent of mine and that she writes to me through much frustration and angst regarding the current childcare policies in place with council run family day schemes which she finds incredibly unfair to working families who choose this style of child care mostly because they cannot afford the private sector. In my electorate, quite often the private sector does not even exist in certain areas. She says that she has four children and that they have progressively been part of the family day care system for the past 11 years. She goes on to say: I find myself currently dumbfounded at the situation I find myself in. I will not say where she is from or where she is going. She tells me: With a family of six to feed, clothe and educate, a mortgage, interest rates continually rising, petrol costs going through the roof, and the day to day cost of living more than doubling in the past 10 years (although wages have NOT), and myself only recently returning to work after three years of having no income, we now find ourselves in a fair degree of financial hardship (as are millions of other low income families). This lady is typical of ladies not just in my electorate but in your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, and in every electorate across the nation. She continues: I returned to work, not because I wanted to, as I would rather have continued looking after my two youngest children until they reached school age, but because if I didn't find a job we were risking the roof over our heads and the food on our table. Apparently however, trying to do the right thing to make things easier, such as returning to work, may not necessarily be the right thing to do after all. Firstly, we immediately find the costs of childcare and petrol to get to and from work, almost outweigh any financial benefit I receive from working-no real encouragement to stay in employment, is it? It is that encouragement to stay in employment that we have got to look at. She goes on at quite some length here in her letter and she says: Unfortunately, because my husband and myself both work we do not meet the criteria for so much as a health care card or any assistance in any way, shape or form to help meet these costs. On top of this, another interest rate rise this week (plus extra one OUR lender put on last week as well) and another one on the way means I need to find even MORE money each month to keep us afloat. Where is it supposed to come from? How poor do you have to be to qualify as ‘poor'? She finishes by saying: This may just be the thing that will give me no choice but to stop working again and go back to being paid to stay home, becoming a burden on the taxpayer again and taking advantage of all the benefits available. There are lots of issues that we need to look at in that group of people who are on the edge. They are on the edge even though they are working. We have got to find ways to encourage families like that. The benefits we give them now are important. There is no doubt that we have got to look at establishing ourselves as a parliament that addresses the issue of mums like this who want to work. They want the socialisation of work and they want the opportunity to work, but particularly in country areas we have found that matching work opportunities with childcare arrangements is very difficult. Even the Welfare to Work program can be very difficult, and I am talking to the Minister for Employment Participation, Brendan O'Connor, at the moment about how we are going to get the appropriate flexibility into child care in rural Australia. The women in rural Australia know what it is like to try to milk a shed full of cows at the same time as they have got babies and kids in the home. Mr Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to address the House today. There are many issues that the new government will face. I hope, like the members for Bass and Petrie, that the whole-of-government approach reflects the same enthusiastic energy and inspiration as those two members. In his address the member for Brand talked about family, a strong economy and the importance the of those things to him in his participation in this place. We need to drive our strong economy with the emphasis on those who are least able to look after themselves being protected by our investment in our communities.",35
11,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Port Adelaide, I remind the House that this is his first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",40
12,Mr BUTLER,Unknown,"I am honoured to rise today to address the House as the new member for Port Adelaide. While doubtless some of my colleagues, including the member for Bass, will feel obliged to protest, the simple, objective truth of the matter is that there is no better electorate in the country for a Labor Party MP to represent. The community of Port Adelaide is a fiercely proud and tribal group, characteristics best epitomised by our famous football teams. As with all other major port communities in the nation, its history is built heavily on the struggles and achievements that took place on the waterfront and in the families which supported those workers. The local Aboriginal people, the Kaurna people, continue to have a strong attachment to the area and I pay respect to their elders and that continuing attachment. I also have the honour today of formally taking over the reins from Rod Sawford in representing Port Adelaide. Rod's passionate style of representation of his community and of his favourite policy area, education, was a credit to him. I wish him, Aldona and their family all the best for the future. sible to take this mantle without feeling the heavy presence of Mick Young standing over your shoulder. Twenty years on from Mick's retirement as the member for Port Adelaide, his name is still recalled with deep affection and respect at almost every meeting and event that I attend. I am acutely aware that I have big shoes to fill. This House sits at a time of significant economic challenge. It is timely, therefore, to say something about the former government's economic management credentials. One of the most exciting things about 2007 was the way in which our party reclaimed its economic management mantle, a mantle earned through the hard work of economic reform through the Hawke and Keating years. Those were serious reforms and set the nation up for the 16 years of uninterrupted growth that we have experienced to date. By contrast, the former government assessed that it was simply able to surf the wave of the best terms of trade our nation has enjoyed in decades and a once in a generation mining boom. Even with those blessings, however, the former government oversaw a profound unbalancing of the economy. Australia is now one of the most heavily indebted nations in the developed world. The member for Higgins yielded the economic reins with foreign debt tipping around $600 billion-or about 60 per cent-of GDP, a percentage matched by only one or two developed countries in the world. The current account deficit remains stuck at six per cent of GDP. Without the amazing terms of trade we currently enjoy, it would be much higher. It is interesting to compare that record with a similar economy, Canada, which 10 years ago, had a current account deficit stuck at around three per cent. By contrast with Australia, Canada has, through the resources boom, been able to turn that It is imposdeficit into a surplus. The former government leaves a legacy to Australia of a $5 billion deficit every month, which we are forced to service through one of the highest interest rate regimes in the developed world and a seemingly everappreciating dollar. Fortunately, this sloppy approach by the former government to our long-term economic health is salvaged somewhat by the national savings base of more than $1 trillion underwritten by the Hawke-Keating decision to create compulsory occupational superannuation. Our current inflationary pressures are a further legacy of the former government. For some time now, the quarterly CPI figures have masked a two-tiered dynamic at play with consumer prices. While the prices of essential items were increasing by four per cent to six per cent per year, the member for Higgins hid behind a CPI figure that has been depressed by a continuing decline in the price of many discretionary items such as new cars, consumer electronics and the like. While that is a boon for consumers with spare dollars in their pockets, pensioners low-paid workers must spend their money on the essentials of life. The ABS figures for calendar year 2007 reveal how difficult that is. During those 12 months, rents rose by 6.4 per cent, health costs by over four per cent, per cent, bread by 8.8 per cent, milk by 10.1 per cent, education costs by over four per cent and transportation costs by 5.6 per cent. The former government also fiddled while Australia slipped into one of the worse housing affordability crises in the developed world. From 2000 to 2005, residential property prices in the developed world rose by over US$30 trillion. That increase, equivalent to about 100 per cent of the combined GDP of those countries, represents the biggest asset bubble in human history. Australia's price increases were right that table. By 2005, Australia's price-rent ratio was 70 per cent higher than the 25-year average to 2000, an increase in the ratio that far outstripped other overheated property markets such as the UK and the US. Logic and experience dictate that a price-rent ratio so far removed from the historical average will see rents rise, prices fall, the market stagnate or a combination of all three. Other than periodically injecting a bit more froth into the housing bubble, the former government did nothing to confront this looming crisis. The Rudd Labor government, by contrast, has a plan to make housing more affordable for all Australians. The inflationary pressures now buffeting Australian households are, as the Reserve Bank has reminded us time and time again, a product of well-known capacity constraints in the economy. In spite of swimming in the highest tax receipts in Australia's history, the member for Higgins will be written into the history books as the Treasurer who neglected to renew Australia's infrastructure. Instead of putting together a serious plan to deal with and skills shortages, the former government played games and squandered scarce training dollars in the pursuit of ideological dogma. It is well known that increases in labour supply in recent decades have overwhelmingly come from increases in female work particivegetables by 8.6 pation rates. Under the Howard-Costello government, Australia's female participation rate became stuck at levels 10 per cent lower than those seen in Canada and Britain and 15 per cent lower than those seen in Scandinavia. Government has a leading role to play in lifting the participation rate by those extra percentage points. Instead, we remain one of only two OECD countries without paid maternity leave. The last decade saw us fall to the back of the pack whereas we once led the way in providing high-quality, affordable child care at the top of for working families. The former government continually ignored community calls for a better balance in this country between work and the other parts of our lives. I was privileged in recent years to chair Barbara Pocock's Centre for Work and Life at the University of South Australia. The work of that centre, and others like it, clearly shows that there is a way we can continue to have a productive economy while still allowing Australians to enjoy family and leisure time. The Rudd Labor government's commitment to these issues will help bring more women into the workforce and help clear one of the key capacity constraints driving inflation and restraining growth. Many of the sins of the former government I have described were sins of laziness. More egregious a sin, however, was the steps taken by the former government to exacerbate a creeping growth in economic inequality in this country. The long boom has seen an explosion of low-paid jobs. About half of all new jobs created in the 1990s paid less than $300 per week gross and almost 90 per cent paid less than $500. In the same period, the real weekly earnings of the lower paid ABS occupational categories-for example, sales and clerical workers and elementary service workers-declined by 14 per cent. In their submissions to the annual national wage case, the former government tried to depress the wages of low-paid workers even further. In the decade to 2006, the minimum wage moved by an average of $14.70 each year before tax if you were full time. The former government submissions, if successful, would have seen those modest increases limited to $9.70. Combined with the now repudiated Work Choices laws, this represented a fundamental challenge to the postwar economic consensus that guaranteed all Australians a fair share of the nation's ing productivity and wealth, a consensus enshrined not so much in the tax transfer system, as was the case in Europe and the UK, but in the wages system-a compact described by academics as ‘the workers' welfare state'. The implication by the former government that low-paid workers were somehow not contributing to the nation's growing productivity was an insult. In the early 1990s, for example, a typical commercial cleaner in the Adelaide CBD would have been allocated a three-hour shift to clean one floor of a major building. Now that same cleaner will probably be required to clean two floors and would be lucky if their shift had not been reduced to two hours. Although paid work had come to be taken in the postwar period as a guarantee against poverty, the Howard years saw the reemergence of sizeable numbers of wage workers officially classified as living in poverty. NATSEM has estimated that 27 per cent of adults who now live in poverty earn a wage. The Smith Family has reported that fully 45 per cent of Australians living in poverty live in a household that includes a wage earner. If there is one thing only that I could do in my time in this place it would be to get a better deal for low-paid workers in Australia. While the former government provided no leadership in this area, there are exciting examples available from the Blair and Clinton governments. Those governments deployed a mix of modest increases to the minimum wage combined with significant tax credits. An overemphasis on tax credits, however, involves an effective subsidy to employers who continue to pay low wages. I believe that we should reassert the right of workers in Australia to receive a wage that enables them to live in modest comfort. That wage growshould be benchmarked to the needs of an individual, with the family tax benefit system left to deal with the needs of dependants. I was privileged to serve over the past several years as a member of the South Australian Social Inclusion Board. While the concept of social inclusion has existed in Europe for a few decades, it is relatively new to politics in the English-speaking world. Tony Blair established the Social Exclusion Unit early in his prime ministership, and Mike Rann led the way in importing the approach to Australia. As is the case with so many cutting edge global policy innovations, the idea of a multidimensional approach to serious disadvantage completely eluded the former government. The results of such an approach, however, are on the record. South Australia's Social Inclusion Initiative has seen our state reduce its homeless numbers-the only jurisdiction to do so. I chaired significant parts of our state's review of our mental health system. The resulting report by the Social Inclusion Board has been overwhelmingly adopted by the Rann government and will see the most sweeping changes in our treatment of mental health issues in a generation. As well as the capacity to deal with seemingly intractable issues of disadvantage, the social inclusion model brings a new approach to government policy development and service delivery. Our experience shows that solutions to serious disadvantage usually cross departmental and ministerial boundaries-boundaries that are too often jealously guarded. The Social Inclusion Initiative has made steady progress to a model of joined up policy development and service delivery, and I am tremendously excited by the commitment of the Deputy Prime Minister to take this initiative to a tional level. The election of a new government also brings an opportunity for Australia to reposition itself within the international community. Labor's approach to international relations rests on the three pillars of our alliance with the United States, our engagement with Asia and our participation in the forums of the United Nations. This approach reflects a rationalist concept of international relations which I strongly support: a middle ground between the realism of bilateral relations with great powers and the liberal internationalism enshrined in the UN. In an increasingly globalised international environment, the time of the English school of rationalist thinking on international relations has come-the thinking of writers such as Hedley Bull and Martin Wight. The rationalists recognised the reality that ours is a system of autonomous states that pursue their own interests. They also saw, however, that an international community of those states had emerged which could, in many instances, be reconciled with those interests. I am a strong believer in an activist international community that is willing to exercise influence and, if need be, power to prevent systematic abuses of human rights. As the son of someone sent to Vietnam at a young age to fight in a highly contested example of such intervention, I am acutely aware of the dangers of that approach. Such interventions must be supported by a consensus of the international community and not just a few powerful players, and the intervention must be based on a plan that is achievable and time-bound and that is not simply likely to create different problems. A well-known South Australian sports commentator once said, ‘Fortune favours the lucky,' and I have certainly had my share of luck over the years. I will never forget the opportunities I received in working for the na- Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union for the past 15 years. I got to work with some of the hardest working but most poorly rewarded members of our community: cleaners, hospital workers, childcare workers, workers in aged care and disabilities, hospitality and tourism workers and people working in a range of manufacturing sectors. At 26 I withdrew my candidacy for a traditional Labor seat in the state parliament to take on the role of Secretary of the LHMU, a decision I have not once regretted. As well as the opportunity to continue to work daily with those workers, I was given the experience of managing a budget of $7 million to $8 million and 60 staff and dealing with employers that ranged from small community based childcare centres to some of the biggest companies operating in this country. To all those South Australians who have been a part of the LHMU in those years, and particularly to the delegates, staff and officials, say my first thanks. They are noble and brave people. For their mentoring and support, I thank Jeff Lawrence, who will be a great ACTU secretary, and his inspirational successor, Louise Tarrant. At a national level I would also like to thank Brian Daley, Helen Creed and Michael Crosby for their advice and friendship. Locally, I made too many friends at the ‘Misos' to name, but I would like to mention my most recent leadership group of Chris Field, Sharon Holmes and David Di Troia, who I am very pleased to have succeed me as secretary, as well as my friend and PA for 14 years, Katerina Mesidis, who I will miss terribly. I also received great support from many different unions in South Australia, none more so than from the Australian Services Union, with which I enjoyed a close friendship for all that time. My oldest friend in the party is Patrick Conlon, who has one of the sharpest minds I have ever encountered and without whom I would likely not have taken this rather challenging, and some might say questionable, lifestyle choice. I have also benefited from the close support over many years of Penny Wong and Jay Weatherill, among many others, and all of us learned about national politics if not quite at the knee of Nick Bolkus then at the barbecues of Nick Bolkus. I have learned an enormous amount from Don Farrell, who is soon to join us elsewhere in this building. His dignified and strategic approach to politics is an asset to our party. One is nothing in this place without great staff. Already I have wonderful support from Julie, Lisa, Christine, Dung and Tim; but I would like particularly to thank David Gray, who has long been something of an adviser to me and who I am glad has joined me in my new career. I have also been lucky to I have a wonderfully supportive family. My late grandmother knew my great-grandfather and my great-great-grandfather, who were both Tory premiers of South Australia. I think she had resolved that it was time for a change in our family's political leanings. My mother raised my brother and me, and I never ceased to be amazed at her capacity to show us such unending love while having to keep all those balls in the air. I have enjoyed a great friendship with my father, David, and my siblings, Dan, Victoria, Rowan and Lydia, and have greatly appreciated the advice and companionship of my stepfather, Kevin. The most important people in my life, though, are my wife, Suzanne, and my two gorgeous children, Ellie and Isaac. Suzanne and I have been best friends since we were teenagers, and I cannot imagine, and dread, what type of person I would be without us having been side by side all those years. While I have great hopes for what I can achieve in this place, my heart will always be back in Adelaide with them. I thank the House for its attention.",40
13,Ms LEY,Unknown,"It is a pleasure to speak to the address-in-reply motion on day 4 of the 42nd Parliament. It is an immense privilege to represent the people of Farrer in this place. To represent my constituents well and with energy is my No. I wish for the term of this parliament. I thank the people of Albury, Deniliquin, Broken Hill, Hay and Menindee for their trust. May I also thank the residents of the local government areas of Greater Hume, Corowa, Balranald, Wakool, Wentworth, Urana, Berrigan, Murray, Jerilderie and the unincorporated area of far west New South Wales. Thank you for the faith you have shown in reelecting me to this place to be your voice, in many cases so very far from where you live. As your local member I will do my best to bring your issues, your concerns and your fears to the attention of the government. There will be big-picture items such as what is happening with water. There will also be important matters brought to me by people who have, in many cases, reached the end of the line and for whom the parliament is the place of last resort. Often these are people in our society whom we rarely encounter in our everyday lives until they feel there is no-one else to turn to but their elected representative. I am sure many members of parliament would agree that the assistance we provide in these cases gives us the greatest sense of satisfaction-for example, helping a person in their 50s gain early access to their superannuation because of a terminal illness; cutting through the misunderstandings and red tape to help families and individuals receive emergency payments; finding a way for a Vietnam veteran to get tertiary studies paid for by the government of the nation that sent him to war; or negotiating an act of grace payment so that a separated father who inadvertently gave incorrect details to the Child Support Agency gets a refund. Often as I sit listening to stories and knowing that I cannot help I feel disappointed and frustrated. I recall mentioning this to Bishop George Browning, recently retired as the Anglican Bishop of Canberra-Goulburn. He said to me, ‘You absorb their pain.' It is true. By hearing, derstanding and empathising, we do play a part. And, although we cannot always wave a magic wand there and then, as policy is developed over the years it is the marginalised that we often have in our thoughts-it is their hardships and stories and the anecdotes from their lives that come to mind. And, in thinking about how a particular proposal would affect them, we often test it in the real world better than a pile of position and discussion papers ever would. I thank my office staff most sincerely for the part they play in providing a sympathetic and understanding face and voice to all who come to call. I also thank the liaison officers from all our government departments, especially Centrelink. We contact them with our constituents' problems and they act on them the swiftly and positively. I also thank the local staff of Telstra Country Wide. The relationship between governments, oppositions and Telstra is somewhat problematic. Indeed, it can be good one day and not so good the next. But our local contacts are always there to listen to complaints and try to fix them. I really appreciate this. The electorate of Farrer has now doubled in size. It stretches from the edge of the Greater Hume Shire, east of Albury along the Murray to Wentworth and the South Australian border, up to Broken Hill and beyond to Tibooburra and Cameron's Corner-nearly 200,000 square kilometres, influenced by three time zones, from the dog fence in the far north-west of New South Wales to Lake Hume, which is the largest water storage on the Murray River, at Albury, with six times these the holding capacity of Sydney Harbour and 370 kilometres of shoreline. It is defined by the Murray River and the Darling River, by both irrigated and dryland agriculture and horticultures, by the important mining town of Broken Hill, by the regional city of Albury un- and by the smaller towns and villages in between. People often express surprise at the size and shape of my electorate and what they perceive to be an impossible task in representing such a diverse community, across an area that is slightly more than three times the size of Tasmania and nearly nine-tenths the size of Victoria. I do not mind the size, the distances I travel or the fact that I seem to be constantly on the road or in the air. I have great affection for western New South Wales and a great passion for its people. I wish I could do more, see more and learn more, but there are not enough hours in the day. I appreciate that all federal electorates must tain the same number of voters, but country people are disadvantaged. It is one of the reasons why the PM's new sitting timetable is flawed. A ‘Rudd day off' in parliament on Fridays: government ministers shoot through, government backbenchers talk to empty benches and the opposition is not able to do its fundamental job of holding the government to account. For me, my time here is never wasted, but, if the Friday sitting going to be devoid of ministerial accountability and question time, I would prefer to spend it in my electorate.",44
14,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The member for Farrer will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",46
15,Mr RUDD,Unknown," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would like to take the opportunity on behalf of the government and the parliament to recognise the event which occurred today in the Great Hall. This was the official welcoming to the parliament of the cross and icon which are the symbols of World Youth Day. The Leader of the Opposition and I attended in the company of Cardinal Pell, the Archbishop of Canberra and Bishop Anthony Fisher, together with Catholic schoolchildren from across Canberra and the wider region. It was an important occasion to symbolise on behalf of both sides of Australian politics the extent to which we and this parliament support this important celebration of the Catholic faith later this year in Sydney. World Youth Day will be a major event, bringing to Australia tens of thousandsprobably hundreds of thousands-of pilgrims from around the world. It will also be accompanied by a visit to Australia, the first, conby Pope Benedict, the Holy Father. Both the Leader of the Opposition and I have already indicated publicly how much a welcome guest the Holy Father will be when he visits Australia and how important an event World Youth Day will be not just for the Catholic faith in this country but for the wider Christian community. I conclude by saying that those measures commendably promised in support of World day is Youth Day by the previous government of Australia have been embraced by us as the next government of Australia to make sure that this event is as successful as possible and important for the community of faith in Australia.",46
16,Dr NELSON,Unknown," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I join the Prime Minister in strongly endorsing his remarks about World Youth Day and the visit of the cross and icon here to Australia. This is an extraordinarily important event for all Australians, whether Catholics or Christians, because it is a celebration of faith and of the fragile yet powerful belief in hope. It is also a recommitment by all of us to young people, not only young Australians but all those young people throughout the world who are very much our future. Obviously I join with the Prime Minister on behalf of this side of the House in celebrating this major event and providing and committing all of the support that we can to His Eminence Cardinal George Pell and those Catholics who will come from all parts of the world. NA Mr Brian Burke",46
17,Dr NELSON,Unknown,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that Mr Brian Burke is the disgraced former Labor Premier of Western Australia and a convicted criminal. Does the Prime Minister endorse the statement of his foreign minister that he has not had a conversation with Brian Burke in a decade and a half and he wished that ‘more people had followed that example'?,47
18,Mr RUDD,Unknown,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As I have said on a number of occasions, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight I would not have met with Mr Burke. As I have said on many occasions, I got that wrong. And, as I have said on many occasions, had I been aware of what subsequently became apparent through the ACCC inquiry, I would not have met him. As for the member for Perth's comments, he of course had the benefit of particular insights in the West. I recognise his better insight on these questions. I should have had that insight myself at the time. I accept full respontant sibility for my actions. Pakistan",47
19,Ms PARKE,Unknown,My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the importance of today's election in Pakistan to both regional and international security?,47
20,Mr RUDD,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Fremantle for her question. Today are the first parliamentary elections in Pakistan for six years. These elections were scheduled for 8 January but were postponed because of the tragic murder-assassination of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on 27 December. Benazir Bhutto was a woman of great courage. She refused to be cowed by the extremists, and she paid the ultimate price for that with her life. The government is pleased that these elections are proceeding. The government has consistently urged its counterpart in Islamabad to return to the democratic processes in Pakistan as quickly as possible. There are of course difficult circumstances on the ground in Pakistan. The political environment is tense, and the physical security within that country represents huge challenges for those wishing to exercise their democratic right. A suicide bomber over the weekend killed over 40 people and injured more than 100. I condemn unequivocally this suicide attack, as I condemned unequivocally the murder of Benazir Bhutto. Extremists behind these attacks cannot be allowed to succeed in derailing Pakistan's elections. The critical challenge for the future is to see extremism marginalised in Pakistan, and the challenge for the democratic process in Islamabad and more widely across Pakistan is to ensure that that occurs. That can be assisted by there being a free, fair and transparent democratic process through the conduct of these elections. That will be imporfor a full restoration of confidence in the political and electoral processes of that country on the part of all the citizens of Pakistan, whatever their religious beliefs and whatever their political beliefs. In a small way, Australia is making a contribution to voter education campaigns through a program run by the Asia Foundation. This is not just a matter for Pakistan itself, though primarily the exercise of the democratic right to elect the next government of that country is of first relevance to the people of that country; it is also pivotal for the future of regional and international stability. What happens in Pakistan through these elections and the government which emerges from it will fundamentally shape so much of the global community's war against terrorism and what happens in the adjacent country of Afghanistan, where we currently have troops deployed. This therefore is not simply a passing election of remote or marginal consequence or interest to the Australian people. This country, Australia, has a deep strategic interthis est in the outcome of these elections in Pakistan and what flows from those elections. We have 1,000 troops next door in Afghanistan, and their future and the future of tions are deeply shaped by events in Pakistan and therefore will be deeply affected by events which proceed from this election. Also, in the wider war against terrorism, the fact that al-Qaeda has been able to safely base its operations in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan and in the north-west of Pakistan itself will in turn be affected by what happens with the electoral process and its outcome in Islamabad. Also the outcome of the Pakistani elections will shape the future of the relationship between Islamabad and New Delhi, India and Pakistan representing nuclear weapons states within our own region. It will also, of affect radically the lives and aspirations of more than 100 million Pakistanis themselves in a rapidly growing country with a rapidly increasing population and will shape so much of their future as well. For democracy itself the successful conclusion of these elections is important intrinsically because of the future of the democratic project across wider South Asia. These elections therefore go to the core interest which we have as international citizens but specifically when it comes to our strategic interest with our troops on the ground deployed in Afghanistan and the wider war against al-Qaeda and terrorist organisations. We the government and the people of Australia will be watching carefully the outcome of events in Pakistan in the days ahead and hopefully the successful and peaceful conclusion of that democratic process. NA",47
21,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery afternoon His Excellency Zacarias Albano da Costa, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Timor Leste. On behalf of the House I extend to their operahim a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Mr Brian Burke",48
22,Dr NELSON,Unknown,"Could I firstly, on indulgence, strongly endorse the remarks of the Prime Minister in relation to Pakistan and the democratic elections. It is not overstating it to say that the outcome of not only the democratic process in Pakistan but security arrangements within that country will determine the outcome in Afghanistan and therefore the struggle against terrorism globally. I strongly support the remarks made by course, the Prime Minister in that regard. My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether there are any additional emails, telephone conversations or indeed any other contact between himself and his office and the convicted criminal Brian Burke which have not been previously disclosed?",48
23,Mr RUDD,Unknown,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The emails that we released yesterday were in direct response to a challenge to do so by the Leader of the Opposition and in response to multiple requests by members of the press gallery. They are all the email contact which exists between me and my office and Mr Burke. That is on the basis of an exhaustive search of our email records yesterday. Secondly, in various previous statements of mine I have indicated that from time to time there was some telephone contact between me and Mr Burke. I said this last year. Thirdly, on the question of meetings with Mr Burke, I have indicated that we met on three occasions, and the details of those meetings are outlined in my earlier statements. Workplace Relations",48
24,Mr HAYES,Unknown,My question is to the Minister for Education and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Will the minister detail the waste associated with the production of the WorkChoices booklet?,49
25,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. I can advise the House that today the Prime Minister and I went to the national mailing and marketing centre in Canberra to send the final of these WorkChoices booklets off to be pulped436,000 of them off to be pulped. Let us remind ourselves that last October when the Howard-Costello government decided to introduce Work Choices it knew Work Choices would hurt working families. As verified by John Howard's autobiography, the cabinet sat around the table and talked about how many working families would lose out under Work Choices and they decided to go ahead with it anyway. A deliberate decision was taken to rip off working families. But in order to disguise that delibtaxpayers, erate decision, the Howard governmentMr Hartsuyker- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It goes to relevance. This question was about the WorkChoices booklet.",49
26,The SPEAKER,Unknown,The Deputy Prime Minister can proceed.,49
27,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"A deliberate decision was taken to rip off working families and consequently a deliberate decision was taken for a propaganda campaign to try and disguise that fact. Some $120 million of taxpayers' money was ultimately allocated towards that advertising campaign. Let us remember the highlights of this propaganda war: the 36-page booklet that contained the example of Billy, who got a minimum wage job and lost everything else. He lost public holidays, rest breaks, bonuses, annual leave loading, allowances, penalty rates, shift loadings and overtime-Billy with a minimum wage job in this propaganda.",49
28,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister can put the booklet down.,49
29,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"But the propaganda did not end there. It was joined by a to-do list, a Work Choices to-do list. It was joined by a Work Choices mouse pad. The propaganda continued, apparently under the guise of informing Australians about their rights. Mr Hockey interjecting",49
30,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I think the Manager of Opposition Business is saying he still uses one of those mouse pads. But this propaganda war is now at an end. Six million of these booklets were produced, but Australians know a con when they see one. They did not want these booklets, just like they did not want the Howard-Costello government's Work Choices laws. So 3.5 million of them ended up being shredded by the Howard government itself. These booklets sat in storage containers around the country costing to add insult to injury. They paid the $2 million for the booklets, then they paid $110,000Mr Secker- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Deputy Prime Minister is ignoring your demand to put down that article.",49
31,The SPEAKER,Unknown,I thank the honourable member for Barker. The Deputy Prime Minister's use of the props is excessive.,49
32,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I am just reminding everybody of the Work Choices propaganda that Australian taxpayers paid for-$2 million on those booklets and then $110,000 to store them from October 2005 until 28 September 2007, more than 3½ million of them. And, on the topic of pulping fiction: whoever is the Harvey Keitel-Winston Wolfe character of the Howard-Costello government, whoever used to do the clean-up jobs, then ordered that these booklets be pulped-and they were pulped, immediately before the election campaign started. But we found 436,000 of them that the clean-up job missed, and we are ensuring that today they are pulped, just like the Rudd Labor government will pulp Work Choices. On the question of pulp fiction, the Manager of Opposition Business is today trying to get away with the biggest fiction of them all: he is trying to pretend that members of the Howard government, Howard government ministers, did not know that Work Choices could hurt Australian working families. He is trying to pretend that the only Australians who did not know Work Choices could hurt working families were the Australians sitting around the Howard government ministerial table. Apparently they are the only ones who missed out on the news. The member for Higgins, hunched over Ian MCLachlan's wallet note-apparently he missed out on the news.",49
33,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister is straying from the question a little.,50
34,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I am searching for an explanation, Mr Speaker, which could possibly make the version from the Manager of Opposition Business true. So here we have the Howard government ministers around the ministerial table-the only Australians who do not know, according to him, that Work Choices is hurting working families, absorbed are they by their divisions: the member for Higgins hunched over his wallet note, the current shadow minister for family and community services hunched over the John Howard defence minutes because that was his role, the current shadow Treasurer hunched over a number sheet-apparently the only ones who were so self-absorbed they did not know that Work Choices was hurting working families. Well, this truly is fiction. Each and every one of them knew that it was hurting working families. Before the election they defended Work Choices with propaganda, and now they defend it with their Senate numbers. It is time to do what the Australian people want and vote for Labor's",50
35,The SPEAKER,Unknown,The Deputy Prime Minister will resume her seat. I take it that the Deputy Prime Minister has finished. Mr Brian Burke,50
36,Dr NELSON,Unknown,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to reports yesterday of his relationship with Brian Burke. Did the Prime Minister at any time seek the advice of the convicted criminal Brian Burke on leadership issues within the Australian Labor Party?,50
37,Mr RUDD,Unknown,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. In the various conversations I would have had with Mr Burke, they dealt with politics in general, state and federal; they would have dealt with the state of the parties, state and federal. I have no particular recollection of a conversation on the leadership of the Labor Party itself. Climate Change",50
38,Mr MARLES,Unknown,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House of how the government is tackling climate change and why decisive so selfaction is needed now?,50
39,Mr RUDD,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question. Climate change, for the government and for the nation, represents core economic business and core environmental business. That is why we as the government have embarked upon a comprehensive set of measures to deal with this challenge. These measures go to what we do in terms of international diplomacy. They go to the question of what we do in our domestic arrangements for the future development of an emissions trading scheme. They go to the question of what we do on the future of mandatory renewable energy targets. They go to how we harmonise such mandatory renewable energy targets across the states and territories to create a unified system for the country. They go to mitigation measures including, for example, $130 million which the minister for primary industries has already announced for use by primary producers to assist in their mitigation measures on farm and on property. And they go to a range of other measures which can be embraced by individuals and families-for example, the solar rebate programs which will be unfolded by the government during this year. It is this sort of multifaceted approach which is necessary to deal with the overall challenge of climate change. All this is made possible in terms of Australia's international diplomacy by the fact that, within the first minutes of the existence of this government, we proceeded to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Within the first 11 days of this government's existence, we handed the instrument of ratification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, at a UN climate change conference in Bali. And within that framework we have, through the agency of the minister newly appointed for climate change, embarked upon a range of negotiations with our partner governments around the world-within the framework, for the first time, of the Kyoto protocol-to ensure that we have an effective Bali road map ahead, which goes from this conference at Bali through the Warsaw conference which will be held later this year, through to its destination point, which will be the Copenhagen conference at the end of next year. These are difficult and challenging negotiations, but negotiations of which we could not be fully part were we not ratification members of the climate change convention. As a result, we the government, through the agency of the Minister for Climate Change and Water, are expending every energy possible to ensure that those negotiations can come to a successful conclusion. This would not have been possible had the previous government been returned to office. This would not have been possible because that government had embarked upon a series of measures and statements the end point of which was to refuse, after 11 years, to ratify the Kyoto protocol. It took us 11 minutes to ratify Kyoto and 11 days to present the instrument of ratification-after 11½ years that that government had still refused to ratify. The program of work we have before us of course goes beyond international diplomacy. It goes also to the targets we set for this nation for the future, and those must be compatible with what we agree on globally as well. Therefore, the work that has been 11 commissioned by the Treasury in terms of the independent Garnaut report-one which we began by commissioning independently, from opposition, in the middle of last yearwill be important. When that report comes down it will be one of the sources of advice, together with what the Treasury says and what we also have from the Department of Climate Change and elsewhere, in shaping our overall framework for the delivery of an effective emissions trading scheme for the country. Beyond that, a core challenge which the minister is wrestling with is also how we evolve an effective mandatory renewable energy target regime for the country, given the conflicting state regimes which exist. These are important items of work for the nation. They are of core relevance to the business community and to the general community. They are of fundamental relevance to whether we have in place in this country a set of measures which underpin long-term economic growth. But Australia is now back in the circle. We are back in the negotiating ring fully-not half-heartedlyas demonstrated by the response to us as the new government of Australia by the international community when we presented our instrument of ratification in Bali in December. This will be serious, difficult and challenging work ahead, but we are prepared to exert every element of the government's energy to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion. I commend the work done thus far by the Minister for Climate Change and Water. This is a very difficult task that she has before her, but this is fundamental economic and environmental business for the nation. It is one of the core priorities for government. It is one of the core priorities upon which this government was elected, and it is a government determined, as in other spheres, to honour the pre-election commitments it gave to the Australian people. NA",50
40,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Tony Stewart, Deputy Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. On behalf of the House I extend to him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Mr Brian Burke",52
41,Dr NELSON,Unknown,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to Brian Burke's offer on 11 October 2005 and again on 22 November 2005 to organise a journalists dinner with the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister: why was he actively involved in making arrangements for this dinner, including adding his staff member Mr Alister Jordan? Why did the Prime Minister tell Mr Burke on 29 November-after he had been sent a guest list-that ‘this looks great'? Doesn't this directly contradict his statement to the Australian people on 1 March 2007: … my recollection is that I found out that arrangements had been put in place, that's when I became concerned, that's when I took action … Prime Minister, on which occasion were you telling the truth?",52
42,Mr RUDD,Unknown,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. When the invitation was extended by Mr Burke for the dinner in question, you are right: initially, I said yes. Then, subsequent to that, I became progressively uneasy about it. I then said no and communicated that by the means contained this and outlined in the emails concerned. As I said in my remarks in response to the Leader of the Opposition's first question, this, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, is something that I would have preferred not to have done. I did so. It was a mistake, and I have accepted full responsibility for it. Foreign Investment",52
43,Mr RIPOLL,Unknown,"My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline the government's approach to foreign investment in Australia by state owned enterprises, including by sovereign wealth funds? What is the government doing to protect the national interest in sensitive sectors?",52
44,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"I thank the member for his question. Australia welcomes foreign investment. Foreign investment helps to develop our industries. It creates jobs and prosperity and provides access to new technology, skills and overseas markets. These are all very good things for the Australian economy. While we encourage foreign investment, we must also ensure that foreign investment is consistent with the national interest. Under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, it is my job as Treasurer to ensure such investment is consistent with the national interest. I have the legislative powers to, in certain circumstances, prohibit proposals that are contrary to our national interest or to impose conditions as I see fit to protect our national interest. On Sunday, I released guidelines, or principles, to enhance the transparency of Australia's foreign investment screening regime. The six principles set out the main factors to be considered in determining whether investments by foreign governments and their agencies are consistent with Australia's national interest. These relate to the investor's independence from its own government and its commercial conduct. Further, the principles look at the proposed investment's impact on competition, government revenue or policy, national security considerations and the overall contribution to the economy. These principles are to be applied on a case by case basis to judge whether any investment by a foreign government or its entities is in the national interest. The principles are consistent with the approach that was applied by the previous government through the Foreign Investment Review Board. What is new is that there has been heightened public interest and heightened commercial interest in these proposals. That is why the Rudd government has moved to provide full transparency in relation to these matters. The government will ensure that investment in Australia continues to enhance our national interest and our national prosperity. Mr Brian Burke",52
45,Dr NELSON,Unknown,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister confirm that, on the night of the postponed journalists dinner on 12 December 2005, he stayed in Perth? What was the purpose of this trip to Perth? Did he have any contact with Brian Burke during this time?",53
46,Mr RUDD,Unknown,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. My recollection is that it was about the time of the state funeral of Peter Cook, the former Minister for Trade-that is my recollection-and that I was in Perth for that purpose. The Leader of the Opposition is correct. I was, therefore, there on the evening when the original scheduled time for this dinner occurred. I did not attend it. I do not recall having any contact with Mr Burke at that time whatsoever. Aged Care",53
47,Ms BURKE,Unknown,My question is to the Minister for Ageing. What is the latest information on the April 2007 gastroenteritis outbreak at Broughton Hall nursing home?,53
48,Mrs ELLIOT,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Chisholm for her question. Members will be aware that in April 2007 there was a major gastroenteritis outbreak at Broughton Hall nursing home in Camberwell, Victoria. Out of the 22 residents affected, tragically five died. On 17 April 2007, the previous Minister for Ageing announced that Ms Rhonda Parker, who is now the Aged Care Commissioner, would investigate an allegation that a staff member from the Department of Health and Ageing and/or the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency did not respond to calls for help from a Broughton Hall resident. The resident involved was Mr Merson Dunstan, who was in his early 80s. During the outbreak he was taken to hospital and subsequently died. In May 2007, Ms Rhonda Parker's report was finalised and delivered to the then Minister for Ageing. That was almost 10 months ago and the Dunstan family has heard very little since. On 7 February 2008, my office contacted Rhonda Parker to inquire about the investigation and express concern about the lack of feedback to the Dunstan family. A day later, on 8 February, Ms Rhonda Parker provided a summary investigation report. I have been advised that the full report was unable to be released publicly due to legal constraints imposed by the Privacy Act. Ms Parker's investigation has found that, whilst the allegation that departmental staff and/or agency assessors ignored pleas for help was not substantiated by the evidence, she believed there needed to be changes. Ms Parker recommended that during a disease outbreak departmental staff be required to check on actual nursing home residents rather than just examine documentation and meet with management and staff. It is a very sensible recommendation and I do not see why the previous government did not act on it. I have asked the department to work on implementing Ms Parker's recommendation. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is a ministerial statement. The minister is directly reading from a piece of paper. There are other forms of the House available for her to make this sort of statement, with an appropriate reply from the opposition. This is ridiculous.",53
49,The SPEAKER,Unknown,The question was within order and the answer was within order.,54
50,Mrs ELLIOT,Unknown,"On Sunday, 10 February, I hand-delivered a copy of Ms Rhonda Parker's summary investigation report to the family of the late Mr Merson Dunstan. I also took the opportunity to apologise for the previous government's and the previous minister's failure to provide any information to the Dunstan family. Whilst it does not bring the matter to a close, I hope it is a step forward for the Dunstan family. It must have been a very frustrating and indeed a very sad nine months for the Dunstan family, and our thoughts are with them as they now face the coroner's inquest later this year. I now table the summary investigation report provided to the Dunstan family. Economy",54
51,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer to the recent 35-year record low in unemployment, of 4.1 per cent, and the record high in labour force participation, of 65.2 per cent. Given the Reserve Bank's stated intention to tighten monetary policy to slow economic activity in order to lower inflationary pressures, what does the Treasurer regard as Australia's current non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment expressed as a percentage? If the Treasurer regards that rate to be higher than 4.1 per cent, how many Australian jobs does he believe should be sacrificed to achieve it? Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With regard to standing order 100, the question clearly asked for an opinion of the Treasurer. It is clearly out of order. I understand they are new to asking questions but they do need to be in order. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I also rise on a point of order. In the first place, section 100 has been interpreted liberally by previous speakers. The question is specifically about the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. If the Treasurer does not know the answer, he should not have the job.",54
52,The SPEAKER,Unknown,The question is well and truly in order up until towards the end and I think even the last bit is probably in order as well. Mr Hockey-No more protection!,54
53,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The question has been asked. I would have thought there was a wish to have an answer.,55
54,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"I do thank the member for his question because it is a good question. As I indicated to the House only last week, we are optimistic about the future of the Australian economy. Unemployment is at a record low. We are in our 17th year of straight economic growth and that is a good thing for Australia, but what Australia has to do is deal with the economic challenges that are emerging. As I indicated last week, we have an uncertain international environment and we are not immune from international fallout. But the biggest challenge the Australian economy faces is dealing with the inflation challenge-the parting gift of the Liberal Party of Australia to the Australian people. We should always aimMr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance. The question was about the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, and the Treasurer has made no reference to it at all.",55
55,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"I would like to make it very clear that the objective of the Rudd government is to get unemployment as low as we possibly can. But there is one hurdle, and that is the level of elevated inflation. The highest level of inflation in 16 years was left to the incoming government. That elevated inflation, which has been on the march for the last couple of years, has produced seven interest rate rises in a row. That is the legacy of the Liberal Party of Australia. That is the parting gift of the Liberal Party of Australia to the incoming government. We have taken responsibility for that from day one. The Prime Minister has put out there his fivepoint plan. Very important to ensuring that we have sustainable growth in this economy is to put in place our five-point plan to tackle inflation, and we are doing just that. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Again, the question was very specific. It was asking the Treasurer about the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. It should be easy for him to answer it; he is the Treasurer.",55
56,The SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of order. The member will resume his seat.,55
57,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"We all know that those opposite dropped the ball on inflation. If anyone wants any proof of that, watch Four Corners tonight. Mr Dutton interjecting",55
58,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! the member for Dickson!,55
59,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"What we will see on Four Corners tonight is all of the disunity in the former government on display in all of its glory. Mr Ciobo interjecting Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask you two things: firstly, could you draw the Treasurer back to the question and, secondly, could he answer what NAIRU is.",55
60,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before the Treasurer returns and answers the question, can I ask that the members for Dickson and Moncrieff just modify their enthusiasm. Take the example of the member for Dunkley and not the member for Sturt.",55
61,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"I think Australians, as they are watching Four Corners tonight, when all the disunity is on display, when the complacency of the former government is on displayMr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance. I have asked the Treasurer a question about a very important and very well-known economic term-the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. He has not even mentioned it. Doesn'the know what it is?",55
62,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Before giving the Treasurer the call, I remind him that promos for ABC programs are out of order. The Treasurer.",56
63,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I have answered the question. We aim to get it as low as possible. That is the objective of the Rudd government: to get it as low as possible. But I am sure the Australian people will want to know tonight",56
64,Dr NELSON,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. To assist the Treasurer with relevance, I table the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. He might consider that.",56
65,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Leader of the Opposition would have to seek leave, and leave would have to be granted. Is leave granted? Leave is not granted. The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Can I take it that the Treasurer, having used the words ‘I have answered the question', has completed his answer?",56
66,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"I think Australians will want to know, when these meetings were taking place at the Quay Grand, who was running the Australian economy. Who was fighting the fight against inflation? Mr Anthony Smith interjecting",56
67,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Casey is warned! And the honourable member for North Sydney will be outside phoning a friend.,56
68,Mr SWAN,Unknown,Who was guarding against reckless spending while they were out there stabbing each other in the back? This government will always put the national interest above the petty interests of those opposite and what they were doing at that time.,56
69,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"In fairness to the member for Leichhardt, as somebody who is yet to be able to defend himself from interjections, I think that we should go a little easy on him. I call the member for Leichhardt. Fuel Prices",56
70,Mr TURNOUR,Unknown,My question is to the Assistant Treasurer. What has the government done in its first few months in office to introduce greater transparency into the petrol industry?,56
71,Mr BOWEN,Unknown,"I appreciate the question from the honourable gentleman and I appreciate the opportunity to outline to the House the actions the government has taken in its first few months in relation to transparency in the petrol market. On 18 December, less than a fortnight after the Rudd government was sworn in, we issued formal monitoring powers to the ACCC. These powers give the ACCC the ability to subpoena documents and witnesses if they fear anticompetitive conduct at any point in the petrol supply chain. Importantly, on Saturday we fulfilled another election commitment with the an tralia's new petrol commissioner. Mr Walker has been Consumer Protection Commissioner and petrol commissioner in Western Australia for the last 10 years. Under his leadership and the leadership of the Western Australian government, petrol prices have been a major focus of the Department of Consumer and Employment Protection in Western Australia. Indeed, Perth has gone from being one of the more expensive cities in Australia for petrol to one of the cheapest. I have asked the new Petrol Commissioner to investigate the recent increases in LPG and diesel prices which have been causing concern across the country, and particularly in relation to diesel in rural and regional areas, and to report back to the government on what more can or should be done. I welcome the endorsement from the Leader of the Opposition of that action. The ACCC's petrol report, handed to the government last December, underlines the need for these sorts of actions. The ACCC found the wholesale petrol market in Australia to be ‘a comfortable oligopoly'. Perhaps it is comfortable for producers, but it is not comfortable for consumers. It is important to understand that our position in government is the same as it was in opposition. The biggest impact on Australian petrol prices comes from world oil prices. But, when world oil prices are so high, it is incumbent on the government of the day to do everything possible to put downward pressure on prices by ensuring the market is working competitively-something the previous government did not do. They shrugged their shoulders and said over 11 years, ‘Australian working families have never been better off.' Therefore they chose not to take action in relation to petrol prices. This government has a different approach. We believe that through competition and transparency we can put downward pressure on petrol prices, and that is what we will continue to do. I am pleased to report to the House that the Rudd government has done more to introduce transparency into the petrol market in Australia in the last 2½ months than the previous government did in 11½ years. There is, of course, more to do. We will continue to work with the ACCC on their suggestions and recommendations for action, including investigation of the so-called buysell arrangements between oil companies, which mean that a problem in a refinery of one producer flows through to other producers and all consumers pay more for their petrol. We will also continue to work on the issues of transparency and more information for consumers that the ACCC raised in their report. Given that I have been asked by the honourable member for Leichhardt about the government's actions since the election, it is appropriate that I inform the House of some of the third-party commentary on those actions in relation to transparency in the petrol market. Peter Kell, the CEO of Choice, has said: We are pleased to see the federal government stepping in on behalf of consumers in relation to petrol pricesMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It was a very specific question. It did not ask for third-party references. I ask you to sit him down. Otherwise, get another question up from our side.",56
72,The SPEAKER,Unknown,The minister will use the third-party endorsements incidentally to his answer.,57
73,Mr BOWEN,Unknown,"Peter Kell said: We are pleased to see the federal government stepping in on behalf of consumers in relation to petrol prices and are especially pleased to see the ACCC has now been given a greater monitoring role. The President of the NRMA, Mr Alan Evans, said: Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Assistant Treasurer Chris Bowen should be congratulated for acting quickly to expand the powers of the ACCC and work towards appointing a Petrol Commissioner as soon as possible. On the weekend Mike Harris, Chief Executive of the AAA",57

75,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The minister will resume his seat. There is simply too much noise for anybody to hear what is going on except for the interjectors hearing their own voices.,57
76,Mr BOWEN,Unknown,"Mike Harris, the Chief Executive of the AAA, the peak motoring body for Australia, said: The AAA motoring clubsMr Secker- Mr Speaker, I rise on a further point of order. He is defying the chair. There is no way that this is incidental.",57
77,Mr BOWEN,Unknown,"The AAA, the premium motoring organisation in Australia, said: The AAA motoring clubs-the NRMA, RACV, RACQAnd all the state motoring organisationswelcome ... Mr Walker's appointment and we believe the scope of his brief will ensure motorists are paying a fair and reasonable cost for fuel. There is just one more. I did say I would inform the House of third-party independent commentators. I must admit: the next one is not a third-party independent commentator. She is the former leader of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory. She said on 18 December, after I was interviewed on Darwin ABC radio: We know governments and the ACCC are doing what they can on petrol, and I don't think people expect more than that. I am pleased to hear what the federal minister had to say this morning. I am glad that at least one conservative leader has taken a constructive approach to the issue of petrol prices in Australia. I note that the leader of the National Party has called for the GST to be reduced on petrol. Eleven years in office and they never came up with that idea.",58
78,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The minister is now starting to debate the issue.,58
79,Mr BOWEN,Unknown,Eleven years in office and now all of a sudden they think they have a plan. I am not sure if it is actually official National Party policy. We can never be sure these days.,58

82,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Members on my left ought not get too overly excited. Newcastle Electorate: Roads,58
83,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. In light of the government's views that removing infrastructure bottlenecks is critical to fighting inflation, will the government support the coalition's pre-election promise to provide $780 million to complete the F3 to Branxton link road? Does the minister their agree with the member for Hunter and now Minister for Defence, who said after the coalition's announcement that Labor would absolutely match this funding to remove bottlenecks from the Newcastle area?",58
84,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"I thank the shadow minister for his question. At the election Labor made a clear commitment not only to continue with AusLink 1 but also to expand our funding for AusLink 2. What we need is a plan to deal with infrastructure in an integrated fashion. We need a plan for road and we need a plan for rail. We need a plan that recognises that we need to get our goods to port and we need to get our people around our cities. With regard to the specific question which the minister raised, I am very pleased that this week I will be introducing into the parliament legislation to create Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia will conduct an audit of the infrastructure needs of the nation, both now and into the future. It will be able to establish an infrastructure priority list based upon objective criteria, with input from the Commonwealth, input from the state, input from local government, as well as input from the private sector. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question was very specific. It was about the F3 to Branxton link road and the Labor Party's commitment of $780 million to build the road. It was a very specific question and I ask for a specific answer.",58
85,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Without the chair giving commentary on the matter contained in the response, I do believe that the minister was attempting to explain the process involving not only this project but also other projects.",59
86,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"This government does indeed have a very different approach towards these processes. What we will not do is make promises during election campaigns to the point whereby they simply do not add up. With regard to the now opposition's AusLink commitments, during the federal election campaign they just made promises regardless of whether or not they added up. They made promises because they knew they were never going to be in a position to fulfil them. What is interesting about the specific question raised by the shadow minister is that he was the minister prior to the election. Did he do anything about it? No. Did the previous National Party minister do anything about it? No. Did the minister before that do anything about it? No. And yet, just 11 weeks post the November 24 election, they have come in here and put forward specific questions about commitments that were given. I will tell you what we will be doing. We will be doing two things. One, we will be establishing a proper process so that assessments can be given in terms of priority, establishing one that consults with Commonwealth-state governments and the private sector. Two, we will be repairing the state of the Commonwealth finances caused by the national pork-barrelling and waste whereby the former government were prepared to just make commitments regardless of whether they added up. Kosovo",59
87,Ms VAMVAKINOU,Unknown,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister update the House on recent developments in Kosovo?,59
88,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,Unknown,"I thank the member for Calwell for that question. Yesterday the government of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence for the nationstate of Kosovo. This unilateral declaration of independence followed a long period of negotiation between Kosovo and Serbia, largely under the auspices of UNMIK. As members would appreciate, this long period of negotiation has not been successful. There has been no agreement between Kosovo and Serbia. I think it is true to say that there will not be unanimous community welcoming of yesterday's unilateral declaration of independence, and that was reflected in the debate in the Security Council yesterday. Having said that, Australia very strongly supports recognition of Kosovo's independence. We believe that that is the best way forward for peace and stability not only in Kosovo but also in south-eastern Europe. The Australian government urges the relevant leadersPrime Minister Thaci of Kosovo and President Tadic of Serbia-to ensure that whatever disagreements there are between Serbia and Kosovo, whether on the unilateral declaration of independence or on other matters, they are resolved peacefully and in a way which does not incite violence. The Australian government also urges this view upon relevant parts of the Australian community. We know that attitudes towards the independence of Kosovo are strongly held in sections of the Australian community, and whatever views are expressed should be expressed by way of restraint so as to ensure that all persons' views in this matter are respected. The Australian government's approach to recognition is that the Australian government recognises nation-states, not governments. The criteria for the recognition of nationstates are that we find a permanent population, a defined territory, a capacity for effecalong tive government and a capacity to have relations with other nation-states. We believe that these criteria are met in the case of Kosovo; and, as a consequence, we are very favourably disposed to recognition of Kosovo. We are currently in discussions with our allies, partners and friends about our approach, and after these discussions we look forward to formal recognition of Kosovo at an early opportunity. I think one of the very key priorities for Kosovo into the future is to ensure the rights and the safety of minorities in Kosovo, including and in particular the protection of cultural and heritage sites. We have seen in Kosovo and in south-eastern Europe in the last decade or so a very sorry history. Australia played its part with the warm and generous welcoming of Kosovar refugees to our shores a few years ago. The Australian government very strongly believes that the best way forward for peace and stability in Kosovo and in south-eastern Europe is to recognise the independence of Kosovo under international supervision, and after appropriate discussion with allies, friends and other nation-states, we hope very quickly to move to such a formal recognition. Investing in Australia",59
89,Mr ROBB,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to the damning report of comments he made to a New York meeting on 25 January, when he warned off more than 200 prominent investors who had gone to the meeting to hear the merits of investing in Australia. I ask: does the minister stand by his comments in New York that Australia is not an attractive investment destination?",60
90,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,Unknown,"I never made any such comment. My comment in New York at a lunch of potential or prospective and current investors into Australia was the following lines: firstly, that one of the things that has made Australia a prosperous nation has been Australia being an attractive place for capital investment-originally and historically, overseas capital investment and, more recently, domestic capital investment led by Labor's great superannuation reforms; and, secondly, that we had been a prosperous society by being a great trading nation. I encouraged investors to invest in Australia by making points which went to the attractiveness of investment in Australia. I also drew attention to one of our current problems. That problem is called inflation. I made the point that, far from being neglectful and complacent about inflation, the new Rudd Labor government had made combating inflation its highest economic priority. I would have thought that any investor contemplating investing in Australia, either a domestic investor or an overseas investor, would want to ensure, would want to know, would want to be confident that the government of Australia was on the case when it came to making sure that inflation and, as a consequence, interest rates were under control, rather than being neglectful and complacent about it as our predecessors had been for a long period of time. Mr Robb- Mr Speaker, given that the minister has withheld his speech from his website, I seek leave to table the damning newspaper report. Leave not granted. Trade",60
91,Ms GRIERSON,Unknown,My question is to the Minister for Trade. Could the minister advise the House of the likelihood of a successful outcome to the WTO Doha Round and why this is important to Australia and the global economy?,60
92,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I will deal with the ‘why' first. Over the last five years without a Doha conclusion the growth in world trade has been twice the rate of growth in world output. The message from that is clear: if we can get growth in world markets, and through the liberalisation of our trade agenda, that will create the environment for sustained economic growth. It is important not only for us but also for the global economy. That is the reason that it is critical that we get a successful outcome in the Doha Round-not just any outcome, but an ambitious one that deals with agriculture, with industrial goods and with services. As to the likelihood of that outcome, in my judgement, whilst it will be terribly difficult, it is doable. There has developed a new political will-and this was demonstrated at the recent conference of trade ministers in Davos-to achieve a successful and ambitious outcome. This has been backed up in the dynamic of that political will in three new texts that have recently been issued in Geneva dealing with those three areas that I talked of before. But it is one thing to have the text; it is another to maintain the political will to achieve the outcome. I think-and this seemed to be the view of the ministers present-that, at this time of global uncertainty in the world economy, trade ministers can do a great deal by introducing some certainty to that uncertain environment. Finally, can I just say that, even if we do succeed in Doha, this is really only the beginning of the next set of trade rounds. We on this side of the parliament have always taken the view that what we need to do is get the most ambitious outcome at the multilateral level, to reinforce and enhance that at the regional level and to reinforce it again at the bilateral level. We have never been against bilateral trade arrangements; our criticism of the previous government is that they reversed that order. They put the emphasis on the bilateral rounds and they achieved outcomes that drew away from the multilateral outcome both in resources and in terms of outcome. It is also our view that the previous government squandered the opportunity presented by our riding the resources boom to sustain our economic future. In terms of their leadership of the Cairns Group, we do not believe they took the opportunity that that structure presented to reach out to the newly emerging groups in this Doha Round. This government will take a new strategic direction and make a new commitment to achieving the outcome at the multilateral level, enhancing it at the regional level and enhancing it again at the bilateral level-WTO-plus. That is what this country needs. But you have to start at the beginning. The previous government never got there. We hope to help turn that around. Workplace Relations",61
93,Ms JULIE BISHOP,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. I refer the minister to the John Holland Aviation Services agreement 2007, a collective agreement negotiated and agreed on behalf of workers by the unions. I draw her attention to the fact that this union collective agreement trades away more than 30 award conditions, such as penalty rates, overtime loading, leave loading and public holiday loading. Does the minister support such union agreements?",61
94,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I note that the agreement that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has in her hand would have been negotiated under the previous government. But, putting that to one side, I will explain Labor's industrial relations policies, which can be read by any of the members of the Work Choices political party in this parliament. If they read those policies, they will find that you can make a collective agreement which has in it flexibilities but the underlying benchmark is a no disadvantage test against the full award. The underlying benchmark under Work Choices in its initial phase was against five protected conditions-only five-which means that everything else could have been signed away, and routinely was. Indeed, the then Howard-Costello government advocated the trading away of conditions for nothing in the example of Billy. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. I referred to this specific agreement and asked whether the minister supported such union agreements.",61
95,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I am explaining, or endeavouring to explain, to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that I am for collective agreement making when parties choose to do it. Whether parties choose to use a union or choose not to use a union is a matter for them; that is a question of freedom of association. What is the job of government? The job of government is to set the appropriate benchmark to make sure people are protected. What is the appropriate benchmark? It is the full award. What was the benchmark under the Work Choices party? It was five minimum conditions. That meant leave loadingabout which she claims to be concernedcould be traded away for nothing, penalty rates could be traded away for nothing, overtime could be traded away for nothing and so on and so forth. They sat there and knew it was happening and did nothing about it. I understand that, as the Four Corners show will reveal, they are deeply divided about a number of things, but the one thing they all seem to believeMs Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. This is not about the program on television this evening. The question was: does the minister support such union agreements? It is a very simple question. If she is unable to answer the question, she should say so.",62
96,The SPEAKER,Unknown,The Deputy Prime Minister knows that the promo is out of order and she will continue her response to the question.,62
97,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I do not contend that the Four Corners show is relevant but it is going to be interesting to watch; there is no doubt about that. Irrelevant or not, I suspect a lot of people in this parliament will be watching it. The benchmark the government has set is a full no disadvantage test against an award. That means that you always get better than the award. Under the Work Choices party, you could always get worse than the award. Using their Senate numbers to keep Work Choices going is what they are guaranteeing today-more rip-offs of working families. Ms Julie Bishop-I seek leave to tender the agreement that is signed by the AMWU, the ASU, the AWU and the National Union of Workers. The 34 award conditions that are traded off are in annexure 3. Leave not granted. Skills Shortage",62
98,Mr TREVOR,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy. In February 2005 and again in February 2006 you noted that $20 billion worth of major infrastructure and resource projects could be in jeopardy as a result of skills shortages. Are skills shortages still a serious capacity constraint in the resources sector, and what action is the government taking to address this issue?",62
99,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Flynn for this question. I am pleased to have him in the House because he grew up in Gladstone and has lived and worked there for most of his life, one of the key regional resources and energy regions of Australia. More importantly, he joins a growing band of regional members of the government, such as the representatives of Capricornia, Dawson, Leichhardt, Lingiari, Solomon, Lyons, Hunter and Brand, who have a good appreciation of the importance of the resources and energy sector to the Australian community. They very much appreciate that the resources and energy sector in Australia represents some major challenges. It is interesting to note that the Leader the National Party did not, for example, question the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government today about the AusLink investments in key regional centresinvestments which the opposition failed to match during the election-such as the AusLink money being spent in places such as Dampier, Karratha, Bunbury and Esperance to try and overcome some of the infrastructure blockages in those key resources centres around Australia. Let us go to the issue of skills shortages. We all appreciate that the resources and energy sector is vital to Australia's future. of the responsibilities of the Minister for Trade is not only to ensure that we maintain momentum on resources and energy but also to guarantee that we diversify the Australian industry base so as to make sure that, whilst we ride the resources boom for the foreseeable future, we open up additional employment and export opportunities for Australia. That is very important to the future of Australia. This is about a government actually confronting Australia with the need to make the hard decisions on a variety of fronts to guarantee that Australia is best positioned to confront the challenges of the 21st century. The resources sector is one of those vital sectors. It represents five per cent of Austrain lia's GDP. Importantly, when you add the downstream processing and associated minerals activity, it represents 20 per cent of Australia's GDP. It also represents more than half of Australia's export opportunities at the moment. We are talking about a nation that sees the resources and energy sector as being very much central to where we go in the next 20, 30 and 40 years. One of the problems is not only infrastructure blockages but huge shortages of skills in Australia. We have to make sure that we do everything possible to overcome these key of skills and infrastructure blockages, because in the resources and energy sector they are very much central to our future wealth and prosperity as a nation. Let us deal with some of the backlog with respect to potential investment in Australia in the foreseeable future. At the moment, the investment planned in the resources sector is estimated at about $30 billion, up from $22 billion in 2006-07 and more than double the average expenditure over the last quarter of a century. So one of our challenges is to work with a whole-of-government approach to try and overcome some of the skills shortages at the moment, skills shortages which are in One danger of stranding resources and energy development in Australia. You have to understand that, once it is stranded and investment goes elsewhere, it will be a long time before Australia attracts that investment back, and we will therefore miss out on important skilling and export opportunities. I am pleased to say, in a complimentary way, that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship recently announced an increase in skilled migration of 6,000 people for this current financial year, with a special focus on the resources and construction sector. More importantly, I am also pleased to say that during a recent visit to the Pilbara with the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs we had an important opportunity to actually sit down with key resource companies such as Woodside, Chevron, BHP and Rio to talk about the problems that confront them. They reinforced to us that the issue of skilled labour is one of the biggest problems in Australia. They also appreciate our endeavours not only to increase skilled migration but also to build integrity back into the 457 visa class, because it is important to their future. We also had the opportunity to talk about the support that the minister for Indigenous affairs is going to give to the resources and energy sector to try and maximise Indigenous employment and training opportunities. I also welcome the recent announcements by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister of not only creating additional training places but also bringing on Skills Australia. This is not just about government at federal and state levels acting on this front. It is also about reminding the private sector: ‘Training is not a cost of running your business; it is an investment in your future.' So we are looking to that new partnership. I encourage those key resource companies in major regional centres in Australia to actually start doing the work now with their local high schools and local communities: be on the ground running when we announce and put in place key election commitments to put apprentices back in schools, where they belong-to get these young people to start their apprenticeships at school. That will give us a better opportunity to enable them to finish school and also to start an apprenticeship, which will create great career opportunities for the rest of their lives. I simply say in conclusion that the resource and energy sectors are important to Australia, and the responsibility of all ministers, including me, is to actually do what we can to overcome the blockages on the infrastructure front and the skills front that could leave Australian resources stranded. In doing so, can I say time is not on our side. Our responsibility is to make sure we take the hard decisions to enable a modern Australia to confront the 21st century and guarantee working people a vibrant future. Days and Hours of Meeting",62
100,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,Unknown,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that the Prime Minister has just had a pay increase of some $95,000 and that in his capacity as Prime Minister he has had two free houses and a private jet made available to him, will the Prime Minister commit to not being a part-time Prime Minister and to attending parliament each scheduled sitting Friday?",64
101,Mr RUDD,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for this question. As I said in response to a question in this place last week, firstly, the number of question times in this House this year will increase relative to the average annual number of question times through the duration of the Howard government. That is very important. Secondly, the number of sitting days for the parliament will also be greater than was the case under the Howard government. These provide ample opportunities for members to ask questions of the executive-a greater number, in fact, than existed on average over the years of the Howard government-and a greater opportunity for members such as the member for Maranoa to raise questions in this place and to use the opportunity to stand up in private members' business to put forward the interests of the good people of Maranoa and the challenges that they face. As the government peruse observations and reflections made by the member for Maranoa about what needs to be done in Charleville, Roma and places like that, we will be very attentive to what those contain and will reflect on them in the responses we provide. Skills Shortage",64
102,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,My question is to the Minister for Employment Participation. Could the minister advise the House of how the government is addressing the skills shortage through its employment services policy?,65
103,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, as this is my first opportunity, can I congratulate you on your election to high office. I think you have already shown a great capacity to chair this magnificent chamber.",65
104,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Help me by getting to the answer.,65
105,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for his question. It is a very important question. Indeed, this particular area of public policy a great bearing on Western Sydney. I know he understands that and I certainly will want to work with him on this particular matter over the course of the parliamentary term. Skills and training are vital to Australia's future prosperity and our ability to compete on the international stage. We all know that a skilled society is central to the next wave of economic reform, but the previous Liberal government left Australia with its worse skills shortage in living memory. That shortage has critically affected key industries and put at risk our economic growth. This is exemplified by the migration occupations in demand list, which has seen the number of occupations on the shortage list increase by 400 per cent since 1999. In less than 10 years, there has been a fourfold increase of occupations on that particular list, which is indeed an indictment of the previous government. We told the Australian people we would improve employment services to get more Australians into work and to help employers get skilled labour to boost their productivity. We will create a new suite of employment programs which will provide better opportunities for training and indeed for a more skilled workforce. The Rudd government are committed to addressing the severe skills shortages in Australia. Before the election, we actually committed to 450,000 vocational education and training places over the next four-year period, which I think is a significant commitment to providing the training required for Australians. In the area of my own portfolio, 175,000 places out of those 450,000 will be provided specifically for Australians entering and re-entering the workforce from unemployment. We are already acting on that commitment, and that is why 20,000 of those training places will be rolled out between 1 April and 30 June this year. The second part of the honourable memhas ber's question asks why Australia is facing such a severe skills crisis, which is putting at risk our long-term economic prosperity. For almost 12 long years vocational education and training was relegated to the bottom of the government's priorities. It was not even regarded as a significant matter by the previous government. There is a case in point with respect to that particular assertion. Under the previous government the number of apprenticeships and traineeships commenced as a result of a Job Network placement fell by more than half. Between 1998 and 1999 there were 32,807 places compared with only 14,925 in the financial year 2006-07. That is a disgrace. That is an indictment of the selfabsorption, the self-interest and the incompetence of the previous government. If you want to see some more signs of that, watch Four Corners tonight because we know there will be versions of history and revisionism going on. There will be many versions, as we know. It will underline",65
106,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Minister for Employment Participation is starting to debate the answer.,65
107,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,Unknown,"how absorbed the previous government was. There was no investment in training; there was just a ‘get them into any job at any cost' mentality. In my portfolio, that blinkered approach created an employment system with the wrong emphasis, where training and education had little or no value. I refer the House to the words of the Age's economics editor, who only on 5 February said: ‘The Howard government dropped the ball on skills training.' Indeed it did. And as recently as two days ago the Daily Telegraph reported on a survey conducted by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research. It found that 80 per cent of large employers have had difficulty recruiting over the last 12 months. That is 80 per cent of large employers, up from 68 per cent in 2005. The Rudd government is currently waging a war on inflation. We will continue to fight that war, something that was neglected by the previous government for more than a decade. Vocational Education and Training",66
108,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,Unknown,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his pledge to the Australian people in this House on 10 May last year where he promised ‘to build new trades training centres and upgrade existing facilities and equipment in all of Australia's 2,650 secondary schools'. Can the Prime Minister guarantee that every single secondary school will have its own trades training centre at school as he pledged?",66
109,Mr RUDD,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Building on the answer which has just been given by my honourable colleague concerning vocational education and training: this is core business for the new Australian government. It was marginal business for the government we replaced. You see that in the pattern of expenditure; you see that also in the inflation challenges that are before the Australian economy. We have had warning after warning from the Reserve Bank about skills shortages in the Australian economy, going back years and years, about which the previous government did nothing, as a consequence of which we have inflationary pressures unleashed in the Australian economyMr Anthony Smith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. Could the Prime Minister simply answer yes or no to whether his pledge still stands?",66
110,The SPEAKER,Unknown,I call the Prime Minister.,66
111,Mr RUDD,Unknown,"Part and parcel of dealing with the skills shortages is what we do with voc ed and training. And a core part of that is what we do with voc ed and training in schools. I remember visiting schools during the election campaign, including the school that the Treasurer and I attended as kids. It is an absolute disgrace that, at this stage in the country's history, trades training centres such as that have barely changed an inch since we attended that school back in the early to mid1970s. And you see this pattern right across the country, with mums and dads across Australia saying, ‘I want my kids to have decent access to voc ed at school'Mr Anthony Smith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance again. The Prime Minister needs to answer a simple question. He promised 2,650 secondary the schools would have their own trades training centre. Will they or won't they?",66
112,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for Casey will resume his seat. I call the Prime Minister.,66
113,Mr RUDD,Unknown,"Therefore the challenge lies in making sure that kids from working families have decent opportunities for trades training in schools. The previous government just waved goodbye to that and for 11½ years did fundamentally nothing for hundreds and thousands of young Australian kids wanting to pursue a trade. Kids wanted to pursue a career in the motor trades, a career in carpentry or other careers in industrial design, but there were no real opportunities available to them. They had to wait for an alternative government to stand up hereand I recall doing so-at the dispatch box in the budget reply and say, ‘Enough is enough is enough: this government, were it to be elected, would be committed to delivering trades training centres to each of Australia's 2,650 secondary schools.' We have committed funding for doing that into the years ahead. It will be delivered, as we undertook at the last election, because we are a government committed to honouring our undertakings to the Australian people, unlike those who preceded us, who categorised their promises into that which was core and that which was non-core, because they did not believe in the promises they gave in the first place. Bombing of Darwin: Anniversary",66
114,Mr HALE,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Can the minister explain to the House the significance of the bombing of Darwin, which is being remembered tomorrow, and the government's plans to commemorate this period of Australia's war history?",67
115,Mr GRIFFIN,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Following the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942, then Labor Prime Minister John Curtin predicted the beginning of war on Australian soil. He said: The fall of Singapore opens the battle for lia. Our honeymoon is finished. Four days later, war came to Australian shores with two air raids launched on Darwin. The two air raids killed more than 250 people and wounded between 300 and 400 people. Twenty military aircraft were destroyed, eight ships at anchor in the harbour were sunk, and most civil and military facilities in Darwin were devastated. The air attacks on Darwin continued until November 1943, with Darwin being attacked some 64 times. This was testament to Darwin's pivotal role in the war effort into the islands. During the war other towns in Northern Australia were also attacked, with bombs being dropped on Townsville, Katherine, Wyndham, Derby, Broome and Port Hedland. The battle for Australia was a struggle that encompassed a nation's heart and soul, as Australia resisted the enemy's attacks on its soil and territories. The threat of invasion was very real. The struggle stretched our nation's resources to the limit. Men and women in uniform and men, women and children on the home front responded to the call. The battle for Australia comprised the bombing of Northern Australia, the Battle of the Coral Sea and those battles along the Kokoda track and from Milne Bay through to Buna, Gona and Sanananda. The defence of Australia became a springboard for victory. The Battle for Australia Commemoration National Council was formed in 1988 to encourage annual commemoration of the battle for Australia on the first Wednesday in September each year. The date coincides with the anniversary of the Battle of Milne Bay, which proved to be the first of many Japanese land defeats in the Pacific war and a turning point in the defence of our nation. This government went to the electorate promising to formally recognise Battle for Australia Day as a national day of obserAustravance-action the previous government would not take. Work is underway for the Governor General to issue a proclamation to observe Battle for Australia Day on the first Wednesday in September each year. It will not be a public holiday or an alternative to ANZAC Day or Remembrance Day, but it will provide all of us with the opportunity to reflect on the momentous events that helped shape our nation and to remember those who lost their lives to protect our freedom and way of life.

NA Australia-United States ‘Open Skies' Agreement",71
129,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (3.50 pm)-I ask leave of the House to make a ministerial statement relating to the Australia-United States ‘Open Skies' Agreement. Leave granted.",72
130,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"Last week the Australian government successfully negotiated an open skies agreement with the United States. This development represents a watershed for trans-Pacific aviation. Under the new agreement, Australian and United States airlines will be able to fly an unlimited number of services between our two countries through any combination of other destinations. This agreement has been a priority for me and the government since our election last year. The agreement with the United States opens the way for increased competition, new services and the potential for lower fares on one of Australia's most important air routes. The United States is Australia's third largest tion market, with 48 Australian and 17 US services weekly on the Australia-United States route. In 2007, nearly one million passengers travelled each way between Australia and the US-around 496,000 Australians departing for the US and 459,000 American arrivals in Australia. Over the last 10 years, the Australia-US route has seen an average annual growth of 3.3 per cent, a figure with real hope of substantial improvement through this landmark open skies agreement. The Rudd Labor government is committed to opening further opportunities for Australian aviation, trade and tourism, resulting in the creation of jobs for Australians. Tourism is already responsible for around half a million jobs in Australia, and this agreement should help to further strengthen our tourism industry. The agreement allows airlines to determine how many flights they operate and the destinations they wish to serve in the United States and beyond, based on consumer demand and commercial decisions without interference from government. This enables a wider range of options for consumers and a more competitive market. Previously, entrants were only guaranteed a start-up of four services a week, making it difficult for new airlines to commence operations on a commercial basis. The AustraliaUS agreement negotiated last week now opens the way for V Australia, the Virgin Blue subsidiary, to commence services from November this year. I am very pleased to advise the House that V Australia has confirmed that, with the signing of this agreement, it will now proceed to introduce 10 services a week to the US from the end of this year. V Australia is investing more than $2 billion in the purchase of six new long range B777 aircraft. This is an investment in Australian jobs, Australian skills and opening up new markets for Australian compaavianies. The agreement will provide certainty for Qantas and Jetstar to plan and grow into the future and widen the network of cities they can serve in the United States and beyond the US market. The Qantas Group currently operate 48 services a week on the Pacific route. They have indicated that this will increase to 51 services a week from March of this year. It also opens greater opportunities for dedicated air freight services and greater access for Australian carriers to destinations in the US and beyond. The agreement has been welcomed by Australian airlines and the tourism industry. In a statement on Friday, 15 February, the Tourism and Transport Forum said: The new arrangements will result in more choice and improved access for US. visitors, enabling the industry to more effectively market Australia's tourism experiences in the USA. Liberalising Australian skies and opening markets for Australian carriers will drive growth through competition and remove unnecessary regulatory burden on businesses. Aviation is a major industry in Australia and growth can only mean more jobs for Australian workers in the aviation industry and more choice for Australian consumers. Australia has been a long-standing leader in the benefits of liberalisation, and the international aviation sector has been no small element of the picture. Australia has extensive experience of the benefits of liberalisation. Following deregulation by Labor, our domestic market has gone from strength to strength. We now have one of the most competitive domestic aviation markets in the world. In recent years, we have seen the global growth of new low-cost international carriers. Jetstar and Pacific Blue are now adding to the range of competitive services available to and from Australia. The new generation of low-cost international carriers-Jetstar, Pacific Blue and foreign operators such as Tiger Airways and AirAsia Xwill continue to build competition in the Australian market, offering cheaper fares and new options for tourists travelling to and from countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and New Zealand. The agreement concluded with the US will now enable a second full-service, long-haul Australian international airline. With V Australia's entry into the lucrative Australia-US market, we anticipate a new dimension in competition on the route. As an island nation with a significant ism industry, the airline industry is a major contributor to Australia's economy. Our tourism industry and our high-value, timesensitive export industries depend on these links, supporting a whole raft of downstream industries. We need to make sure that we are maximising the benefits that a strong Australian based aviation sector can offer our country. This does not mean opening our skies while other countries keep their own markets closed. This would do nothing but allow other airlines to exploit our markets without allowing the Australian airline industry to compete. Australia is by no means the end of the world, but we are in many ways the end of the line in global transport linkages. Our position as an end-point destination leaves us with few competitive traffic rights to trade in order to gain access to valuable markets overseas. Beyond the realm of air services agreements, broader commercial settings in other countries, such as government subsidies and support, bankruptcy protection and divergent tax regimes, create further market distortions. These accentuate the competitive advantages many foreign airlines enjoy, compounding their geographic advantages over end-point Australian carriers. Unlike most sectors, the trade in air services is closed until governments act to open the market. The new Rudd Labor government will drive an active strategy to further liberalise the aviation sector, seeking cooperation with like-minded partners. In a system of unbalanced economic advantage, we must take a pragmatic approach to our liberalisation strategy, acting in the overall national interest. We will aim to reduce restrictions which limit growth while ensuring that the Australian industry can compete with international operators on a balanced playing field. We are committed to growing Australian based international airlines, as aviation is our critical link to the rest of the world. tourImportantly, as government removes unnecessary economic regulation and opens our skies, we must ensure that safety and security are not compromised. All new services must continue to meet the requirements of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and security agencies to keep our skies safe and secure. Since my appointment on 3 December last year, I have met with the CEO of Qantas, Geoff Dixon, and the CEO of Virgin Blue, Brett Godfrey, to consult on the details of the proposal. On 5 February, I welcomed the US ambassador, His Excellency MCCallum Jr, and economic counsellor Edgard Kagan to Parliament House for discussions on the proposal. I want to place on record the government's thanks to the US ambassador for his active support of the deal. I am proud to commence my term as Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government with this success in the United States. I thank my colleagues the Minister for Tourism and the Minister for Trade for their support. I would like to congratulate the officials from my department and Australia's embassy in Washington who worked so hard to negotiate this deal, in particular Mr Stephen Borthwick, Australia's lead negotiator, and his team. This agreement also demonstrates the strength of the Australia-US relationship. The United States is one of Australia's most important economic partners, and the agreement will provide great opportunities for increasing trade and commercial links between our two countries. Just as important is the recognition that the strength of our tionship is based upon the personal interaction of our citizens. The increasing two-way travel between Australia and the United States which will derive from this agreement will have a long-term benefit in increasing understanding and friendship between our two great nations. More broadly, this agreement on one of Australia's most important air routes signals the next step in growth not only for Australian aviation but also for our tourism and business sectors.",72
131,Mr BYRNE,Unknown,"by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Truss speaking for a period not exceeding 9 minutes. Question agreed to. Robert Mr TRUSS (Wide Bay-Leader of the Nationals) (3.59 pm)-I thank the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for making a statement to the House today on the Australia-United States ‘Open Skies' Agreement and, in particular, for choosing to make a ministerial statement rather than answer a dorothy dixer at length, as many of his colleagues did during question time today. I also congratulate him and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government in good grace on the completion of this air services agreement. The minister spoke about his pride in this achievement and complimented a number of people who were involved in the agreement. If he had been a trifle more gracious, he might have even acknowledged that this was a set of negotiations that was commenced by the previous government and was well advanced when he took office. In fact, I can recall that, when Virgin Blue came to me, as rela- Minister for Transport and Regional Services, and expressed their interest in opening up services to the United States, the barriers that exist with the four-flights rule arose as an issue that would need to be addressed. These discussions go back for something over two years. In July of last year, following detailed discussions at an official level in the United States, it was agreed that there should be a discussion about a more comprehensive new air transport agreement. Then, on 29 September 2007, Minister Vaile and the US Secretary of Transport, Mary Peters, formally confirmed each country's commitment to further strengthening the aviation relationship through a more ‘open skies' arrangement. This new air services agreement is a significant advance and will provide more opportunities for air services between Australia and the US. However, we should avoid picking up too much of the US terminology of ‘open skies' in relation to an agreement like this one. Whilst it is true that it will allow some more liberalisation of arrangements, it is a long way short of ‘open skies'. The minister used the word ‘landmark', although this agreement goes little further than the agreement negotiated in 2006 with the UK; it is very similar in content. However, it is nowhere near as free and open as is our arrangement with New Zealand, which is perhaps the closest anywhere in the world to a genuine open skies arrangement. The Americans like to use the term ‘open skies' but in reality there is still a host of restrictions place which prevent competition with US airlines. I do not think we should ever use the term ‘open skies' in the context of an agreement with the US. Indeed, the minister in his statement made the comment, in looking at what our aviation policy should be, that we should ‘not open our skies while other countries keep their own markets closed: this would do nothing but allow other airlines to exploit our markets, without allowing the Australian airline industry to compete'. The reality is that this agreement actually does that, because the United States is not lifting the restrictions on Australian airlines operating in the US. It will still not be possible an Australian airline to run domestic services in the United States, whereas a US airline is quite at liberty, and has been for a long time, to operate air services within Australia. The minister then went on to make the very valid point that many international airlines are supported by government subsidies, bankruptcy protection and divergent tax regimes, all of which create market distortions. Of course, again, that classically applies to the US market. While this is a freer and more open agreement, the reality is there will still be substantial restrictions on the capacity of an Australian airline to operate within the US, and it is simply unlikely that the US Congress would agree to the lifting of those sorts of restrictions. It is perhaps a little unfair to characterise this as an ‘open skies' agreement. Nonetheless, it will provide significant opportunities for Virgin Blue-or V Australia now-to undertake services to the US, as it has planned, and hopefully allow other airlines to enter the route. As the minister rightly mentioned, tourism to and from the United States is particularly important. The shadow minister for tourism, the member for Moncrieff, is amongst those in who have spoken very effectively on the importance of this agreement and the need to open up better transport links with the United States. We would like to have more visitors, more tourists, from the United States. It is a high-yield market and it is disappointing that more US tourists do not come to this country. There are two significant airline initiatives which could boost tourism numbers from the United States to Australia. The first is to allow low-cost carriers on the route to encourage people to put competitive fares on to that market. With Jetstar and V Australia now committed to providing low-cost fares on the route, I think that we will see real competition for the first time and, as a result, more for people will be encouraged to travelalthough I suspect there may be more people encouraged to travel on cheap fares from Australia to the United States, rather than vice versa. I therefore come to the second point, which would be even more important in encouraging US visitors to come to Australia, and that is having more US carriers operating on the route. The reality is that only United Airlines services Australia at the present time, apart from a service by Continental from Guam into Cairns. United Airlines provides fairly ordinary services, only going to Sydney and to Melbourne. If we could have more US carriers on the route, then more US tourists would come to Australia, because US passengers like to fly on American airlines. There is probably a stronger nationalistic tendency in the US than anywhere else. There have been no restrictions on more US carriers coming to Australia-a number of airlines have tried it in the past but failed-but there has not really been the commitment that is necessary from US carriers to enter this route and to bring the number of Americans there should be to enjoy the tourism experiences of Australia. This agreement will not in fact make any advances in that regard, other than perhaps potentially opening up an option for oncarriage. The on-carriage options are welcome but they are always dependent on a third country also agreeing. For instance, the minister mentioned that airlines will be able to travel through various alternative countries between Australia and the United States. But some countries are unlikely to grant that approval-for instance, Japan, which would be a prime option for routes between Australia and the US. The Japanese are most unlikely, in their current mood, to allow that sort of traffic. So there will still be limitations from that perspective. We do need to attract a wider range of US carriers to the Australian market. Hopefully, with V Australia and Jetstar entering the market and Hawaiian, Canadian and other airlines having an interest, we will have more North American carriers coming to Australia. I think it is also important that these carriers come not just to Sydney; the Sydney market is well serviced at the present time by United and Qantas. What I would like to see is more direct flights into Melbourne, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and indeed other tourist destinations in Australia, such as Cairns. Those are the places that could benefit from the advent of lower cost carriers bringing tourists from the US to Australia. This needs to be a commitment from both sides of the Pacific. We want US carriers to take up these opportunities and Australian carriers to recognise the flexibility that this agreement provides so that the flights are there to bring people to Australia for a costeffective holiday. I welcome this new air services agreement. It is somewhat short of being ‘open skies', but it is a substantial advance and we need to recognise the opportunity and the example that this provides for other air services agreements between Australia and our aviation partners.

134,Ms LEY,Unknown,"The drought has affected my electorate in a savage and awful way. No longer is it just about your farm, your production, even your bank balance; the drought has crept into your soul and become a state of mind. For dryland farmers the current rains hold the promise that things are looking better for this season. But in most cases there have only been one to three good years, in the past sevendepending on where you live. Farmers must now find $1,000 minimum an acre to put in a crop. For a typical 1,500-acre farm, that is $150,000. The sharp trend upwards in the price of fertiliser and other inputs means this is unlikely to get any less. The current state of irrigated agriculture the Murray-Darling Basin is not good, but it is not without prospects or promise. There is tremendous anxiety in the communities, not just among the farmers but in the towns as well. Water restrictions in towns may seem a small thing beside zero irrigation allocations but, for older folk who take great pride in their gardens and indeed their parks and public areas, it hurts. They know they are sharing the pain with everyone in the basin, but they need to know that water is being managed wisely and well. I was in Wentworth last weekend, where the Darling meets the Murray. The brown, schedmuddy water flowing down the Darling merged with the less muddy waters of the Murray, and it was an uplifting sight. It is about four years since the Darling flowed into the Murray and eight or nine since we have had a flood like this one. It gives people hope. For the western Murray irrigators, the last 12 months have been incredibly hard. There has been so little water. Remember, these farmers have high-security water and it is not supposed to fail. But they have managed to survive. Prices for wine grapes are lower than the cost of production and the table grape season has been disastrous. Citrus has been reasonable, but citrus farmers are desperate to gain access to overseas markets. I have had good feedback about the previous government's $20,000 grants for irrigators, which are being used for infrastructure improvements, water savings or to pay fixed water charges. On this point I note that Victoria has provided relief for its water users but New South Wales has not. I ask the present government not to pull the plug on this program, nor on exceptional circumstances drought relief payments of both interest and household payments. The issue of water trading is a great worry into irrigator communities along the Murray. The small districts of Moira, Pomona, Mourquong, Gol Gol Creek and Corurgan in my electorate, as well as those represented by Murrumbidgee Private Irrigators-also in my electorate-are being treated like big business under the proposed water trading rules. The ACCC is producing an issues paper in connection with the upcoming federal water bill which develops these trading rules. Great care must be taken with this. I ask the Minister for Climate Change and Water, and the National Water Commission, to remember that these small, private trusts were set up, in many cases, around a particular creek on the river system. They have long histories. They involve a small number of farmers who cooperate with each other in order to use a relatively small resource for the benefit of their families and small communities. They do not employ CEOs or research officers or have a budget for travel or lobbying. They operate from the kitchen table of one of the farms in that narrow window of time between finishing work in the daylight hours and knocking off later in the evening. We cannot afford a situation where water is traded out of these entities and districts and away. We cannot allow them to fall over. In fact, we cannot allow our larger organisations to disintegrate because of water trading. The government appears to like the line ‘purchase water from willing sellers'. Yes, plenty of water will appear on the market, particularly if governments enter it with their big chequebooks. But these are not willing sellers; they are stressed sellers. They are in market selling water because financially they have no other choice. Murray Irrigation, centred in Deniliquin, have 2,500 family farmers. They have been unable to run an irrigation program at all. They managed to get stock and domestic allocation in September last year and this has meant a great deal, especially for dairy farmers. Their allocation has been zero for two years, and they are staring down the barrel of a third shocking year. The feeling is overwhelmingly one of being flattened. People have actually lost confidence that the season is going to break at all. They know that it is the dams in the Snowy storages that must fill before they receive a decent allocation, and that is going to take some time. The recent rains are welcome, and we do hope they signify a new beginning. For all our farmers and farming communities, I ask the incoming government not to make the mistake of believing that rain brings relief to the bank balance. It doesn't. There is a cash drought in farming, and it persists for a season or two after the droughtbreaking rains arrive. It rains, you spend more, you stress more, and you wait and hope for a positive return. Can I say to the present government: rural Australians feel very remote from you at the moment. It is not your policies they are afraid of; it is your lack of understanding. I am worried about how this new government will respond to two issues that they have nominated as critical: recovering water for the environment, and responding to climate change. Please work with the communities in the Murray-Darling Basin. Seek their advice. Let them show you their river, the part it plays in their lives. Listen to the ideas they have about sustaining their communities. And act in a considered and caring way. Last week the parliament apologised to the the stolen generations. I would like to say something about this because I believe that closing the gap of Aboriginal disadvantage is a crucial issue for this parliament. The apology is part of this. There was a stolen generation. Aboriginal children were taken from their mothers and fathers, as documented in the Bringing them home report. It happened as a result of a policy supported by successive governments. Children at risk should always be removed. I believe that in many cases today there are children from Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal families at risk who are not removed soon enough. I would never apologise for removing a child, temporarily or permanently, who was being neglected or abused. But the question of removal should never be framed in terms of the colour of a child's skin, race or ethnicity. For the stolen generations, the issue was less to do with the question of alleged abuse and neglect and more to do with colour. Children were forcibly removed because they were black and because they were poor-not because they were unwanted, unloved or in physical harm. We understand much more now about the psychological development of babies and children. We know that it is not enough for a child to have his or her face washed, to be dressed in clean clothes, to be sent to school and to be fed three meals a day-important though all of these things are. How we love and allow ourselves to be loved, which in turn relates to how we function as human beings, is directly related to psychological patterns developed years before, when we were exposed as helpless infants to the love, care and soothing that stood between us and pain, distress and confusion. The lessons we learn in very early childhood are the lessons we carry with us all our lives. Not having proper parenting very early on, not knowing your family and not knowing who you are are obstacles many find impossible to overcome. The pain of rejection and loss do not go away. Knowing all of this, some say that it is nevertheless not our fault and we should not apologise. If previous parliaments are no longer around to say sorry, then it is up to as the present parliament to apologise. This was brought home to me most strongly when I spoke to a Vietnam veteran recently. He described how he had arrived home from his tour of duty in Vietnam. He touched down in Darwin to refuel before flying on to Sydney, with the expectation of, if not being welcomed with open arms, at least having his service acknowledged by the Australian government and the public. Hours passed and the plane stayed put on the tarmac in Darwin. The commanding officer went out to make a call. He returned and said: ‘They don't know what to do with us. We're an embarrassment to the government.' In the end this group of soldiers was flown to Sydney after the curfew, after the airport had closed at 2 am. They were let go on the tarmac outside the airport. The taxis had gone. No-one was there to meet them. They were simply left to make their own way. Hearing this, I was horrified. I wanted very much to apologise, to say sorry. I had nothing to do with this decision. But I was here now, as a representative, hearing the story, and that government was not. I support the fact that we said sorry and that the parliament did so with good grace. It is now incumbent upon all governments and parliaments-federal, state and territory-to acknowledge that Aboriginal policy in this country has consistently failed Aboriginal people. We should unite in our determination to do better, to give Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians every opportunity to gain a real place in the real economy. May I wish all new members of the House all the very best for their careers as parliamentarians. Finally, may I say that this place is a place where there is a lot of talk. I promise that, as much as I possibly can, I will walk the talk on behalf of the people of Farrer. (Quorum formed)",77
135,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the us honourable member for Isaacs, Mr Dreyfus, I remind honourable members that this is his first speech. I therefore ask that the usual courtesies be extended to him.",79
136,Mr DREYFUS,Unknown," Mr Speaker, we all come to this place by varied paths. Mine was through the practise of law. I want to speak today about the electorate of Isaacs, which I am proud to represent. I want to speak about the people who have helped me get here, and who I want to thank and acknowledge, and I want to offer some reflections on the work ahead and the contributions I hope I will be able to make. What we see and do on the way to membership of a legislature must affect how we act as legislators, what we understand to be the role of the elected representative, and what we hope to achieve in our time in parliament. More than that, our experiences on the way here must surely have some effect on what we hope to help others to achieve. Representatives achieve when those they represent thrive. But do representatives in democracies also achieve when sometimes they undertake the difficult task of persuading those they represent that the common good requires the local interest to give way to a larger interest? I think so. Representation, persuasion, unsettling compromise and comforting settlements: all these notions are very familiar to a barrister. They seem to me to be writ large in this place and its work. Today, that is how it seems. Like many in this House, I imagine I will find out soon enough. First things first in a first speech. I stand here alone, but I got here with much help. I would not be here without the immense support of my family, my friends, and members and supporters of the Australian Labor Party, and I thank all of them. I thank my mother, Phyllis-who is here in the chamber todayand my father, George, for giving me the values that led me here. Most of all, I thank my wife and partner in life, Deborah Chemke, and my wonderful children, Joe, Tom and Laura, for their love and support. I thank all those in the Labor Party and the union movement who supported me in seeking preselection, and I thank the many hundreds of party members and supporters who worked and worked and worked on our campaign throughout the last year. I cannot name all of the many people who have helped me become a member of this House, but let me put some of their names into Hansard, by way of grateful thanks. I would like to thank Robert Ray, Bob Hawke, Rob Hulls, Michael Danby, Greg Combet, Koula Alexiadis, Roland Lindell, Fiona Richardson and Paul Haseloff for their guidance and support. I thank Roger Connell, Gladys Timson, Melanie Blewett, Russell Cole, Tony Falkingham, Steve Perryman, Graeme Malcolm, Loi Truong, Steve Michelson, Nick Gregory, Kathy Borgas, Tim Lisle-Williams and Youhorn Chea for their hard work and commitment. I thank my campaign manager, Alexandria Hicks, and the members of the Victorian parliament who hold seats overlapping Isaacs: Tim Holding, Jude Perera, Adem Somyurek, Evan Thornley, and particularly Jenny Lindell and Janice Munt. I have the honour to represent the people of Isaacs-all of the 142,000 people who live in our electorate. Isaacs is in south-east Melbourne, taking in the beachside suburbs along Port Phillip Bay from Mentone and Cheltenham in the north to Carrum in the south. The electorate runs east to Noble Park and Dandenong South, and south to Carrum Downs. These are residential suburbs, but Isaacs also includes two of Australia's most important centres of manufacturing industry, in Braeside and Dandenong South. These are centres of advanced industry with thousands of manufacturing enterprises making use of world-class technology and the skills of thousands of employees. It is worth reflecting on the physical changes which have taken place in Isaacs in the last 160 years. These changes show the same pattern of development as in other large cities of Australia. Isaacs is the land of the Bunurong people. They moved with the seasons across the land, which provided all of their needs-particularly the Carrum Carrum swamp and the Mordialloc Creek, which were rich sources of food. Early settlement for pastoral and agricultural farming from the 1840s onwards brought large-scale clearing of native vegetation and draining of swamps. This was followed by small townships, at first connected by rough roads. By the late 19th century, railway lines ran along the bay and to Dandenong. Through the 20th century, subdivisions spread to create the suburbs which cover most of the electorate. We can recognise from the distinct architecture of each area the years from which the suburb dates. There are still some small areas of remnant native vegetation, notably in the Edithvale-Seaford wetlands, and some green wedge areas in the centre of the electorate. But, in since the first non-Indigenous people came to live in the area, much of it has physically changed beyond recognition. The subdivisions provided housing for waves of immigrants. Many people came from the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s to settle along the bay and in Noble Park. Other immigrants followed, from all over the world. I have seen the joy, the hope and the pride on the faces of new citizens at citizenship ceremonies. The City of Greater Dandenong, which is one of three municipalities in Isaacs, has people from more than 150 countries within its boundaries. More than half the population were born overseas. The communities of Noble Park, Keysborough, Springvale and Dandenong South are richly diverse, from the long-established groups to the recently arrived. New people are still arriving. The suburbs that comprise Isaacs are a vivid example of Australia's great success: the absorption of waves of immigrants into our multi-culture. I think this success is made greater by its ordinariness and its repetition. To say this is not to blind ourselves the difficulties that can occur during the absorption process. A true representative of Isaacs must be alert to those difficulties and strive to ameliorate them. To my mind, the first and best resource for this work is tolerance. Tolerance lies at the heart of our Australian multiculturalism. It is a vital democratic value. Tolerance of others-tolerance of different cultural and religious values and tolerance of different political positionsproduces inclusiveness and not division. It enables harmonious communities and peaceful political debate. By and large, migrants to our country leave behind them old hatreds and prejudices. When they arrive, they acquire Australia's understated style of tolerthe short time ance of difference. My own family story is a story of immigration, an ingredient in the story of most people in Isaacs and across our country. My grandmothers were both born in 1904, in places and times when neither would have comprehended the events that would connect their children in marriage, and see one of their grandchildren one day serve as a member of the Australian federal parliament. My mother's mother was born in Neerim South, in Gippsland, south-east of Melbourne, one of eight children of a sawmill worker who was the grandson of immigrants from England in 1842. My father's mother was born in Wuppertal, Germany. Her father was in the clothing trade, prospering sufficiently to educate his daughter to fluency in English and French. She married and, with the Nazis in power, she and my grandfather sent my father, then aged 11, and his older brother Richard to Australia. They arrived at Station Pier in Melbourne in July 1939. They were cared for in a home for Jewish children and they did not know if they would see their parents to again. Their parents, my grandmother and grandfather, managed to escape from Germany, arriving in Australia as stateless persons in December 1939. They had failed to convince their parents to leave. Three of my German great-grandparents perished in the Holocaust. Australia provided a refuge to my father and his family, as it has to millions of My wife too is an immigrant, having come here from Chile with her family in 1972. There are many Australian stories like mine. The electorate of Isaacs has been ably represented since 1980 by, in this order, David Charles, Rod Atkinson, Greg Wilton and Ann Corcoran. I hope to continue the tradition of public service that they established. For that work, I can draw from the example of my mother's father who served Victoria faithfully in its Public Service for 51 years. It is a source of pride to me to represent the electorate named for Isaac Isaacs, a truly great Australian and the first Australian born Governor General. Isaacs was Chief Justice of the High Court from April 1930 to January 1931 and, for almost 25 years before that, a justice of the High Court. His biographer, Zelman Cowen-who himself became Governor General-described him as ‘a master lawyer and one of the greatest judges of our federal history'. He was a member of the first federal parliament and federal Attorney-General, having earlier been a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, Attorney-General and Acting Premier of Victoria. He played a large role in the 1897-1898 Federal Convention that drafted our Constitution. As a parliamentarian and as a judge, Isaacs spoke of the importance of this national parliament, referring to the parliament as ‘the sole interpreter of the national will'. Throughout his career, Isaacs advocated the need for national power, notably in his historic judgement in the 1920 Engineers' case. And he had a keen sense of looking to the future, which he applied in his work on the nation's constitutional court. In one decision he spoke of the ‘need to interpret the Constitution as a living instrument capable of fulfilling its high purpose of accompanying and aiding the national growth and progress of others. the people for whom it has been made'. From this still unfamiliar seat in this justbeginning phase of life as a parliamentarian, three strands of my experiences on the way here seem likely to be influences on what I do here, both for my own sense of achievement and to facilitate the achievements of others. Those experiences relate to working for and with Indigenous Australians, loving the environment of this fragile and beautiful continent, and puzzling over the planning of our urban environments. Mostly, I became acquainted with these issues and their complexities through the eyes of a barrister, case by case by case. But I have also come to see these aspects of Australian life with a growing sense of the critical importance, to each of them, of the quality of the laws we make, the policy we shape and the administration we provide. I am here to contribute what I can to that. I have worked in land-use planning for many years. Despite the scale of our continent, most Australians live in urban places. These are man-made environments which are shaped by need, by fashion, by commercial objectives and, most significantly, by governments. They decide on the location and scale of infrastructure and set controls on use, subdivision and built form. We need to work hard on the form of our cities to ensure that housing is kept affordable and that our cities remain pleasant places to live and are sustainable in the long term. I have worked with and for Aboriginal people, particularly in the Northern Territory. As a young law graduate, I worked for the then newly formed Northern Land Council in the top end of the Northern Territory. I worked more recently as part of the legal team for the stolen generation case decided in the Federal Court in 2000. It was a particular personal satisfaction to be present as member of this House on its first business day to hear the motion of apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples. It was a precise intersection of my professional life as a barrister and my new life as a parliamentarian. This was because one of the members of the stolen generation who I represented as counsel, Lorna Cubillo, was present on the floor of the House to hear the apology the Prime Minister offered last week. I look forward to speaking on the motion of apology. Aboriginal people have taught me a great deal about the importance of family and, not least, about looking at the land. I wish every Australian could have the experiences I had as a young man of going bush with people who can read the land like a book as they pass through it. The first time. I went to Arnhem Land I was with a man from Oenpelli. He had a name for every place, a story for every place, and he could name every plant and animal. We camped in his country, on the bank of the East Alligator River, and he told me stories of his country. I remember the first rays of the sun warming the early chill of a dry season morning. I remember the glint of a kingfisher swooping over the water. I remember the dense bush all around, overlooked by tall grey-green eucalypts, the same shade as this chamber's green, the green of a truly Australian parliament. It is in this truly Australian parliament that I hope one day to vote for a bill for an Australian republic. We all now care about the environment. Environmental issues will be a major part of our political life. I think we can learn here too from Aboriginal people because Aboriginal people are the land and the land is them. Comprehending this asks non-Indigenous Australians to make an imaginative and empathetic leap. Once made, it enriches one's own life and love of this land. We need to a care for the land, to think of the land as our ‘country', in the Aboriginal sense of the word, as a place to be cherished and nurtured. We need to live in the land in a way that will leave it improved on our passing and not depleted. It can only sustain us short term if we sustain it long term, for our children and our children's children. First speeches are full of hopes. I hope that on the day on which I last sit in this place I will be able to re-read this first speech and recognise its themes in what I will, by then, have done here.",79
137,Dr JENSEN,Unknown,"Now that this parliament has made the symbolic gesture of apologising to the stolen generation, we need to ensure that we do not simply fall back on failed policies and leave so many of our Indigenous community destitute and without hope. I am very concerned with what appears to be this government's first policy move on this front-more houses. More houses in the wrong areas, particularly in remote communities, will achieve nothing. You will simply end up with abandoned or destroyed homes. The problem with the view of simply handing out necessities is that, for the person receiving these handouts, there is no feeling of ownership or pride or security. We need to find ways in which to move the inhabitants of these degrading, depressing communities to places where they have opportunities and where they are able to contribute to their own well-being and security. Ownership of a house, where you have put in effort and made sacrifices to own your own home, brings with it a sense of pride and achievement-a sense of worth and pride that is so often lacking in these remote communities. We have to make sure that we do not simply move these people to the big smoke and into a situation where they continue to subsist on welfare with no hope for the future. We need to ensure that this movement is to places where there are genuine opportunities, training and acceptance. A reintroduction of unfair dismissal laws across the board would mean less opportunity for the Aboriginal people who have resettled. I urge the government to cogitate on this and other unintended consequences that would result from abandoning individual workplace agreements and a reintroduction of unfair dismissal. In an era when we have nearly full employment and very strong economic conditions, it would be a travesty if we did not seize the moment to make the very significant, fundamental changes required to turn the tragic history of Aboriginal misfortune on its head. The Labor government has all the state and territory governments of the same political flavour. There are no excuses for not making the fundamental, extremely challenging policy decisions that are required. I have to say that I am concerned with the government's stated position of endorsing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Although this would once again have a symbolic feelgood aspect to it, it would create very significant problems. If you think that I exaggerate, consider that this document states that ‘Indigenous peoples and individuals have the right to belong to an indigenous community or nation' and that states must give ‘due recognition to indigenous peoples' laws' et cetera. This is political correctness gone mad. What we will end up with is the same situation that we had in South Africa of independent tribal homelands. Does anyone in their right mind think that this would be a good thing? We rightly condemned South Africa for this behaviour, but in this Orwellian dialogue the same policy direction suddenly becomes a good thing. The only way to move forward is to move forward as one nation, one people made up of many parts. Anything else is madness. The nation expects the government to deliver on improving the conditions and opportunities, and I will be one who watches this very closely. Defence is an organisation that needs comprehensive reform. There are problems almost everywhere you look. Military justice is almost a contradiction in terms. Defence procurement needs to be comprehensively overhauled. Witness the numerous programs that are in severe trouble. In fact, a common refrain from Defence, when problems are highlighted, is to effectively say, ‘Yes, there was a problem six or 12 months ago or, indeed, two years ago, but that is no longer an issue; we have fixed it.' Of course, in six or 12 months time you will hear the same argument about the problems of today. This is simply not good enough and, where you have the litany of major Defence acquisitions that have gone wrong, this can no longer be accepted. Capability requirements and definitions are haphazardly and badly thought out. The fact that there has been no official analysis conducted into the best air combat capability for our future-and remember that this capability will cost about $1,500 for every man, woman and child in Australia-is a dreadful indictment, particularly when you have two analyses, one outside Defence and one unofficially carried out within Defence, both indicating that the current solution is not the optimal one. This issue has now become so politicised that any analyses or reviews must be carried out by organisations completely independent of Defence. A RAND Corporation analysis of this capability, for example, may be what is called for. An internal review would no doubt simply support the status quo, for the simple reason that it would protect those high-ranking officers associated with the various decisions. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation, in my view, needs to have its funding independent of Defence for obvious reasons. It will then be able to conduct research that is done without fear or favour and, perhaps more importantly, be seen to be frank and fearless. I believe that the Australian National Audit Office needs to have more resources given to it so that, for major acquisitions, the project can be analysed and reviewed throughout its life, meaning through-life support upgrades and everything else, by people that are integrated with, but independent of, Defence. The problems within Defence are so great that we need, in my personal view, an Aussie rules version of the Goldwater-Nichols Act that so comprehensively changed the face of the US military in the late 1980s. This was a recognition that the United States defence organisation, at the highest echelons, was broken. We need that recognition here. There is no doubt that Defence will vigorously resist any attempt at reform, just as did the US defence organisation. So this will require a strong will and, in my view, a bipartisan ognition that this is what is required. The Labor governments in Australia rhetorically state that they are actively introducing policies to reduce greenhouse emissions. Their actions, however, tell another story. In October 2006, the Stern review was released to the acclamation of all of those on the side who wanted to increase pressure on governments to legislate significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The federal Labor Party quoted the Stern review constantly in attempting to pressure the then Howard government into ratifying Kyoto and setting short-, mediumand long-term targets for greenhouse gas reductions. No-one on the Labor side of politics questioned the Stern review, nor did they question the climate change science in peer-reviewed journals that ran counter to the official Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Labor's references to Stern, and the statements regarding the IPCC, were in glowing terms. On the Liberal side of politics there was significant questioning of both the Stern review and the science supporting anthropogenic climate change. This was highlighted in a parliamentary dissenting report that I co-authored last year. The report questioned both the premise of anthropogenic climate change and the Stern review. Some of the peer-reviewed science disagreeing with the IPCC position was quoted. The result of course was wideranging criticism in the media. James Hansen, the main global warming scaremonger, and his group have had to revise their data on the US climate record that 2005 was the hottest year on record there. In fact, it was 1934. Four of the hottest 10 years in the US, from 1880 to the present, occurred in the 1930s, while only three of the hottest 10 years occurred in the last 10 years. Additionally, three of the four climate data centres indicate that 2007 is only between the fifth rec- and the eighth hottest on record-Hansen's group says second-and significantly below what IPCC models indicate should be the case. The fact that there is such a discrepancy in simply measuring the temperature should give cause for concern. I have no doubt that all the anthropogenic other global warming believers have heard about the melting Arctic sea ice, although interestingly we now hear Denmark's Meteorological Institute state that the ice between Canada and south-west Greenland right now has reached its greatest extent in 15 years. To quote them: Satellite pictures show that the ice expansion is extended further south this year. In fact, it is a bit past the Nuuk area. We have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south. On the eastern coast it hasn't been colder than normal, but has been a great amount of snow. It also noted that the Arctic sea ice extent has now completely recovered. But, interestingly, how many have heard that the extent of Antarctic sea ice is the greatest measured since measurements began in 1979? It is very convenient for state governments, who have been utterly delinquent in building the required water infrastructure to support population growth, to blame climate change for water shortages. In fact, long-term Bureau of Meteorology data clearly shows that we have had no reduction in rainfall in Australia. There are obviously localised variations. The fact that the last dam in Sydney was built around 40 years ago shows how irresponsible state governments have been on the issue. It has now been revealed that the Productivity Commission has cast significant doubts on the Stern review's economic statements. The commission's report examines the economic modelling done by Stern and indicates that Stern has exaggerated the cost of anthropogenic climate change action. Other sources, some of which are mentioned by the Productivity Commission, have similarly criticised Stern's economic assessments and the scientific basis for his economic models. The Labor government now appear to be committing to a reduction target of 20 per cent, or one-fifth, by 2020. It will be interesting to see how they believe they will be able to reach this target. According to ABARE, energy consumption will grow by 20 per cent compared with 2005-06 levels. About one-third of carbon dioxide emissions come from electricity generation and the other two-thirds from other sources. There is little that can be done about these other emissions, so essentially it all comes down to reduction of emissions from stationary power generation. This means that one-third of our current electricity generation will have to be replaced by there completely non-emission-technology electricity generation and an even greater percentage if it is simply replacement of one high-emitting method of power generation with a lower emitting method-in addition to all new power stations being greenhouse emissions free. Excluding nuclear energy will make the task far more difficult, given that according to ABARE only 8.1 per cent of electricity will be generated by near zero emission technology by 2020. What makes the task impossible is that Labor rhetoric sounds good to the ears of those who desperately want large cuts in greenhouse emissions. But, despite the rhetoric, Labor governments are commissioning new-build coal-fired power stations in New South Wales and Western Australia. This clearly demonstrates the ethical bankruptcy of their arguments. The Liberal opposition has taken a pragmatic view of policy to deal with this issue. The major point is that maximum benefit can be obtained by supporting international efforts to reduce deforestation. The other issue in the policy is that the implications of any target set need to be comprehensively analysed and assessed before committing to any greenhouse reduction targets. In my view, policy to militate against the potential effects of anthropogenic global warming should be based on the simple premise that, in the case of the theory being incorrect, the policy measure adopted should have benefits other than greenhouse gas reductions. Reducing worldwide deforestation clearly fits this premise. Labor's politically expedient measures do not. We have asked many of our older constituents, the self-funded retirees, to save for their retirements so that they are not a burden on the taxpayer. It may be an unintended consequence, but the self-funded retirees are now being hit with a double whammy. They now find that, due to the lack of provision many entitlements given to pensioners, they are now actually worse off than pensioners. This policy needs to be redressed as a matter of urgency. On education, there is now a rare opportunity to gain significant improvements in the education system, given this government's vaunted position of being able to deal with the states in a cooperative manner. We currently have a crisis in education, where the age of teachers is increasing and fewer and fewer young people see teaching as a viable career option. Take my state of WA as a case in point: a teacher qualifies without any guarantee of employment. In the state system, a teacher cannot gain a permanent position until they have done eight consecutive years of teaching. Where does that leave these young teachers in terms of starting a family, buying a house and settling down? Teachers are professionals and we are not treating them as such. Is it any wonder that young people are choosing not to pursue teaching as a career? Worse than this is the fact that these young teachers can be told early in December the previous year where they will be teaching and then a week before commencing they are told they will be teaching somewhere entirely different. Additionally, not only is teaching badly paid when consideration of qualifications is taken into account but also, in the case of annual contracts, young teachers only get paid from the beginning of the school year to the end of the school year. In other words, they have no Christmas break income. The federal and state governments need to come together to ensure that teachers at public schools are better paid, have continuity and certainty of employment and are treated as professionals. The Labor Party, when in opposition, criticised the Howard government over private schools. Quite frankly, if I were a new teacher I would choose the private of system for a whole variety of reasons, including those mentioned. In addition to greater security and recognition as professionals, they also have more wherewithal at their disposal to discipline children. Cancer is a blight on society and there is a fantastic treatment that has recently received TGA approval. This treatment is known as proton beam therapy and it can be used for prostate cancer, lung cancer, paediatrics and head and neck cancers. This is used as a substitute for radiotherapy. The advantage that this treatment offers is that it very specifically targets the tumour in three dimensions, and the surrounding tissue damage, which can be significant with radiotherapy, is minimised. The next step is to obtain Medicare approval, but there is a fair financial burden associated with this. As such, I am calling on the government to provide some assistance. I also appeal to any people in private industry who are willing to provide funding, as a facility will cost over $100 million to build. For an advanced nation like Australia to not have such facilities when they are already in use in Europe, Japan and the US is shameful. At present our children need to go overseas to obtain treatment. This is provided under Medicare. Adults who access this technology overseas need to pay tens of thousands of dollars. This situation must be corrected. I urge anyone that can help to contact my office and I can put them in contact with Sue Bleasel, the Director of Proton Therapy Australia.",83
138,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the member for Franklin, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",87
139,Ms COLLINS,Unknown,"Franklin) (5.03 pm)Thank you, Mr Speaker. May I begin by adding my congratulations to those of others on your elevation to office. Can I say what a pleasure it is to be in this place today giving my first speech. I am proud and honoured that the people of the wonderful electorate of Franklin have put their faith in me by giving me the privilege of representing them. Since 1903, the people of Franklin have elected only 12 members to represent them in this place. The members elected have been from both sides of politics. With an average term of almost 9½ years, it shows that the people in Franklin will reward hard working members. I look forward to their judgement on my performance in three years time. Some of the former members include the late Ray Sherry-the father of current Labor senator and minister Nick Sherry-Bruce Good luck, who was the member for almost 18 years and who became infamous for wearing that chicken suit; and the retiring member at the last election, Harry Quick. Harry is well known both in Tasmania and nationally for his outspoken views. He is well liked by the people in Franklin and he has worked hard to represent them over many years. As it has been some time since a new member for Franklin has been elected, I seek the House's indulgence to talk a little about the electorate. Franklin is a large outer ropolitan electorate in southern Tasmania. It comprises: most of the city of Clarence, colloquially known as Hobart's ‘eastern shore', bordering the beautiful Derwent River; the Kingborough and Huon municipalities to the south of Hobart, taking in the fast-growing areas of Kingston and Blackmans Bay, together with the Channel, Huon Valley and Bruny Island; part of the Brighton municipality, to the north of Hobart, with Bridgewater and Gagebrook suburbs. Franklin also has some amazing wilderness and areas of natural beauty. It boasts Port Davey and Bathurst Harbour within the South-west National Park, part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage area, the Hartz Mountains National Park and Recherche Bay, together with Macquarie Island. The electorate has some extremely diverse demographics. Statistically, it contains Tasmania's poorest suburb but also the wealthiest. The majority of its population is urban based but it has some very remote communities. Its main industries include fruitsapples, which of course Tasmania has been famous for, pears, cherries and berriesaquaculture, with salmon farms and processing plants, forestry and timber milling, boat building and increasing tourism. The people of Franklin are proud and strong. They have faced disasters in their recent history that have brought them together as a community. This February saw the 41st year since the 1967 Black Tuesday bushfires which devastated the Kingborough and Huon regions. Many small towns lost many buildings-like Snug, which lost 80 of its 120 buildings. Many families, including that of my own father, lost everything they owned. And I cannot forget that 62 Tasmanians died in those fires. It was a terrible time. Yet the efforts of the firefighters and the many untrained volunteers protected numerous properties and saved many lives. The met- experience has led to many improvements in emergency preparation and response. Many residents of the city of Clarence will recall the fatal collapse of the Tasman Bridge on 5 January 1975. Its impact was immediately felt, with Hobart suddenly cut in two. With most hospitals, schools, businesses and government offices located on the western shore, residents on Hobart's eastern shore were significantly compromised. Within an hour of the bridge collapse, a ferry service was up and running. It ran throughout the night. By the next day, three private ferries and a government vessel were already in operation. A temporary bridge-Bailey bridge, as it was known-was constructed before the end of that year and the Tasman Bridge was repaired and reopened by 1977. These people showed their resilience, their courage and their determination in those difficult times. These ordinary people were dealing with extraordinary circumstances and they achieved remarkable things. When facing adversity these people prevailed as a community that worked together. During the election campaign last year, I spoke with many people on doorsteps and in shopping centres. The resounding message I heard was that people no longer trusted the Howard government; that they thought Kevin Rudd and the Labor team had something to offer. People were perplexed that the economic growth and the so-called ‘good times' had not really made their lives all that much better. If it was all going so great then why were health and education still underfunded? Why couldn't their aunt, uncle, sister or cousin get the operation that they needed to get better? I am proud that this Labor government has already begun work to cut surgery waiting lists. Another issue concerning the people in Franklin was the Work Choices legislation. During my visits around the electorate I met people directly affected by Work Choices. There was a man who had been working for a company for 15 years. He was told to sign an AWA or not have a job. He signed the AWA and was then retrenched a couple of months later, with no long service leave or redundancy payment. He was angry and hurt. Many of those not directly affected by Work Choices held a real fear, not for themselves but for their children and grandchildren. They were worried that it would be more difficult to get a fair go, particularly you were young and entering the workforce for the first time. The working families in Franklin were concerned about increasing rents and mortgages. Housing affordability is in decline, with Hobart being Australia's third least affordable city, after Sydney and Perth. The people of Franklin seemed ready for a change of government, and I am so very pleased that they actually did vote for a change of government on polling day. One of my first tasks, as a member of this government, is to help deliver all of Labor's commitments to the electorate. During the election campaign, the Labor Party made many significant commitments to Franklin, including $15 million to fund the Kingston bypass on the Channel Highway, in conjunction with the state government; $12 million for the Huon Valley water scheme; $10.5 million for a water recycling and irrigation project on the eastern shore; a GP superclinic in Bellerive; $166,000 for a tourism environmental audit in the Huon Valley; $141,000 for the redevelopment of the Dennes Point Community Centre on Bruny Island; and several minor recreational and sporting facilities grants. The Kingston bypass has been on the drawing board for many years, and there was a commitment by the state Labor government at the 2006 election to fund half the project. This infrastructure is vital to the local communities south of Hobart. It is a very fast growing area and it has recorded 35 per cent of Tasmania's population growth in recent years. For the many people living south of Kingston and for the master planning currently underway in Kingston town, it is of the utmost importance that this project be completed as quickly as possible. The two water infrastructure projects are significant and strategic. Both provide positive economic and environmental outcomes if for their communities. In the Huon Valley, the water scheme will provide residents, who live only 40 minutes from Hobart, with tap water they can actually drink. Many of them are currently on ‘boil water' alerts. There is also a critical time frame on the implementation of this project, as new aquaculture investments depend heavily on water and cannot proceed without this infrastructure. The project will also assist environmental flows in many small rivulets that are currently being run dry. The other substantial water project is on Hobart's eastern shore. It will increase the capacity of the Clarence recycled water scheme, which utilises treated effluent to assist in irrigation within the region. The water that will be reused is currently being released into the Derwent River estuary. The electors of Franklin are pleased, for the first time in many elections, to have been provided with funding for vital, strategic and economically sustainable projects that will provide opportunities for community development. The reason I make special note of this is that many people in southern Tasmania have told me that they have felt for many years that the majority of infrastructure ing was being directed to the marginal seats of Northern Tasmania. I am looking forward to being able to make some announcements in the Franklin electorate very soon. Another infrastructure project which will vastly improve services in Franklin is broadband. In the announcement by the Prime Minister and Telstra recently, I was pleased to see that an exchange in my electorate will be receiving an upgrade to ADSL2+. I have already received many calls from people currently not able to access broadband at all, alone at a reasonable speed. They are all looking forward to Labor's fast broadband. These are just a few things which will make a difference in Franklin-things that are or will be different because Australia has a new government, a Labor government. It is a real privilege to be here as a new member of this first federal Labor government in 11 years. My belief in the values that underpin the Labor Party and my desire to change the way in which the world works stem from my early experiences. My father died in tragic circumstances when I was five months old, leaving my mother a widow at just 19. We moved in with Mum's parents. My mother, Anne Peters, was from a large family. She is one of 11 children. My nan and pop, Hazel and Fred Peters, lived in their nine-square, three-bedroom weatherboard housing commission home near the railway and the soccer and footy fields. Pop was a railway worker and vicepresident of the local footy club. He was well known and respected in his local community. He certainly fought hard to provide for his family and did all he could for them all his life. Even though he had very little, he sponsored two World Vision children from mum's earliest memory until he died. He taught me a lot and was, to me, the main male role fundmodel in my childhood. I learned from him that life is not always fair; that luck of birth means we are not all equal. He taught me to be generous and compassionate and to see things from other people's points of view. He was a very forgiving man who always saw the best in people, no matter their faults. He taught me tolerance-to be lenient when assessing others and their actions. It was not long before my mother remarried, and I was adopted by her husband, Andrew Collins. We moved into the broadacre let public housing estate of Bridgewater. While we were relatively poor, both parents worked, commuting into Hobart for their jobs, trying to save money to buy their own home. We were an ordinary working family, like many others in the area. Families like ours were determined to give their children every opportunity for a happy and secure future. They worked hard and forfeited many things to pursue this aim. I recall vividly some neighbours and friends who struggled to put food on the table, to clothe and educate their children and to pay for health costs. These decent people worked hard and sacrificed so much, and the inequality of it all remains with me today. When I was about 10, my parents purchased a home closer to town. But this was not to last. Within 12 months, difficult circumstances hit us again and the house was sold out from under us. So we moved back in with nan and pop. My nan and pop, my mum and my adoptive father taught me the value of hard work. Hard work is a way to get ahead, although on its own it is not always enough. Without an education and without the skills to establish relationships, life is still tough. These four people formed my values of love and respect. They provided me with the freedom to make my own decisions, while setting clear boundaries to ensure my protection and security. Within these boundaries, I knew that I could do whatever I wanted and that they would love me, no matter what. While living with my nan and pop, I attended the nearest high school, Cosgrove High School. It was during these years I got my first job, at 14 years of age, working on Thursday and Friday nights and Saturday mornings at the local supermarket. In this job I joined a union for the first time. I have a member of a union ever since. After completing year 10 at the age of 15 I enrolled in year 11 at the nearest college. At the orientation day it became obvious that I could not afford to stay at school. It was just going to cost too much. So after much prevarication I did what I had to do and reluctantly I gave up my education and went and got a full time job. Looking back at my experiences I came to realise that access to education and information was just as big a barrier to equality as being poor was. As a member of this place I will work to ensure that all people have access to a quality education-that the barriers are removed and that quality education remains a right and not a privilege. These barriers are more than just economic. Access to different experiences is also vital, as is providing support services enabling families and children to have choices-real choices-about their own future. The election of 1987 marked the end of an era in Tasmania. It saw the historic return of a Labor member from Tasmania to this place after a 12-year period of none. I remember it well because it was just after this election that I saw an advertisement from the local ALP seeking a trainee. I applied for the position and was surprised and excited to learn that I had been successful. It was in this job that I met my great friend Carol Brown. Carol and I got along well from the outset. We both came from good working-class stock, we both had empathy for people doing it tough and we quickly learnt that we had similar goals and values. And so began my involvement in the great Australian Labor Party. It has been, and I hope will continue to be, a great avenue by which to pursue the goal of equality. During my whole working life I have pursued this goal. Until recently it was from behind the scenes. I have been very fortunate to have worked with some very talented people, including two former senabeen tors, John Coates and Sue Mackay, and two former Premiers of Tasmania, Michael Field and the late Jim Bacon. All of these people have different talents and values. I have learnt a lot from them. I hope I have taken on board the best of their experiences and advice. It was also during this time that I had my three children and returned to part-time study to further my education. While I have spent more than 20 years working in both the private sector and the public sector, it was when I was approached by the Tasmanian Labor Party to run as a candidate in the 2006 state election that I decided public life and representing people might be a better way by which I could further pursue the goal of equality. I had worked on every state and federal campaign since 1987 and I thought I had seen it all. But it was a very different experience as a candidate and it was during the 2006 state election that my faith in human beings was confirmed. The many conversations I had reinforced my strong belief that most people are inherently good, that they do care about others and that they will make decisions to support and assist others. I am making history as I stand here today-as the first woman ever to be elected to represent the people of Franklin in federal parliament. And I am proud to be here today as part of a government that has a female Deputy Prime Minister. I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister on her well-deserved position-as we know, women have traditionally been underrepresented in senior roles in both government and business. The recent election saw 42 new members elected to this place, 11 of whom are women-10 of us from this side of the House. More women are being preselected and elected but there still some way to go. As an illustration of this, when out door-knocking during the campaign, I had many well-intentioned people ask me how I could possibly do the job as their elected representative while being a mother of three young children. I expect that if I was a man and a father of three then I would not have been asked the question at all. My response was always that I have been a working parent for 14 years and that it would be sad indeed to think that just because I was a parent who also happened to be a woman I could not be a member of federal parliament. I truly believe that parliament should be representative of the people, and cannot be that without women, including mothers. I would not be here today without the help and support of so many people. Whilst it is not possible to name them all, I do want to try and acknowledge a few. I want to thank my nan, who turns 93 next week; my mum, who did her best to provide for me in very difficult circumstances; and my brothers, Stewart and Wal, and my sister-in-law, Robyn, who have all helped and supported me. I also want to thank Carol Brown, my dear friend-as I mentioned before-for over 20 years now. I have learnt much from her in our long friendship. I want to thank David Price, the former state secretary of the Tasmanian ALP branch, for his advice and support and for listening to me; Lin Thorp, my campaign manager, who I thank for never losing patience with my everworsening case of candidate-it is; my friend Mary Massina for always being there if I needed a friend and also for her great sense of style; my wonderful and successful campaign team, Tom, Maggie, Stu, Julie D, Kacee, Mary Mc, Sharon, and Catryna Bilyk; and the unions and union members who assisted on my campaign. I thank them all most sincerely for their hard work. Their monuis mental effort of getting a campaign off the ground at breakneck speed was remarkable. I thank the army of door knockers and the volunteers. I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the former candidate for Franklin, Kevin Harkins. Kevin made a very tough and brave decision to stand down as the Labor candidate. As a result, my candidature was quite sudden and unexpected. It was a very big decision in a short space of time that my family and I had to make. It was not taken lightly and I want to thank my husband, Ian, and my children, Georgie, Lochie and Andy, for supporting me throughout. My family have made many sacrifices due to my it continuing role in public life. I expect they will make many more and I thank them sincerely for their belief in me and their understanding. In closing, I want to assure the people of Franklin that I, as part of the Rudd Labor government, will not let them down. I will work hard to put their position to government. I will be accessible. I will listen to their concerns, their gripes, their needs and their advice. Men and women of Australia have placed a great trust in us all and we must work together to make life better for them. I want people to think back to 2007 as the year that things changed for the better. I want my children and the next generation to be proud of the role we have played in making this great country greater.",87
140,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call Mr Coulton, I remind honourable members that this is his first speech. I therefore ask that usual courtesies be extended to him.",93
141,Mr COULTON,Unknown,"Parkes) (5.22 pm)Almost a week has passed since I took my seat in this House, and the learning curve has been steep. So far, the highlight has been the first speeches of my fellow members of the class of 2007. I feel very humble to be part of such a diverse and talented group of people. I am honoured to have been elected as one of Australia's decision makers but regret that most Australian people are not encouraged to understand our Westminster system of parliament. I believe that the presidential style of today's politics does this country no favours. There is often greater importance placed on fluffy symbolism and 30-second news grabs than on the hard work of the 150 men and women who sit in this House. We are all a product of our upbringing, environment and experiences but, regardless of where we sit in this House, we have all come here with the best of intentions. Apart from the six enjoyable years I spent at the Farrer Agricultural High School in Tamworth, I have lived in the Warialda and Gravesend districts all my life. My family have been involved in farming for generations and, for as long as I can remember, I always wanted to be a farmer. Indeed, I was 10 years old when I did my first full day of tractor driving. I was raised to appreciate the value of hard work and the benefits of helping each other not just within our family but within our community. At this point, I would like to acknowledge my family. My father, Jack, has always been a dominant figure. His fierce determination has seen him succeed in life despite receiving only a few years of formal education. A man of great presence and strength, he is now 86 and battling the demons of old age and ill health. My mother, Nancy, was the most influential person in my early years. the She believed that there was goodness in all people and a positive side to every situation. She passed away seven years ago, after an 18-month battle with cancer. It is my one regret that my parents are not here today. To my sisters, Viv and Joy, and my brothers, John and Bob, and their families, thank you for your support and friendship. I am so pleased that some of you, as well as some members of my extended family, could be here today to share in this occasion. There have been two defining events in my life, and the New South Wales government has been responsible for both of them. The first was when they ignored the request of Robyn Redford, a very pretty young teacher from Western Sydney, to be sent to the South Coast of New South Wales and assigned her instead to the small primary school near my family's farm at Gravesend. Robyn and I married 26½ years ago. Her intelligence, support, loyalty and tremendous capacity for hard work have been my inspiration. The high standard that she set for herself as a wife, mother, teacher and political campaigner is the main reason I am here today. We have been blessed with three happy, healthy children. Claire is an English and History teacher, currently working at Newcastle High School. She has a kind and giving nature, is intensely loyal and has a great enthusiasm for life and a passion for teaching. Sally is in the final year of a degree in medicine at Newcastle University. She has shown a single-minded determination and sacrificed much to achieve her goal. Being both caring and practical, Sally will doctor and hopefully will become part of the solution to the shortage of doctors in rural Australia. Our son, Matthew, having just completed his Higher School Certificate, is working at an outdoor adventure camp in England for a year before commencing study at university. Robyn and I were very proud to attend Government House in Sydney twice in one week last November. On the first occasion, Matthew was awarded a Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award. On the second occasion, he was awarded an Order of Australia commendation and medal for community service. We know that he has much to give to society in the future. The second defining moment that changed the course of my life was when the New South Wales government decided to structurally reform local government in 2003. The reform process led to the creation of the Gwydir Shire Council. This council covers nearly 10,000 square kilometres, has a population of 6,000 and includes three former local government areas. Despite having no former experience in local government, I found myself the inaugural Mayor of Gwydir Shire in September 2004. Up until this point in my life, I had believed my future lay in agriculture. My involvement with the Gwydir Shire Council took me in a new direction. Contrary to the dire predictions of many, Gwydir Shire Council has been an amazing success. In its first year it was awarded the AR Bluett Memorial Award for excellence in local government. In the following year it received the New South Wales Training Initiative Award as a partner in the Gwydir Learning Region. In four years the value of real estate has risen from a very low base to being identified as one of the top performing regions for investment in New South Wales. I would like to recognise my friends from the Gwydir Shire, who are in the gallery today, and thank them for showing me what good be a fine government is all about. In regional areas, local government is under increasing pressure. It has become the primary vehicle for the delivery of services. Councils across regional Australia have risen to the challenge to meet the needs of their communities and are not only providing the traditional services of roads, rates and rubbish but now involved in health, child care, social work, education and aged care. They are doing a magnificent job but are grossly underfunded. I firmly support a more equitable method for funding regional local government. Although I had been involved with the Nationals for a number of years, my desire to seek election as a political representative intensified in 2006, when the Australian Electoral Commission proposed a redistribution which, if it had gone ahead, would have seen 47 per cent of New South Wales lumped into one electorate. That proposal was ultimately defeated as a result of the protests of people of all political persuasions for whom good representation was vitally important. The new electorate of Parkes was formed. It covers an area of 107,000 square kilometres and stretches from the central west of New South Wales to the Queensland border, moving from the bustling regional city of Dubbo, in the south, to the picturesque village of Toomelah, in the north, and from the unique Lightning Ridge, in the west, to places like Bylong and my home town of Warialda, in the east. The seat is named after the father of Federation, Sir Henry Parkes, and largely replaces the abolished Federation seat of Gwydir. While it is very much like Gwydir, it also now contains Dubbo, which is both new to the rest of the electorate and also its largest centre. Following my preselection early in 2007, many people in Dubbo worked tirelessly to boost my profile, quite a challenge given that I lived at the opposite end of the electorate. I would like to express my gratitude to the Hon. John Cobb, the previous member for Parkes and now the member for Calare, for his insight and support. I would also not have been successful without the help of Pauline MCAllister and Peter Bartley, among so many others. In the north of the electorate, from Moree and Hugh Coulton and many of my friends from Warialda must be recognised for their enthusiastic support and their leadership of others. I cannot thank Parkes Electorate Council Chairman Ruth Strang enough for her help, deep commitment and never-wavering dedication and loyalty. It would be impossible for me to acknowledge here the many campaign workers I was fortunate to have on side, but I cannot let this occasion pass without placing on record my appreciation to Angela, Sarah, Kellie, Felicity and Kerry. To my Nationals colleagues, particularly honourable members Mark Vaile, Kay Hull and Peter MCGauran and senators Fiona Nash and Nigel Scullion, as well as the former Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Costello: thank you for the time, assistance and advice you gave me in my electorate during the campaign. It was invaluable. I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, the former member for Gwydir, the Hon. John Anderson. John represented the people of Gwydir in this place for over 19 years, rising to be Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Prime Minister. John was a key player in the team that was arguably the most successful government that this country has ever seen. His contribution to his electorate, his country and this chamber is well known and is without parallel. John was inspirational to me, both during his many years as my local member and then recently as my campaign director. I would like to wish John well in his future endeavours. I am sure this country has not heard the last of the former member for Gwydir. I am here today because I have a deep and unshakable belief in the future of inland Australia. In my electorate of Parkes there are strong and vibrant communities, both large and small. They are fiercely independent and are very proud of their heritage. Despite the effects of years of drought they are optimisPeter Taylor tic about their future. Lack of infrastructure is a major impediment to our development. There are two projects that are essential to ensure continued progress in my electorate. They are the construction of an expressway over the Blue Mountains and the Melbourne-to-Brisbane rail line. It is a disgrace that in the 21st century the main connection between Sydney and western New South Wales was built nearly 200 years ago by convicts. A new expressway would not only be an advantage to the people west of the mountains but act as a relief valve for Western Sydney. The Roads to Recovery program, instigated by my predecessor, the Hon. John Anderson, has been a real boon to regional roads in Australia. However, despite this unprecedented amount of investment, parts of my electorate remain severely hamstrung by a rural road network that has not improved since the days of horse and buggy. I firmly believe that the productivity of an area should be a major consideration when allocating road funding. I intend to drive this concept forward at every opportunity. The development of rail in general and the construction of the Melbourne-to-Brisbane line in particular must happen. Road transport alone will not be able to cope with the predicted doubling of the freight task by 2020. One double-stacked container train would take 276 trucks off the road, save 100,000 litres of fuel and prevent thousands of tonnes of greenhouse gas from entering the atmosphere on a journey from Brisbane to Melbourne. The proposed rail line would dissect the Parkes electorate and would place it at the transport crossroads of Australia. I was alarmed to hear last week that the government is intending to delay this worthwhile project. While it may well end up being funded and managed by private enterprise, it will not happen without the will of the government. I will use my position in this House to work tirelessly to advance this project. The way society reacts to the issue of mate change will impact greatly on regional Australia. As our country grapples with the extent and effects of climate change, we must remember that agriculture is the cure, not the disease. Farmers have been adapting to the variables of the Australian climate for many years. The adoption of advanced farming techniques, such as zero-till methods of crop production, best-practice management in the irrigation industry and advanced pasture management techniques in the livestock industry, have allowed our farmers to maximise production while caring for the environment. This evolvement of agricultural practices has greatly increased the level of carbon sequestered in the farming process. Australian farmers are now producing more food and fibre with fewer inputs of fuel and water than ever before. Ill-considered environmental policy can have a devastating effect on a region. The decision several years ago to lock up 350,000 hectares of forest in the South Brigalow bioregion has turned a vibrant living forest sustaining a population of flora and fauna into a wasteland. The cessation of the logging which had been operating sustainably in the forest for over 100 years decimated several towns in the area. To add insult to injury, the mismanagement of the forest allowed thousands of hectares to be destroyed by fire. So now we have no forest and no community, not to mention the thousands of tonnes of carbon that were spewed into the atmosphere during the fires. Government policy needs to be based on scientific assessment, not emotional or political doctrine. As I campaigned throughout my electorate last year, the issue of health was-and remains-the major concern. In regional and rural areas the problems in health care are multiplied. I intend to lobby constantly for cliincreased access to adequate health services for all residents, and I firmly believe that this cause will be advanced if we remain positive in the way that we portray and demonstrate the enormous benefits of living in rural Australia. In order to fulfil its great potential, the electorate of Parkes will need to grow its population. We are desperately short of suitably trained workers, from doctors and nurses to skilled tradespeople. Country people can be notoriously bad at promoting the positives of their region. While it is the role of a local member to be aware of the issues that are of concern to the electorate and to work to overcome them, I also believe that it is the role of elected representatives of all levels of government to be champions for their constituents. The greatest gift a government can give its people is confidence: confidence that they have a future, confidence that the government will support them in their best endeavours and confidence that the government will look after them when times are tough. Fear is a weapon that is used too freely in this place. The greatest tool of empowerment and builder of confidence is education. My experience as Chairman of the Gwydir Learning Region opened my eyes to how a community changes when it values education. The provision of educational opportunities that are relevant for individual communities must be a priority. Education is the common denominator in most of the issues that confront my electorate. Whether it is the shortage of health professionals, the lack of skilled tradespeople, the antisocial behaviour of our teenagers or poor nutrition in young children, education can provide a solution. Education should be the basis for restoring dignity within our Aboriginal communities and should be tailored to the needs of individuals. With the cooperation of all providers of education and local communities, real progress can be made to provide opportunities for those who need it most. It is in the interest of this nation to on stimulating growth in regional Australia. The reasons people once had for congregating in cities are largely irrelevant in the 21st liament. century. The improvement in telecommunications in recent years has removed one of the last barriers to doing business in the bush. The availability of land, the affordability of housing and the security of living in a caring community are all compelling reasons to relocate. The supply of abundant natural resources such as coal and natural gas, the emerging importance of alternative fuel supplies like ethanol and solar power and the bullish outlook for agricultural commodities will attract industry to our area and will underpin our region's economy for years to come. I come to this place as a proud member of the Nationals. My introduction to parliamentary life has been made much easier by the support and guidance given to me since the election by my leader, the Hon. Warren Truss, and my other Nationals colleagues. The Nationals have a strong history in the Australian parliament and I am determined to play my part in carrying that tradition into the future. I have arrived at this point in my life as a result of my personal beliefs, the influence of my family, my farming business background, my community involvement and my experience in local government. Even though the electorate of Parkes is considered a rural seat, more than 80 per cent of the people are not directly involved in agriculture. The majority of my constituents live in the many towns and villages spread across the electorate. These people have ignored the doomsayers who have predicted the demise of rural Australia and are fighting back. They, like me, believe our best years are ahead. I would like to thank the people of the Parkes electorate for the confidence they have shown in me. I bring the hopes and focus dreams of these wonderful people into this House for inspiration and motivation as I commence my work in the Australian par",93

143,Mr CLARE,Unknown,"On 27 December 1941, Prime Minister John Curtin issued a clarion call to the nation. In our darkest hour and with the looming threat of invasion, he called on a generation to steel its resolve and make ready the defence of Australia. Curtin's call reached a young man from Australia Street, Camperdown, Sydney-a young man who had just turned 18. Eight days later he joined the Australian Army. Not old enough to vote in 1941 but old enough to know his country needed him, old enough to be part of the first army to defeat the Japanese at Milne Bay, old enough to be torn open by mortar fire. His name was Jack Clare and he was my grandfather. On the other side of the world, my other grandfather was a prisoner of war. Athol Neate was captured in the doomed defence of Crete and spent the next 2½ years in Stalag 18A in Wolfsberg, Austria. I tell their stories because their names deserve a place on the national public record. They were men of courage and fortitude, like their generation and like their Prime Minister. And, while the challenges that face us today are very different, meeting them will require the same determination and national resolve. They require us to harness the skills of the Australian people and their readiness to serve. The noblest thing that we can do is serve our country. Australia knew that in 1941, and Australians know it today. Whether we are teaching the young or caring for the old, fighting the fires of the Australian bush or fighting for the rights of others, our service matters. This place, this parliament, is also about service. Many outside here do not believe that, but they want to, and so do I. In June 1966, under the shadow of apartheid, Robert Kennedy left this message with a group of young South African students: It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope ... It is a message that is just as relevant today as it was then. People of courage and belief can make a difference. It is this faith that will drive my public service. And it explains what happened to Australia on 24 November last year, when a ripple of hope washed away the politics of division and fear. Thank you to my new colleagues who carried this message to the Australian people, thank you to those who carried the torch through the darkness of over a decade in opposition and thank you to my friends in this place-the members for Prospect, Watson, Fowler, Banks and Reid-for your wise counsel and advice. To these I add the state members for Toongabbie, Cabramatta, Fairfield, Auburn and East Hills; former Premiers of New South Wales Bob Carr and Neville Wran; Senator-elect Mark Arbib; and New South Wales ALP General Secretary Karl Bitar. I owe a special debt of gratitude to my campaign director, Tony Stewart, the state member for Bankstown; to my campaign team-amongst them, Brian and Elizabeth Langton, John MCLaughlin, Jim Bakopanos and Myra Pengilly; to my amazing staff, Ingrid, Chris and Sally; and to my partner, Davina, the sunshine of my life. An even greater debt is owed to my local branch members. They are the backbone of the Labor Party, and I thank every single one of them. They do not seek glory or recognition. They know that when you change the government you change the country, and they are the change-makers. It is because of them, and people like them across the country, that I stand on this side of the House today. Last week we saw how much we have already changed when a Prime Minister had the courage and the decency to say one simple but important word, to apologise to the stolen generations and to send forth a tiny ripple of hope. Today this country is a little better, and we all stand a little taller because he did. His actions give proof to the words of Robert Kennedy. Most importantly, I thank the people of Blaxland for the support and trust that they have placed in me. Their faith in the Australian Labor Party has never wavered, and I am determined to be worthy of this precious trust. It is a great responsibility to be elected to the Australian parliament and an even greater privilege to serve the people I grew up with-my friends and neighbours, my old school mates and team mates. Blaxland is where mum and dad built a home and raised a family. They still live in the same house today. It is where mum works at my old high school, helping generations of Blaxland kids grow up, and it is where dad works with many others in the manufacturing industry. Sitting in the gallery, they are the proudest parents in Australia, and I am a most grateful son. To mum and dad, I bring to this place the values you have taught me: the importance of doing what is right, helping others and getting involved in the local community. On the sporting field and in the classroom, they always encouraged me to do my best, and they taught me the harder you work, the luckier you get. Also in the gallery is my high school history teacher, Peter Valenti. Peter brought the stories of John Curtin and Robert Kennedy to life, and he awoke in me the possibility of public service to improve the lives of others. He is now a school principal and is still inspiring young people in Blaxland. I was the first in my family to go to versity. The Australia that existed before Gough Whitlam did not give my parents the same opportunity. I studied law to help people. I quickly realised the best way to do was not by arguing the law but by changing it. Bob Carr gave me that opportunity, and that is what we did. We changed the criminal law working with police and victims of crime. It was an honour to work for a man with such passion for public service. Each morning he would say to us, ‘What can we do to help someone today?' He was a leader in the Labor tradition-a tradition and a party that believes in reward for effort, help for the needy and opportunity for all. It is a party whose commitment to a strong economy is matched by its commitment to a fair society. Australians care about fairness. We argue about it in our pubs and clubs, around the barbecue and here in this chamber. It is title of our national anthem. It is the great barometer by which we judge things. It is part of our history. In November 1907, Justice Henry Bournes Higgins handed down the Harvester decision. This infused the concept of fairness into our industrial relations system. That was November 1907. In November 2007-100 years later almost to the day-the Australian people reaffirmed their commitment to fairness and threw out a government that had whittled it away. I am fortunate for many reasons but, above all, I am fortunate to be part of a Labor government, a government that will put fairness back into the lexicon of this parliament, a government that will put fairness back into the workplaces of this nation and a government that will put fairness back into the pay packets of working people-people like those who live in Blaxland. Blaxland was created in 1949, in the early years of the postwar boom, when men like my grandfather staked their claim in the new uni- housing estates of Western Sydney. Since that time there have been only three members for Blaxland-Eli Harrison, Paul Keating and Michael Hatton. I pay tribute to this their contributions and place on record my sincere appreciation to Michael for his support and advice. All served the people of Blaxland with distinction. Paul Keating's service went well beyond the boundaries of just one seat. He rendered the Australian economy competitive and prepared it for the 21st century. It took courage to float the dollar and vision to introduce reforms like compulsory superannuation. He also had a bold vision of Australia and our place in the world-strong and independent, engaged with Asia and reconciled with Indigenous Australia. It is a vision whose time has come. Blaxland is an important part of the great Australian story. The traditional custodians of the land are the Dharug, Dharawal and in the Eora people. Rock paintings dating back 3,000 years can still be found along the Georges River. Matthew Flinders was the first European to explore and chart its waterways. Almost 100 years later Sir Henry Parkes settled on its banks. They are two men whose public service helped shape a nation. One gave Australia its name and the other inspired its Federation. In the years between Flinders and Parkes, bushrangers plied their trade along Dog Trap Road and convicts built the historic Lansdowne Bridge. When the railway came to town 100 years ago, it brought with it a land boom. Paddocks were subdivided and suburbs were born. After the Second World War, when Australia opened its arms to the people of the world, many settled here. Blaxland is now one of the most culturally diverse places in Australia. Working people from 130 different countries, speaking more than 60 different languages, call it home. It is a place churches, mosques and temples, where different languages grace our shops and where our homes welcome everyone, no matter where they were born, how they worship or what language they speak. This is where the new Australia is being forged-a courageous, cosmopolitan, cohesive Australia, where being Australian is not about where you come from but about where you are going. It is a place famous for its people like Steve Waugh, Jon Konrads, Lenny Pascoe and Jeff Thomson, and a place brimming with unsung heroes, people like Jihad Dib, the Principal of Punchbowl Boys High School-a place that was threatened with closure four years ago because violence and disruption were so bad parents stopped sending their kids there. The school was failing. But, under his leadership, a lot of hard work has turned that around. This year's year 7 is the biggest in 13 years. Enrolments have sprung up by 35 per cent in the last two years. And literacy improvements are 3½ times the state average. Another local hero is Mark Newey. Mark is a real estate agent. Last year he helped eight families fend off a bank that wanted to throw them out on the street when the owner of the block of units defaulted on his mortgage. Mark fought for these people and convinced the bank to let them stay in their homes. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have a Mark Newey on their side. Last year 300 families in Blaxland lost their homes, more than anywhere else in Australia, more than ever before. This is the real and unravelling legacy of the Howard government. Blaxland is the mortgage stress capital of Australia. I was speaking to a real estate agent in Cabramatta last week who told me that he has four repossessed houses on his books. of That's just one agent. Just one month. The sheriff at Bankstown Court told me there are about 30 repossessions about to occur in the next two weeks. Young families who sell up before the sheriff arrives find the value of their home has plummeted. The median house price in Blaxland has fallen by 16 per cent in the last three years. Many now have negative equity in their homes. It means they owe the bank more than the house is worth, making the threat of repossession all the sporting heroes, more frightening. The last housing boom was great for some but it has made life tougher for others. The rate of home-ownership is dropping. So is the proportion of first home buyers. I want to make sure the great Australian dream still means something to future generationswhere a mortgage is an investment, not a trap. It is a challenge for any family to build or buy a house. It is just as big a challenge for governments to turn rows of houses into a working city, to build infrastructure. Seventy per cent of Australians live in our major cities. They are the engine rooms of our economy. Improving the performance of our economy means improving the performance of our cities-making them work. I have seen first hand how important good infrastructure really is to our economy. For the last four years I worked for Transurban, the Australian company behind the successful Westlink M7 project. I saw the M7, and its 144 bridges, rise from the ground and the positive impact it has had on local families and businesses. The M7 is not just a road; it is a magnet for economic development. Even before the M7 opened, some of Australia's biggest companies were flocking to relocate along its corridor. In the last three years it has helped to create 10,000 new jobs and generated almost $3 billion in economic development. It is a good example of what good infrastructure can do: fix the bottlenecks in our cities and the bottlenecks in our economy, improve people's lives and make business more efficient, which helps us tackle inflation. The Business Council of Australia estimates we have a $90 billion infrastructure deficit. To tackle this task, like many others, we must bring a willingness to work together: working in partnership with state and local governments, with the private sector and with the community to renew our nation-building zeal, to build the infrastructure we need not just for today but for tomorrow. On 20 January 1830 my great-great-greatgreat-grandfather arrived in Sydney Covein leg-irons. Thomas Clare was transported to Australia from Dublin. His heinous crime: stealing books. We have come a long way since then. He was sent to the other side of the world as punishment for wanting to read; now it is a national priority. It is certainly top priority at my old primary school, Cabramatta Public. The principal, John Rice, tells me 80 per cent of kids starting kindergarten speak little or no English. Few can spell their name. But give it three years and their literacy and numeracy skills are at or above the state average. What a powerful message this sends. Our education system is the most powerful cause for good in this country. Run well, it can ensure that every child has the opportunity to reach their potential. It is the great equaliser in an unequal world. If we are serious about equal opportunity for men and women, for rich and poor, for Indigenous and multicultural Australia, then let it begin with the youngest Australians. Let us be the government that again invests in public education. Let us be the government that ensures postcodes do not determine opportunity. Let us be the government that recognises the importance of teachers to learning outcomes. And let us be the government that unleashes the potential of the next generation. We start by giving every child access to high-quality preschool. The impact across Australia will be profound; the impact in Blaxland will be greater still. In the last few months, I have visited all 52 schools in Blaxland. What I found is a microcosm of our community and a window to its future. The number of children who currently go to preschool in Blaxland is well below the national average. Retention rates are also lower. We need to fix this, not just for their sake but for ours. Our future prosperity rests on their shoulders. If every child in Blaxland has access to preschool, they will have the same chance as other children and they will perform better at school. If they stay longer at school, they will earn more and add billions to our economy. And, if they get a degree or a trade certificate, they will give this country the skills we need to compete in a the shrinking and more competitive world. It is for all these reasons that we need an education revolution, and places like Blaxland need it most of all. Mr Speaker, I promise to make the most of this extraordinary opportunity, to be worthy of this place and those who sent me to it, to serve with a fraction of the courage of my grandfathers and with all of their commitment. John Curtin inspired their generation and my grandfathers inspire me: not to defend a nation but to defend the humble hope of a family home; to protect the basic rights of working people and their dignity at work; to turn a new page in the great Labor tradition of nation building; to invest again in our youngest Australians; and to build a better Australia for the grandchildren of tomorrow. As the poet Alexander Smith said: A man does not plant a tree for himself; he plants it for posterity. Our great responsibility is to govern not just for this generation but for the ones that follow. The pace of change and the challenges ahead demand it. Here in this place is where we can meet these challenges. This is where we can turn the Australia of our imagination into something real. Australia needs more people ready to serve and more voices to create ripples of hope. That is why I am here. That is why I am a member of the Australian Labor Party. And that is what I will do on behalf of the people of Blaxland.",97
144,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The question is that the address be agreed to. I call the honourable member for-Fisher; my apologies.,102
145,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"Where you holiday, Mr Deputy Speaker, regularly.",102
146,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,My apologies to the honourable member for Fisher; I knew it too well.,102
147,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"Initially, I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Blaxland on what I thought was a very well put together speech. Clearly he had thought through the matters he wanted to raise in his maiden speech to the Australian parliament, and I do wish him well, as I do all other new members-although one could understand if I do not wish those on the other side any sense of political longevity. I do counsel the honourable member for Blaxland, however, that when serving his political masters he ought not to forget the people in Sussex Street-who, I understand, are possibly more of a potential threat to him than would be the electors of Blaxland. There are few debates in this parliament where one can talk about anything one wants to. I want to use this chance to say how strongly I support a single conservative party in Queensland. Hopefully after that has been achieved there will be a flow-on effect so that we see a single conservative party nationally. Sir Robert Menzies in the 1940s faced a crisis of conservative politics and he managed to bring together 18 disparate non-Labor and conservative forces to form the Liberal Party of Australia. At the present time, the conservative parties throughout Australia are in some disarray. We do not hold government at any state or territory level and we certainly, post 24 November, do not hold the keys to national government. I suppose the one bright spot on our national horizon is the lord mayoralty of Brisbane, where I am hopeful that Campbell Newman as lord mayor will be able to obtain a majority in his own right at the council elections next month. Lawrence Springborg, the leader of the Queensland opposition, has, in quite a visionary way, been consulting with the people of Queensland with a view to achieving a new conservative party, to grow out of the Liberal Party and the National Party. Alternatively, one could merge the two-and I am not wedded to any particular alternative but I strongly consider that if any rationale ever existed for there to be a separate Liberal Party and a separate National Party then that rationale evaporated a very long time ago. Honourable members would be aware that I have been privileged to serve in the Australian parliament as both a member of the National Party and a member of the Liberal Party, at different times. The people who were in both of those party rooms were very similar people, but, more importantly, the branch members of the Liberal Party and the National Party were very similar. Indeed, the voting public who support Liberal and National Party members are not specifically National or specifically Liberal; they are broadly conservative voters who want to achieve positive outcomes for the future of our state and nation. That is why I have written to the Queensland state president of the Liberal Party, Warwick Parer, a distinguished former senator of this parliament, and our state director, Geoff Greene, to urge support for the proposal being put forward by Lawrence Springborg. I greatly regret a recent decision of the Queensland state council of the Liberal Party to defer any consideration of a single conservative party until after the Brisbane City Council and the Gold Coast City Council elections. I hope that the postponement of these discussions is not designed to gain time so that a new party could be put to death at a time when it would be less politically dangerous to do so. I do not think anyone would accept a decision to say no at this stage because, were that to happen, our Brisbane City Council team and our Gold Coast City Council team would be pilloried at the council elections to be held next month. Had the state council gone ahead with an indication of support for a single conservative party, I consider that this, at the council elections, would have given a very strong momentum towards support for conservative teams running in council elections. But, having said that, all is not lost. I can understand that there was an argument put forward that, were we to be talking about a new party prior to the council elections, that could well divert our attention from the need to win those elections. I accepted the decision of the state council, but I strongly urge that, on the day after the council elections are out of the way, we as a Liberal Party go out and consult our members and seek to attain the support we need to form one conservative party. I said earlier that the non-Labor forces in Australia are currently in a state of disarray. As we stand, we are somewhere between three and 12 years away from national government. We are probably six years away from state government in Queensland because Anna Bligh leads what is arguably the worse government in Australia of any political party. What we need to do is to indicate to the Australian people and to the voters of Queensland that we have listened. They have sent us powerful messages at successive state elections. They say to us, ‘Get your act together and then come back and seek our support.' I believe the Howard government was an outstanding government. History will record the achievements of that government. We inherited an economic basket case, yet we reduced unemployment, we had lower interest rates than have historically been the case, and we made Australia respected throughout the world. When history judges the record of that government, history will be very kind because it was a very good government. Having said that, on 24 November, a new Prime Minister from Queensland was elected and the Labor Party, as we have seen in the successive votes today and earlier, clearly holds a very strong majority currently in the Australian parliament. What we need to do is to try to indicate to the Australian people that we have learnt the lesson and that we are prepared to listen to the message being sent to us. I believe that it is very, very important to move forward to form this single conservative party. Were this to happen, I believe the electors would look at us in a much more favourable light. In recent times, the coalition has worked very well together at the state and the federal levels. However, there is this feeling in the community's psyche that over the years we have had the luxury expended by Liberals and Nationals of taking pot shots at each other. There have been visions of disunity. We have seen headlines in the various papers on occasions indicating that the parties are not working to one purpose. That is why I think we cannot now afford two non-Labor parties-particularly two non-Labor parties which largely have the same policies and which largely represent the same people. The Liberal Party has many more rural members of the Australian parliament than does the National Party. I do not say that in a sense of triumphalism over the National Party. All I am saying is that the rationale for two separate parties has long evaporated. I want to commend the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Nationals in this place because both of them have indicated that they are not opposed to Queensland moving forward to form one conservative party if that is what the collective wish of the membership of the Liberal Party and the National Party in Queensland happens to be. There are some who say: ‘Let's not have a merger at state level. Let's wait until there is some form of national consensus.' Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you would agree with me in your capacity as the member for Maranoa and as a former president of the National Party that often such a sentiment could in effect be code for putting it off until such time as it will never actually happen. History records that the only way that the Australian Country Party became the National Party of Australia was when one state-that is, Queensland-grasped the nettle. It unilaterally changed its name and then created the momentum which, over a period of years, saw the Australian Country Party become the National Country Party at the national level and then become the National Party of Australia throughout the nation. Already in the Australian parliament we have Senator Nigel Scullion, who represents the Country Liberal Party, which is a merger of the parties in the Territory. I suppose it is a bit strange in a sense that he is also the deputy leader of the National Party, but that is an issue for another discussion. If the Liberal Party and the National Party were prepared to be visionary and prepared to emulate what Sir Robert Menzies did in the 1940s and if we were able to achieve a single conservative party in Queensland then one would find that very quickly the other states would fall into line. We would have one conservative party, which, in effect, would indicate that we were ready to inherit the keys of government. The state leadership of the Liberal Party and the National Party in the Queensland parliament have both indicated support for this proposal. As I talk to Liberal Party members in my electorate and elsewhere throughout Queensland, I find that there is a very strong view in favour of ruling off the past and moving forward. In the electorate of Fisher, I was very fortunate because we had a joint campaign committee. The Liberal Party and the National Party campaigned together as equal partners, and we achieved a result which, given the tsunami that engulfed our side of politics, was very pleasing. The electorate has sent us a very strong and unambiguous message: fix up the mess and make some positive changes. If that happens, of course, we will receive support. We just cannot go on as we are. We need to try something new. If we do go on as we are, I suspect we will be where we are for a very long period of time. You cannot have a good government in Australia unless you have an effective opposition. I just see a single conshine servative party as being essential. It really ought to happen. It must happen. If it does not happen, then we are consigned to the wilderness of opposition for possibly a generation. I would also like to say how pleased I am that next month the three councils on the Sunshine Coast-the Noosa Council, the Maroochy Shire Council and the Caloundra City Council-will merge to form the new Sunshine Coast Regional Council. It would have been better if we were called the Sunshine Coast City Council because, let's face it, while the member for MCPherson at the table would certainly not agree with meMrs May-I do not.",102
148,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"we all know that the Sunshine Coast is a much finer place to live and to bring up a family than the Gold Coast. The Sunshine Coast Regional Council will be able to emulate the successes of the Gold Coast council. What Gold Coast council members have been able to do is to work together as a body. We all know that the Gold Coast is an entity. When we were in government, Gold Coast representatives, led by the mayor, would come to Canberra and knock on the doors of ministers. Ministers knew that, when dealing with the Gold Coast City Council, they were dealing with a body which represented the whole of the Gold Coast. Ministers like to know who they are dealing with. The Sunshine Coast, however, has Noosa, Maroochy and Caloundra. While we have had the Sunshine Coast Regional Organisation of Councils and they have sought to work together, at times despite the best of intentions Noosa, Maroochy and Caloundra have worked in different directions. Happily, after the council elections next month we will have a Sunshine Coast council which will be able to speak for all of us on the SunCoast. I think that the process followed by the state government, with its lack of consultation with the community, is something for which the state government ought to be condemned, but the outcome is positive because we will have a new council which will speak up for the Sunshine Coast, which is undoubtedly the best part of the country in which to live and to bring up a family. The opportunities on the Sunshine Coast are absolutely limitless. This brings me to one of my favourite hobbyhorses. After the Prime Minister was elected, he said he was going to govern for all Australians. In fact, I think the new honourable member for Blaxland said in his speech that we do not want to see government decisions made by postcode. The Sunshine Coast will have its population double over the next 10 to 15 years. I am pleased that Infrastructure Australia will be set up, as we have so many infrastructure requirements. We need to upgrade the Bruce Highway all the way from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast. The previous government funded the upgrade as far as Caboolture to six lanes, and now we need to extend that upgrade all the way to the Sunshine Coast. As a community, we have so many infrastructure requirements. I have been in touch with the Prime Minister's office to stress that some of those needs must be met. I will certainly be knocking on the Prime Minister's door to guarantee we get as much infrastructure as we possibly can. In the run-up to the election, the Labor Party ran very strong campaigns on the Sunshine Coast. With a Queenslander, Kevin Rudd, being the Leader of the Labor Party, I suppose all conservative candidates in Queensland had only one opponent, and that was Kevin Rudd; the quality of the specific Labor candidate did not matter. But Labor candidates did promise a lot of spending on the Sunshine Coast. I will certainly be doing what I can to hold the government to those promises, to make sure that, even though the previous government was not successful on the Sunshine Coast, the promises made to Sunshine Coast people are completely delivered. In the time available to me, I would also like to say how sorry I am that the state government has decided to proceed with the Traveston dam. I am all about there being adequate water supplies for the future, but the Traveston dam will be poorly located, it is not a good dam site, and over a thousand families will be affected. I read in the Sunshine Coast Daily today that apparently some considerable amount of Australian government money is being spent building a new bridge in an area which will be inundated by the Traveston dam. One just has to ask whether that is a sensible use of Australian taxpayers' money. On 24 November we had an election. We also know that the government won and we, the opposition, lost. We focus a lot on the outcome, as indeed we should, but, while we might not like the outcome, as Australians we always ought to respect the process. We are singularly fortunate as Australians because we are able, come elections, to put a government in or put a government out. The sort of right that we have is not a right shared by people right around the world. One only has to turn one's television set on at night to know that people elsewhere do not have the freedom, the stability, the way of life and the tolerance that we have as Australians. While we might be upset over the fact that we did not win the election, as Australians we ought to focus positively on the process because it means that as a country we are able to select the government we want. If there is a feeling that the government ought to move on-as was clearly the case on 24 November last year-so be it. What will happen is that the government opposite will run out of steam and, in the fullness of time-hopefully sooner rather than later, particularly if we form one non-Labor party-we will see a change of government and a return to good and sound government. In summing up, I again congratulate all honourable members, particularly new members, on both sides of the House on their election. We are a very great privilege to serve in the Australian parliament. Just over a thousand people have served in the Australian parliament since Federation. We are a wonderful country. I know that we will not agree on everything. I respect your motivations for standing and being elected, and I would like to wish you well in your political careers.",105
149,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the member for Corio, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I therefore ask that the usual courtesies be extended to him.",106
150,Mr MARLES,Unknown,"I start by acknowledging the Ngunawal people, the traditional owners of this land, and also by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land in the electorate of Corio, the Wathaurong people. In acknowledging these people as the traditional owners of their land, I would also like to acknowledge the strength of their identity. Indeed, it is the strength of identity of all of Indigenous Australia which has allowed these people and this ancient culture to survive numerous threats, not the least of which has been European settlement. We are lucky that Aboriginal Australians are our first Australians. The power of their identity serves to illustrate how important identity is for all peoples. It is the source of all collective action. It is the source of all public policy. Politics at its grandest is all about identity: searching for it, clarifying giving expression to it. In this, my first speech to this parliament, I would like to talk about the identity of places which mean everything to me. I grew up and have spent most of my life in the city of Geelong. Since 1849, when Geelong was first incorporated by the New South Wales parliament, it has had many identities. In the 18th century it was a gateway to the goldfields. Later it became the centre of Australia's wool industry, as our major wool port. In the second half of the 20th century, Geelong has been Victoria's industrial city in the same way that Newcastle and Wollongong have been in New South Wales. As the member for Corio, my electorate covers the bulk of Geelong. As we sit here in 2008, Geelong's identity is on the move once more. Sixteen per cent of the working population of Geelong now works in Melbourne, and that figure is on the rise. Within the next 20 years, if we are not already so, we will be connected to Werribee, Melbourne, Frankston and Sorrento as part of a greater Port Phillip Bay metropolis. And the question is: how will we maintain our identity within that metropolis? Our challenge is to ensure that Geelong does not merely become an outer suburb of Melbourne. Geelong's identity must lie in becoming an alternative economic centre in the greater Port Phillip Bay metropolis, in the same way that San Jose is, relative to the San Francisco Bay area. In part, that is about Geelong promoting itself as a lifestyle city. With our northfronting bay, our raised peninsula, our wineries, our historic buildings and our proximity to the Surf Coast, there is no better place to live around Port Phillip Bay. But mainly it is about fully exploiting Geelong's existing infrastructure. With our own airport, seaport, Highway No. 1 and the national rail gauge all located near each other in the north of it, Geelong and Geelong itself located on the corner of Australia, there is every reason for Geelong to be not only a regional but a nathree tional transport and logistics hub. With a world-class university and TAFE college producing a highly skilled population and with cutting-edge technology coupled with our existing industrial base, there is no reason why Geelong cannot be a global centre of manufacturing excellence. But the critical ingredient in all of this is confidenceknowing that we in Geelong can do things as well as anybody else in the world. That is actually why Geelong's AFL premiership last year was so important to the town. Just imagine if I had not mentioned that! For new nations we talk about people engaging in an act of self-determination, which implies that they have something to determine, that there is a confident identity which unites them as a people and which they in turn present to the world. Any nation which does not have that confident identity struggles, and that struggle is being had by our nearest neighbour to the north, Papua New Guinea. People who have seen themselves as highlanders or from Manus, as Trobriand Islanders or Papuans, have been asked to forge a nation combining all of these people and many more. While Australia was a caring and benevolent colonial power, the truth is that we did very little to prepare these people for what has turned out to be a tremendously difficult task. And so in 2008 Papua New Guinea is bleeding. All its social indicators are poor, such that life expectancy in PNG is the shortest of any nation outside of Africa. Port Moresby is now one of the most dangerous cities in the world, and there is an unknown rate of HIV infection which is drawing comparisons with sub-Saharan Africa. As always, it is PNG's poor who are the worse victims. And yet, with its abundant resources, PNG could be a wonderful success. Ultimately, of course, it is for PNG to determine its own future but, as PNG tackles its issues, it is very important that Australia is there as a strong partner not only out of affection for a close neighbour but also in our own national interest. Since 1975 I think all levels of Australian society, not just government but corporate Australia and the community sector as well, have failed to maintain the bonds which used to exist with Papua New Guinea prior to independence. It has been my privilege over the last few years to have visited PNG on numerous occasions, mainly on behalf of the ACTU but also as a member of Labor's International Party Development Committee. It has become a passion of mine to encourage across all Australia a much greater degree of engagement with PNG. This engagement is needed by Papua New Guinea, and Australia must be the very best friend that we can be. In contemplating national identity, inevitably my thoughts turn to Australia's own identity. When we allow our finer spirits to soar, Australia has a national ideal which is the very envy of the world. It is described by words like ‘egalitarianism', ‘fairness' and the spirit of ‘a fair go'. And all of this is grounded in the idea of mateship. Charles Bean, the famous Australian First World War correspondent, said in relation to the Australian troops both at Gallipoli and on the Western Front: ... the chief article [of their creed] was that should at all times and at any cost stand by his mate. That was and is the one law which the good Australian must never break. Mateship is at the heart of our great military image, which is not Nelson standing on the deck of the Victory peering out at the French fleet as he was about to impose upon them a terrible defeat. Nor is it a group of American marines raising the flag on the heights of Iwo Jima in an emphatic symbol of victory. No, our great military image is of a medic leading a donkey, on the back of which is an injured digger-one Australian helping another, a mate helping a mate. That spirit of mateship is very much alive in Australia today. We saw it in the opening of the Sydney Olympic Games, which absolutely celebrated the famous aspects of Australian life-the culture of Indigenous Australians, the Great Barrier Reef-but which also celebrated ordinary Australians in that wonderful scene with the men and women wearing their stubbies and workboots, using angle grinders and sending sparks into the night sky. What other nation, what other culture, would put on display to the rest of the world the most ordinary of its people to show that they are extraordinary too? Mateship has played a role throughout our history. In the early pioneer days, out in the bush, husband and wife became the best of mates in a way which broke down the barriers of traditional gender segregation. As we sit here in 2008, that is really now the norm in Australia, where the vast bulk of couples regard their husband or wife as their best mate. That is particularly Australian. It is very important that when we consider the concept of mateship we do so in its grandest context as being all about men and women being mates. At our best, mateship has played a role in our immigration policy, as we have welcomed people to Australia from all four cora man ners of the globe as mates. Mateship has been at the heart of the reconciliation process, because Aborigines are mates too. Mateship is an Australian ideal, but it does not seek to define the ideal Australian. Mateship is about all Australians-men and women, black and white, rich and poor-mucking in together and then celebrating that fact. It is fantastic. It is uniquely Australian and with it we have been and will continue to be simply great. But there has been a darkness to the Australian character as well, which we cannot ignore. We have seen it most notably in our history in the White Australia policy, which was national policy and bipartisan policy embraced by every prime minister from Barton through to Menzies. It was actually the Curtin government, when negotiating the arrival of American troops into Australia to use our continent as the base for the offensive campaign against Japan, that raised concerns about African-American troops coming here because this was, after all, a white tinent. The Americans, rightly, objected to that. But, ultimately, a compromise was reached where those African-American soldiers were based in the north of Queensland, far away from offending the eyes of the population centres in south-eastern Australia. That is a terrible story, but it happened, we have to acknowledge it. This darkness has been apparent in the policies which gave rise to the stolen generation and in a policy of intentionally brutalising new people on their arrival to Australia so as to discourage others from doing the same. We have seen it at work in the Pacific solution. How we reconcile these two aspects of the Australian character is difficult. How do you reconcile a sense of togetherness with a sense of exclusion? How do you reconcile bigotry with mateship? The answer is: you have a national discussion in the context of nationhood. Yet here we have another curious fact about our country. As David Day, the eminent Australian historian, has put it, Australia is the reluctant nation. On 1 January 1901, the vast bulk of the Australian people did not see it as our independence day. Rather, it was the coming together of British colonies to form a new British entity in the South Seas. From that day, right through until the rejection of the republic referendum in 1999, our path to independence has been drawn out and ambiguous. With the notable exception of Paul Keating in the early nineties, that road to independence has lacked any kind of national discussion such as that which occurred between the likes of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams at the outset of the American republic. I actually think that it is the absence of that national discussion which has left, at times, our national character somewhat unreconciled. And yet we have a need for a strong national identity now more than ever, because borders are far more transparent than they conwere in 1901 and we no longer sit under the umbrella of an empire. Who we are and what we stand for is there for all the world to see. Whether or not we can confidently assert an Australian brand into a globalised economy has everything to do with whether or not Australia will succeed in the global econand omy. But to do that we need to understand our own brand first. I think the wonderful side of the Australian character, mateship, is well known. But it ought to be enshrined, in my view, in our national documents. So, personally speaking, I agree with John Howard that mateship ought to form part of the preamble to the Australian Constitution. But the darkness in the Australian character is less understood. There are some who say that there is a deep seated streak of racism in Australia. I disagree with that because I actually think that Australians have been incredibly generous to people from all over the world. Yet I do believe that non-Indigenous Australia, from the very beginning of European settlement, has been beset by a sense of insecurity. At different times we have felt insecure about the distance from the motherland, six England. We have felt fearful of our Indigenous population. We have been worried about the size of our continent and how small a population we have to occupy it. And we have been anxious about the Asian region in which we live and what designs may be had on our own land. In more recent times there has been a certain economic insecurity. How will we continue to make things? How will we continue to have a manufacturing sector in Australia when our nearest neighbours are able to make things for a fraction of the price? I think it is when we have indulged this sense of insecurity as a nation that public policy in Australia has manifested in doctrines like the White Australia policy, the stolen generation or the Pacific solution. So to me there is no more important issue in a national discussion. There is no more important issue for the future direction of Australia than to face up to these insecurities. In the 21st century Australia needs a new birth of confidence, because the issues which caused us anxiety in the 20th century frankly are no longer relevant in the 21st century. I do believe that the vision put forward by Kevin Rudd and Labor at the last election captures this new Australian confidence. It is right that we reject an unfair laws which, at their worse, allow one Australian to exploit another. There is no mateship in that. It is also right that we base our econteam omy on a highly skilled, well-educated population bringing to bear the best technology so that we can make the best products and deliver the best services in the world. That is not only the smart play for Australia; it is fair play. With high-skilled jobs come highpaying jobs, and that gives us the financial base for the egalitarian society and the Australian spirit of a fair go. Whether or not you believe that the policies put forward by Labor at the last election represent the best recipe for fostering mateship as our national ideal, what also matters is that we have a discussion about what our national ideals are. This is an exciting time. The nation's response to the stolen generation apology last Wednesday absolutely demonstrates that in 2008 Australia is ready to shed the insecurities of the past and to seize the future with a renewed confidence and hope. Mateship is a very powerful ideal with which to do that. It comes from the country as a whole. It is an ideal which has the capacity to endure, but it is an ideal which will only endure-indeed, it will only be a national ideal-if it has bipartisan support. Now is also a wonderful time to have that discussion, because at the last election 25 per cent of this parliament turned over-one of the largest renewals since Federation. There truly is a new generation in this parliament. I believe that we have a job ahead of us to better understand who we are as a people. We have a job ahead of us to restate the very idea of Australia. And we have a job ahead of us to forge a strong and unshakable national identity which eschews insecurity and fear, which is grounded in confidence and which celebrates mateship and the spirit of a fair go as that which makes us fundamentally set of industrial Australian. It is a wonderful privilege for me to be standing here as a part of the fantastic Labor led by Kevin Rudd. I would like to start my thankyous by thanking Kevin and all the Labor movement for simply giving me the opportunity to be a part of this. I would also like to thank the electors of Corio for putting the me here. I stand here as their representative but I also stand here as the representative of many friends and family, without whom I would never have been given the privilege of serving in this parliament. But before acknowledging them, I would like to acknowledge the former member for Corio, Gavan O'Connor, who served in this place for 14 years. He was a tireless advocate for the people of Geelong. He contributed to national public policy, particularly in the area of agriculture. On behalf of all those in Corio, I would like to thank him. To this point in time, my career has largely been spent in the trade union movement-first at the Transport Workers Union, where I worked under John Allan and Steve Hutchins and alongside Glenn Sterle, Tony Sheldon and Andrew Watson; and then at the ACTU, where I worked under Sharan Burrow and Joe de Bruyn. I owe a great deal to each of these people, as I do to the union movement, which will always hold a very special place in my heart. There are a number of Victorian parliamentarians, who are friends of mine in this place, whom I would also like to acknowledge because they have given me support and guidance for a long period of time: Kelvin Thomson, Nicola Roxon, Michael Danby, Stephen Conroy, Robert Ray and Anthony Byrne. And it is a particular joy for me that I have been elected into this parliament at the same election as David Feeney and Bill Shorten, both of whom have been dear friends of mine for more than 20 years. I would like to acknowledge a group of school friends who have shared my life from childhood: Darren and Jo Fox, Peter Little and Gitte Horn, William Reeves, Ninian Lewis and Clare Lawrence. In Geelong we have been pursuing a struggle to reinvent the Labor Party after a period in the 1990s when our fortunes were very dim. This has been a most difficult and trying task. I have to thank state MPs John Eren, Lisa Neville, Michael Crutchfield, Jaala Pulford, David Saunderson, Cameron Granger, Lou Brazier, Alex DiNatale, Peter MCMullen, Kathleen Pender, Geraldine Eren, Clare MCClelland, Ann Clark, Roger Lowrey, Jill Petersen, Gavin Penn, Glen Menzies, Mark Donohue, Jade Butler, John Maroulis and Darren Lamont. You know what each of you means to me and, while it may be me who is standing here, it is your collective spirit which inhabits this chamber. Saverina Chirumbolo, who has suffered the unusual ordeal of working with me for eight years, needs a special thanks. My productivity is largely dependent upon her, and I thank my lucky stars that she has agreed to join me on this next part of the journey. I have been very fortunate to grow up in a loving family, many of whom are here tonight: my parents, Fay and Don Marles; my parents-in-law, Vince and Judy Schutze; my brothers and sisters Jenny Green, Liz Marles, Ken Quail, Vic Marles, Geoff Westcott, Jason Schutze, Brendan Stafford, Melissa Schutze and Albert Landman; my uncles and aunts, Robert and Ive Buntine and Richard and Jan Inglis; and some friends who are very much family, Susan and Carlo Bernardini, Leonie Sheedy and Ron Joseph. Finally, my most heartfelt thanks go to my own family: my children, Sam, Isabella and Harvey-each of whom pays a price for my being here-and my wonderful wife, Rachel Schutze. It is she who makes the wheels of my life turn. It is she who reminds me that in the midst of political adversity it is familial love that really matters. It is she who makes all things possible, and my guiding motivation in this place will always be to make her proud.",106
151,Mr HUNT,Unknown,"May I start my contribution to this address-in-reply by congratulating the member for Corio. As I look across the chamber I have to say that, in my short time here, I would regard that as the finest contribution for a maiden speech that I have heard. Without seeking to denigrate other fine efforts, I think that was the finest first speech from his side of the chamber. As an alumni of Melbourne university with him and another colleague, I am not surprised. In speaking in this address-in-reply debate, I recognise that there has been a transition of government. On 24 November, the people of Australia made their decision and, unfortunately, the Liberal-National coalition lost government. I have two roles to carry forward: firstly as the member for Flindersand today I want to set out a four-part plan for the coming term of office-and secondly, more broadly, as a member of the alternative government of Australia. In that respect, I wish to make some preliminary remarks. I begin with a simple fact. Late last week, the Australian Bureau of Statistics set out the fact that Australian unemployment has fallen to a 35-year low of 4.1 per cent and the participation rate has reached an all-time high of 65 per cent. These two facts spell one simple thing, and that is that more Australians are in work today than at any other time in our history. That means that families have the economic security which comes from work. Families have the ability to make choices, which have not been open to others throughout Australia's history, about their own futures. More people than ever before are in a position of self-sufficiency. It also means-I think most significantly-that the dignity of work has been extended to more people than ever before. Yes, it is difficult and yes, challenging. That is why it is, by its very nature, called ‘work'. It means that the people of Australia, from the north to the south and from the east to the west, are in a position to make choices about their futures. That is, to me, what liberalism is all about-this very notion that we give people choice, we give people the ability to make their own futures, and from that we give them a sense of hope, aspiration and all that is possible in their lives. How did this come to pass? The narrative from the other side is that this was all cident, that all that we have today, which is so different from the world of 1990 or 1993, was but simply an accident of geography. This proposition is palpably false. The changes that we have seen in Australia since 1996 have been built on the hard work of five great economic revolutions. Firstly, and most importantly, there was the promotion of budgetary discipline, of turning around a $96 billion deficit, and turning it successively over time into surplus after surplus, which firstly paid off the debt and, secondly, laid the foundations for the Future Fund, for a higher education fund and for a hospitals fund-so investing now for all time for future generations. These activities were opposed at every step by those who now in the government profess support for fiscal rectitude. The second of these revolutions was in relation to waterfront productivity. The waterfront faced a coronary; it needed a bypass. Perhaps the most bitter battle of the last 12 years was to take the steps needed to clear out the barriers and bottlenecks on our waterfront. We did that, and we did that because it was difficult not because it was easy. That is precisely why we did that. The result has been a dramatic increase in the productivity of our waterfront which in turn has meant that our manufacturers, people working on it is shop floors, farmers and all of those who seek to export or import have been able to do their work. These changes are real, important and profound, and yet they were opposedbut now they will be kept. The third of the great revolutions in economic productivity that we have seen in Australia came from the dramatic reform of the tax system-reforms so great that the now Prime Minister referred to it at the time as ‘fundamental injustice day', as we all know. The reforms were so great that, faced with all Labor state and territory governments and a an ac- Labor Commonwealth government, he will still keep those reforms. Nothing would stop him now from making those changes. We now see that the reforms to the taxation system, in moving from heavy income tax to light income tax and moving from a situation where we had a consumption based tax, have changed the way the alignment of incentives stack up in Australia. That in turn was fundamental, not to injustice but to productivity in Australia. The fourth of the revolutions was in relation to helping those who had been trapped in a welfare cycle out of that cycle and back to work. That was a great and humane task. What we have seen is that those who were on the fringes of employment, who were outside of the employment scope, have been given the dignity of work as well as the security of work. For that we are profoundly proud. We have nothing to apologise for there. We should acknowledge and be proud of bringing back into the system those who missed out. Finally, we saw a revolution in giving encouragement to small business. This encouragement, which allowed employers to employ, was part of a process which ultimately created two million jobs and created the conditions for 4.1 per cent unemployment and 65 per cent participation in employment across the economy. These things together matter for the current generation, the future generation and the dignity of individuals. Against that, what are we seeing today? Firstly, we are seeing that the white flag is already up on future tax cuts. The understanding that I have is that there will be no more future tax cuts, now that those which we promised have been implemented. Secondly, we see a worrying trend on foreign investment-sending a message to the rest of the world that we are getting ready to put up the shutters. It is a form of dangerous populism. We do not know the final form of that which will pass, but the message to the rest of the world is that this is a different Austratunately, lia. Thirdly, we also see signs that there will be a roll-back on tariff cuts. So all of the great elements of economic reform-which do not matter of and in themselves but matter solely as a means of giving people employment, income and a real and long-term future-are being wound back. That is a dangerous sign-and that is the difference between the two sides of this House. At the end of the day, what we focused on and what we created is economic security. Against that base, I now turn from the strongest economy that Australia has had, arguably since the Korean War boom if not before then, to where we are now in the seat of Flinders. I want to set out a four-part plan for the seat of Flinders: firstly, in relation to health; secondly, in relation to police and security; thirdly, in relation to the environment; and, fourthly, in relation to education. It is not limited to those, but they are the four pillars that I will pursue in the electorate of Flinders over the coming years. The first of these relates to health. I turn to Warley Hospital. The great disappointment of my time in parliament has been the loss of Warley Hospital for Phillip Island. I am saddened because we committed $2½ million as a federal government, and that has been taken away by the new government. The promise for Warley Hospital on Phillip Island was a simple one: they would be given $2½ million to give them a future; so this not-for-profit, community-owned, bush nursing hospital would have a future for another 84 years. Sadly, the new health minister did not listen to the pleas from the people of Phillip Island. She did not even answer the letter which was sent by the board of the hospital. The new Prime Minister promised on 29 November that the health buck would stop with him. The Victorian Premier said, ‘Warley Hospital is not our responsibility.' Unforthe new health minister and the new Prime Minister said, contrary to the promise that the health buck would stop with them, ‘It's not our responsibility either.' The result is that a hospital which had a bright future, a proud past and an important present has closed. On 31 January, 15 employees lost their jobs. They included nurses, administrators and cleaners-people who had been committed to the future of Warley Hospital. But it affected more than just those individuals; an island lost its hospital and it lost history. So my commitment now is to work to get this hospital reopened. I do not know whether we will be able to do it, but I do know that I want that fight-and I will have that fight and we will work and work. Only in the last few days the promise that there would be an emergency service to replace Warley Hospital has been broken. Local papers have reported that families have had to travel not just to one nearby hospitalbecause that was on a bypass-or to two or three but to four hospitals before finding a place where they could stop. These reports are from the most recent Phillip Island Advertiser. That is a profound health crisis, which the new government has precipitated. This hospital had fought for its history, had lived its history, and had been a proud part of Phillip Island-and now it has gone. I also see that the state owned Koo Wee Rup Hospital, with a wonderful board and a wonderful executive, is fighting to be allowed to have respite care. At the moment we see a catch 22, in which the state says, ‘We will not allow you to apply.' Because it is a state hospital, the Koo Wee Rup Hospital is not allowed to apply for federal funding without state support, so it is being strangled and held in by the very people who ought to be encouraging its development. Similarly, we see that the maternity unit of Rosebud Hospital was closed. Mothers were sent to Frankston-sometimes a 40-minute trip away-to give birth, and then, after six hours, newborn babies were put in vehicles and sent back. The disruption for mothers and babies and families was profound. Here are three hospitals and three poor outcomes: Warley Hospital, Koo Wee Rup Hospital and Rosebud Hospital. Against that, I am proud that we have a new Medicare office in Hastings, because its this makes a difference to people's lives. Now we need more aged care in Hastings and we need to build on the over-600 places that Flinders received over the last six years. We also need something that I think is revolutionary-that is, assisted care for the disabled so that they can live in an assisted situation. There is a proposal for Hastings which I hope will find the support of the new government and of the state. I now turn to the issue of police and safety. Only last week police on the Mornington Peninsula held a crisis meeting at the Moorooduc coolstores. What they said was very simple. Brave and courageous members of the police force stood up in defiance of the standing orders from their own state authorities and said, ‘We have a crisis in policing on the Mornington Peninsula.' The answer is simple: more police for Rosebud, more police for Hastings and a police station for Somerville. We need nothing less and we will not rest until we receive a 24-hour police station for Somerville. We were told it was impossible to get a new high school for Somerville and yet we had that battle and, with the community, we were successful. That same commitment applies: to fight, to win, to receive funding and to build a 24hour police station for Somerville. I cannot say when it will happen but I do know that that fight will be maintained until we succeed. Sadly, there is another element of security to mention, an issue which I have raised in the Main Committee of the House-that is, the need to ensure that all seven rail crossings on the Mornington Peninsula which do not have boom gates are given them. I mentioned last week that I spoke with Gwen Bates, the mother of Kay Stanley. Kay was tragically killed recently in a level-crossing accident. There were no boom gates, she did not hear the warning for whatever reason and a pregnant mother-to-be was lost. Her mother, Gwen Bates, has asked that I raise this matter in parliament. I do so both for Gwen and also so that we make it absolutely clear that accidents such as this should not be allowed to happen in the future. It is a genuine tragedy in the true meaning of the word when a life has been cut short. I want to address further things. We need a bypass for Lang Lang and Koo Wee Rup. That is not part of any promise, because it is not my position to give that promise, but it part of the fight. Bypasses for Lang Lang and Koo Wee Rup will give these towns a future, give people a way through and give them a sense that these towns matter, that they cannot be ignored and that they should not be ignored by the state or by the new federal government. The third area to which I turn is the ronment. The first point here is in relation the channel-deepening project. Whilst I recognise that the broader project is inevitable-and I have said that on many occasions-it is utterly unacceptable that two million tonnes of toxic waste from the mouth of the Yarra should be dredged and dumped into Port Phillip Bay. Dieldron, DDT, arsenic, mercury, lead, cadmium and up to 270 other chemicals or heavy metals have all been identified as being contained within that toxic sediment. To use Port Phillip Bay as a dump is simply not acceptable. The second point is that Gunnamatta is the site of 150 billion litres of class C, partially treated sewage which is dumped off one of the great surf beaches of Australia every year. This is water which pollutes the coast, which is wasted, which should be recycled and which must be recycled. We have had a proposal on the table. I implore the new state government to reconsider that which they have dropped and to prefer this over desalination, because ultimately they are making a capital decision to guarantee that this dumping will continue for the next decade or the next 30 years, and they are doing so by preferring desalination over recycling for industry and agriculture. This leads me to the last of the elements in the plan for the seat of Flinders. It is in relation to education and to sport. We hear from the community a call for a new secondary college for the Bass coast. I am willing to work for that end. Whether it is in San Remo or on Phillip Island or in a nearby area, it is something which is necessary. The Bass is coast has one of the fastest growing populations in Victoria, in percentage terms, and it needs that support. On the other hand, I am delighted that we have a new low-fee Christian school in Mount Martha. I am pleased to have been able to play some small role in the creation of the Balcombe Grammar School, which envi- opened only a few short weeks ago. The to former government played an important part by giving a significant percentage of the funding. It will be a significant boon to the young families of the Mornington Peninsula and it will be a great addition to the township of Mount Martha. We must now work for a year 11 and 12 facility as part of the Somerville Secondary College, which I mentioned before, and ultimately, on the health front, work to see a Rosebud swimming pool and a Phillip Island pool in place for the aged, the young, the families and the visitors. All of these things are only possible because we have the healthiest economy in the world. I recognise that government has changed hands but our job as local members, as well as national members, is to set out the conditions for a healthy economy and to fight for those things at the local level which will give people a long-term future. For those reasons I lay out to the House this plan for health, for police, for environment and for education in the seat of Flinders.",111
152,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Kingston, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",116
153,Ms RISHWORTH,Unknown,"Firstly, may I offer my congratulations to you, Mr Speaker, on your election to that office, and I look forward to your guidance in matters parliamentary. I would also like to congratulate the Prime Minister on attaining the high office to which he has been called. I offer him my truly heartfelt congratulations, since it is under his inspiring leadership I too have been elected to sit in his government. The office of Prime Minister, though, is one whose duty lies beyond party politics and electioneering. It is an office that requires important decisions in the interests of our country and its citizens. It is an office that also requires vision-vision with regard to not only our nation's immediate needs but also the needs of its future. I can think of man better suited to the task of governing for our nation than the honourable member for Griffith. I acknowledge the contribution made to the federal parliament by previous members for Kingston, Mr Kym Richardson, Mr David Cox and the Hon. Gordon Bilney. I especially thank the latter two for the thoughtful advice they have provided to me as I embark on my parliamentary career. I am honoured and humbled to stand in this symbolic place as the representative of the people of Kingston. To serve in this House is an honour afforded to few, and we owe to ourselves and our constituents the duty to give the best we can in that service. Kingston is an outer metropolitan electorate in Adelaide that very much represents what is so great about our country. The electorate is bound by stunning coastline to the west and the picturesque Adelaide Hills to the east. We have some of the earliest settlements in South Australia, in Willunga, Old Noarlunga and Old Reynella. We have some of the newest housing developments. We have semirural areas and magnificent vineyards, and we have densely populated urban suburbs that many working families call home. It is also the traditional home of the Kaurna people. Together these aspects of the south create a unique community which, although diverse, has a strong sense of identity. I was born at Flinders Medical Centre, which continues to be a leading hospital in that the state and the most significant medical facility serving the people of my electorate. I studied at the Flinders University of South Australia, where I was also a student leader. These facilities were the herald of promise in Adelaide in the sixties, just as so much of my electorate is the locality of promise in a new century. My parents chose to settle in the inner south of Adelaide before I was born. I no want to pay my greatest tribute to my parents, Leslie and Judith, who are both here today. They have been a constant support throughout my life and I certainly would not have made it to this place today without their love, help and guidance. I thank also my siblings, Shannon and Julian. The three of us have shared a strong bond growing up and, although we have all chosen different paths, we continue to share a close and supportive friendship in our adult life. My family have a long and proud tradition of service to our country. Both of my grandfathers served in the Second World War, as did my grandmother. My brother serves today in the Royal Australian Air Force. I hope to emulate their commitment and dedication to our nation, not in uniform but in service of a different kind in the Australian parliament. I put myself forward for federal parliament because I am passionate about social justice, about opportunity and about a fair go. The fair go is synonymous with the Australian way of life. It is sometimes used as an empty slogan, but for me it is much more than that. It embodies what I believe to be a truly Australian ethos, an ingrained belief that all citizens should be treated fairly, equally and compassionately and that they should be given the opportunity to be their best. This is demonstrated no more clearly than in the work laws that govern our offices, our shops and our factories. The last federal election was absolutely critical in determining that Australians will not tolerate a tearing down of their right to a fair go in the workplace. Australians endorsed the substance of the fair go, not the empty slogan. It is perhaps a cliche to say every election is the most important since the war, since no federal election is unimportant, but I do sincerely believe that the most recent election was a tremendous turning point, a great pivot in our national history. Had the Australian people accepted the previous government's Work Choices, it would have signalled a sad repudiation of our nation's egalitarianism and our commitment to a fair go. Industrial relations has been important to me for many years. I felt the hard edge of the 1996 workplace relations legislation when I was offered an AWA while employed by a large American retailer. I refused to sign and was no longer offered work despite my five years of loyal service. I was 19 years old at the time. Hence, industrial reform and the enforcement of AWAs is not merely an abstract concept for me. I know first hand the pressure, the threats and the consequences a large and thoughtless employer can impose on a young and vulnerable worker. I see it as a fundamental duty for me as a parliamentarian to ensure other workers are not placed in that situation and do not suffer that affront to their rights at work. That is why I am proud to be a part of this government, a government going forward with fairness in the workplace. At that time. I was very grateful for the assistance given by the union I had joined to protect my rights. That union, the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association, helped me stand up for myself and demonstrated to me the virtue of sticking together to help each other. I have gone on to have a long association with this union as both an activist and an official. I make no apologies for having been a union official. I am extremely proud of the fact that I have helped thousands of people get a better deal at work and protect their interests in the workplace. Only those who have no genuine conception of real workplaces can think being a unionist is anything less than a fine and admirable preparation for parliamentary service. I am especially grateful that I had the opportunity to represent workers in the southern suburbs of South Australia, the area that I now have the honour to represent here. I take this opportunity to extend my thanks to those in the South Australian branch of the SDA who I had the pleasure to work with over many years, particularly the South Australian secretary, Don Farrell. I would not be standing here today without his support, encouragement, advice and belief in me. I would also like to thank current and former assistant secretaries Peter Malinauskas and the Hon. Bernard Finnigan, who over the years have also provided me with sage advice and words of wisdom. To me a socially just society is like woven cloth, one in which many threads come together to make a cohesive whole, a unified fabric. I would like to briefly expand upon what I see as some of the key threads that need to be woven together to advance our nation into the 21st century. I am a defender of the role of government in improving the quality of life and opportunity available to people. Governments cannot solve all problems, nor can governments make all decisions, but governments should, dare I say must, ensure the framework and foundations are there so that our citizens can. I believe in the social contract, the notion that each individual is part of a society. Citifrastructure zens pay their taxes and in return are entitled to expect from their government liberty, protection from harm, security and, where necessary, aid to their welfare. This is no more important than in the area of health care. As a qualified clinical psychologist I have had the good fortune to be intimately involved in providing front-line care to the mentally ill and emotionally troubled. We must continue to pay great attention to the needs of those requiring mental health care. Unlike many physical ailments, mental illness is not always visible, but it is no less serious. We must continue to improve our standard of care that promotes psychological well-being and mental health in our community. When it comes to mental health and health care in general, I also believe we must invest in prevention as well as treatment. This is the only way we can advance a healthier, happier and more productive society. I consider it of the utmost importance that Australia enjoys a system of public health care that is the envy of the world. There are many challenges facing our system, such as rapidly changing technology and an ageing population; however, we must meet those challenges and maintain our hospitals and health system at their best. We must protect and defend the principle of universal health care, as it is unacceptable that a person's financial position should determine whether they might live or die. Maintaining and building infrastructure remains a priority for my electorate and is a key thread to improving quality of life for the people of Kingston. Just as much work all was done in the sixties and seventies to lay the foundations for large-scale settlement in the south, so we must make a renewed effort in this new century. Providing greater rail services and better roads, building high speed broadband and maintaining a supply of high-quality clean water are all essential inrequired not only in my electorate but also across the nation. I am confident the Rudd government, in conjunction with our colleagues at state and local level, can work to lay these much needed foundations for our future. Intrinsically linked with infrastructure in the south is economic development. The need to focus on economic development in the south of Adelaide has only been emphasised by the announcement that the Mitsubishi plant is set to close at the end of next month. Losing one's job represents much more than just missing out on a pay packet. For many of these workers their identity has been tied up with the quality cars that they made and the line in which they worked. I want to pay tribute to these workers who provided loyal service but were victims of circumstances beyond their control. Despite this sad circumstance we need to look to the future, the future for these workers and the future of the region. I would like to thank the Prime Minister, the minister for industry and the Premier of South Australia for making a commitment to invest in the south of Adelaide, an investment that I believe should be focused in the area of high-tech, innovative and sustainable industry. The provision of quality education for all children is another vital thread in the woven cloth of social justice. I want to ensure that all young Australians can reach their potential so they in turn can one day also contribKingston, ute to our nation's growth and prosperity. I am particularly committed to working on early childhood education and I am proud that our government has seen fit to identify this area as a priority. My work as a psychologist has highlighted to me the critical need to provide our kids with the best possi- tion. ble start in life, ensuring that they have access to a high standard of education to allow them the best opportunities in those early formative years and to set them up for the future. I have spoken of my family and former union colleagues. Of course, there are many others I need to thank-people who have played various roles in getting me to this moment. I would firstly like to thank my friend Brer Adams. It was through his enthusiasm that I became active in the political process and embraced politics as an avenue for change. I would like to thank my campaign team, who worked tirelessly over the election period. I especially thank my campaign manager, Chris Picton, whose commitment, drive and attention to detail ensured that we achieved the result we did in Kingston. Thanks go to my deputy campaign manager, Sonia Romeo, whose dedication and organisation ensured that the campaign ran smoothly on the ground. I express thanks also to Senator Dana Wortley for all her help. To Alex Dighton, Xanthe Kleinig, Tom Koutsantonis, the member for Wakefield, the honourable Minister for Youth and Minister for Sport, Senator Annette Hurley, Shane MCNeil, Nimfa Farrell, and Chloe Fox: I am extremely grateful for all the moral support and well-considered advice you provided me through the campaign. Thanks also to my staff-Emily, Mary, Suzanne, Emmanuel and Aaron-for their hard work in servicing the constituents in the seat of Kingston. I would like to express my gratitude to all Labor Party members and supporters in who worked so hard on my campaign. I truly could not have won without their tireless help. I also acknowledge the Kingston Your Rights at Work group, who campaigned vigorously to ensure that the industrial relations debate remained in the forefront of voters' minds during the elecIn closing, I wish to bring to mind the man after whom my electorate is named. Charles Cameron Kingston was a colourful character and a colossal figure in the story of Federation. Kingston was a pioneer who worked long and hard to see Australia become a nation. I often think about the aspirations of those men and women at the beginning of Federation. They had a vision for a strong, united country. They believed in the capacity of the Australian people for democracy, freedom and enterprise. How proud they would be to see us now, a strong and prosperous nation. It is a nation that contributes beyond its size, population or wealth in international affairs, a nation that enjoys tremendous unity and common purpose, and a nation that soon I hope will select its own head of state. Our challenge, 100 years later, is to ensure that in another century our descendants can look back on the decisions we make now and feel that we too played our part in our nation's journey, that we built on those early foundations, that we saw both the potential of the present and the challenges for the future and that we lived up to the promise. Just as those who lived in the early settlements in my electorate a century ago sought a better life, so do thousands now seek that better life in newer areas. Their aspiration for a better quality of life and a fair go for their children and their grandchildren is one that is shared by all generations. So it will be my task, with all the energy and ability I can muster, to do what I can to make that aspiration a reality, to play that part, to continue weaving that cloth of justice and to commit to those vital threads of fairness, of opportunity, of education and of care for the benefit of those I have the privilege to represent and to the advancement of our great nation.  Speaker, it is good of you to come into the House to hear the humble member for Sturt make his contribution to the address-in-reply debate tonight. I look forward to feedback on my speech, perhaps at a later occasion when we might be chatting about the parliament over a cup of tea. There is no doubt that the opening remarks that I would like to make in the address-in-reply debate are to thank the electorate of Sturt for re-electing me for the sixth time to the House of Representatives. In the Howard government, I had the privilege to serve as a minister and as a parliamentary secretary over four years. But it is a truism of illness. politics that service at the electorate level is the most important privilege that is afforded a member of parliament. If you are not a member of parliament, you cannot have those other opportunities to serve in higher office. Every three years or less, I face the opponents that Labor puts up against me, and every other time and again this time. I am grateful that the electors of Sturt have chosen to re-elect me. Perhaps on this occasion it was not quite by the comfortable margin that I have enjoyed in the past. I won by 1,711 votes. Some of the members of this House who are busily congratulating their colleague were active in campaigning against me, which is a great shame. I thought there was a bit of camaraderie in this place but, unfortunately, at election time the Minister for Youth and Minister for Sport and others could not wait to get their talons into my electorate to try to remove me from it. But we fought the good fight and, fortunately for the electors of Sturt and for me, we were re-elected. I am very grateful for their support. Often when you are a minister or a parliamentary secretary, you get given opportunities to do large things. When I was the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing, I was responsible for the mental health package, which was one of the more important tasks that I did as a member of the executive of the last government. It was worth about $1.9 billion. I think it is fair to say it has made and will continue to make a great difference to people in Australia who are suffering from a mental illness, not least because we opened up the Medicare safety net to psychologists-I note the member for Kingston, who has just spoken, talked about her role in psychology-and I think that has made a huge difference to those people in Australia who are suffering from a mental At a more micro level, every task that each person in my electorate asks me to do for them as their local member is critically important. Each one needs to be given the absolute attention that one can bring to it as a member of parliament. Over the last 15 years that I have served in this House, I hope that I have helped many of the constituents in my electorate, and I look forward to continuing to help them over the next three years. During the election I did lay down a seven-point plan for improving the electorate of Sturt in particular. I wish to touch on that tonight in the address-in-reply debate. For many years one of the hoary chestnuts of politics in South Australia has been the Britannia roundabout. This is not just any kind of roundabout; this is a historic roundabout just outside my electorate but in fact servicing my electorate and which used to be in my electorate. It has been a difficult area for fic in South Australia and Sturt for a very long time. It is rated the most significant traffic red spot in South Australia by the Royal Automobile Association of South Australia, with in excess of 100 car collisions annually. For a very long time. I have been campaigning and calling on the state government in South Australia to take the necessary action to improve the Britannia roundabout. This roundabout is not on the national highway and as a consequence misses out on the funds that the Commonwealth could bring to try and assist in fixing the Britannia roundabout. I have asked on many occasions the state government, circulated petitions, held public meetings and supported the Britannia roundabout action group. I have asked the state government to take the necessary steps to make it a safe place for the commuters, for the drivers of South Australia and Adelaide from my electorate into the city. Mr Bevis-You had 11 years to list it as a black spot.  think is quite rudely placed on the back bench by the new Prime Minister. Certainly if I had had that position he would have been on the front bench of any government that I led-not that he would get this opportunity, I would think. I would not be holding your breath, if I were you, Arch. I think that is highly unlikely. But I think the Prime Minister made a significant error of judgement in not putting the member for Brisbane on the front bench, and I welcome his support for my campaign to do something about the Britannia roundabout. There are a number of options, but the two that are the most conducive to assisting with the problems of the Britannia roundabout are, first, installing traffic lights around the roundabout at a cost of about $9 million, which the state government could do relatraftively easily. It would not be the optimal solution, in my view. It would be a short-term solution but it would be at least some step in the right direction. The longer term solution, the better step, would be to start a feasibility study to build an underpass under the Britannia roundabout so that the traffic would be diverted substantially in the direction of Fullarton Road and Dequetteville Terrace. By doing so it would ameliorate substantially the likelihood of danger and damage to the residents of my electorate. That is one of the areas that I intend to continue to campaign on in this term. Another one is to try to bring funds to the state schools and other schools in my electorate. The Howard government had an excellent record in the Investing in Our Schools Program of providing substantial funding to schools in my and many other electorates right across the country. In fact, only in the last few years the former government committed $2.7 million to Linden Park Primary School for its redevelopment; $132,000 to the Paradise Primary School for the upgrade of its music, drama and information technology facilities; funds for the upgrade of sports amenities at Athelstone Primary School, which cost $150,000; close to $47,000 to the Norwood Morialta High School under the Community Water Grants; and $65,000 for the installation of air-conditioning at Wandana Primary School. The East Marden Primary School received close to $50,000 to create an environmentally friendly play space, and $75,000 was provided to the Charles Campbell Secondary School for an all-weather shelter and an upgrade of the student support area. These are a few examples. Finally, the Gilles Plains Primary School received $75,000 for resurfacing of the playground. So over quite a period of time the Howard government injected millions and millions of dollars into local schools in my electorate, making a difference to the services and the amenities provided to the students of those schools. I would like to see that continue. There is tremendous work that could be achieved at the Hillcrest Primary School. That school needs new ovals and new play areas, new buildings and air-conditioning to provide support to one of the more depressed areas of the Adelaide metropolitan area, which is in my electorate. Hillcrest, Gilles Plains Primary School-these schools need continuous support from government. The state government has a direct responsibility, and the new Commonwealth government should not have abandoned the Investing in Our Schools Program, because it did provide a tremendous resource for those kinds of tasks that principals and their school councils thought would be of great value to the local schools. I would like to see that reinstituted or, if it is not reinstituted, another program which would support primary schools and secondary schools across my electorate, particularly Gilles Plains and Hillcrest. I know the Burnside Primary School, where my own children have been to school, is also in need of an upgrade. I hope it will get support from the new Commonwealth government in providing the kinds of services and amenities that the close to 700 students need at the Burnside Primary School. One of the other areas that I have raised one of my plans for Sturt in the next three years is keeping open the Glenside Hospital. The state government have a plan to essentially close the Glenside Hospital, which is the mental health hospital in Adelaide, and turn it into a smaller and in my view downgraded mental facility. They will introduce residential accommodation for the mentally ill, which I think is very important, but they are going to sell off huge parts of the Glenside Hospital campus for housing redevelopment. It is important public land which was willed to the people of South Australia in 1836 by our ancestors to be handed down to future generations. The state government's plan is for a smaller mental health facility, for the South Australian Film Corporation to be moved to the old hospital, for the selling off of large parts of the public land at the campus, and for retail and commercial tenancies to be built on the site of the campus, which is quite unnecessary given the amount of retail and commercial accommodation that is already available in the Glenside precinct. This will not provide the kinds of services that those people who have a mental illness in South Australia need. The local community in Glenside are quite rightly up in arms, and they are also up in arms because the state government has treated them with such complete contempt. I have been to three public meetings in my electorate-others have been held; I think there have been four or five-and at none of those has the state minister responsible for this, Gail Gago, been prepared to front up to the local residents of Glenside and explain her position. She has sent public servants. The public servants have come along and manfully-and I guess womanfullydefended the state government's position. But the reality is, as anybody in this place knows, that public servants are not responsible for policies of governments. Public seras vants are required to introduce the policies set for them by government. But it is the government which is answerable to the people for those policies. And for the state minister for mental health services to be so cowardly as to be not prepared to front the public meetings, in my electorate, of local residents who are deeply concerned about the changes to Glenside Hospital I think is nothing short of an abject disgrace. Probably the member for Wakefield is a close friend and supporter of Gail Gago, the minister at the local level. They might not be in the same faction of course-they are a bit split down there in South Australia. But, on the basis that they are all in the Labor Party family, he no doubt supports Gail Gago's inattention to the constituents who are dead keen to meet with her and ask her questions in a public forum about what exactly she intends to do with the Glenside Hospital campus and to ask her to reconsider. That is an area on which I will continue to fight for my constituents over the next three years. Another area is the periodic flooding of First Creek. There are four major creeks that run through my electorate from the foothills through to the sea, or to the Torrens. First Creek had a major flood in November 2005. It was not quite the same as the Queensland floods that we have been experiencing in the last few weeks, but it was a very substantial flood that washed out hundreds of homes of people who lived along First Creek in the catchment area and destroyed the roads and made them unusable. The state government has been very slow in repairing the roads adequately for the benefit of the residents who live along First Creek. We need to have a long-term strategy for the diversion of water or the stopping of the periodic 50-year and 100-year floods that occur on First Creek. The former government initiated a program on this. We put money into the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board. We allocated them money to start a program or conduct a feasibility study about what to do with the periodic flooding of First to Fifth creeks. The Norwood, Payneham and St Peters Council, an excellent council in my district, have been taking steps within their own area to mitigate the worse excesses of the flooding of First Creek, but it is a bigger responsibility than one council's. We started the project, and I call on the federal government and the South Australian members who are present here to continue it. The South Australian members present here have not quite got the same pull in the federal government as had South Australian members in the previous government. We had a number of ministers and cabinet ministers from South Australia. I think there is one cabinet minister in the Rudd Labor government from South Australia. At one stage there were four from South Australia under the previous government. Whatever small pull the present members have on the government, I call on them to use it. I hope that the member for Adelaide, into whose electorate First Creek flows, will take a great interest in the need to stop the periodic flooding of First Creek. I notice the member for Makin looking quizzical. He has not given his maiden speech yet, I think, so he is not entitled to be rude to me from the government benches, though I will be kind to him. I notice him looking quizzical. But I can assure him that the residents in his area, to whom Fifth Creek would be of importance, are very keen to make sure that these kinds of projects are given maximum attention by the Labor government. There are a couple of other areas I would like to touch on. One is the Campbelltown City Soccer Club. I was very fortunate to be able to gain a $1 million grant for the Campbelltown City Soccer Club based at Newton in my electorate. That grant is to provide facilities for the 400 families who are regular users of that sports and social club. The club had been allowed to languish for several decades using very substandard facilities. After a great deal of lobbying, the former Minister for the Arts and Sport, George Brandis, very helpfully managed to secure a grant for me of $1 million for that sports and social club. The club members are very worried because Labor's razor gang is planning cuts right across the government. It would be an absolute travesty of justice if that grantwhich had already been announced and was relied upon by that club, its families and the people who live in that part of Newton in my electorate-were cut. Those people would miss out on their grant and on the change to their facilities, a change that would give state-of-the-art facilities for the children use that sports club. It would be a travesty if they were to miss out on that because of the razor gang of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, which is cutting into national security and defence and outrageously targeting projects like the Campbelltown sports and social club redevelopment. And so I am calling on the government to assure me, and through me my constituents in Newton, that the Campbelltown sports and social club grant is safe from the prying hands of the minister for finance and the Treasurer as they seek to try and pretend that somehow they have not been given the best economy in 107 years in the handover between the two governments. Black spot funding is always an important issue in all electorates across the country. There are, surprisingly, even in metropolitan Adelaide, a number of black spots in my electorate which I think still need to be attended to. On Gorge Road, Athelstone, for example, where there is a valley which crosses to King George Avenue, there is a black spot which pedestrians find very dangerous to cross. It has railings and guard rails and so on, but still it is not adequate, and what they really need is a raised pedestrian crossing-oh, the Speaker is back. It is good to have you back, Mr Speaker. They were moving through the chair pretty quickly in my speech-being knocked over like flies. We need a raised pedestrian crossing in order to protect those pedestrians crossing Gorge Road at Athelstone. There are two other black spots that I would like to make mention of. One is OG Road at Klemzig. There was a very terrible accident involving a school student who was killed at that crossing late last year-a St Ignatius student. St Ignatius is my old school, my alma mater, and the Leader of the Opposition's old school. OG Road at who Klemzig needs attention under the Black Spot Program. There is a similar situation on Gorge Road at Athelstone near St Ignatius College. A lot of complaints and petitions have been raised by me and by local residents about the need to improve the black spot situation at Gorge Road, both at King George Avenue and at St Ignatius Collegebetween the cemetery that exists there and the school. There are a number of outstanding aspects of black spot funding on which Sturt could well do with support from the Commonwealth government. There are improvements, I am pleased to say, that are occurring at the North East Road and Sudholz Road intersection and the North East Road and Blacks Road junction through the Australian government's Black Spot Program. We managed to secure funding from the last government to ensure that those issues in the northern part of my electorate are being properly dealt with. Finally, I would like to touch on the subject of broadband, which has received a lot of airplay under Kevin Rudd. It is one of his many first priorities. He has a lot of first priorities. Education is his first priority. Economic management is his No. 1 priority. Defence and security were his first priority in November 2007. Inflationary pressures were his No. 1 priority in December 2007. Climate change was in November. Cooperative federalism was also his No. 1 priority. He has six No. 1 priorities; he is quite the Houdini. I would ask him to come through with his promises to do with broadband. The federal government put huge resources into the broadband guarantee. I hope that is not under threat. Families and all Australians who live in the foothills in my electorate-in Campbelltown, in Newton, in Tea Tree Gully and through Hope Valley and Oakden-deserve proper access to broadband supported by the private sector. Whatever the government can do to fulfil its promises on broadband will be welcomed by the residents of my electorate, and it will build on the good work that we did in government with respect to the broadband guarantee.

154,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the member for Lindsay, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",125
155,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,"Lindsay) (7.39 pm)It is with great honour that I rise to speak for the first time in this House. In doing so, I wish to acknowledge the trust that the people of Lindsay have invested in me. Bounded at the east by Ropes Creek and South Creek, the Lindsay electorate extends across the Cumberland plain and the majestic Nepean River to the foothills of the Blue Mountains. At its northern boundary is Castlereagh, one of the historic Macquarie towns, and at its southern boundary is Mulgoa, named after the local Dharug tribe that once inhabited those parts. Wholly situated within the city of Penrith, the Lindsay electorate is part of a community that I have proudly served as a councillor and a former mayor for almost nine years. In this time, I have come to the clear and unmistakable conclusion that the greatest asset of this community is its people-hard working, generous, passionate and enterprising. Apart from being the place where my wife and I are raising our four young children, this is the place where my ancestors first settled in this country. Around 170 years ago, my great-grandfather's grandfather, Walter Bradbury, settled in the Penrith area. He had travelled to the new colony on convict escort duty as a member of the 80th Regiment of Foot, Staffordshire Volunteers. In 1843, Walter came to local prominence when, as a constable posted at Penrith, he was granted a substantial reward from the Governor for apprehending a group of deserters armed with muskets from the 99th Regiment at Parramatta. Acting on a secret tip-off, he apprehended a group of rogue elements who had been threatening the peace and order of the local community by engaging in despicable and clandestine acts. These events bear a striking resemblance to the events that took place in Lindsay in the final days of the 2007 election campaign. A century after Walter Bradbury's arrival, my mother and her parents, Anthony and Paola Tedesco, came to these shores from war-torn Malta in search of new opportunities. They were a part of that other great wave of migration that enriched our nation in the years after the Second World War. My family's story encapsulates only two of the many different threads of that rich tapestry that is the story of the great region that has been my home since birth. As the place that one in 10 Australians call home, Western Sydney is now the third largest regional economy in Australia. It also represents one of the most diverse and cosmopolitan regions in this nation. But, before becoming all of these things, Western Sydney was home to the first Australians. I pay my respects to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, who I recognise as the traditional owners or custodians of the lands and waters of this country. As the first member for Lindsay to do so, I add my voice to the apology issued by this parliament and say sorry to our Aboriginal people for past mistreatment, including the stolen generations. Before European settlement, the local Aboriginal tribes called the area that now constitutes Penrith city Muru Marak, which means ‘mountain pathway'. Indeed, it is Penrith's proximity to the Blue Mountains that provides a central reference point to its history, which is shared by both its Indigenous and its non-Indigenous inhabitants. After setting out from his South Creek farm in 1813, Gregory Blaxland, along with William Lawson and WC Wentworth, became the first European to cross the Blue Mountains. Where other Europeans had failed, Blaxland's strategy of following the high ridges proved successful. Apart from marking out Penrith as a place from which great journeys might be launched, the Blue Mountains crossing opened up more land for the young colony, which had been fast running out of grazing land for its cattle. The real historical significance of the Blue Mountains crossing is that it became the expedition that allowed the young colony to overcome the geographical barrier that had stopped it from further expansion and growth. I passionately believe that, in the same way that the first crossing of the Blue Mountains helped the infant colony scale the heights of one of the natural barriers that prevented it from reaching its potential, it the role of government to help all individuals overcome the barriers that prevent them from reaching their potential and fulfilling their destiny. In short, the objective of government action should always be, as former Labor Prime Minister Andrew Fisher once said, to ensure that every Australian is given ‘the fullest opportunity to rise in life'. This is why I believe in the power of government. It is a simple but enduring belief: that governments have the power to change people's lives and that governments are capable of creating and extending opportunities to all. This is the one conviction that has guided me in my life and the one belief that has led me to this place. I believe in the relative efficiency of the market but I also believe that our nation and all of our people will only realise their full potential with the carefully targeted intervention of government. Where hope and optimism are shackled by disadvantage and despair, government must intervene. Where ability and promise are restrained by dysfunction and disincentive, government must intervene. Where opportunity and competition are frustrated by market power and privilege, government must intervene. To realise our nation's potential, we must liberate the talents and abilities of all of our people. Australia will only realise its potential when every person in this country is given the opportunity to bridge the gap between what they are and what they are capable of becoming. We must rebuild the architecture of the state to align it more closely with the vision we hold for our nation's future. We must overcome inertia and indifference with investment and incentive. We must entrench reward for economic and social contribution and we must use the instruments of public policy to discourage anything less. Most imhad portantly, we must reach for a future where is every person in this country is valued. Every person has a contribution to make and it is the responsibility of government to make sure they can. This is the moral imperative that dictates that government must do all that it can to empower people to realise their potential. Whilst it is the responsibility of government to provide opportunities, the social compact demands that individuals make the most of these opportunities. Government must invest in the social infrastructure needed to empower individuals and communities to take advantage of the opportunities that are created. A strong and effective state must be accompanied by a strong society underpinned by resilient communities. Governments can strengthen communities but they cannot do the job on their own. Ultimately, communities are defined by the interrelationships between the people that comprise them. Family, however described, is at the very heart of this notion of community. We must promote policies that support and sustain the relationships between people, their families and their communities, because a strong and cohesive society is the only foundation upon which the architecture of the state can be securely built. We must embrace the benefits of investing in our social infrastructure. We must act upon the evidence of the long-term benefits of prevention and early intervention. We must equip our parents and grandparents, our families and our communities with the tools required to build resilience and social cohesion. We must accept the importance of early childhood education. We know from the work of the Nobel laureate Professor James Heckman that the events of a person's first 60 months of their life will be more important in their emotional and intellectual devellogical opment than anything that happens in their next 60 years. Government has a greater role to play in these formative years. Every child must be nurtured and provided with the access to early learning that success in life quires. Where families and communities are denying children these opportunities, government must take some responsibility. Family visits, parental support and education, access to early learning, breakfast clubs, eracy programs and mentoring programs are all essential. Apart from the moral imperative, there are also powerful economic reasons why government should provide opportunities to all. If we are to compete in a global economy with nations that are 50 times our population, we simply cannot afford to give up on a single person. This is why it is in our national economic interest to provide opportunities to help every person unlock their full potential. If we are to realise our economic potential as a nation, we must create opportunities for lifelong learning and training. We must lift participation in the workforce and the voluntary sector. We must restore incentive to our tax system. We must take greater responsibility for our health and well-being. We must invest in the arteries of the modern economy with new and upgraded infrastructure. In part, this is what Labor's education revolution is about. It is about providing opportunities to overcome the barriers that prevent us from reaching our economic potential as a nation. It is about recognising the realities of globalisation. With globalisation we are facing a world where our nation's prospects are inextricably linked to our ability to mobilise the skills and talents of our people. It is about recognising that we cannot compete with the armies of unskilled labour emerging in India and China, nor can we fight the march of automation and technochange. But the opportunities that globalisation presents are already beginning to become available to those who have benefited from the opportunities provided by government over the last 30 years. To the rehighly skilled, the global economy offers almost unlimited opportunities. Young Australians with highly developed skills are in great demand right across the globe. For many, the global economy has elevated their litprospects of social mobility to a new stratosphere. With these people, the challenge is to ensure that their skills, their enterprise and their creativity are not lost to another country. That is why Australia must not lose sight of its comparative advantages. We have a reputation for being home to some of the greatest cities in the world, and our lifestyle is second to none. But under the pressures of ad hoc growth and repeated failures to deliver the infrastructure that our cities require, the livability of our cities is under threat. Gridlock on our roads and freeways and inadequate and limited choice of public transport are all combining to have a corrosive impact on social and family life. These transport and infrastructure challenges that threaten the livability of our cities and suburbs must not be seen as peripheral to the great economic challenge of globalisation, because they are at its very heart. These and other barriers that prevent our nation from reaching its potential require new policy approaches and new leadership. In the same way as the young colony's expansion required the leadership of the Blue Mountains explorers, our nation needs to embark upon a new expedition, driven by new leadership-leadership that nurtures, cultivates and harvests the talents and abilities of our people, leadership that looks into the eyes of each Australian and sees success as their destiny rather than failure as their fate. It is leadership that expunges the shadow cast by the politics of fear and illuminates our nation with a message of hope. This is the leadership that Australians have always looked to the Australian Labor Party to provide. As the great custodian of the progressive political tradition in this nation, the Labor Party has always dedicated its energies to the pursuit of social justice, ness and the creation and extension of opportunities for and to all. As Labor we believe that all Australians, regardless of their circumstances, should have the opportunity to liberate their talents and realise their potential. With hard work, discipline and determination, no Australian should be denied reward in a society that allows them to fully exploit their talents and rise in life. These values constitute our moral and political compass and guide us in the pursuit of our work. We are committed to delivering a strong economy and a fair society in the social democratic tradition, with hard heads and kind hearts. It is because of these values that we support an education revolution, fairness and decency in our workplaces, universal access to health care and accessible and affordable child care. These are the values that will guide us as we confront the challenges that lie ahead for the nation. These challenges include responding to the nation's skills crisis, restoring fairness to our workplaces, addressing the balance between work and family, building better cities whilst fighting the housing affordability crisis, and improving transport and other physical infrastructure. We must close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We must rebuild our hospitals and health system. We must confront the pressures of an ageing population and fight the scourge of drug and alcohol abuse. We must secure sustainable solutions to our energy needs and confront the challenges of climate change and water. We must redesign our Federation and improve our confidence in the institutions of governance. We must restore our leadership role in the international community and defend our nation from the threat of terrorism. These are some of the great challenges to which I dedicate myself on behalf of the fair- people of Lindsay. As I begin my work in this parliament, confronting these challenges as a legislator, I am inspired by the words of Robert F Kennedy, who said: An honourable profession calls forth the chance for responsibility and the opportunity for achievement; against these measures politics truly exciting adventure. Labor's victory in Lindsay was the product of the hard work of many people who have contributed to my last three campaigns. I thank all of the party members, the branches, the union members and members of the local community, some of whom are in the gallery this evening. I thank them for having been involved in this victory. In particular, I wish to thank Senator Steve Hutchins, who has been by my side throughout the last three campaigns. I also wish to thank Mark Arbib, Karl Bitar, Diane Beamer, Chris Bowen, my councillor colleagues, especially Pat Sheehy, Greg Davies and John Thain, Ron Mulock and Faye Lo Po, Prue Guillaume, Justin Koek, Julia Hine, Linda Bourke, Todd Carney, David Latham, Camden Gilchrist, the Allison and MCKeown families, Russell Boserio, Steve and Sheryl Vine, Sandra Lyle, Gai and Michael Maskell, Paul and Elaine Talbert, Keven Cross, the Genovese family, Rien and Margaret Koek, Bill Buckley, Brian and Dorothy O'Farrell, Lois and Colin Fisher, Russell Baker, Matt Hazell, Mark Greenhill, Ann Keating, Angela Humphries, New South Wales Young Labor and my many supporters from the local Filipine, Indian, Nepalese and Sri Lankan communities. I wish to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of the men and women of the Australian trade union movement for their role in ensuring the election of the Rudd Labor government. In particular, I wish to thank Michael Williamson, Gerard Hayes, Mike O'Donnell and the entire team at the HSU, Tony Sheldon and the TWU, Andrew Ferguson and the CFMEU, Geoff Derrick and the FSU, the ETU and Matt Thistlethwaite, Mary Yaager and the Lindsay Your Rights at Work team. Let there be no mistake: our victory represents a clear mandate from the working families of Lindsay to is a repeal the Howard government's extreme and unfair Work Choices laws. I wish to thank my old mates Scott Connolly, Matthew Martyn-Jones, John Degen and Ben Heraghty, my good friend Robert Ishak and his team at William Roberts and my former colleagues at my old law firm, Blake Dawson, especially those in the tax group. Most importantly, I thank my family, who are in the gallery tonight-some of them behind sound-proof glass. Family has been the greatest inspiration in my life. To my beautiful wife, Kylie, and my four beautiful children, Anna, Helena, Rose and Nicholas: I thank you for giving me this opportunity and I hope that I can honour your selflessness through the quality of the contribution I make to public life. To my parents, John and Carmen: I hope I make you as proud of me as I am of you. In my successes, I see your sacrifices. To my siblings and their spouses, Natalie and my good friend Troy, two of my greatest supporters, with whom I have learnt so much in politics, Catherine, Trish and Charlie, and Stephen: thank you for your support and for giving me some great political advice around the dinner table. To Michael and Beverley Addison: thank you for your tremendous support. To Babs, Ben and Flo, Michael, Byron, Marcus and Hayley, and Wendell: thank you for your support. I also thank my extended family of uncles, aunts and cousins, many of whom worked hard for me on many election days. All of you have made this day possible. I also acknowledge the assistance provided to me by Lorraine Stacker from Penrith Library. I acknowledge the two previous members for Lindsay-in particular, my good friend Ross Free, who was also first elected to serve in this parliament on his third attempt. I also acknowledge Tony Luchetti and the great Joseph Benedict Chifley, who both served my local community before the seat of Lindsay was created. Like Ben Chifley, I had the great privilege of being educated by the Patrician Brothers, whom I also acknowledge and thank today. After two earlier unsuccessful attempts to reach this place, I know only too well that I am here to serve the people of Lindsay and will only remain here for as long as I continue to enjoy their trust and confidence. As I stand in this parliament today, I am reminded of the words of Gregory Blaxland, who, upon crossing the Blue Mountains, remarked: This expedition, which has proved so completely successful, resulted from two previous attempts. Like Blaxland, I know that, after having just overcome the seemingly insurmountable, now the real work begins.",125
156,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Robertson, I remind the House that, whilst not her first speech in the Australian parliament, this is the honourable member's first speech in this House. I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",130
157,Ms NEAL,Unknown,"I acknowledge your elevation, Mr Speaker, and congratulate you, as is the tradition. I can assure you I will respect your ruling and comply in all things, as you would expect. I rise to speak for the first time as the federal member for Robertson. It has been a long and difficult journey. But it is the fulfilment of a calling I have had all my adult life. Firstly, I must thank the people of Robertson. They have elected me to represent them here in federal parliament and I feel honoured. I am dedicated to living up to the faith that they have shown in me. I feel privileged to be a part of the largest Labor government in Australia's history, led by an energetic Prime Minister of fresh ideas and with great compassion for those who are disadvantaged in our community. His leadership is a large part of why I chose to seek election at this time and to help end the aridness of the Howard years. Most of all I am proud of the Australian people, who at this election rejected the exploitation of workers and embraced a fairer relationship between employees and employers, who rejected the politics of division and embraced unity, who rejected selfseeking opportunism and embraced a caring society, who turned their backs on meanheartedness and embraced generosity of spirit, who rejected the short-term exploitation of our environment and chose to protect our natural beauty and to make plans to deal with the challenges of climate change. This breadth of spirit was vividly illustrated last Wednesday with our national apology to the stolen generation, and I look forward to its continuation. I am ambitious for an enlightened social democracy built on the goodwill of the Australian people and formed on the foundations of a strong and vibrant economy. The seat of Robertson was one of the only three federal seats named after premiers. It was named after Sir John Robertson, the small landholder's friend. He had a prodigious career in both length and achievement. Like me, he served in both the upper and lower houses but, unlike me, he served in the New South Wales parliament and was a staunch opponent of Federation. Robertson in 1901 was a large rural seat covering a large chunk of rural New South Wales, stretching from Dubbo to just west of Newcastle. Over time, as the population of the area increased, the seat moved east to outer metropolitan Newcastle and then south to become the Central Coast seat in New South Wales that it is today. Robertson is located on the coast between Sydney and Newcastle but has a character all of its own. In the south it is bordered by the Hawkesbury River, in the east by the Pacific Ocean, in the north by Terrigal. It stretches westward to include the hinterlands of Mangrove Mountain and Peats Ridge. The Central Coast is a region of beaches and waterways, with villages and towns scattered between them. In the last two decades that I have lived there, it has become more urbanised but it still retains its unique quality. I know it is a tradition to say that your seat is of unique beauty, but in this case it truly is. I am the 12th person to hold the seat of Robertson, but it would be accurate to say that the first member to represent Robertson as a Central Coast seat was Barry Cohen. He held the seat for 21 years, from 1969, and was certainly a local champion. His relentless pursuit of local interest is certainly something that I would like to replicate, as I would like to replicate his longevity. I also wish to acknowledge the contribution of Frank Walker, who held the seat from 1990 to 1996 and also had a long and productive career in the New South Wales parliament. I pay tribute to Jim Lloyd, my opponent in the last election, who represented his constituents with genuine concern and ran a strong and vigorous campaign. I wish him and his wife, Kerry, well in retirement and hope they have the opportunity to enjoy the Hawkesbury River that I know they love so well. I wish to particularly thank the large number of volunteers, both within the Labor Party and outside, who helped me with the enormous task of changing the minds of some 5,000 people. Many thought it could not be achieved, and I would have to say that there were moments when I wondered. I would like to thank my campaign director, Donna Judd, who kept the whole show on the road and sacrificed an enormous amount of time. And of course I have to thank her forever tolerant husband, Graeme, who shared a lot of the burden in terms of time. It is impossible, as many have said, to name all the volunteers and those who helped, but there are some that I must. I would have to say, in naming them, that there are many names that I will spare you, as it would take almost my entire time to do that. I thank Harish Velji, Tom Hollywood, Cathy and Roland Soder, Helen Myers, Paul Collimore and Paul Sullivan, Paul Lister, John Gifford, Chris Calbert, Nick Jacomas, Dave Humphries, Bill Stewart, Jack Woodward, Emma Furness, Kerry Stratford, Mary and Anthony Gooley, Paul Wilson, Andrew Clark, Alison Nolan, Bill Cong, the Sidiropoulos family and Jane Stafford. They really are just a few of the many people who helped. I acknowledge with enthusiasm the assistance of the Your Rights at Work team, led by Mary Yaager and John Robertson from Unions New South Wales. I also have pleasure in thanking the many unions that assisted my campaign: the Transport Workers Union, particularly Bruce Penton and Tony Sheldon; the Australian Workers Union; the NUW; the ETU, particularly Jim Macfadyen, who is also Gosford City Council Mayor; the USU; the Health Services Union-a member of which has joined us in my northern neighbouring seat of Dobell; the SDA; the FSU; the RBTU; the AMWU; the Nurses Federation; and the CFMEU all helped and all contributed to the ultimate result. I would like to thank the New South Wales branch of the ALP, of which I have been a member for 27 years. My particular thanks go to Sam Dastyari. I would also like to thank many of my colleagues for their assistance, in particular Senators Steve Hutchins, Michael Forshaw and Ursula Stephens, who gave me advice and assistance and, of course, have been my very long-term friends. Many of the other members of this House have also been colleagues and friends for a great many years. I would also like to thank New South Wales minister Tony Kelly and his wife Anne. I immensely enjoyed working with Tony, and already I am missing the rest of the Kelly gang-who worked there also-a great deal. It is traditional for new members to reflect on their background and to put forth their personal philosophy and the issues on which they will focus in their future years in parliament. I apologise in advance if I am somewhat indulgent, as the opportunity to make such a personal presentation, uninterrupted, does not occur very often. My maternal grandfather, Oliver Hoskin, was born just before the turn of the century. He left, as a 19-year-old telephone mechanic, to fight in Gallipoli, Palestine and Fromelles with many of his generation. He returned home and survived long enough to marry, live through the Great Depression and produce four children before expiring from the effects of mustard gas suffered during the Great War. My grandmother, Georgina Smith, had an iron will and a tendency to be frugal. She supported her children as a nurse and ensured that all her children were well educatedthree at university and my mother at teachers college. This high regard for education, and the value of sacrificing to achieve it, tainly a core principle of my own. I imagine that my paternal grandfather, Fred Neal, met his wife, my grandmother Grace, an upstairs maid-it is very difficult to imagine that such a short time ago upstairs maids were quite common-while making deliveries as a grocer's assistant in the Darling Downs of Queensland. He remained a grocer's assistant all his life. He was a simple and kind man who believed that caring for your family and carrying out your obligations to your community were the only things that really mattered. They lived all their lives in Australia Street, Allora, a town of some 300 people. In fact, by an interesting coincidence, it is the same street where the grandparents of the member for Solomon lived. I do not know what it indicates, but I think it indicates something. My grandmother still lives in Allora at the age of 93. My grandfather believed that all men should learn to cook, as he said this skill saved his life when, being one of the few men who could, he performed this vital role during the Second World War. My parents, both teachers, met and married in Dalby, Queensland. My father completed a commerce degree while teaching and raising three young children with my mother. During the early 1960s, a policy of recruiting from regional Australia was introduced in the federal Public Service, and the Australian diplomatic service was opened up to those outside Sydney and Melbourne. This led to my father's selection to join the Department of Overseas Trade. We moved to Canberra and then commenced a period of travel to a range of places in Europe and Asia. I once calculated that I moved house 13 times before entering high school. Some people on the other side have indicated that this was a matter of some stress for them, but I would have to say that nothing could be further from the truth for is cerme. Every move was an adventure which I learned a great deal from. I learned about the advantages of Australia's climate, stable democracy, rule of law and a government administration generally free of corruptiondespite what the media might say. I learned about the depth of poverty and the impact of lack of access to education and health services on many people in other parts of the world. Most of all, it taught me that change and new ideas are a positive thing and they should be welcomed. I would like to thank my parents for their care and the opportunities they gave me. My father taught me, by example, that hard work is an essential element of all success and the ‘in' crowd is not always right. My mother taught me to stand up and be counted. I would also like to thank my twin brother, Chris, and my sister, Catherine, for keeping me down to earth and laughing with me. Sometimes you need that bit of help. I acknowledge my Botticelli cupids, Alexander and Julian, who are in the gallery today. I am sorry for embarrassing them. They have grown up to be extraordinary young men, and I am extremely proud of them. I also thank in particular my husband, to whom I said on the last occasion and I still hold this to be true: as far as I am concerned, he is always on the side of the angels. My life has certainly been a kaleidoscope. I consider myself blessed to have had such wide-ranging experiences that allow me to balance and reflect on both the harmonies of our Australian community and the sometimes conflicting views and ideals. I was born in 1963, which makes me, I understand, both a baby boomer and generation X. I have been both employer and employee. I have worked as a union officer for the Federated Iron workers Association of Australia, where I learned about the need for collective bargaining and the unfairness visited on workers by some unscrupulous employers. I have had the opportunity to meet both Laurie Short and Harry Hurrell, both legends of the labour movement. I have also had a career as a lawyer-which, as has been suggested, is a much-maligned profession. Contrary to the views of many of those on the opposition side, they are not the only ones to sample the highs and lows of small business. I have established two businesses and have mortgaged my home, worked very long hours and received little reward for the first few months of operation. The life is manding-but of course there are rewardsbut that should never be an excuse to exploit your employees. I have lived most of my life that in an urban environment but I attended high school in Orange in the central west of New South Wales. There I learned many skills that I am sure will be useful for my political life. I learned to ride a horse, drove cattle, drench sheep, pick apples, milk cows-both by hand and machine-and, from my grandmother, how to kill a chicken using only my hands. The accumulated knowledge of these experiences has led me to believe that all that is required for evil to triumph is for good men-or, in this case, women-to do nothing. I hope it will be said at the end of my time here in parliament that I did not stand back and let an injustice occur. At the core of everything we do here should be the objectives of social justice, social cohesion and equality of opportunity. Reform is why we are here. During my initial time here I will pursue a number of priorities. My first, of course, is the repeal of the Work Choices legislation and the abolition of AWAs and the unfairness that flowed from them. This has already commenced, with the introduction of the bill to put this into effect. I have to say that I am thrilled and I am sure my constituents back in Robertson feel the same way. Another of my priorities is infrastructure. I believe that Australia is at a crisis point with a lack of infrastructure, which is strangling our economic growth and limiting the potential of our population. This is due to a failure to invest in the last decade due to a shortterm view and myopic outlook that the market will provide. This crisis is nowhere more evident than on the Central Coast, where a fast-growing population has outstripped our infrastructure and threatened our environment. I have ambitions for the Central Coast and I believe these are shared by the people who reside de- there. To bring these to fruition we need to invest in our infrastructure, both built and social. I am pleased to see the Infrastructure Australia bill is being given priority. This will help promote this much-needed investment in infrastructure. I am particularly concerned to see that our broadband infrastructure is brought up to a level comparable with the rest of the developed world and that the regions, like Robertson, have the same access to digital information as the capital cities have. I am also enthusiastic about being part of the Rudd Labor government's education revolution and to see the way we educate our young people brought into the 21st century. I am concerned about two aspects in particular. If our children, before they enter school and in the first three years of school, do not develop the basic skills upon which to build the rest of their education, they can carry this deficit for the rest of their lives, being denied the quality of life they deserve and denying the community the quality of contribution they could provide. Labor is committed to providing 15 hours of preschool education to all children before they start school. This will go a long way towards dealing with this problem. I would also like to ensure, when children's skills are underdeveloped in the first few years of their education, that the underlying causes are identified and remedial action is taken. It is not enough to say that we will look to see whether they have those skills; we have to invest the funds to actually remedy the situation. I am also particularly concerned with the skills development of those aged between 15 and 25 years. Many in this age group fall between the gaps in their transition from school to work. Those who do not complete school or some other tertiary training are twice as likely as the rest of the population to become unemployed in later life. This is a waste of talent that the nation cannot afford. Any civilized society certainly has a duty to train and educate their young people in the transition from dependence to independence. Surely it is also our ability as a community to provide education and training for our young that is a real test of a civilized society. It is certainly an imperative in terms of our economic policies of maintaining growth and containing inflation. A competitive economy requires a skilled workforce. It is my objective to create a guarantee that every young person may continue in formal education, training or employment when leaving school. We cannot continue to waste our young talent. Finally, I am particularly concerned about the environmental impact on our coastlines, the pressure of development and the need to manage and protect these fragile ecosystems so that we do not lose the beauty that we so much enjoy. These are my first priorities but there are a number of matters that also fill me with passion. I believe that housing is the fundamental core of a decent life. The failure to ensure access for many people to a home and the increasing number of homeless are a blight on our humanity. I believe that we should assist families to raise and educate their children, particularly at the time that they are born. I believe that Australia should not compete in the world by engaging in a race to the bottom by lowering wages but that we should compete by creating a smarter and more skilled workforce. I believe that our elderly should enjoy a secure and stimulating retirement and should have access to a nursing home when they require it. I believe we have a responsibility to engage in the reduction of poverty worldwide, and I embrace our commitment to increasing foreign aid to 0.5 per cent of GDP. I believe that because it is what is required of a humane society and also because I am convinced that deprivation leads to war, suffering and death. I believe Australia should focus more on our island neighbours in the Pacific region and provide greater assistance in developing democratic governments and the rule of law in that region. I believe that Australia can do better. That is why I am here.",130
158,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,Unknown,"I congratulate the member for Robertson on her fine first speech in this House and I wish her a long, productive and rewarding time here. There are a number of members who are chicken killers and I will pass their names on to her on another occasion! I want to express my gratitude to the people of the Wills electorate for giving me the honour of representing them in the 42nd Parliament. I had a tough year last year after my resignation as shadow Attorney-General and I want to thank my family, friends and supporters for the way they rallied around me and helped me both personally and in mounting a first-class campaign for my re-election. I will mention just two. First is my brother, Lex, who is referred to by my staff as Superman. He is in charge of the corflute signs, and all I can say is that I am glad he is on side. Second is Noel Crawley, a tireless and cheerful campaign worker who was recently injured in a car accident. We all wish Noel a full recovery. I thank the people of Wills who came out to support me so strongly that the electorate of Wills moved from being a 67 per cent two-party preferred Labor seat to now being a 72.5 per cent two-party preferred Labor seat. In other words, not only did everyone who voted for me in 2004 stick with me, but one in six people of those who had voted Liberal in 2004 came across to vote for me on this occasion. It means a lot to me that they returned me with a much increased majority. Wills is now the fourth strongest Labor seat in the country. This is an emphatic vote of confidence and I have no intention of wasting it. I intend to do everything I can to lift and build the community in which I live and to make Wills a better place for all of us who live there. I also intend to pursue a vigorous agenda for change in this nation. There is great hope and optimism in the air. There is excitement and enthusiasm. This is a wonderful time to be in the parliament. There are both big opportunities and big challenges. People have high expectations of us as a new Labor government, and so they should. People should always have high expectations of their representatives. One of the things I most want to see in Australia is an active, well-informed, engaged citizenry making demands of their governments. In this regard, I want to single out for praise and commend to the parliament the work of GetUp!, who have sent us a people's agenda for the new parliament. I have long regretted the decline of public meetings, the declining membership of political parties, the declining membership of progress associations and the general decline my in vehicles for civic engagement. It seems to me that the rise of TVs, DVDs and the internet has turned most of us into passive consumers, sitting in front of a screen and waiting to be entertained rather than getting out there and making things happen. Our political culture has suffered. It has become top down rather than bottom up, leadership obsessed, driven by large campaign donations, lobbyists and focus groups, with a conspicuous lack of dialogue and a lack of serious, genuine discussion and discourse about the direction Australia and the world need to take. Into this quite serious hole in our democratic jacket has stepped GetUp! It is a national, independent political movement of almost 250,000 Australians. It uses the latest online and offline technologies to break down the barriers between the governed and the governing, and its vision is of a progressive Australia, one with social justice, economic fairness and the environment at its core. In December, thousands of Australians met simultaneously in 327 ‘Vision GetTogethers'-strangers who share simply a postcode and a concern for their country, meeting in almost every electorate in the nation to decide their priorities for the recently parliament. In January, the results of their work were compiled and voted on by a staggering 32,500 Australians from every state and territory, Australians of all ages and political persuasions. Three issues stood out as the most important priorities for this parliament. The first is ‘becoming environmentally sustainable' and combating climate change. Given my background as someone who became interested in politics as a result of my interest in environmental issues, I think that this is not surprising; it is very significant that this has stood out as the most important priority. The second is ‘making high-quality primary, secondary and tertiary public education accessible to all Australians', and the third is ‘respecting the rights and improving the living standards of Indigenous Australians'. I will say a little more about these in turn. The first issue is about becoming environmentally sustainable and combating climate change. The Australians who participate in GetUp! want meaningful action to combat climate change and sustainably manage our water, forests and marine habitats. GetUp! are overwhelmingly and urgently concerned about climate change over any other issue facing the nation. They want strong and binding emissions reduction targets by 2020, federal funding for research into renewable and alternative energy, and a robust carbon tax or trading scheme that does not favour large polluters. They are happy to pay more for energy needs to meet this end, although they point to the need for measures to ensure this is equitable. They want Australia to be a world leader in this sphereleadership that will create the culture change necessary domestically and set the example internationally to avert a climate disaster. They strongly call on the government not just to legislate and fund but to proactively lead the way in creating a culture of sustainelected ability. They finish with a quote: We have seven years to cap our CO2 emissions. It is an emergency. All hands on deck. That is exactly right. Global warming is a planetary emergency. It requires all hands on deck and that no stone be left unturned. NA",135
159,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! It being 8.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Paradise Point Bowls Club",136
160,Mr ROBERT,Unknown,"I have spoken before in this House about the great electorate of Fadden being the fastestgrowing electorate in the nation. Indeed, community groups, volunteer organisations and sporting groups are the backbone of Fadden. They provide the social fabric and the opportunity for families and individuals to get together, which are so important in the local area. I am delighted to have recently been asked to be patron of the Paradise Point Bowls Club, which has serviced its local area since 1974 and has over 800 playing members. It is one of those great community organisations that work tirelessly to bring the community together. At a time when community can be seen to be coming apart at the seams, organisations like the Paradise Point Bowls Club are out there bridging the gap and working to bring the community together, with a great focus on social interaction as well as on competition within their chosen sport. Since 1974 the Paradise Point Bowls Club have raised substantial amounts of money for both CareFlight and the Salvation Army. They endeavour to have older players teach senior students from Coombabah State High School how to bowl. This not only increases the students' knowledge of a great sport at which we do very well in the Olympics-and I am looking forward to Beijing in six months-but, more importantly, connects the more established citizens of Paradise Point to the new generation in Coombabah. The Paradise Point Bowls Club also have regular social bowling competitions where members of the community can get together, especially more senior members. I contend that it is these kinds of organisadetails,' tions that make an area enjoyable to live in, by providing a social outlet for people of the community to gather. I also raise the point that the previous Howard government so recognised the importance of these organisations that it established the volunteer small equipment grant to help support these organisations and their great work. In my electorate of Fadden this scheme has helped support many organisations ranging from the Paradise Point Scout Group to the Labrador and Pacific Pines Junior Australian Football Club. I note that the Labor Party during the election campaign promised to maintain the program, albeit with some changes. However, local sporting and community organisations like the Paradise Point Bowls Club are yet to see any evidence of this changed program. Before coming in here this evening, I took the liberty of looking at the GrantsLINK website, which is meant to be the public's best source for finding out about all funding and grant assistance from all levels of government. Looking at the federal funding assistance, I did a search for volunteer grants. You can imagine my surprise when the site directed me to a website dealing with the funding of the last round whilst Mal Brough was the minister. This afternoon my staff called the hotline. The hotline is advertised by the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. If you call, you will be told that something is coming. They do not know when and they cannot tell you the details. For the likes of the Paradise Point Bowls Club and many other organisations in Fadden-which I remind the House is the fastest-growing electorate in the nation-to go to the GrantsLINK website and receive information from the previous government, to call the hotline and be told, ‘Something is coming; we do not know when and we cannot tell you the is frankly not good enough. Volunteer organisations form the backbone of this nation and the backbone of the electorate of Fadden. If they are to continue to do the good work that we need them to do in this nation, they need our support and they need the government's support. Far be it from me to suggest that the government is not listening because the GrantsLINK website sends them into the abyss and the hotline number tells them, ‘Nothing is available; we are still waiting.' But may I encourage the Rudd government to move expeditiously to put new funding opportunities in place so that worthy organisations can apply and these community organisations can continue to do great work. I salute them all, especially the Paradise Point Bowls Club, for their work in the electorate of Fadden. National Primary Industry Centre for Science Education",136
161,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,Unknown,"In September 2006 DEST funded a scoping study entitled A strategy to attract young people into careers in primary industry through tertiary science. It was built on a model funded by the Grains Research and Development Corporation and has been in operation in Tasmania through the University of Tasmania since 1998 and in Western Australia since 2003. The model has been piloted in the Riverland and in Adelaide since 2006 and supported by Riverland Horticultural Council Inc, Flinders University, the University of Tasmania and Horticulture Australia Ltd. This model, which has been dubbed ‘the Russell model', was delivered by the National Primary Industry Centre for Science Education or PICSE for short. This will provide a pathway to attract young people into science through university and then into science careers in primary industry. This will create future leaders and innovators, will real value and will provide an essential science skills and knowledge base to rural and regional Australia, as well as maintain Australia's international competitiveness. This model, the Russell model, was initiated in the electorate of Braddon in 1998, when I had the great privilege of first being elected to this House. Tomorrow I will be meeting with its innovative initiator, Dr Russell, and some of his fellow collaborators to try and advance this very exciting project, which will assist in developing our primary industries. As you would be well aware, Mr Speaker, with your great interest in science and the environment, student enrolments in science at both secondary and tertiary level are declining, unfortunately, at the same time that industry demand for science professionals is increasing. These facts are responsible for a growing shortfall in science professionals to meet industry, research and postgraduate demand. Given the time lag of at least five years between year 12 and students exiting university, it is imperative that the PICSE program commence in 2008 in order to have an impact on the serious skills shortages in 2012, when DEST anticipates a 35 per cent shortfall of science graduates. I was very pleased today by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government mentioning his Skills in Australia legislation, which Labor proffered in the election and will bring forward soon in legislation. I think this fits absolutely magnificently into that and also into our education revolution legislation and policies, so well advanced by the Deputy Prime Minister. PICSE will provide a successful and proven strategy for universities, primary industries, research and development corporations, state government departments, DAFF, DOTARS and DEST to work collaboratively add to support a national solution through the delivery of a tested model that integrates science class activities, teachers' professional development, production of teaching resources, student camps and a student industry placement program with local science based industries. An investment of $2.48 million is required to establish PICSE in 2008. It is proposed that this will be shared by six activity centres, with local universities and local industries providing $100,000 to $150,000 each to a total of $0.92 million, with an investment from national industry partners of $0.30 million and federal government assistance of $1.25 million. By 2012 this level of investment will lift to $1.84 million from 14 activity centres, with $1.26 million from national industry partners and $1.26 million from the federal government, totalling $4.35 million annually to develop science in our primary industries which are so badly needed both now and into the future. I heartily commend this program, begun in Braddon in 1998, both to this government and to all members in this House because I know that it will certainly aid their regional communities and primary industry in particular. (Time expired) Cowan Electorate: Blackmore Primary School",137
162,Mr SIMPKINS,Unknown,"I rise to speak about a travesty of good education in my electorate of Cowan. Specifically, I would today like to talk about the Blackmore Primary School, in the suburb of Girrawheen. Blackmore is one of four primary schools in Girrawheen. It is the third biggest in student numbers, with over 200 students. It also has more classrooms and a very sound academic record-award winning, in some cases. In August 2007 the school community, a proud and effective community, were informed that following consultation their school was to be closed, the land sold and students integrated into another primary school in Girrawheen, the Girrawheen Primary School. As with any school community with spirit, there was always going to be resistance to the closure. The trouble with this whole situation was that there was no actual consultation with the parent community of Blackmore. Parents were not brought into the discussions, and the announcement of the closure came as a surprise to both the parents and the teachers of not only Blackmore but all the local schools. In putting this sorry situation into context it is worthy of mentioning why the parents and teachers at Blackmore and the teachers at other local schools were so greatly surprised. That was because everyone believed that phase 1 of this plan of rationalisation with Girrawheen was merely going to involve the closure of Hainsworth Primary School and the integration of the Hainsworth and Montrose primary schools onto the Montrose site, although under a new name. So it was the case that Blackmore Primary School was not intended to be part of phase 1. If phase 1 had been implemented in the original plan, the plan that most people in Girrawheen seemed to know about, it would have left three primary schools-one in the east, Montrose; one in the centre, Girrawheen; and one in the west, Blackmore. However, the announcement by the state Labor government of the closure of Hainsworth and Blackmore came as an unwelcome surprise. There followed a quickly convened meeting of parents with education department representatives and the state Labor MP for the area. This meeting quickly revealed that all the good points for keeping Blackmore had never been considered. Within two weeks over 900 parents and other supporters of Blackmore Primary School signed a petition supporting the school's retention. However, that fell on deaf ears and the reasoned case we put forward for retaining the school was rejected. Another question was also asked by the P&C about the necessity for consultation to occur. But what they were told was, ‘The school's going to be closed now, but we'll conduct some consultation right now'-even though the decision was made. Unfortunately, there was yet another tragic episode in this betrayal of the good people of Girrawheen. A P&C representative went to the state parliament to plead the case directly with the minister. However, before the minister appeared, the state Labor MP for Girrawheen accused the P&C of disloyalty by their asking for my support, as a Liberal. I understand that the state MP was aghast that the people of Girrawheen did not just roll over, because it was a Labor decision, affecting people in a suburb that traditionally supported Labor. That was the main issue. On 13 September 2007 I worked with parents to hold a public meeting to further highlight the error of the decision. At that meeting the people's views were heard and they loudly booed the state MP. Later the minister even accused me, under privilege in the state assembly, of using children for political purposes by giving them signs saying, ‘Save Blackmore Primary'. That was not actually the case; that was all done by the parents. They were fighting for a cause, and they refused to be bullied into just accepting it. The current situation is that the state Labor government is committed to closing the school and selling the land for upwards of $17 million. The closure will take away the only school in the west of Girrawheen. It will require children to walk as far as 1,500 metres to the nearest school. As a parent of children who attend a small local state primary school-it is quite similar to Blackmore-I know how it would feel if the state government tried to close my school. This is why I am actively opposing this decision. Blackmore is not just a place on a map that is worth $17.7 million; it is a future for our children-our greatest asset. This is about making sure that a school is retained in the west of Girrawheen and that it is given the resources it requires. It is an important ity for the area- (Time expired) Shortland Electorate: Homelessness",138
163,Ms HALL,Unknown," Mr Speaker, as this is the first time. I have spoken since you have been in the chair, may I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election to the position of Speaker. Last year, the Prime Minister requested that all government MPs visit a homeless people's refuge. I embraced this suggestion. I had not visited the refuges in my electorate in a year, and I thought it was about time. I went along. In the Shortland electorate, there are two refuges: a youth refuge and a women's refuge. The Eastlakes women's and children's refuge is an organisation that I have had a long association with. When I visited them, they said that they were really encouraged to hear that the Prime Minister had asked MPs to visit a homelessness service in their electorate. They went on to describe how their service supports women and children who are escaping domestic violence by providing them with accommodation. They also highlighted the fact that domestic violence is the most common reason for women and children to access their services. Some of the services provided by the Eastlakes refuge include case management, advocacy, referrals to other agencies, court support and medium-term support accommodation, for which demand is particularly high. The refuge has four bedrooms, and each one can accommodate a mother with up to four children. During the last year, the refuge had accepted 34 mothers and 62 children; however-and this is the really sad part-they had to turn away 317 mothers and 697 children because they did not have the rooms and beds for them. These women and children are very vulnerable and have no other option. Over the last couple of years, I have seen amena very strong increase in the number of homeless people within the electorate. People are sleeping in cars. There is a very low availability of rental accommodation. The ticker system that exists in New South Wales makes it very difficult for a person to find accommodation if they have ever made a mistake in the past. There are an enormous number of people who are homeless. If you do not have a rental record, that also makes it very difficult for you to find a place to rent. The other refuge I visited, the Allambi that Youth Service, has been operating in the Shortland electorate since January 1981. It is a crisis youth refuge and provides short-term accommodation for up to eight young people-four males and four females. There are two bedrooms within this refuge. The staff there are absolutely dedicated to their job, but demand for accommodation and their services is enormous, and the conditions that they have to work under are less than optimal. They provide an outstanding service and also have a vision for the future: they would like to start a service for younger people between the ages of 12 and 14. Currently these children have to go into the refuge with older children, and this creates some difficulty within the service. I emphasise to the House that there is a real need for services such as those provided by the Allambi and the Eastlakes refuges. Both services have welcomed the release of the paper entitled Homelessness: a new approach. They are very keen to be involved in the process that will see a green paper tabled in May and a white paper tabled in August this year. Staff who work in these services feel that they are being given a real opportunity to have a say on homelessness and the direction that accommodation services should go in the future. Homelessness is an enormous problem in Australia today. It is an enormous problem in my electorate. Young people and women and children-those who are most disadvantaged-are being badly affected. (Time expired) Local Grants Scheme",140
164,Mrs MARKUS,Unknown,"I rise this evening to raise my concerns about the Australian government's failure to renew funding for the Local Grants Scheme as part of the previous coalition government's Working Together to Manage Emergencies program. The Local Grants Scheme provided communities such as mine access to funds so that emergency service centres could be upgraded or purchase additional equipment. Following a search of the Attorney-General's website today, I found the following statement: The Local Grants Scheme will not be offered. This statement concerns me greatly. I find it ironic that the Australian government is offering funding to assist local emergency services with volunteer recruitment and training, while neglecting to fund basic equipment that is necessary to get the job done in the first place. This will impact on the ity of volunteers to serve local communities effectively. The Hawkesbury Rural Fire Service Operational Centre in my electorate has a phone system which urgently requires upgrading. This phone system is the link between volunteers and residents in the community, especially when homes and lives are at risk during a fire. The Attorney-General said: The Rudd government recognises that emergency volunteers give so freely of their time to protect the lives and property of others. What I am saying is that denying these volunteers access to funds to purchase essential equipment is not recognising their value. Basic equipment which was previously funded under the coalition government included equipment for the upgrade of the SES Emergency Operations Centre in the Hawkesbury, emergency generators for Cootamundra Shire Council and upgrading of communication equipment for Shoalhaven's main and alternate emergency operation centres. All this was funded through the Local Grants Scheme. The current eligibility guidelines under the National Emergency Volunteer Support Fund for such items state that ‘operational equipment will generally not be considered unless it can be demonstrated to have a training use'. While training is critical to all emergency services, organisations and volunteers particularly to maintain occupational health and safety requirements, equipment to do the job and training on such equipment cannot be undertaken without the purchase of such equipment. I call on the Rudd government to provide rural fire services and the SES in electorates such as mine and in other parts of our country with funding for much-needed equipment, just as the previous coalition government did. In my electorate alone, where the capacNew South Wales government is primarily responsible for the emergency services, Labor have failed to provide these emergency services with basic equipment to help them fight fires, to keep volunteers and the people and communities they seek to protect safe. In the Hawkesbury we have the RAFT-the remote area fire team. The job of the RAFT volunteers is to be dropped, often by helicopter, into remote locations and to fight fires in the early stages at their source where on-the ground units cannot reach. It is unacceptable that the members of this unit, which assisted with the Canberra fires, do not have the following as part of their basic firefighting kits: battery packs to ensure power radios remain powered in remote areas-they need 20; a 2,000-watt converter generator to recharge radios-they need one; backpack blowers to clear firebreaks and helipads-they need two; professional chainsaws to clear firebreaks and helipads-again, they need two; and lightweight sleeping bags so that when they sleep out overnight in the bush they have something to sleep in. That is basic. Most importantly, they need eight emergency distress beacons, which are essential in an area with no radio coverage. All this totals just $23,000. I have many emergency services in my electorate, including Ebenezer RFS and Oakville RFS, to name just two. The group fire captains and the fire control centre of Hawkesbury Rural Fire Service desperately need equipment. I call on the Rudd Labor government to provide Australian government funding to rural fire services and state emergency services in my state and others, because the state Labor governments have failed to provide these much-needed pieces of equipment so that these volunteers can do their job. With the apparent alteration to guidelines for local grants, an avenue for federal funds is now cut off. Ballarat Electorate: Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial",141
165,Ms KING,Unknown,"I am pleased to stand here this evening to welcome the honouring of a very important promise by the Rudd government to my electorate and to the ex-prisoner of war community across Australia. At the fourth anniversary of the commemoration of the Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial in Ballarat, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs honoured Labor's long standing commitment that the memorial be recognised as a national memorial. In outlining the legislative process by which this is to be done, the minister also announced $160,000 to the City of Ballarat over four years for the memorial's upkeep. My electorate, and particularly the veteran community, were extremely pleased at the announcement. The funding will ensure that this memorial can be preserved into the future. But, more importantly, the minister's announcement that later this year he will be introducing legislation that sets out the process by which national memorials outside of Canberra will be recognised, and that the memorial in Ballarat will be the first memorial to be recognised under that legislation once passed, honours our commitment to the ex-POW community. The memorial, whilst in Ballarat, pays tribute to over 35,000 Australian ex-POWs, the 8,000 of whom died overseas while in captivity. The rest of these brave men and women came home bearing the scars of their tragic and traumatic experiences. The names on this memorial provide a tribute to those who were held in captivity during the Boer War, the two World Wars and the Korean War. It is important that the relatives of those who suffered during their imprisonment, or of those who died during their imprisonment, have somewhere to go to pay their respects. It is important that those who have not been touched personally by these traumas also have somewhere to go where they can not only pay their respects but also learn about these 35,000 Australians. The people of the Ballarat electorate, being strongly supported by people from all over Australia, have long held the view that this memorial in Ballarat is nationally significant. We have never sought to take away from the Changi Chapel here in Canberra as the national memorial for ex-POWs. But for many Australian ex-POWs it has not represented all wars and people from across all conflicts. We witness that on any weekend in Ballarat when you can see the masses of poppies along the wall against those 35,000 names-poppies put there by friends and relatives who have travelled from all over Australia to pay respect to their loved ones. Anyone who visits this memorial cannot help but be moved by the significance of itcannot help but be moved by the national significance of it. It has taken two years and a change of government, but we now have the commitment and the will to make the Ex-POW Memorial in Ballarat one of national significance. This process has begun, and I look forward to speaking on the bill when it is introduced to this place later this year. This has been the culmination of endless hours of work and lobbying from a combined group of people, particularly the tireless efforts of the veteran community not only from Ballarat but from all across Australia. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Peter Blizzard OAM, who developed the concept and the design, and who received his OAM largely for his work on the memorial. Les Kennedy OAM and David Baird OAM, a former POW, have tirelessly campaigned on this issue. The ex-POW community from Victoria and across Australia, many of whom were there on the day of the fourth anniversary to hear the minister's announcement, have supported this move. It is an incredibly moving monument with the names of all the known Australian prisoners of war. These names are listed in historical order from the Boer War in 1899 through to the Korean War in 1953. At the end of the granite wall where the pathway ends, visitors face a large stone engraved simply ‘Lest We Forget'. I would like to finish by honouring those who died and those who survived as prisoners of war. In the Boer War there were approximately 200 POWs, four of whom died. In the First World War there were more than 4,000 POWs, with more than 300 who died. In the Second World War there were more than 30,000 POWs, with more than 8,000 who died. In the Korean War there were 29 prisoners of war, with one death. Those deaths are nationally significant. Those 35,000 survivors are nationally significant. And the monument to those 35,000 people, their families and their stories is nationally significant. I am very proud to be part of a government that will formally recognise the memorial in Ballarat dedicated to all men and women who were POWs across all wars as a national memorial.",142
166,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! It being 9 pm, the debate is interrupted. House adjourned at 9.00 pm NA The following notices were given: Ms Hall to move That the House: (1) recognises that epilepsy is the most common serious brain disorder and is the most universal of all medical disorders; (2) acknowledges that 2000,000 people live with epilepsy at any one time in Australia and that up to three times as many Australians will have epilepsy at some time in their lives; (3) that people living with epilepsy are disadvantaged by lack of research into the disorder and by the lack of a national plan for epilepsy or deeming it a disorder that is a national priority; (4) acknowledges the impact that epilepsy has on the lives of people living with it; (5) calls on the Australian Government to fund greater research into epilepsy; and (6) calls on the Australian Government to establish a nationwide educational strategy on epilepsy modelled on the World Health Organisation's global campaign. Mr Kelvin Thomson to move That the House: (1) congratulates the Government for its action taken to date to tackle global warming; and (2) urges the Government to take action to ensure greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 60% from year 2000 levels, by 2050. Mr Hayes to move That the House: (1) affirms its recognition that a combination of special education, speech therapy, occupational therapy and behavioural interventions has proved to be successful in helping people with an autism disorder; (2) recognises early diagnosis and intervention is also essential to ensure families and carers have access to appropriate services and professional support; (3) supports the Federal Government policy to establish specialised child care and early tervention services for children with autism; and (4) calls on the Government to consider a specialised child care centre be established in South West Sydney.  That the House notes: (1) that the Workplace Relations WorkChoices Bill has had damaging impacts on the livelihoods of working families across Western Sydney; (2) that Australian Workplace Agreements are unfairly biased against young people seeking employment as it forces them to negotiate with employees without adequate representation; and (3) that the Fairness Test flooded small businesses with red tape while still not providing an adequate safety net for employees, placing unnecessary pressure on local communities across Australia.  That the House: (1) recognises: (a) that the Government has given the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) formal monitoring powers under the Trade Practices Act on unleaded petrol, across the petrol supply chain; (b) the importance of ongoing monitoring of the fuel industry with the appointment of a Petrol Commissioner within the ACCC; and (c) that the Petrol Commissioner will also be informally monitoring the price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and diesel; and (2) supports further efforts to increase transparency and competition in the fuel industry. Mr Hartsuyker to move That the House condemns the Federal Labor Government for its decision not to proceed with the planned expansions of existing Centrelink call incentres in Coffs Harbour, Launceston, and Hobart. (Notice given 18 February 2008.) Ms Livermore to move That the House: (1) acknowledges those Australians who have selflessly donated their organs, and those who have given consent to do so, so that others may have the gift of life; (2) recognises, in this Organ Donor Awareness Week, the importance of organ donation; (3) recognises that although 90% of Australians support organ donation, and while Australia has one of the most successful organ transplantation rates in the world, actual organ donation rates are amongst the lowest in the developed world; and (4) supports the Government's initiatives to improve organ donation rates. Ms Owens to move That the House notes: (1) that Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week will be held from 24 February to 2 March 2008; (2) that ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer death in women, with nearly 1,200 Australian diagnoses each year and nearly 800 Australian deaths from it each year; (3) that when ovarian cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, the outlook is very good-as many as 90% of women diagnosed early are cured. However, 75% of women are diagnosed at the advanced stage when it is very difficult to treat; (4) that it is a devastating disease that is difficult to diagnose early and treat at an advanced stage. A woman dies every 10 hours largely because of the lack of early detection tests and poor knowledge of the disease throughout the community; (5) that a recent Senate Community Affair's inquiry into gynaecological cancer in Australia (tabled 27 February 2007) identified a need for increased awareness amongst the broader community about gynaecological cancers and symptoms and better educational support for general practitioners; (6) that a survey commissioned by the National Breast Cancer Centre has revealed that half of all Australian women believe incorrectly that a pap smear will detect ovarian cancer and that 56% of women are unable to correctly name any signs or symptoms of the disease; and (7) the need for greater focus on education and additional research funding to help Australian scientists to find early detection markers and more effective treatments of this insidious disease. Mr Lindsay to move That the House: (1) supports the provision of the highest quantity health services to Australians; (2) notes the continuing advances in medical science, making available new diagnostic tools; and (3) recognises the need to extend the availability of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning to regional Australia.",143
