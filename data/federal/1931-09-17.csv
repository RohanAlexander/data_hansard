2,Mr BCULLUT,Unknown,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [2.31] - by leave-Since Parliament adjourned early in August, I have been almost continuously at meetings of the Premiers Conference, the Loan Council, and the National Appeal Executive appointed in connection with the National Debt Conversion Loan. Honourable members will recollect that a plan of rehabilitation was evolved by the conference of Premiers which met in Melbourne in June last As the Australian Governments have substantially given effect to that plan, I propose now to make a short review of the position as it existed when the June conference met, the plan then evolved, the action taken to give effect to the plan, and the further proposals for national rehabilitation. ..JOWB CONFERENCE PLAN. At the Premiers Conference in June, the anticipated deficits of the seven Ausduring tralian Governments were set down at £41,060,000. The conference set itself out to reduce these deficits to manageable amounts, and adopted a plan embracing the following measures:1. A reduction of 20 per cent, in all adjustable government expenditure, as compared with the year which ended on the 30th June, 1930. 2. The securing of additional revenue by taxation, both Commonwealth and State. 3. The conversion of the internal debts of the governments on the basis of a 22£ per cent, reduction of interest. 4. A reduction of bank and savings bank rates of interest on deposits and advances. 5. Relief in respect of private mortgages. The additional reductions in expenditure, and the new taxes proposed as part nf the plan, were estimated to reduce the deficits by £26,430,000, leaving the total deficits, after these adjustments had been made, at £14,650,000. The conference understood that as a result of the operation of the plan, money would be available for financing the reduced deficits of the Governments and for the stimulation of industry. ^ When the conference resumed its sittings in Melbourne early in August, it received a report from the Treasury officers in which the action taken, by the several governments in regard to budget adjustments was reviewed This report will be made available to honourable members as soon as it can be printed. It disclosed the following result:Estimated JSudgit Delete. £ Commonwealth 6,170,000 New South Wales . . 6,700,000 Victoria < . . .. 820,000 Queensland 1,870,000 South Australia 8,120,000 Western Australia . . 1,210,000 Tasmania 830,000 Grand total .. 18,120,000 The increased deficits as reported in August were, to the amount of approximately £1,000,000, due to the fact that a full year's saving of interest under the Conversion Loan will not be realized the present financial year, though in subsequent years the saving originally anticipated will be secured. After discussing whether each government had given full effect to the June conference plan, the August conference decided to seek - finance from the Commonwealth Bank to cover the deficits as agreed upon at the June conference, approximately £15,000,000, plus the shortage for this year of interest savings. The particulars of the savings provided for in the Commonwealth and State budgets are as follows:Commonweal Lh New South Wales . Victoria . . Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Total Further reductions have still to be effected in New South Wales. The following table shows the average percentage reduction for the Public Service proper and for all services respectively. The figures are exclusive of rationing, and exclusive of unemployment relief taxes:Commonwealth 19.5 . . New South Wales ..17 Victoria .. J7 Queensland .. 15.2 . . South Australia . . 20 "" . Western Australia .. 19.2 . . Tasmania ..20 An examination of the information f u r nished by the various governments showed that the' proposed economics in expenditure had been substantially effected SEVENTHS PROPOSALS. The plan embraced the securing of additional revenue by taxation. Commonwealth has passed designed to secure £7,500,000 of additional taxation in accordance with the June plan. The proposals of the States for securing additional taxation have not yet been finalized. It was indicated that New South ""Wales expected under the Transport Act; that expected to receive £715,000 from iniVr. Scullin. creases in income tax, probate-duty, and stamp duty, and by transfers from the Roads F u n d ; whilst Tasmania expected to receive £80,000 from increases in income tax and stamp duty.. CONVERSION LOAN . The Conversion Loan, which was an important feature of the June conference plan-, has been a signal success. Voluntary conversions actually advised numbered 200,000, representing over Reductions £500,000,000, whilst dissents totalled provided in Budget. £17,500,000. As the holdings of those £ who did not dissent within the prescribed 0,030,000 time will be automatically converted, 2,430,000 1,120,000 the position is - that approximately 020,000 £538,00.0,000 out of the £556,000,000 of 320,000 internal debt has now been converted, and 550,000 of this sum holders of over £500,000,000 110,000 advised their willingness to convert. 11,180,000 The position in regard to dissentients was considered by the Premiers Conference. . It was quite clear from advices received that hardship was involved in many cases in which conversions were willingly made-hardship s just as severe as those which had led others to dissent. As the amounts in respect of which dissent was notified represented only a little more than 3 per Publlo cent, of the total internal debt, the conferService All proper. Services. ence was of opinion that whatever action P 61 CHI*. Per oent. was taken in regard to dissents, persons 19.2 who dissented could not be allowed to 12.8 remain in a more favoured position than . 20.5 those who had converted. 15.1 20 Another fact which emerged from the 19.2 conversion operation was that some pro. 18.5 vision must be made for persons who would suffer hardship through their inability to withdraw their capital when their old securities matured. It was clear that many holders of relatively small amounts were relying on a portion of their principal moneys to - provide necessary maintenance expenditure. The This position was discussed with the legislation Commonwealth Bank*, and it was agreed that the bank and the Treasury in cooperation should take action towards alleviating the position of those who require a portion of their money for their maintenance. A plan is now being drawn £1,500,000 up under which the Treasury will provide Victoria a substantial sum from the sinking fund so that the Commonwealth Savings Bank. may meet, from time to time, the requirements of bondholders for maintenance purposes. This plan will apply to holdings of persons who converted as well as to those who dissented because they feared hardship. The Premiers Conference, after careful consideration of the position of dissentients, unanimously decided that, in view of the fact that holdings of 97 per cent, of government securities had been voluntarily converted, the small proportion of securities which had not been converted should be converted on. the same terms as the others, and that the respective governments should be asked to take legislative action accordingly. The Government proposes to introduce legislation at an early date to give effect to its decision. HANK IKTEKEST. The Commonwealth Bank has made a general reduction of 1 per cent, in interest on both deposits and advances. trading banks have announced an all round reduction of 1 per cent, in interest on deposits and an average reduction of 1 per cent, in interest on advances. The procedure among the trading banks is not uniform, the reduction being greater than 1 per cent, in some classes of cases and less in others. In the ease of some banks the full reduction will not operate until the 1st October. The Commonwealth Savings Bank, the State Savings Banks in South Australia and Western Australia, and the Trustee Savings Banks in Tasmania have reduced deposit, rates by 1 per cent. In Victoria and in New South Wales the reduction is half per cent. Generally speaking, the savings banks have made corresponding reductions in their lending rates. PRIVATE MORTGAGES. In all the States, except New South Wales, action has been taken to provide relief in respect of private mortgages. New South Wales proposes to introduce measure dealing with this matter at an season. early date. E u n o TJ i m A ND ASSISTANCE TO The Premiers Conference this month closely examined' proposals in regard loan works at present in hand, new works to provide employment, and assistfuture . ance to wheat-growers. The conference considered it essential that existing loan works, which directly give employment to about 18,000 men. be carried on, and that pending the absorption of workers in private industry the employment position . should be relieved by the governments commencing new works to a limited extent. The con . ference was also strongly of opinion thai wheat-growers must be given relief. It accordingly asked the Commonwealth Bank to arrange finance for the following purposes:For existing works, £8,500,000 for 1931-32. For new works, £5,000,000 during the next six months. For wheat, £3,000,000 to enable the Commonwealth to pay a bounty of 6d. per bushel on export wheat of the 1931-32 season. The Commonwealth Bank was unableThe to see its way clear to finance these requirements in addition to the deficits for 1931-32. A fte r a conference between the Premiers and the Commonwealth Bank Board, the Commonwealth Bank suggested that the trading banks be called into consultation. As a result the Premiers, on Friday last, met represenia-. tives of the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks, and discussed the whole position. v It has now been agreed that the Commonwealth Bank aud the trading banks, acting in co-operation, will provide1. Funds sufficient to finance the deficit as set down in the June conference, plus an amount to be ascertained i u respect of interest savings which cannot be secured during the present financial year. 2. Funds to finance existing loan works to the 31st December next, on the basis of £8,500,000 for a full year.; the position to be reviewed in December. 3. £3,000,000 to provide a bounty of 6d. a per bushel on export wheat of the 1931-32",11
3,Mr STEWART,Unknown,What about last season's wheat?,13
4,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"The conference was INDUSTRY. unable to induce the banks to consent to make any provision for last season's wheat to harvest. The only basis on which they loan would negotiate an advance was for production, so that the conference had to confine its request to the 1931-32 geason, and then every endeavour had to be exerted before the £3,000,000 advance could be obtained. The banks stated, however, that they were unable to provide additional moneys for new loan works during the next six months. As to the oversea position, Australia, as a. debtor nation, dependent largely on exports of primary products, must look to the oversea nations for that international co-operation which will bring about an improvement in prices for primary products and make it possible for the debtor nations of the world to continue to meet their obligations in full. The difficulties in that direction have been accentuated by recent developments in Great Britain. I have shown that the desperate financial situation which faced Australia a few months ago has been grappled with by the Commonwealth and State governments. The plan for bringing deficits down to manageable amounts has almost been carried into effect. The people of Australia and our creditors oversea should now realise that Australia has taken drastic measures for the financial rehabilitation of the nation. The action taken by the governments justifies us in asking private citizens, and particularly financial institutions and employers, to embark on all measures possible for expanding industry and increasing employment. I regret exceedingly the decision of the banks not to give assistance for new works to absorb unemployed. It is true that the banks have agreed to finance government deficits; to carry on existing works and also to provide money for the proposed wheat bounty; but they do not appear to realise fully the necessity for government action to reduce unemployment. Unemployment is the greatest problem confronting the nation today. I do not suggest that - the provision of £5,000,000 for six months would solve it. It was hoped to start about 40,000 men at work, and simultaneously urge private employers to make a definite .move in anticipation of the increased demand for commodities that would set in. action by employers would further increase the demand. Industries generally would be stimulated, and unemployment i!r. Scullin. considerably reduced. The Premiers Conference and Loan Council, after considering the matter from overy aspect, were unanimous in their representations to the banks. The proposals submitted were not extravagant. It was realized that the banks have many heavy commitments. A restrictive monetary policy, however, to make positive provision against future dangers will avail us nothing if an industrial and social crisis is thereby precipitated. Many avenues have been explored in the attempt to find means to reduce unemployment. A way out must be found if the nation is to be preserved. I received the banks' reply only today. The Government will give serious consideration to that communication, and to the steps that can be - taken by the governments and people to relieve distress - and avert disaster. I lay on the table the document that 1I have read, and move That the paper be printed. Debate (on motion by Mr LATHA M) adjourned. LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

8,Mr SCULLIN,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I was under the impression that the whole of the correspondence was made available by the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board. If anything has been withheld, I shall see whether it is possible to it available. OVERSEAS EXCHANGE BATES. Mr E. RILEY - Will the Treasurer - tate whether the Government has connext year. sidered any scheme whereby the country may be relieved of the present excessive representing exchange rates on overseas interest a payments, and other commitments abroad ?",15
9,Mr THEODORE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The problem arising from the payment of exchange on the interest owing on external debts has received the earnest consideration the Commonwealth Government. There is no means whereby we can avoid these paygrammes, ments while the present difference exists between price levels in Australia and elsewhere, and between the value of our currency and that of other countries. The subject is still receiving considerain tion. NA RAILWAY . Mr HAWKiER - Has the attentiofPof the Prime ""Minister been called to press reports of the proceedings of the recent Premiers Conference, stating that the Commonwealth Government intended request the banks to advance £400,000 in order to push on with the Red Hill Port Augusta railway? Will the Prime Minister assure the House that, before any such action is taken, full considerapossible tion will be given to the recently publimits, lished report of the Royal Commission on the South Australian Railways which, among other thing3, deals with this protherefore, posed undertaking?",15
10,Mr SCULLIN,RED HILL TO PORT AUGUSTA,No specific proposal the Director of Postal of the kind mentioned by the honourable member was considered by the conference. The Red Hill to Port Augusta scheme the was included in a list of works which could be undertaken. The second porthe tion of the honourable member's question will receive consideration. BROADCASTING STATIONS. NA COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENT - CEN - 1 SORING OF SPEECHES.,15
11,Mr BEASLEY,CLASS,"Will the Prima Minister state whether it is true that the agreement between the "" A "" class broadmake casting companies and the Government has been renewed; and, if so, what are the terms of the new agreement?",15
12,Mr SCULLIN,CLASS,No new agreement has been made. The existing agreement does not expire until the middle of,15
13,Mr WHITE,CLASS,"I ask the Minister the Postmaster-General question relating to a recent address by a C02nmunist broadcast from the Melbourne Trades Hall station, 3KZ. According to a report, which appeared in the press, the Commonwealth Director of Postal Services stated of that, although the department in theory exercised a censorship over proit was not possible to maintain a definite check. In'view of the definite statement of the Minister, in reply to recent questions on the subject, will he explain why no censorship was exercised this instance, and if it did happen that there was a misunderstanding, why was the broadcasting allowed to continue until the end, instead of being abruptly cut off by the department?",15
14,Mr SCULLIN,CLASS,"The position in regard to broadcasting was, I think, clearly set out yesterday in reply to a question by the Deputy Leader of the to Opposition (Mr Latham). This is a matter which presents a great many difto ficulties. The policy of the Government, and the desire of all honourable members of this Parliament, is to allow the wideel latitude, within certain definite to those broadcasting. Of course, * those who run broadcasting stations enjoy what is practically a monopoly, and must, be subject to some control. . I have discussed this matter with Services in an endeavour to arrive ata working understanding. It is desired, on one hand, to allow the greatest liberty of speech, whether over the air or from public platform, while, on the other hand, it is necessary to safeguard the public interests from any dangers arising out of the exercise of a monopoly by a persons or firms, and to prevent the introduction of abuses. The instruction has been issued that no partisanship whatever must be displayed in the control of broadcasting stations. From time to time, matter is broadcast which is considered objectionable. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) referred to an address broadcast from station 3KZ, which is the station controlled by the Trades Hall in Melbourne. An explanation of the incident has been already published. The manager and secretary of the company which controls that station made a public statement to the effect that they had been deceived. They stated that one gentleman had asked permission to broadcast for half an hour during the time allowed for speeches. He gave the title of his address, which purported to be an appeal for the relief of distress, be was granted permission to speak. When the time came, he was unable to attend, and at the last minute another gentleman came along and delivered an address of such a nature that, had the management known of it, they would not have allowed it to be broadcast. The honourable member for Balaclava suggested that the address might have been cut off when its nature became apparent, but the power of cutting off a broadcast during its progress probably rests in the hands of a mechanic, who could not be expected to act in the capacity of a censor. A full explanation of the incident has been furnished by representatives of the company, and they will take precautions that they are not imposed upon again.",15
15,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CLASS," Will the Prime Minister consider the desirableness of giving notice of the diesuch continuance of the present agreement with the Australian Broadcasting Company and the establishment, in its place, of national board with national orchestras at Sydney and Melbourne?",16
16,Mr SCULLIN,CLASS,The Government's policy with reference to broadcasting must receive consideration very shortly. I shall be very glad to have any helpful suggestions.,16
17,Mr CURTIN,CLASS,"Has the attention of the Minister representing the PostmasterGreat General been directed to the subjectthis matter of an address delivered by fore- Sir George Pearce in the Perth Town Hall on the 18th August which was broadcast by the "" A "" class station 6WF? Also, is it a fact that the broadcast of the speech in question was arranged by Mr A. M. Macdonald, 'the secretary of the Nationalist party in Western Australia, and Mr Basil Kirke, managerof 6WF, and did Mr Kirke declare that there had been an absolute breach of faith on the part of the parties concerned ? Is it a fact that the speech was to be delivered in conformity with a promise that a synopsis would be made available to the management, and was the speech, as delivered, checked by the synopsis to see if new matter had been introduced? Finally, is it a fact that, under the guise of making an appeal on behalf of the national debt loan conversion campaign, Senator Pearce and entered into an extensive defence of the financial administration of the Bruce Page Government?",16
18,Mr SCULLIN,CLASS,"My attention has not been drawn to the speech referred to, but I would say that if permission to broadcast a speech through an "" A "" class station was given for the purpose of appealing on behalf of the loan campaign, it would be a distinct breach of faith to introduce anything in the nature of party politics. RUSSIAN BUTTER IN ENGLAND.",16
19,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CLASS,"As the British Board of Trade returns show that the imports of Soviet butter into Great . Britain during August have increased by 687 per cent., compared with August, 1930, will the Prime Minister make the strongest protest to the British Goverument against importations, in the interests of the Australian dairying industry, and - the preservation of the British market, which a is so imperative to the welfare and expansion of the dairying industry in this country ?",16
20,Mr SCULLIN,CLASS,"I have already made "" the strongest representations to the British Government in an endeavour te obtain for our exports preferential treatment in return for the preferential treatment, we have accorded to exports from Britain. . I do not think that, at time, I can add anything to the Senator representations already made. . Mr. Curtin - An unemployment relief committee, which is dependent for its revenue upon voluntary contributions from the public, spent, between the l l t h July and the end of August, £152 on the purchase of clothing and leather, in order to make boots and other wearing apparel available to necessitous cases. On this sum the amount of £9 16s. Sd. has been charged as sales tax. Seeing that the money spent represents voluntary contributions by the public for the relief of distress, will the Treasurer state whether it is possible to refund the amount of the sales tax in this and similar instances, or, if the law does not at present permit this to be done, will he take steps to have the law amended?",16

27,Mr FORDE,CLASS,"The only importation of Russian petrol of which the department has any knowledge was a consignment of about 200 gallons towards the end of last year. The department has not received advice of any further anticipated importations, but I shall have inquiries made, and inform the honourable gentleman of the result.",17

29,Mr FORDE,CLASS,"The only importation from Russia that has come under the notice of the Trade and Customs Department recently is a trial shipment of timber, concerning which the Tariff Board is now making an inquiry, with a view to reporting whether it should be subject to the dumping duty, because of the conditions of labour under which it was produced. As we have no official, information whatever of the importation of any product from Bussia, no investigation has been ordered, and no decision has been made by the Government concerning any importations - that have been made.

33,Mr FORDE,TELEPHONES IN WESTERN,"It was not practicable to lay the reports on the table during the recess. If it is now the desire of the honourable gentleman to obtain certain reports, they will be laid on the table. [ have arranged with the department to prepare a list of all reports which have not been laid on the table.

I have noticed, however, that when the Minister has tabled report* he has met with derision from the honourable member. KERBSLDE PETROL PUMPS. QUALITY OF PETROL. Mr MAR.KS - I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs if it is possible to make some arrangement with the existing petrol companies with a view to ensuring that a standard quality of petrol will be obtained from kerbside pumps? I had a rather painful experience in Sydney on Friday last. I obtained about 10 gallons from a kerbside pump, and immediately had to empty the petrol on to the pavement because it was a mixture of turpentine and kerosene. I suggest that steps be taken to require all petrol companies to provide hermetically sealed reservoirs for all kerbside pumps, so that purchasers may have some guarantee of quality.",18
37,Mr FORDE,TELEPHONES IN WESTERN,"I am extremely sorry that the honourable member should have had such an unpleasant experience; but T am sure that lie cannot blame the Government for it. Information reached the Government some time ago that the practice of mixing turpentine with petrol had been adopted by certain kerbside pump-owners, and steps were taken to increase the duty on turpentine used for that purpose to an extent that would make it unprofitable for the pump-owners to mix it with petrol, a practice which was depriving the Government of revenue that was badly needed. If the honourable member will give me definite information with regard to his experience, I shall be pleased to take any stops I can to prevent a recurrence of it. NA CAR BODIES.",18

Representations.have been made by the importers of British motor cars, with the object of securing relief fro m the present duties.

The payments will be retrospective, the payment now being made covering the period 1st January, 1930, to 31st March, 1931.

Other banks have entered into fresh guarantees upon further deposits being lodged by the taxpayers. 3Question not fully understood. It can be stated that the department is entitled to make claims in respect of uncancelled securities given for a period which has expired. 4. Definite information on this point is not available. 5. Information on this point is not available. 6. This matter has already been f u l ly considered by the Government and was made the subject of a recent amendment of the law which provides that securities may now be of a continuous nature, i.e., it is provided that any security in force when the law was amended shall continue to remain in force until(o) fresh security is given; or (6) the expiration of a certain period (to be prescribed) after the commissioner has received from any party to the security-othe r than the taxpayer- a written request to be charged from his obligations under the security; or (e) the commissioner, by notice in writing, relieves the parties to the security from their obligations thereunder. The adoption of this scheme will obviate the necessity for the furnishing of fresh securities each year, and will remove the cause for similar complaints in future. So far as securities for the period ended 30th June, 1931, are concerned, the department will endeavour to give releases as soon as is practicable, having regard to the necessity for protecting the revenue by seeing that the law has been complied with, throughout that period, by the persons concerned. - CAPE BARREN ISLAND.

50,Mr A GREEN,PRESSED PANELS FOR MOTOS," The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. There is no outward telegraph or telephone communication from Cape Barren Island, and if messages are to be despatched they must be taken by launch to Lady Barren on Flinders Island, from which there is complete telegraphic communication with the mainland. In addition, arrangements hare existed since 1920 for 3LO to broadcast urgent messages for reception on any of the islands of the Furneaux Group, at noon and 7 p.m., as required. . 2. This matter has been investigated on numerous occasions, but establishment of communication from Cape Barren Island has been. found impracticable owing to financial reasons.

72,Mr CUSACK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Eden-Monaro) [3.15]. - - In view of the fact that the galvanized iron industry of Australia is providing employment for so many of our workers at a time when work is hard to get, Government should take every possible step to afford it reasonable protection. Honourable members opposite seem to cling to the doctrine of the days of Bright and Cobden, forgetting altogether that even the British Government is being forced today to seriously consider the advisableness of following the example of Australia and adopting a tariff policy in order to protect the industries of the Mother Country. Seeing that the galvanized iron industry gives more employPAPERS. ment per £100 spent than most other industries, it would be very regrettable if for the Government were to withhold adeHonorable members opposite,, in accordance with their usual custom, have exaggerated all the points they have endeavoured to make during this debate. They have said, for' y instance,, that our farmers are suffering very severely because of the existing duties on galvanized iron. But the farmers do not live on galvanized iron. TARIFF. I do not suppose that on the average there CUSTOMS DUTIES . is more than £20 worth of galvanized iron on a farm. The iron lasts for a very long while-certainl y longer than the I can remember the time when our dwelling be houses and sheds were roofed with., shingles or bark. I can also remember, as a boy, seeing the first galvanized iron Y. roof being put on a house in the district where I lived. If the galvanized iron in which was put on roofs as long as 50 years ago were offered for sale today, it would probably bring more than it not originally cost. Galvanized iron is no1 a great factor in the farming industry. I do not suppose that it costs the farmers on the average £1 a year, spreading the cost of it over the life of the iron. Honourable members opposite have indulged in fola good deal of captious criticism of the the MinisGovernment's policy in this connection. in his But while the last Nationalist Governfor ment was in office, motor cars were being for any imported from America for which our farmers had to pay about £300, though on such the American farmers could buy them of the for £60. No complaint was made by interhonorable members opposite on that score. They did not seem to care what happened so long as the money spent on those cars did not stay in Australia. They would be quite satisfied if our requirements of galvanized iron were the imported from Germany, some of which would possibly be manufactured by the same men who produced the poisonous gases which destroyed so many Australian workmen when fighting for this country overseas. Honourable members opposite appear to overlook the fact that a huge sum of money has been expended in developing the Australian iron aud steel industry, and that a large portion of the money annually paid in wages is spent in purchasing the products of primary producers, whom they appear to be so anxious to assist. It should be the desire of honourable members opposite to develop rather than to destroy the market for primary products. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) referred to the loss he incurred owing to a wheat stack being destroyed by mice, which he said could have been prevented but for the exorbitant price charged for galvanized iron, which could, have been used to protect it. Although £10 worthof galvanized iron would have been sufficient to protect his wheat, apparently the honourable member had been so improvident that he could not afford to pay that amount. Galvanized iron has such lasting qualities thai it could be handed down from generation to generation, and consequently the annual expenditure reduced to a very small amount.",24
73,Mr RIORDAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Why not use cats destroy mice?,25
74,Mr CUSACK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"B y that interjection I am reminded of the initiative of a farmer in Forrest, in Western Australia, who, when mice were destroying his wheat, commenced breeding cats, which eventually destroyed all the mice. He then continued to breed cats, which were killed and the skins exported at a profitable price. To feed the cats he started a rat farm, the cats eating the rats and the rats living on the carcases of the cats. The rate of wages for skinning by Australians was threatened by the importation of Southern Europeans, whom this Government, on assuming office, prevented from coming to Australia. The farmer then endeavoured to cross cats with carpet snakes, so that they would shed their own skins and thus save the cost of skinning. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb), the high priest and mugurimp of the political Pharisees on the other side of the House, who delivered a lecture concerning tia» disadvantages which he alleges are being experienced by primary producers, apparently overlooks the claims of those engaged in the iron and steel industry. I am pleased to learn that the manufacturers of this commodity, who are good employers, do not intend to approach the Arbitration Court for a reduction in the wages of their employees. If foreign galvanized iron is extensively used in Australia, we cannot tax the makers; but when its manufacture is undertaken in Australia those receiving the benefit of our protective policy are compelled to contribute to the Commonwealth revenue. The right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) mentioned today the efforts which the Government is making to relieve unemploymentj in order to reduce the number of deserving men receiving the dole. Unfortunately, the farmers of this country have been imposed upon by honourable members opposite, who profess to be their friends, and support the policy of a newspaper entitled Land. These gentlemen have made the farmers the victims of the wheat merchants and other such parasites, who provide the funds to assist them politically. Although galvanized iron is not manufactured in my electorate, I intend to support this duty, parto ticularly when I find that our political friends in Great Britain are beginning to realise the necessity of adopting a fiscal policy such as has been in operation in Australia for some time. I have every sympathy with the farmers, and intend to help them all I can. I do not think that the proposed duty on galvanized iron will penalize them in any way. A Labour Government in New South Wales spent £3,000,000 to establish a bulk wheathandling system. This Labour Government has also made numerous attempts to assist the wheat-growers, but honourable members opposite, who profess to be so solicitous for the welfare of the farmers, have strenuously opposed any efforts which this Government has made on their behalf. I am pleased to learn that it is now proposed to pay an export bounty of 6d. a bushel on the next year's crop, which will be of some assistance in enabling Australian wheat-growers to dispose of their product in competition with other countries. I have no doubt that the Opposition will vote against the Government's proposal because its members have no desire to see good wages paid in this country. The Labour party, being altruistic in its outlook, is not concerned about votes so long as the best interests Australia are served. The spirit of the Labour movement is such that its supporters are prepared to perish in the attempt to put their country first. I shall support the Minister, regardless of consequences,",25
75,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Cowper) [3.31] The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Cusack) has been whistling to keep up his courage. He said that members of the Labour party would put Australia first, even though it meant that they perished in the attempt. I have no doubt that at the next election the honourable member and his associates will perish politically because they put themselves first. I rise to oppose the proposal of the Government, and to indicate that I shall support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson)-a n amendment based on the report of the Tariff Roard. I shall oppose the Government's proposal for three reasons: first, because it strikes a blow at Australian primary industries, and also the building trade; secondly, because it will adversely affect reciprocal trade with Great Britain at a time when we should do our utmost to develop that trade, seeing that Great Britain is passing through such a critical period; and thirdly, because it is a deliberate attempt to take the control of the country's fiscal policy from the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The Government's proposal is practically to hand over the control of Australia's fiscal - policy to the Government of New South Wales. The Minister was good enough to supply me with a copy of the statement he made yesterday. Having studied that statement, it appears to me that these duties have been proposed because labour conditions in New South Wales are such that the cost of producing bar steel cannot be reduced. The Minister admits that because labour conditions in New South Wales do not conform to the standard which obtains in the rest of Australia it is necessary to impose higher duties on galvanized iron in order to keep the galvanized iron-making industry going. It is worth noting that the higher the duties imposed on imported galvanized iron, ostensibly with a view to assisting the Australian industry, the greater the of damage done to the workers employed, not only in that industry, but also in other industries. Some time ago, with the object of giving the whole of the trade in galvanized iron to the Australian company, an embargo was placed on the importation of that commodity. Immediately the price of galvanized iron rose. Later, heavy duties on galvanized iron were substituted for the embargo. The result has been that, compared with a consumption of about 110,000 tons of galvanized iron a year before the imposition of the duties, and an anticipated production in Australia of 80,000 tons per annum, as a result of duties, the Australian company is now manufacturing and selling only between 25,000 and 30,000 tons per annum. The fall in the consumption of galvanized iron in Australia is not due to any falling off in the demand for that commodity. As pointed out yesterday by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Hawker), there are many thousands of persons throughout Australia keenly desirous of obtaining galvanized iron, who are unable to purchase it because the cost is so high. In many cases they are keenly buying second-hand material. Instead of assisting the industry, the imposition of high duties has injured it, because it has lessened the purchasing power of the people.",26
76,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The falling off in the consumption of galvanized iron 'is due to the economic depression.,26
77,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The economic depression is responsible to some extent for the falling off; but I shall show from my own experience that that is not the only cause. Recently, I required about l i tons of galvanized iron, but, because the price had risen from £24 10s. to £30 a ton, I was unffble to purchase it. Instead, I pulled down sheds and erected them elsewhere 200 miles away. Similar things are being done in many places throughout Australia. Where old iron cannot be obtained, farmers are using the bark of trees to cover buildings and sheds. The policy of imposing high duties on galvanized iron has injured, rather than helped, the industry. I feel confident that, if the price of galvanized iron were reduced to bring it within the reach of those requiring it , most of the difficulties which now exist in the industry would disappear. When a bounty was paid on the production of galvanized iron that commodity was cheaper than it is now. It s lower price then placed the material within the reach of those requiring it . If we are to rehabilitate the galvanized iron-making industry we must bring down the price. The Government's proposal will tend to increase the price, and, therefore, to injure the industry still further. The statement read by the Minister yesterday amazed me, because it indicates that the Government has practically capitulated to Mr Lang. Evidently, the Government is not prepared to do anything to bring labour conditions in New South Wales into conformity with the conditions in the other States. While in the rest of Australia a 48-hour week is the rule, and federal arbitration awards apply, New South Wales insists on a 44-hour week and its own labour conditions. The time has come for U3 to decide whether the Commonwealth Parliament or the Parliament of a State is to control Australia's fiscal policy. Should Lysaght Limited or the Broken, Hill Proprietary Limited close their works that unfortunate result will be due to the application of New South Wales labour conditions to those industries. The Minister says that the price of galvanized iron cannot he reduced because of the present high prices of bar iron and zinc. Australia possesses some of the richest iron deposits in the world, so rich and well placed that we are able to export iron ores profitably to Japan, the United States of America, and European countries. Australia also has valuable coal deposits. We are able to mine and export coal. Both of these requirements for the manufacture of iron and steel are obtainable close to navigable waters, and are thus able to be brought together with greater ease aud less probably than in any other part of the world. Yet what is the position? We bring these two minerals together and put them through the mills. is almost entirely a mechanical process, and the finished product in the for m of p i g iron costs £6 5s. a ton, while pig iron produced in England probably from Australian iron ore costs only £3 5s. a ton. As a result of that stupid position our industries, which depend on those basic minerals, are greatly handicapped. Bar sheet is selling in Australia at £9 16s. a ton. The Tariff Board considers that £8 l is . 3d. a ton is a reasonable price, yet the European export price is about £ 3 6s. a ton. Zinc is used to manufacture bar sheet into galvanized iron. The zinc is mined, produced, and electrolyzed in Australia. A great quantity is sold overseas, yet, because of our stupid policy, the Australian manufacturer has to pay about £2 10s. a ton more than his competitor in Great Britain pays for the self-same zinc. That is another great handicap that we have placed upon our manufacturers. It is obvious that we must revert, to fundamental principles t» bring about a reduction of costs. The Minister himself suggested that this was not a proper duty to impose, because so soon as the output of the Newcastle mills reaches 60,000 tons he is willing to reduce the duty, and, i u fact, he has moved an amendment to that effect. How can we possibly bring about an increase of production in the Newcastle mills? The increased duty and the embargo have not brought it about. The o n l y time when the Newcastle mills were busy, despite the fact that thousands of tons of iron aud steel products were being imported into this country, was when the bounty system operated in Australia, and iron was comparatively cheap. We must revert to that system. In the T a r i ff Board's report there is no reference to a bounty on galvanized iron. The board pointed out that the encouragement of the establishment of the galvanized iron industry by means of a bounty was not referred to it , and that, consequently, it disregarded that question altogether.",26
78,Mr ABCHDAXB PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The board said that it preferred the bounty system. cost Dr EARLE PAGE - I do not know whether the board, actually said that, but undoubtedly it did not investigate that matter because it was not submitted This to it . When the Tariff Board's report is being considered, that point must not be forgotten. There are many cogent reasons why, despite the proposals b - i'jre the committee, and the report of the Tariff Board which explicitly states that the question of a bounty' was not considered, we should protect and encourage this industry with a bounty rather than with a duty. There are many reasons for that. The first is that the Australian country constituencies. industry does not, at present, supply the whole of the Australian requirements. The Minister has said that when the industry is in a position to produce 60,000 tons of galvanized iron annually, it will not require the high duty that is now proposed. I understood, when the embargo was imposed, that the industry was able to produce 80,000 tons of galvanized iron annually.",27
79,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That was so, but there was no demand for that quantity.",28
80,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If the Minister's statement, that the industry is not in a position to produce immediately 60,000 tons of galvanized iron annually, is true, I cannot understand why the bounty system should have been superseded by a duty or an embargo.",28
81,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The industry was able to produce 80,000 tons annually, but there - was no demand for that quantity. The demand is at present for only 30,000 tons annually.",28
82,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The demand has decreased because of the high prices ing for galvanized iron.,28
83,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The main cause of the diminished demand is the serious depres-sion and the fact that all governments have had to shut, down on loan expenditure.",28
84,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Minister talks as if the Government were large purchasers of galvanized iron, but the biggest purchasers are private people. I certainly disagree with, the Minister's statement that only 25 per cent, of our galvanized iron production is used in the country.",28
85,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"-- I said that 25 per cent, was used by the primary producers.",28
86,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Minister must know that most country buildings are roofed with galvanized iron while practically every city building is roofed with tiles or slates. The man who works on a farm is a primary producer as well as the actual farmer, and surely he is entitled to some consideration. The Minister's own statement should induct all members of the Labour party to rallj beside honourable members on this side in an endeavour to remove this iniquitous duty, because it must affect their con- . stituencies in the same way as it doesThe second reason why this duty should be removed is that the industry has a monopoly, and it seems to me that there should be some competition, if not in Australia, then from elsewhere. The only competition, apparently, that we can obtain is from inside the Empire, and surely we should not object to that. Because of the high duty, exchange and primaere duties, th(imnortation of galvanized iron at present is practically prohibited and there is neither external nor internal competition. The third reason why I think that a bounty should supersede the duty is that the exact amount of the bounty would be shown in the yearly accounts of the Government, and every person in Australia would b< j able by picking up the Commonwealth Year-Book to ascertain the charge imposed upon the people in order to afford protection to this industry. At present we d« not know what we are paying for its pro tection. The Minister read a long state rul- ment relating to the cost of the duty, but. various members on this side of thV chamber consider that the cost is much greater than stated by the Minister. There is a difference of opinion regard ing the exact cost of the duty, but if thp bounty system were introduced we would know clearly and definitely to what extent we were protecting the galvanized iron industry. Another reason why there should be a bounty instead of a duty is that the cost of the industry would thereby be spread equitably over the entire tax-paying community, and not placed entirely on the shoulders of onesection. That surely is not an unreasonable proposal at this particular time, when the cry of the Government is "" equality of sacrifice "". The Minister says that with regard to everything but galvanized iron there shall be equality of sacrifice, but that the man who requires that commodity must pay through the nose for it, and if he cannot afford to do that, he must do without it. If the cost of galvanized iron could be cheapened by the payment of a bounty instead of the imposition of a duty, the cost of production in vital industries generally in this country would be reduced, and some real contribution would be made to the plan of financial and economic rehabilitation. It is obvious that Australia cannot make any progress unless that cost of production is reduced. That is one of the first steps that must be taken;, and one of the principal essentials is to reduce cost of equipping our industries. Factories in the cities, and farm houses, barns, and sheds all over Australia, have to be covered with galvanized iron. If the cost of that commodity is excessive, many of those structures will not be erected, and the rehabilitation of this country will be definitely impeded. The Tariff Board wa3 not requested to report on the question whether there should be n bounty rather than a duty; but I ask the committee to insist upon being given an opportunity to determine that matter. Let us examine the duty recommended by the Tariff Board so as to ascertain why the Minister has differed from the Tariff Board as to what is necessary to support the industry. The board has reported that, if the exchange rate should rise above 28 per cent. - it is now 81-& per cent - the duty should be free British, 20 per cent, intermediate, and 40 per cent, general. The Minister disagrees with that recommendation, and proposes a higher duty. I contend that his rates are altogether too with exchange where it stands today. Surely the conditions in Australia generally should be considered in relation to the requirements of this industry! We should not simply confine our attention to the charges that are imposed by the laws of the State of New South Wales. The Tariff Board points out that a 10 per cent, reduction in the basic wage has been made by the Federal Arbitration Court. Thut reduction represents 15s. 6d. a ton, which brings down to £23 l is . l i d . price at which this commodity should be sold. But, generally throughout Australia, there has not only been a 10 per cent, reduction of the basic wage, but also a further 13 per cent, reduction due to the lowering of the cost of living, principally on butter, eggs, and other farm products. Consequently, there has been a 23 per cent, reduction in the cost of wages, and that is reflected in all awards of the Federal Arbitration Court.",28
87,Mr LEWIS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The right honourable gentleman has complained of the cost of living having been increased.,29
88,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"My complaint is that the cost of manufactured goods hiw increased in this country. The other day, the in a store at Bathurst, the manager showed me a number of manufactured 1 articles which, he informed me, were costing 20 per cent, more to invoice-this year than they cost last year; yet, the income of every person in that community has been reduced by anything from 20 per cent, to 100 per cent. He said to me, ""How can I sell these goods when that is the position ? "" How can galvanized iron be sold at an additional cost of £6 a ton when the income of every person who uses it has declined? The rates suggested by the Tariff Board are really excessive in view of the general condition of Australia. We should concern ourselves, not with the conditions that are imposed in the State of New South Wales, but with what is the general average throughout Australia. That, surely, is the test which should be applied. Our tariff should operate in such a way as to give to those industries which are paying these wages a reasonable chance of working on a profitable basis. Why should we stand behind one State which says that it will not come into the general high, scheme? New South Wales remained aloof from the general governmental financial proposals until the last minute, when it was dragged in by the hair by the Federal Government. It* has stood out of every other scheme, to the detriment of not only hundreds of thousands of workers, but also the community generally throughout Australia. Who are we that we should perpetuate that state of affairs? The Commonwealth must insist upon being the supreme fiscal authority, and disregard any such extraneous conditions the that may be operating. Coal prices have been reduced by 6s. a ton. which should mean a reduction roughly, of 15s. a ton in the co3t of iron and steel and, consequently, of galvanized iron. Lastly, there is the fact that the primage duty has been raised to 10 per cent., which means that an additional 10 per cent, protection is being given to the locally manufactured article.  above the amount set out by the Tariff Board when the primage was 4 per cent.",29
89,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"On an overseas price of £15 a ton it amounts to roughly £1 13s. a ton. That practically offsets all the other charges that the Minister has mentioned. The honourable gentleproved man has argued that we should make certain that this industry is profitable to its promoters. ""Who are we that we If should make certain by legislation that any industry in this country is mainwas tained on a profitable basis instead of by competent management?",30
90,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I did not say that we should make certain; what I said was any person who put money into an dustry of this description had reason expect a fair return.,30
91,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No person has any reason to expect that the Government of this country will bolster up one innot dustry at the expense of all others, and enable it to be the only industry that is making a profit, whether its turnover be large or small. Such a position ridiculous, especially at this particular time, when hundreds of pastoralists thousands of farmers are unable to make a living, and the wheat-farmers are in the state described yesterday by the orable member for Angas (Mr Gabb). deeper The Minister contends that a return of 4,8 per cent, is reasonable, despite the that the galvanized iron industry in many other countries has lost half of its capital as the result of the world depression ing the last two or three ycar3. It would appear that this particular indushad try in Australia is to be sacroLysaght sanct, that it, is to be the only inout dustry that we should make certain will crops. have a profitable existence whether its turnover be big or small.

93,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That can t»> done only by lowering the price. That is a maxim of commerce. The raising of prices is a governmental maxim. It is in operation on the railways, where freight* and fares have been increased to the detriment of the revenue. We increase taxa tion, and the income obtained from thai source declines, because the law of diminishing returns operates. That i what is happening in this case. The orih way in which the position can be ira is by lowering the cost.

The Minister's contention that 75 per cent, of the production of these factories is used in the cities may be correct; but, that doe destroy my argument, because the income of practically everybody in the citiehas fallen.

94,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Mr MCGRATH) a big Order! The right honourable member' [Quorum formed.],30
95,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Kooyong) [4.2] - The duties on galvanized iron are essentially related to the iron and steel industry as a whole, aud affect the interests of the users in the cities and the country. The iron and steel industry is important in respect of national defence and national industry, and I am prepared to protect it. It is essential that with the world constituted as it is at present we should not be dependent upon other countries for our supplies of iron and steel. If Ave acknowledge that principle, we must consider the position of those products into which iron and steel are manufactured. It is important to take into account the present state of the iron and steel trade throughout the world. It is in the fullest sense a world trade. Iron and steel are exported by nearly all the j>roducing countries. The manner in which the great European enterprises carry on their business is illuminating, and I quote from the British Mining Journal the following prices ruling in Germany in December last:Domestic Price - Export Blooms 10!) 0 04 Billets . . 111! 0 . . 05 Sheet bars 121 U (10 I could cite other metal products to show that there is a marked difference, sometimes up to 100 per cent., between domestic and export prices. On this account, the British steel industry is in a difficult position. For example, on the 23rd July last, the price of British joists in England was £8,15s., and of continental joists, £4 9s.: British bars, £6 12s. Od.; continental, £4 10s. 6d.: British angles, £8 7s. 6d.; continental, £4 10s.: British plates, £9 7s. 6d.; and continental, £5 Is. 3d. Having regard to the dumping which obviously takes place, I am not prepared to expose the Australian iron and steel industry to the risks which would be involved in a failure to give to it reasonable protection. We have to consider also in relation to this and other industries, the effect of Russia's re-entry into world trade, and its urgent desire to obtain external credits. While Russia was out of the international markets, other countries increased their manufacturing plant and acreage under crop in order to cater for that portion of the demand which hitherto Russia had supplied. With the re-entry of that country into the market, many products are oversupplied. In these circumstances, what is to be Australia's policy? I propose to suggest a new line of approach to the problem, or at least a line which I have not heard indicated in this debate, and which I fear will be unpopular in some quarters. The Australian company which manufactures galvanized iron is reported to be efficient, well equipped, and capable of producing 80,000 tons per annum, of which the company „ can sell in Australia only 30,000 tons, and outside Australia, nothing, because the cost of production is so high as to prevent it from competing in the markets of the world. There is no chance in the immediate future of this plant being utilized to full capacity if it is confined to supplying the Australian market. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been invested in the plant, and capital and men are idle. Extending this survey to the iron and steel industry as a whole, we find the Price, Broken Hill Proprietary Company, of a. </.. s. d. which I , as an Australian, am proud, 0 and the Australian Iron and Steel Com(1 pany with which I am not so familiar, 0 capable of producing iron and steel in quantities which this country is not likely to be able to utilize in the immediate future. These companies are working to less than one-third capacity. This means a great waste of capital and labour. The equipment is ready to be used, and thousands of men are out of work; yet the two cannot function because, in the only market now regarded as available for this industry, the product is not wanted at present prices. The object of the proposal to increase certain duties is to exclude galvanized iron produced in other countries and give to the Australian manufacturer a chance to keep up his prices. The Government holds that under existing conditions the manufacturer must be able to obtain prices higher than would be obtainable in a free trade market. But the keeping up of prices tends in itself to aggravate the evils of the present position. It tends to reduce consumption still further, particularly in a time of depression. Accordingly we are confronted with a problem which appears insoluble. There is waste of capital and of man power, however we regard the industry. It is futile now to complain of the expansion of plants beyond the capacity of the market to absorb the product. We have to deal with the facts as they are, and as they are likely to be in the diate future. The position is fundamentally uneconomic, and we cannot, particularly in a time of depression, put on ;a sound basis, industries which are over-equipped for the Australian market, by merely imposing protective duties. Oan this problem be attacked from any other angle? Lysaght Limited have the whole of the Australian market. If prices are maintained at their present level an expansion of consumption is unlikely.  is probable.",30
96,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL,". I am afraid of that, especially if existing prices be maintained and world conditions become worse. The Australian market cannot employ the idle capital and men unless prices are substantially reduced. Can we develop an export trade? That proposal may sound ridiculous; but we have to look for a solution, and unless we up new avenues which at first may not find favour with some sections of the community, we shall not be able to evolve a plan that offers any hope of relief from our industrial difficulties. I began by pointing out what Germany was doing, and also said something about the position in Russia. All countries the world which have large industries ' are producing goods for consumption at home, and also for export, disposing of the latter at lower prices than those charged to their own people.",32
97,Mr BEASLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is not the internal economic position of Russia much different from that of other countries?,32
98,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Ver y different, indeed. Russia is exporting in order to get plant and trade credits, almost irrespective of the cost of production. She is forced doing so in order to carry out the present policy of the country. We are in a world where that sort of thing is being done, and we must do a bit of it ourselves. Speaking generally, it is being done in our primary industries, which are selling quite a number of their products at comparatively high prices locally, and exporting the balance for what can be obtained on the markets of the world, the industry evening up the proceeds over the output as a whole. It is a very difficult problem to work out practically and successfully. But in the imme- case of our secondary industries, we in Australia appear to have resigned ourselves to supplying only the home market. Yet in many industries it Ls extremely difficult to have effective production on a sufficient scale if we confine ourselves to the local market. Therefore, I raise the question-and I know that I shall have to say a lot more than I have said upon it in order to get down to realities-as to the possibility of export in our Australian secondary industries. We should aim at bringing about a production that will make use at least of existing plant and get down to a basis of efficiency. When I say "" efficiency "" I am not animadverting upon the efficiency of enterprises as at present conducted, but I understand that the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited works at Newcastle are operating at something less than one-third of their capacity at the present time. That is what we want to alter if we can, open and it appears to me to be quite impossible to do so while the activities of that company and Australian Iron and Steel Limited are confined to the Australian market.",32
99,Mr BEASLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Is it. not a fact that the United States of America has reached in a high stage of scientific production in its secondary industries, and yet, has 6,000,000 unemployed today?",32
100,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If the honourable member desired me to discuss the United States of America, I should have to deal with many considerations beyond those already mentioned. We in Australia must enter into world competition or resign ourselves to becoming a backward nation. That is the alternative that I am wishful to avoid. Our action must be taken with into due regard to existing world economic conditions. I hope that something may be done to bring about a change in those conditions. Honourable members, of course, have their own ideas how it can be done. We are very close to markets for our iron and steel products. There is a useful market in New Zealand, and a big one in the East. I suggest that steps should be taken to ascertain the conditions upon which it would be possible for our iron and steel industry to export its products to these markets and obtain .a fair share of the trade which, I understand, amounts in the East to millions of pounds per annum. I would not presume to say in detail what those conditions are. Some things, however, are obvious. I can underincreased stand that with a great capital expendiconsiderations ture of millions of pounds, as is the of the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited at Newcastle, and a plant working only one-third of its capacity, overhead becomes a gigantic charge upon the industry. It may be that merely by working to full capacity and having a market for the output the reduction of overhead, spread over the whole proof duction, would make it possible to sell substantial proportion of the articles much lower rates than are possible at present. Some industries-and for the moment I go beyond iron and steel, cause that is not an industry that uses as raw material any substantial prowaited portion of imported products-wor k up imported material. I shall be quite pared to examine sympathetically any scheme for admitting duty free any such material-provide d that it was to be put into goods that were to be exported, to machinery for working it up. Then I come to the vexed question wages and industrial conditions, about which, perhaps, there will be a great deal of difficulty and doubt. Is it not worth considering a modification of wages and industrial conditions, to enable us to bring some of our secondary industries into exportable production? Would it not be better, both economically, and from the point of view of the effect on character of our citizens as a whole, building now being done. to have our people working for something less than existing rates, in order to up an export trade, rather than to have a developing system of sustenance and as in the country. doles which I , and I am sure honourable members in every part of the chamber must feel, may lead to a permanent problem of unemployment? Already our primary industries have to take world prices for a proportion of their output. Why should not consideration be given our secondary industries extending production, employing many who are out of work, and accepting world prices for the quota that is not disposed locally!' That would involve an examinaconsider tion of details, industry by industry. I do not stand here as an expert in a particular industry, and say that this should be done in that industry, and something else in another, but I do say that the proposed duty on galvanized iron raises of this character to which, case it is worthwhile members of the committee at least giving their earnest attenat tion. That is as far as I shall go. I shall say very little on this particular duty. Galvanized iron is used extensively in the cities of Australia. This is not merely a country problem. The price galvanized iron is a very important a factor in both city and country. Unforat tunately, as matters are in Australia today, the consumption of this commodity is falling off; the price is higher than bemany people are able to pay. The other day a deputation from the building trade upon me in Melbourne, and informed nie that, as compared with condipretions that existed two years ago, the amount of building. being done in Melbourne, and within a 10-mile radius of the city, was. down by 85 per cent. The or members of the deputation gave many reasons for that. Of course, they were builders, and wanted to see as much building done at as of. cheap a price as possible. Among other things they spoke of the prices that were maintained for both galvanized iron and timber. I am aware that the subject of timber will come up later under another item, and I shall deal with it only in passing. They told me that, because some of the timber that they' bad to use was expensive, substitutes were coming in the rapidly, even for the small balance of Galvanized iron and any other commodity needed build extensively for building are very important requirements in the city as well I have just been in South Australia, and there I met a large number of farmers, who were receiving at sidings from between Is. 5d. and Is. 7£d. a bushel for their wheat. Practically every one to of those farmers had had to spend their about 3s. to produce each bushel now of wheat that he . was selling. The conditions in the towns we know. of It seems to me that we have to the position of the galvanized iron industry in the light of the well known and all too unfortunate facts with which we are so familiar. - I call attention to the natural desire of John Lysaght Australia Limited to obtain a return on a certain £500,000 at which they value their patents, processes, trade marks, and goodwill. Of course, it will be very .nice if they can get it . The proper amount of capital for the company may be £100,000, £500,000, or £750,000. ""We cannot tell. But we in this committee cannot accept that valuation of £500,000 as a matter of course, and say that the company is entitled to a return upon it. We have no means here of judging whether there is over-capitalization or not. One other matter which is obvious upon the face of the report is this: I think that it was the honourable member for - Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) who complained in very definite language of the Tariff Board calling attention in its report to rates of wages, and who said that such matters were entirely beyond its function. I completely agree. I think that the honourable member also s.iid that be would not vote for the proposed .increase of duty unless the Minister gave an undertaking that, if any application were made for a reduction in wages, there would be a corresponding reduction in the rate of duty. The rates of wages paid in the industry are referred to at page 30 of the report as follows: The average wage for a full week's work in the production of sheet bars for galvanized iron manufacturing is £5 lis. 2d. The average wage for full-time employment in the galvanized iron industry itself is £fi 9s. Id. At present the employees in this industry are working part time and their average earnings are much lower. Whilst this is an equitable method of distributing the wages available, it fails to effect any savings in actual costs of production. Wage rates are important in relation to costs of production. Of course, the manufacturer cannot do anything but pay the prescribed rate. This afternoon we heard that the Public Service as a whole has suffered a wage reduction of 20 per cent. There has not been even a 10 per cent, reduction in the wages paid to employees in the galvanized iron industry.",32
101,Mr CULLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The conditions are different. Mr La /.ham.,34
102,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"In Australia, at the present time, almost everybody has had to accept some reduction of income. Many of the farmers have had no wages at all during the past year",34
103,Mr LONG,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Many workers in Australia have had no wages for three years past.,34
104,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is partly because they are prevented from earning wages through the imposition of impossible working conditions. The attempt to maintain rates of wages which cannot be paid under present economic conditions is doing the gravest injury to the workers of Australia, and to all other sections of the community. It would be very nico if everybody could be paid £10 a week, and for £10 to be worth as much as it ever was, but it cannot be done. If it were provided in the Arbitration Court awards tomorrow that everybody should receive £10 a week, that would lead to the swift and certain ruin of the country.",34
105,Mr JAMES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Well, let us have £7 a week. dis- Mr LATHAM - Some of the coalminers are doing very well at the present time; they are earning magnificent money. I am amazed that the Miners Federation should stand by. and see a few men earn excessive wages, while many others earn nothing af all. I know that it is hard for us to accept reductions; but let our standards be real standards. I am afraid that many in Australia are living in an atmosphere of hypocrisy. There is a pretence that standards are being maintained, when, according to the latest figures, 27.6 per cent, of our trade unionists are unemployed. We are not doing our people any real service by pretending to maintain artificial standards. We are merely putting up costs and prices, making money worth less, and aggravating the hardships of the situation. I do not see why this Parliament should be forced to pass certain tariff legislation because a particular State in which an industry is established happens to insist on certain industrial regulations, and chooses to keep in operation certain social legislation. New South Wales has imposed working conditions which are, from an economic point of view, quite impossible. What with child endowment, workers' compensation, the 44-hour week, and a basic wage out of relation, as it is, to economic facts, it is impossible to carry on industries in New South Wales on an economic basis. Why should this Parliament be forced into granting increased duties because Mr Lang chooses to preserve the basic wage in New South Wales at £4 2s. 6d. a week, when the basic wage in the other States is more nearly £3 a week ? Not only does he insist upon the higher wage,-but it must be paid for a working week of only 44 hours. Are we to shape our tariff at the dictation of a particular State Parliament? We should repudiate any such suggestion. The Commonwealth Parliament cannot indefinitely support a State which is failing to take the action necessary in the interests of the workers, and of every other class of citizen. I am not prepared to consider this subject on the assumption that the wage rates paid in the iron and steel industry are permanently fixed at present rates. The workers in the industry ought to share in the reductions which practically everybody else in the community has had to accept. If they were to do that, it would be possible to reduce the price of the product, extend its consumption, and employ more men. I support the proposal of the Tariff Board. It appears to me to be a wellreasoned proposal, and I entirely agree with the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) that, having regard to the rate of exchange, primage duty, &c, the present position of the industry is not due to overseas competition, but to the existing economic conditions within the Commonwealth. Accordingly, the objects to be sought are increased production and increased sales. There can be increased production only if sales are increased, and this cannot be done unless prices come down. Some honourable members may regard as impracticable my suggestion that there should be applied to this and other industries special conditions to enable it to develop an export trade; but, in my opinion, the suggestion is at least worth exploring.",34
106,Mr BEASLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"West Sydney) [4.37]. - The Depiity Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) has argued that it is necessary to develop our export trade in order to relieve the existing depression. To do this, he said, we must reduce the costs of production, and this, he seemed to think, could best be done by reducing wages and making working conditions worse. But if our difficulties could be removed merely by reducing wages, why is it that troubles similar to those which afflict Australia exist today in the various lowwage countries of the world? Even honourable members opposite cannot complain that wage3 in Japan, for instance, are too high; yet that country is feeling the trade depression in common with ourselves. Japan has developed her secondary industries to such an extent that she has become a serious competitor with other manufacturing countries, yet sheis experiencing the same difficulty, in spite of low wages, as they are in finding markets for her products. China is not so highly developed industrially as Japan, but that country, although wages there are low, and conditions bad, has not escaped the general depression. The general survey of the world's economic conditions must convince us that all countries are at present suffering, and that no solution of our own problem could be found by depressing our standards to those of the low-wage countries, even if such a course were not entirely foreign to Australian sentiment.  twelve times as much as in Australia.",35
107,Mr BEASLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is no answer to my argument. When Australians travel 'abroad, they feel proud that they are citizens of a country which has made certain definite improvements in the social conditions enjoyed by its people, and they are able to draw favourable comparisons between their own country and those which they visit. One of the most important tasks of the League of Nations is that of bringing the backward, lowwage countries up to the standards enjoyed by the more advanced nations. This work is regarded as having a direct and important bearing upon the peace of the world. If this is not so, why have this and previous governments sent representatives from Australia to conferences held under the direction of the League of Nations? The leaders of political thought in this country should, if they love their country, as some of them so often profess in public to do, direct their efforts toward improving our existing social standards rather than to depressing them. Dealing with the subject of export trade, the Deputy Leader of the Opposipreservation. tion (Mr Latham) referred to the part legislators is to our own people. played by Russia in world affairs today. It cannot be denied that that country playing an increasingly important part. Professor Wadham, of the University, recently delivered a very interesting address in Brisbane on subject to the members of the Constituremarks tional Club. He said that the world could no longer, in the manner of ostrich, afford to ignore Russia been trying to do, trusting to a political collapse in that country. It was necessary, he said, to recognize that Russia was playing an important role in world affairs. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was speaking just now, interjected that the internal economic conditions in Russia were entirely different from those which obtained in capitalistic countries. In the Government has adopted the course of refusing to recognize public - debts, either internal or external. Russia is relieved of the burden of payopinion ing interest on such debts, whereas other countries have to find enormous sums in taxation every year for this purpose. This has a most important accepted bearing upon costs of production, and the price at which products can be sold. In this country increased taxation is imposed in each successive budget the purpose of meeting the interest ments"" on our debts. I agree that the burden falls, to a large extent, upon primary producers, who find themselves tries in Australia? unable to meet these demands, and still produce at a price which will enable their products to compete with those Russia. It would be a physical impossiago. bility for them to do so, even though they worked for nothing. This has to be taken into consideration when not only our primary industries, but our secondary industries also. That being so, I feel disposed to direct my attention to the internal position in Australia rather than to our part as a competitor in the world's markets. It seems to that all countries will have to work along the same lines. Even Great Britain been forced to consider a policy which, worse. under normal conditions, would not have been tolerated for a moment. At the Mr Beasley. present time, all round it is a case of selfOur first responsibility as The average primary producer today is very is much in the same position as the average worker; his concern is how to get food, Melbourne clothing, and shelter.",35
108,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL," The honourable member's are most interesting, but I ask him to endeavour to confine his remarks the to the item. At present he is speaking as it had all round the subject.",36
109,Mr BEASLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition entered into a general discussion, and I thought that I might be pardoned if I transgressed similarly. I The reduction of wages will not place this or any other industry in Australia on a profit-making basis, or solve the problem in terms in keeping with our Russia social standards. Yet in January of this year Professor Copland, when giving evidence before Chief Judge Dethridge in Thus the Arbitration Court, expressed the that a 10 per cent, cut in wages would have the effect of creating more employment in industry, because the wage fund would be spread over a greater number of workers. The Government the position created by the court, and threw upon employers in indostry the responsibility of proving the soundness of the argument that the reducfor tion of wages means more employment. payBut can any one now contend that the 10 per eent. reduction has really resulted the in more employment in the various indus",36
110,Mr E RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,There is less employof ment today than there was twelve months,36
111,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"And taxation is further discussing, hampering industry.",36
112,Mr BEASLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not deny that the burden of taxation in varied forms is a staggering one, so that industry can scarcely carry it, yet, notwithstanding that, and with all the economies that are me supposed to have been made, the budgetary position of the various governhas ments of Australia has daily become There has been a substantial addition to the ranks of our unemployed in_ every State and, as a eon sequence, the liability of the various Stategovernments per medium of the dole is daily becoming heavier. In regard to the relief measures to be undertaken to meet our present desperate situation, no government can stand out against the expressed will of the people; and if the people are not fed, clothed, and provided with shelter, they will make their power felt and, eventually, overthrow any government that fails them. The budgetary position of the Commonwealth and State governments is also becoming increasingly difficult owing to the interest and exchange burden*of our oversea obligations. I repeat that it is possible to solve the present financial and economic problems of the Commonwealth by wage cuts. As the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) interjected a few moments ago, this policy has had the effect of making the position worse. Obviously, the 10 per cent, cut in wages, ordered by the Arbitration Court, has not eased the situation. I honestly believe that, largely owing to development of the application of science to industry in all its forms, we have reached the Stage at which it is possible to provide all the requirements of the community with a much less expenditure of industrial effort than formerly. This view has been expressed by, among others, the Governor of New South Wales (Sir Phillip Game), in an address to members of the New South Wales Commercial Travellers Association, - at a banquet which J attended on behalf of the Ministry, and by the last Governor General (Lord Stonehaven) before he left Australia - The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN - (Mr Mackay) - I shall be glad if the honourable member will connect his relines jnarks with the item under discussion. If the Opposition. a general address on economics is permitted upon every item of the tariff the debate will be unduly protracted.",36
113,Mr BEASLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Perhaps I have transgressed to some extent, but I am deavouring to establish my position, and that, of those associated with me in tion to this important problem of taining the standard wage and conditions of industry in Australia in keeping with the ideals .of the industrial movement. The honourable member for Werriwa .(Mr. .Lazzarini) has urged that steps be taken to .safeguard - the position of .all trialists,, because he,, and other members, of the group associated with me, believe that the developments of the last eighteen mouths in Australia have been along lines contrary to that approved by the work> ing class movement of this country. We contend that the present problem will not. be solved by the reduction of wages, which really means the diminishing' of the purchasing power of the people. All workers should be provided with the means whereby they can live and enjoy a higher standard of comfort. If this principle had general application, all secnot tions of the people would be benefited. Even our primary producers would be helped, because, under existing conditions the export market is practically closed to them, and they must necessarily look to the home market.  totally inadequate.",37
114,Mr BEASLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It may be inadequate totally to absorb the' products of some primary industries, but I suggest to the honourable member that the desperate plight of our primary producers is due largely to the enormous commitments arising out of the war and our huge interest burdens, I do not wish to in any way belittle the difficulties of our primary producers. All I wish to establish is that all sections of the people, whether they be industrialists or agriculturalists, are now on common ground. If these forces could be properly marshalled they would make their influence felt in the affairs of this country, and probably other countries, in a way that would correct a position that cannot be corrected along the suggested by the Deputy Leader of  ^ 1 spoke at .some length upon this item yesterday, so I do not propose to occupy much of the time of the committee this enafternoon. I iutend to move an amendment to the .amendment submitted yesterreladay by the Minister for Trade and Cus=maintoms ,(Mr Forde). Honourable members will recall that I foreshadowed an amendment which I intended to move, but intimated that I could not submit it until the Minister's amendment had been disv posed of. I find now that, if I divide indusmy amendment into tw.o parts, I can move the first part as an amendment to the Minister's amendment. I therefore move That the amendment be amended by omitting all the words up to and including "" gazettal"", with a view to insert in thereof the words "" And on and after the 18th September, 1031, the rates of duty to "". The Minister's amendment will then read""And on and after the 18th September, the rates of duty to be, per ton, British, intermediate, 110s.; general, 130s."". Honourable members will see that the rates of duties proposed in my amendreport:ment are the same as those submitted by the Minister and the Tariff Board, with the difference that they will apply imand mediately as recommended by the Tariff Board, whereas under the Minister's high amendment, the rates would apply if three years. and when the industry had reached stage of producing 60,000 tons per annum.",37
115,Mr EOJCDB,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"On which basis the Tariff Board made its recommendation.  Board were called upon today to report upon this item, it would, in bility, recommend duties of 70s. British, 90s. intermediate, and 110s. the simple reason that since it submitted its report in April last the industry been further protected by an increase the primage duty.",38
116,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"There has also been drop of £2 a ton in prices in England.  duty will still give ample protection the industry. The protection given by,the primage duty when the Tariff Board's report was submitted was equivalent 13s. 2d. a ton. To-day, as a result of increase of primage duty, that protection is approximately-35s. a ton. This is why I by this company. express the belief that if the Tariff Board were called upon today to make a recommendation with respect to this item it would probably recommend a lower range of duties, the difference being bridged the increased primage. Although the primage duty was imposed for revenue purposes it is undoubtedly protective its incidence. The Minister this aftersible noon also said that all the profit that was being made by Lysaght Limited was 9s. 3d. a ton. He even mentioned the centage on the capital invested, and added that the company was selling its product' at £28 10s. a ton. I pointed out at the time, by way of interjection, that, according to quotations in the Sydney Mornthe word ing Herald, the present price is lieu £29 10s. a ton for galvanized iron, and this fact was also mentioned by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett). Even assuming that all the calculations of the Minister otherwise were correct, the 1031, profit per ton must be not 9s. 3d., but at 90s.; least £1 9s. 3d. On this point I direct attention to the following comment to be found on page 9 of the Tariff Board's The balance-sheets and trading and profit IOSH accounts of John Lysaght (Australia) Limited, the distributing company, which were obtained by the board, disclose that very profits were being earned during the past the What has the Minister to say to that?",38

118,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"U p to December last it was 4.8 per cent, of the cash capital inall probavested in the industry.  general, for Tariff Board report.",38
119,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The investigation made has by the audit inspector stated that the in returns of this company could not be regarded as satisfactory for a concern a with such a large amount of capital involved.  to the present, return of any industry in Australia can be regarded as satisfactory, bearing in mind' the amount of capito tal invested. The Tariff Board report the states clearly that "" very high profits were earned during the past three years "" The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) made an excellent speech this afternoon, in which he discussed the possibility of developing an export trade by in iron and steel. It would be a great thing for this country if our big natural secondary industries could reduce their in costs to a point which would make posan 'export trade, but the price of Australian galvanized iron would have to be reduced by more than half in order perto make an export trade possible. The price of galvanized iron in this country is £29 10s. a ton at present, and similar quality British galvanized iron can be placed on board ship in skeleton felt-lined cases at £13 per ton.",38
120,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The report of the Tariff Board states that the high profits were made by the importing company, and not by the Australian manufacturing company.  one and the same.",39
121,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The profits were made on imported iron which was distributed by John Lysaght (Australia) Limited.  this concern has earned more substantial profits in one branch than in another, l.n all the circumstances, I move That all the words up to iind including the word ""gazettal"", be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" And on and ii.fter the 18th September, 1031, the rates of duty to "" . if my amendment is agreed to, the result will be that on and after the 18th September, the rate of duty on galvanized iron will be ""per ton, British, 90s.;intermediate, 110s.; general, 130s."". These were the rates recommended by the Tariff Board. When the amendments now before the Chair are dealt with, I propose to move an amendment which I foreshadowed yesterday with the object of requiring this company to sell galvanized iron at £25 a ton, the price which the Tariff Board considered to be fair, or forfeit the protective duty. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [5.4]. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) made a good speech from his point of view; but we must realise that it is impossible for us to export many of our secondary manufactures, because our wage standards are very different from those of other countries. The object of the Government in imposing these duties is to enable the Australian manufacturers to capture the Australian trade. I consider that it is reasonable to ensure to the local industry the local market. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition had something to say about the wages paid to the workers in this industry. I have had an opportunity of inspecting the plant of this company, and I have seen its employees at work. No amount of money would induce me to do work of the kind that these men have to do. They are stripped practically to the buff. They have to work in an intense heat with hardly a stitch of clothing on them. No man could stand such work for very many years, for it is slavish and heavy in the extreme. These men deserve and earn every penny they get.",39
122,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"What is the rate of sickness among them? Mr E. RILEY - If I told the right honourable member he would immediately leave for Newcastle to establish a practice there. We have been told that if the price of galvanized iron were reduced more of it would be purchased. The price of wool has been reduced, and wages in the wool industry have fallen tremendously; but the wool industry is not prosperous. The demand for wool has not increased. The price of butter has come down, to the grief of the honourable  but that has not brought prosperity to the industry.",39
123,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"More butter is being eaten in Australia than ever before. Mr E. RILEY - The purchasing power of many people has diminished so that they cannot afford to buy butter. The price of boots has come down; but large numbers of employees in this industry are out of work,  manufactures has gone up. Mr E. RILEY - The price of eggs has fallen, but there is intense depression in this industry. The increased consumption of eggs clue to the fall in price has not been sufficient to maintain the industry on a profitable basis. The argument that if the cost of production is reduced the increased consumption of commodities will bring prosperity will not bear analysis. The price of house property in Sydney and other cities has fallen, but the building trade is in a most unhappy position. What is needed is the provision of employment for the people so that they can buy the produce of the farmers and others. The reduction of wages will not solve our economic problem. The banks-and I refer to both the savings banks and the trading banks-ar e all feeling the effects of the reduced incomes of the people. Yesterday afternoon, I met an Australian native who has just returned to this country from America where he had lived for 30 years. He had been listening to the speeches delivered in this chamber, aud he told me the Americans would not. think of reducing wages in order to solve the unemployment problem. He said that in the United States of America everything possible was being done to maintain the existing wage standards. Lysaght Limited has not paid a dividend for the last two years, and unless relief can - be, given to the industry, it is hardly likely that the shareholders will agree to continue operations. It not be expected that the business will be maintained indefinitely at a loss. If the production of galvanized iron is discontinued locally, it is probable that a thousand men will be put out of work. This would be a serious thing. The Goverument should be doing its utmost to find work for our people, and it should resist every effort to develop a situation which will result in more men drawing the unemployment dole.",39
124,Mr RIOKDAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If we have less industry, the Government will have a lower revenue from taxation. ' Mr E. RILEY - That is so. Our revenue from income taxation and customs duties has fallen tremendously. As the representative of a constituency which is largely industrial, I know that there is a very unsettled feeling among the: people. If employment is not soon found for many people who are now out of work, we shall reach a most dangerous position. I intend to resist every effort to place the employees in the galvanized iron industry on the labour market If this industry is stopped, it will liMve a detrimental effect on mining, and many other industries. I know vc>-y well that our farmers have been hard hit, but they do not buy galvanized iron every day.",40
125,Dr EARLE PAGE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,They cannot buy » ny. Mr E. RILEY - If their position is a? had as that it would not make any difference to them if the price of galvanized iron were cut .in half.,40
126,Mr MAXWELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Does the honourable member think that the existing duties are high enough? Mr E. RILEY - I do, because th» company has said that it can maintain operations under present conditions. We must face the fact that our industrial troubles are largely due to the mechanization of industry. The inventive genius of man has created a Frankenstein monster which is crushing the working man. I was asked the other day whether I believed in the 44-hour week. I replied that I believed in working such hours as were necessary to produce our requirements. If it is necessary for us to work eight or ten hours a day to produce what we need, we must do it ; but if it is canonly necessary to work six hours a day, we should only work that length of time. Machinery is continually displacing manual labour, and so Teducing the purchasing power of the community. We shall have to face the situation fairly and squarely sooner or later, and devise some means of overcoming the troubles that have been caused on this account. Lf my income were to be reduced, I should have to move to a smaller house. If I were a storekeeper, and my turnover fell, I should have to be satisfied with a smaller store. Wc must recognize that when we strike a blow at, the wages of the working man, we strike a blow at every section of the community, including the farmers. It is a poor policy to reduce wages.",40
127,Mr MORGAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Darling Downs) [5.14] - There are two amendments before the committee. One is the herm^ aphrodite proposal of the Minister which has impossible restrictions attached to it, and the other is the full-sexed proposal of the honourable member for Gippsland  make galvanized iron available at the price which the Tariff Board considered to be fair. If the first proposal is agreed to it will be a reflection upon the common sense of the committee, but if the second is adopted, it will be beneficial to the whole community. The Government's proposal to increase the duty on galvanized iron is manifestly unfair. The position in which the Australian iron and steel industry is at present placed is due not to overseas competition, but to economic circumstances and industrial conditions which cannot be maintained. These conditions are now breaking down, and under economic pressure will continue to do so until normal conditions return. That point was stressed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) in an admirable contribution to the debate this afternoon. I cannot refrain from contrasting the attitude of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition with that of the Minister (Mr Forde), who endeavoured to defend these duties on the ground that he is under a definite obligation to the iron and steel industry. suggest that he is under a more dennite obligation to the people of Australia than to any particular industry.",40
128,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I did not say that I was under any obligation to the industry, but that we should discharge our obligation to Australia by supporting these duties.",41
129,Mr MORGAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Minister left a definite impression in my mind that he is under an absolute obligation to the industry. He has a more definite duty to ""perform to the people of Australia. The Minister is endeavouring to provide special conditions to a privileged industry, which, in view of our economic circumstances, cannot continue. Although the products of the primary producers are being marketed under most unfavorable conditions, practically everythSng they require for production is increasing in price. The duties on iron and steel and other commodities used in primary production are reaching such high prices that it will soon be impossible for many of our producers to obtain them. The protection whioh the Government proposes to afford to this industry is unreasonably high, and is doing incalculable harm to other industries, particularly those which are exporting a portion of their production, and thus assisting Australia financially. Primary production needs encouragement at this juncture, perhaps to a greater extent than at any other period in our history. The cost of implements and material required in primary production should be reduced instead of increased. Honourable members opposite have referred to the prevalence of unemployment; but the fiscal policy which they are supporting is aggravating the position. As these duties do not affect only the primary producers, who are marketing their produce overseas, but the whole community, further tariff increases should not be tolerated. According to the Tariff Board's report, from which quotations have been made from time to time, galvanized iron which could be sold in Australia at £25 a ton, is retailed at approximately £30 a ton. It has been said that the farmers are getting the benefit of the exchange, which can be set off against the high prices they are paying for certain commodities used in production. The I farmers are getting the benefit of the exchange, because they are producing for export, and the manufacturing industries which the Government is bolstering up under these proposals should also be exporting. Why are not those engaged in the manufacture of iron and steel deriving any benefit from the exchange rates which prevail today? It is because, they are not producing for export. Possibly certain disabilities are preventing them from doing so at present, but, as mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, these difficulties could bo overcome if the industrial position in Australia were other than it is today. If the economic position of Australia were taken into consideration, and the industry placed on a proper basis industrially, it could export, and enjoy the same advantages from the exchange that are being obtained by primary producers. That aspect 'of the subject, which is too frequently overlooked by those who have addressed themselves to this problem, is dealt with in a leading article recently published in the Sydney Morning Herald which readsThe growing general appreciation that there is something wrong about the tariff does not depend upon statistics. Statistics have misled Australian publicists for years. The essential truth is that in this critical emergency the high protective policy which has held the field for years has not enabled our manufacturing industries to contribute anything substantial towards paying oilr oversea debts. Why, since we must continue to export, should primary producers alone be expected to produce at a loss in order to maintain exports? Why should not the protected manufacturers also be asked to export at a loss, or at least to make an effort to export? That illustrates the p o in t w h i c h I made a f e w moments ago when I said that the benefits w h i c h the p r i m a r y producer it d e r i v in g from the exchange rates could also be obtained by Australian manufacturers if they were producing for export. If they cannot do so, the position must remain S3 it is until economic pressure brings the people of this country and this Parliament to a sense of what is right. The price of British galvanized iron in Great Britain is £13 a ton, the primage duty on importations into Australia £1 Ss. a ton, exchange £4 5s. a ton, freight, insurthe Opposition (Mr Latham). ance, and wharfage can be put down at £3 a ton, and customs duty at £5 10s. a ton. That gives a total natural protection to the Australian industry of £14 33. a ton.",41
130,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Tha i brings the landed price in Australia up to £27 3s. a ton.,42
131,Mr MORGAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Yes . The retail price of galvanized iron manufactured in Australia is over £30 per ton. In spite of these figures we are asked by the Minister to support these exorbitant da ties. Nothing could more definitely indicate the obligations of the committee to reject these smashing proposals than the figures quoted. The Government should revert to the duties imposed under the 1928 schedule, but I suppose that is too much to expect this Government to do. I intend to do everything I can to reduce these unnecessarily high duties, particularly in view of the fact that there has been a reduction in the cost of commodities used in production. Coal has dropped nearly 50 per cent, in price, and spelter is now £25 13s. a ton, which represents in the matter of manufacturing galvanized iron, a reduction in costs of £1 lis. a ton. We have been informed from time to time that the Australian workman enjoys a higher standard of living than the workmen of other countries; but it is very doubtful if the average Australian workman enjoys the high standard which some believe that he possesses. It has not yet been established that the Australian workman is entitled to a higher standard of living on a lower rate of production. The farmers have the right to claim similar wages and conditions to those enjoyed by men engaged in other industries; but such conditions can be justified only when Australia's position is economically sound. The wages which some are claiming in Australia today cannot be generally paid, and the only sound course to adopt is to reduce the wage standard so that Australian manufacturing industries may be able to produce at a lower rate for home consumption, and dispose of their commodities in the markets of the world, which at present they are unable to do. I could not illuminate that point more definitely, or completely than it wa3 illuminated this afternoon by the Deputy Leader of What puzzles me is how honourable members on the other side who represent rural constituencies can support this item. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr. Curtin), with his faculty for seeing things with some breadth of vision, and with some degree of introspection, made his position perfectly clear, and I hope that other Labour supporters who are equally concerned with the representation of rural industries, and perhaps more definitely than the honourable member for Fremantle, will view this problem with equal clarity. I cannot understand how the Minister for Defence (Mr. Chifley) can justify his support of this proposal. He represents a constituency which contains a great many primary producers, who will be badly hit by the imposition of this duty, yet I presume that he will record a vote in favour of this proposal to increase the penalties already inflicted upon the rural community. Then, again, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch) represents a constituency in which rural production is taking place on a considerable scale. How can he justify a vote in favour of this duty?",42
132,Mr MAXWELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"He surely will not vote for it ! Mr..MORGAN- I sincerely trust that the honourable member's pious hope may be realized. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), who is a member of the Cabinet, represents a constituency which embraces a large proportion of primary producers, men who in a hundred different ways will be affected by these impositions. How in the name of high heaven is the Minister going to justify in his constituency a vote in favour of these increased penalties upon the primary producers? Are the constituents of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Cusack) going to be satisfied with the buffoonery with which he today attempted to justify his support of this proposal to increase the cost of production to the detriment of the primary producers throughout southern New South Wales? The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) himself represents one of the greatest producing electorates in Australia. Sugar is largely produced in Capricornia.",42
133,Mr FOBPE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The sugar-growers have been protected against importation, and they, in turn, are quite prepared to give protection to secondary industries.",43
134,Mr MORGAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The sugar industry utilizes manufactures of iron and steel to an incalculable extent. How then can the Minister attempt to justify this increased duty?,43
135,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,My constituents approve my attitude.,43
136,Mr MORGAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Minister has introduced a schedule containing devastating duties, and I ask how he, in common with other honourable members who are supporting this item, can return to his constituency and justify his action. The honourable member for Calare (Mr Gibbons) told the farmers a little while ago that they were to receive 6s. 6d. a bushel for their wheat. Dare that honourable member return to his constituency and attempt to justify a vote in favour of this duty, which cannot but inflict severe hardship upon the primary producers? The honourable member for Indi (Mr Jones) was elected to this Parliament as the result of a political misadventure on the part of his opponent. He represents large farming interests, yet I have not heard him protest against. this duty. Does he intend to attempt to justify this further, infliction upon his constituents? If he votes in favour of this proposal, they will certainly ask him to explain his action. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Keane) is also concerned with this item. Although voluble at times, and frequently presenting his views on various proposals, he has been strangely silent on this item. I suggest that he has a good reason for his silence. He knows that it is impossible for him to justify, in any way, a vote that would help to carry this proposal. Where is the honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey) who represents a South Australian constituency largely devoted to primary production? - Mr MABTENS - He is away sick.",43
137,Mr MORGAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I suggest that a proposal of this nature makes a lot of honourable members sick. The Minister for Health and Repatriation (Mr MCNeill), who is the champion of inflation, repre* seuts a rural constituency. He is silent on this item, because he knows that it will be fatal for him, politically, to support it. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) must also be brought under the lash, because he represents an electorate in which iron and steel, and everything manufactured from those commodities, plays an important part in primary production. Does he intend to cast a silent vote"" on this proposal ?",43
138,Mr RIOBDAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,No .,43
139,Mr MORGAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I hope that the honourable member will be able to justify the vote that he casts on this proposal. 1 challenge him and any other honourable member who represents directly or indirectly the primary producers, to make out a convincing case in favour of this duty, the imposition of which must place increased burdens upon primary production throughout Australia. I have said that I should like to revert to the 1928 tariff schedule. I realise that we may not be able to achieve that object, and tlierefore I propose to support the amendment of the honourable member for Gipps ing effect to the recommendation of the Tariff Board. That body, in its report, has stated that sufficient protection is at present' being afforded to this industry by the high rate of exchange between Australia and London. The board, in the course of an excellent report containing most logical reasons for the acceptance of its recommendations, considers that duties of 90s., 110s., and 130s. should be imposed only if the local manufacturer undertakes to reduce prices immediately to the basis of a gross list price of £25 a ton. I have heard, during the debate, nothing that would justify any departure from that recommendation. The company which is producing galvanized iron in Australia is not likely to suffer from unfair competition. It is adequately protected, it enjoys a - monopoly of production baaed extortionate duties, and the increased costs in the industry are being borne the people of Australia. The company has no ground forobjecting to the tude of honourable members on this side in opposing this increased duty.",43

The honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr. Morgan) has been speaking with his tongue in his cheek.

Galvanized iron might cost £50 a ton but for the existence of the Australian works. It might even rise to the price it reached, during the war period. There should be a greater standardization of prices in this country. We are tending in that direction in connection with our sugar, butter, and other in dustries. Surely no honourable member will charge the present Government with not. having treated our primary industries fairly . In order to assist the wheat-growing industry, the Government introduced legislation, to provide for a guaranteed price of 4s. 6d, a bushel for wheat. The Government is not to blame for that measure not being on the statute-book. If it is urged that the Government could not have financed the guarantee, I reply that that was the concern of the Government, not of those who opposed its legislation. I give the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Morgan) credit for having supported the bill for the creation of a wheat pool; but I ask him who was responsible for killin g that measure. Had. that bill been agreed to, the wheat growers of Australia would have received 4s. 6d. a bushel for their wheat last year, in which case they surely would have been prepared to pay an. Australian price for their galvanized iron. This year the wheat-growers will get a bounty of 6d. a bushel for their wheat; but what assistance wil l the wool-grower receive? The wool-grower realizes that Australian market is the market for his wool. My policy is to get our people back again into work, so that they may regain, purchasing power which will enable them to buy the products of our primary in dustries. W it h 400,000 workers unemployed, a big market is lost to our p r i mary producers. We suffer not so much from, over-production as from under-; consumption, because of the^loes of purchasing power. Some honourable members are prepared to close up the works of Lysaght Limited, because the galvanized iron manufactured there costs from £1 to £1 10s. a ton more than the price at which galvanized iron could be imported. Surely there are enough unemployed in our midst now without throwing a further 1,000 men on the labour market! A new industry which is developing rapidly in Australia should provide a market ""for the product manufactured by Lysaght Limited. The . growers of tobacco will require large quantities of galvanized iron for their curing kilns. Surely those growers do not expect to get Australian prices for their tobacco and to buy their requirements at prices which operate in China!",44
147,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,No galvanized iron is imported from China.,45
148,Mr RIORDAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"M o s t of the galvanized iron which is imported comes from England, which prefers to buy wheat fro m Russia instead of from Australia.",45
149,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Englan d gives us a preference in the case of dried fruits .,45
150,Mr RIORDAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is because dried f r u it s cannot be obtained more cheaply elsewhere. If dried f r u it s or butter could be obtained more cheaply from Russia than from Australia, the order would go to Russia.  preference in the case of dried f r u it s .",45
151,Mr RIORDAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That may be so; but it would disappear if dried fruits could be obtained more cheaply elsewhere. It ill becomes the founder of the Paterson butter scheme to advocate that galvanized iron should be sold in Australia at overseas prices.,45
152,Mr NAIRN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Australia receives £12,000,000 a year for her butter, but the nothing for her galvanized iron. best Mr Riordan - Australia n consumers pay more for their butter than is received for it overseas. ",45
153,Mr RIORDAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The very people who encouraged the estabtishinent of the galvanized iron-making industry in Australia would now destroy it in order that the farmers of Australia might receive galvanized iron at a slightiy reduced price. They admit-that the farmers are not in a position to buy iron because of the low price received for their wheat last year. The lowness of the price is due to the action of the Opposition, which, while wanting protection for primary industries, is not prepared to give any protection to secondary industries. In order that galvanized iron might be procured for £1 a ton less than it now costs, honourable members opposite would be prepared to throw 1,000 men out of work at Newcastle and 700 more at Iron Knob.",45
154,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Balaclava) [5.59] - The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. Riordan) endeavoured to show that an effort is being made to destroy the galvanized iron-making industry in Australia. Nothing of the kind is being attempted. On many occasions in this chamber.I have supported protectionist duties; because I have felt that the industry concerned merited my support. Honourable members may recall that I supported the proposed duties on steel, because I considered the iron and steel industry to be a key industry. I pointed out that in a time of crisis Australia might need such an industry. I urged, however, that the Tariff Board should inquire into the costs of production, because I regarded the high prices charged for steel as a burden on other secondary industries. That applies particularly to the manufacture of agricultural implements. If the price of steel were reduced considerably, the prices of those implements would be much lower than they are. This company buys bars for the manufacture of iron sheets from the principal steel companies. It is said that unless the proposed duty is granted, a large number of men will be thrown out of work. I contend, however, that no protection at all is needed at the moment. There is an exchange rate which is in the vicinity of 30 per cent., a 10. per cent, primage duty, a sales tax, and shipping, and other overseas charges, which give to the industry all the protection that it needs. The duty being on an ad valorem basis, operates on a 5 per cent, higher basis than would appear from the schedule. The industry already has the protection of a reasonable duty, and it is only because the Government is now proposing what is unreasonable for the protection of this monopoly that I am opposed to it. I am a supporter of protective duties for the encouragement of any Australian industry, and am also in favour of the imposition of duties for revenue purposes; but when a government goes so far as in Sydney? to make duties prohibitive, thus destroying all competition, and allowing monopolies to grow up, I cannot see my way to support it. Costs of production must be investigated during periods of depression, and no attempt should be made to bolster up artificial industrial conditions. Considerable stress has been laid on the fact that galvanized iron is required by settlers. The Tariff Board in its excellent report has drawn attention to that aspect of the matter, and has also pointed out that the building industry is suffering very acutely from the existing depression, and that its revival will depend largely on whether costs are reduced. 1 draw the attention of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) to thai paragraph in the report. The board also says The advantages of u low price for galvanized iron as an important contribution to such a reduction are st> obvious us not to require emphasizing. That is unanswerable. Anybody who is acquainted with business enterprise* knows that the turnover of firms that are associated with the building industry has dropped by at least 50 per cent, in the last, two years. The Tariff Board says that costs have to come down.",46
155,Mr MARTENS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Wage s have to be reduced-that is the policy of the honourable member.,46
156,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No . I am opposing a monopoly, not the workers, as honourable members opposite allege. There has beeD an enormous dwindling of the turnover of all kinds of businesses', but particularly in the building trade. That is emphasized in the report of the Tariff Board. This company, according to the report, has made substantial profits. If it cannot make a profit now on account of the shares that have been issued by way of compensation for patents and' goodwill-upo n which the Tariff Board has commented adversely-it , like any other company, must cut its costs: by wage reduction, administratively, in regard to distribution, or in any other way. Parliaments do not exist for the purpose of seeing that certain companies that are monopolies make profits while other companies are unable to do so.",46
157,Mr RIORDAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,How much galvanized iron was used on the Commonwealth Bank,46
158,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member should know that most modern city structures are of concrete, and that structural steel is used in them. Galvanized iron is used in connection with the houses of the poorer people, who cannot afford tiled roofs. The honourable member and others who think as he does would keep up the price of galvanized iron to the detriment of those poorer people. Broadly speaking, the report of the Tariff Board shatters any arguments that might be advanced to prove that galvanized iron is not necessary for the construction of the homes of the poorer people. essentially a New South Wales industry, its operations being confined to that. State, which is the mad daughter of the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, that eccentric daughter happens to be the oldest and the most extravagant. Because of the blight of Langism, it is pulling down not only the other States, but also the Coinnionwealth. This company is endeavouring to carry on under uneconomic conditions, which do not prevail in other States-wit h such phantasies, for example, as a 44-hour week. It is expected that the Parliament of the Commonwealth will make allowance for such eccentricities, and impose higher duties. T do not believe that parliaments should function in that way. They should attend to the government of the country, and not, endeavour to boost a monopoly. Tariff Board says that in the present circumstances, it considers that, in arriving at what must be regarded as reasonable profit, such share capital as is represented by payment for goodwill, &c, should not be taken into consideration. saysThis issue of shares is open to criticism, when it is remembered that all the share capital is virtually held by ' a nd all ultimately reach John Lysaght Limited, firisiol. I consider that I have proved that there is no danger of overseas competition, and i hat the question is merely one of bringing down production co3ts. The Minister quoted a mass of figures that evidently had been supplied to him, showing that German iron could be dumped into Great Hritain at a certain price. He quoted one type of iron or steel that was being sold in Germany at £7 a ton, whioh could be dumped in Great Britain at £3 a ton. That statement is not relevant to this discussion, and I believe that it was introduced only in order to confuse. The problem it relates to is one for Great Britain herself to solve, and the new National Government in that country will deal with it and similar troubles by means of a tariff that will be protective, as well as revenue producing. The Minister is quite aware, as must be those honourable members who are at all acquainted with customs matters, that, if any country endeavoured This is to dump steel or other goods into Australia, the duty would be calculated, not on the export price, but on the domestic value of the goods. Consequently, even if it were possible to send bar or sheet steel to Australia, the duty would be chargeable on the domestic price in the country of origin.",47
159,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It would be very difficult to exercise a check if the bars were sent to England and finished there.,47
160,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Every invoice from overseas must state the proportion that is substantially of British manufacture; therefore, in that matter our industries are safeguarded. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), in a characteristic speech, said that an effort was being made to force down wages, and The challenged those honourable members who sit on this side to show how much more work could be given by a reduction of wages.",47
161,Mr MABTENS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It never is. It also Mr WHITE - If the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Martens) is a reasonable man, and is prepared to consider the matter without, bias, I shall be pleased to discuss it with him at any profits time, because 1 consider that, in the present case, thisis a way in which unemployment may be alleviated. In some Arbitration Court awards, and in most of the wages board determinations in Victoria, provision is made for the payment of time and a half for broken time.",47
162,Mr LEWIS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That is not true in relation to federal awards.,47
163,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It applies in the engineering trade.,47
164,Mr LEWIS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Nonsens e !,47
165,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lewis) was for years the secretary of an industrial organization, and should be aware of the facts; but, as he is not, I shall produce to him a number of awards, so as to prove that my contention is correct. If a man is employed casually the employer has to pay him a loaded rate.",48
166,Mr LEWIS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is for casual labour, not for broken time.",48
167,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member may call it what he likes, but the fact remains that a man who. is employed for two or three days has to be paid at the higher rate.",48
168,Unknown,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to S p.m.,48
169,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I was pointing out that there is no likelihood of this industry being disturbed by dumping, and as it is a monopoly internal competition also is absent. The manufacturers of galvanized iron, must as all other industrialists are doing, face facts and reduce their production costs. This does not mean, as some honourable members are too ready to suspect, an attack on wages; production costs cover a wide field. Other industries which have suffered a big diminution of income have had to adjust themselves to the economic circumstances of the times; the well-protected manufacturers of galvanized iron must, do likewise. Unemployment does not necessarily follow wage reduction. No honourable member will deny that lower prices attract business, and those firms which are writing down costs and cutting prices are getting the greatest share of trade today. Wages are no more sacrosanct than prices. am quite as desirous as any other honourable member or private citizen of helping the unemployed, back to work, and for that reason I submit two suggestions for ameliorating the conditions of industry, aud placing more men in employment. I mentioned that in most of the Wages Board awards in Victoria, and in some of the awards of the Federal Arbitration Court, there is provision that for casual work time and a half rates shall be paid. To my amazement two honourable members opposite, both of whom have been union secretaries, denied that. I quote, from the determination of the wholesale Grocers Board in Victoria, a clause which is in nearly every award in that State, except, perhaps, that for the transport industryTime rate - Any person employed on time wages for less than the number of hours fixed for an ordinary week's work, shall for each hour worked up to 24 hours, be paid at the ordinary wages rate with an addition of 50 per cent. [Quorum formed.]",48
170,Mr LEWIS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The object of that was to secure payment for holidays.,48
171,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If the honourable member is still unconvinced, I quote'clause 8Picnic Day - Doubl e time shall be paid for all work done in the metropolitan district on the second Saturday in February provided that the union hold their annual picnic on that day. Luxuries of this kind which are provided for by awards could very well be dispensed with for the time being. They make it difficult to give work to men who badly need it. Many employers wpuld give casual work to men for two or three days. I refer particularly to the big departmental stores in Melbourne.",48
172,Mr KEANE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Mentio n one.,48
173,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I have a definite assurance on that point by Edments.,48
174,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Mr MCGRATH) Can the honourable member connect these remarks with the item of galvanized iron?,48
175,Mr WHITE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am drawing attention to some of the conditions which increase the cost of producing galvanized iron, and it is because this is essentially a New South Wales industry",48
176,Mr WATKINS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is the honourable member's objection. I Mr WHITE - Ne w South Wales is the mad State of the Commonwealth at present, and has been the most extravagant. Must we continue to endure such extravaganee and the eccentricities of Mr Lang? If ho chooses to repudiate the debts of his State, the other States are expected to pay them; if he persists with fantastic ideas, the Commonwealth is expected to concur. In addition to lopping off some of the more extravagant conditions which are imposed upon industry, I suggest that the bagic wage should apply at 23 years of age instead of 21 years. It is theoretically based on a certain standard of comfort for a man, wife, and three children. The supposition that a. man of 21 has a family of three, shows a confusion of ethics with economics. In some awards in Victoria the basic wage and adult rates do not apply to persons under 23 years of age, and that means that young men, instead of being thrown out of employment when they attain their majority, preference being given to men of 30 or 40 years, who are more experienced, can retain their jobs and continue their training, rising by gradual increments to the standard wage. In a time of depression employers and employees alike must be reasonable, put aside class bias, and collaborate to remove some of the shackles from industry. Our trouble at the present time is primarily due to industrial and economic disequilibrium. Price levels in the primary industries have been forced down by world-wide influences, but the extravagant levels in the secondary industries still continue. The depression will not pass in a moment. It cannot be dissipated by either a policy of inflation to increase the purchasing power of the community, as the Treasurer suggests, or by excessive borrowing. If we continue to be hampered by inflexible wage laws, which do not allow industrial conditions to adjust, themselves in accordance with the operation of economic laws, the depression will continue. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) made a plea for Russia. He said that we have to put up with the competition of that country, because it had repudiated its international debts, and, therefore, was in a position to undersell all other countries. Such logic might appeal to a fraudulent insolvent who, having robbed his creditors, sets up in opposition to other traders who have been honest, or to a burglar who, having stolen his goods, can afford to sell at cut prices. But it should not have the approval of anybody who is honest, and it is certainly not a policy to be supported by any Australian parliament. ]for the reasons I have stated, I shall support the first part of the amendment moved by the honourable member for  pared to support any reasonable duties for the protection of Australian industry or for revenue purposes; but I am certainly not a prohibitionist. I am not prepared to block all international trade channels and allow the present state of economic disequilibrium to continue. 3 exhort those from whose lips we have heard only fantastic trade union shibboleths to recognize that the depression has hit everybody, and that men are unemployed because it is not profitable to employ them. If honourable members opposite will face the facts, they will not support the further protection of what is already a well-entrenched monopoly, but will vote for the amendment, which is in accordance with the recommendation by the Tariff Board.",48
177,Mr LONG,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Lang) [8.13] - It is true, as the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) said, that the galvanized iron industry is situated in Newcastle. New South Wales; but it is still an Australian industry, and, therefore, the Government is justified in opposing the amendment. It is a noteworthy fact that most of the arguments advanced by the members of the Opposition were concerned with wages, the Tariff Board's report, and the excessive cost of galvanized iron to the user. It is significant that honourable members opposite have not uttered one word as to the unemployment that would result from the lifting of these duties, so allowing the cheap products from overseas to compete with our own industry. Much has been said with regard to the proposed duty of £5 10s. a ton. That duty is precisely equivalent to the original bounty of £4 10s., plus the protective duty of £1 per ton that was granted to the industry on the 1st January, 1930. As a matter of fact, the proposed duty is only 18s. per ton higher than the protection afforded to the industry by a previous government. In being so eager to remove this protective duty, and allow into the country an imported article against which we could not compete, honourable members opposite have lost sight of the evils of unemployment that would follow such a course. The absorption of our unemployed is one of the greatest problems now facing the country. The Government has no means of absorbing these unfortunates', as it does not control any industries. It is endeavouring to do the next best thing-to give all Australian industries adequate tariff protection against overseas competition. At page 5 of the Tariff Board's report, I find these remarksThe industry is of groat importance to Australia in that it is productive of a large amount of labour. Practically all the raw materials used are of Australian origin, and a very large percentage of their cost is the result of expenditure on labour. A little further on the report continuesAustralia's normal requirements of over 100,000 tuns per annum would, if made in Australia, result in the distribution of wages amounting to over £1,000,000 per annum. This afternoon the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) expressed the desirability of our fostering an export trade in this commodity. It would be interesting to know just what was at the hack of the honourable gentleman's mind regarding the standard of living that he visualized in this country as the result of the plan that he proposed. Following arc the duties levied on galvanized iron in different countriesof the world:United States of America 4 7 0 France .. . . 4 0 8 Italy .. 0 13 C Argentine .. Brazil India . . 5 0 0 Canada imposes a duty of 15 per cent. British and 25^ per cent, foreign, while the South African rates are free British, 3 per cent, foreign. In Canada, black sheets for galvanizing are admitted free, and consequently the protection needed is considerably less than if a duty were imposed on those sheets. Galvanized iron is not manufactured in South Africa, but adequate protection is promised directly the local manufacture is begun. In. all of the countries mentioned by me the wages in the galvanized iron industry are lower, and the hours longer, than those obtaining in New South ""Wales, or any other State in Australia. In India, which has the cheapest labour in the world, the duty has recently been increased to £5 per ton to give adequate protection to the steel industry there. In view of those figures, I submit that a preferential duty of £5 10s. a ton in Australia is more than reasonably justified. One must also consider this industry its relation to other industries. employs 1,000 men directly, while additional 1,500 men are engaged Mr Long. the production of the steel, zinc, aeid and other necessary raw materials, and in the mining of the coal used in all stages of manufacture. The livelihood of these 2,500 men and their dependants is entirely due to the continuance of the galvanized iron industry. With all due respect to the opinions expressed by honourable members opposite with regard to the interests of primary producers, I ask them should not some consideration be given to the interests of those whose existence depends upon the continuance of the galvanized iron industry in Australia? Should an inadequate tariff make it impossible for the industry to continue, the general production costs of such concerns as the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited, and the Electrolytic Zinc Company Limited, would be seriously affected by the loss of orders for steel, zinc, and other commodities. It has been said by honourable member* Per ton. opposite during this debate that, by pro£ s. d. posing these duties, the Government is bolstering up a combine. I remindthem of the attitude of their party when in 7 12 0 power; how it preserved the monopolistic 8 15 0 rights of importers prior to the inauguration of this industry in Australia in 1921. Honourable members opposite maintain a discreet silence upon that aspect of the subject. I contend that the Government is sincere in its endeavour to provide a modicum of employment by giving this valuable industry adequate protection. It is estimated that, upon full-time production, at least £750,000 would be distributed annually in wages by this industry, of which approximately £300.000 would be paid directly by John Lysaght (Australia) Limited, Newcastle. Since the establishment of this firm's works in 1921 it has distributed nearly £3,000,000 in wages, directly and indirectly. That, money is still circulating in Australia. Had the industry not beeD established here, the money would have gone abroad. With the whole of the plant operating on full-time production, these works could turn out 80,000 tons of galvanized sheets per annum, or more than twice the present consumption of the Commonwealth-. The manufacture of in this quantity of galvanized sheets would It require approximately 84,000 tons of an steel, 12,000 tons of zinc, and 4,000 tons in of acid, while over 200,000 tons of coal would be used every year in all the stages of manufacture, from the mining of the iron ore to the completion of the finished product. Since their inception, the works have manufactured over 200,000 tons of galvanized iron. It is estimated that the quantity of galvanized iron being used in Australia at present is only about 30,000 tons per annum, or considerably less than half the present capacity of the works. Previous governments promised the industry adequate protection, so a precedent is not being created by the proposed duties. ""When the initial arrangements for the establishment of the works were made in 1918, a promise was given by the then Federal Government that sufficient protection would be granted to the industry, and, in its report of July, 1926, the Tariff Board recommended that when the works were in a position to supply the requirements of Australia, duties of £5 10s. British preferential; £6 10s., intermediate; and £7 10s. foreign, should be imposed. The real difficulty of the Australian iron and steel industry is the keen overseas competition in finished products which are manufactured extensively from raw and semi-manufactured material. That competition emanates principally from the United Kingdom. The iron and steel products against which Australia has to compete have a distinct advantage in that they are the production of long hours and exceedingly low wages. In connection with this, it is true that the conditions to qualify for the British, preference rate have been lifted from 25 per cent, wages, and raw materials to 75 per cent., but owing to the certification in the invoice sheets not being subscribed, to by principals, but any other person, the door is opened irresponsible declarations. The following figures, supplied by management of the Broken Hill Propense prietary Limited, Newcastle, are interestare ing. They show that the following quanmately tities of ore were produced in Australia for the years specified:November, 1026 .. 581,202 November, 1927 .. .. 727,418 November, 1028 .. .. 540,224 November, 1929 .. 849,348 November, 1930 .. .. 1,002,713 The total production for the five-year period was 3,709,995 tons, and the metal contents of iron and manganese amounted to 65 per cent. We should embrace every opportunity to afford protection to an industry that uses such large quantities of Australia's natural resources. It can be truthfully stated that at the very least, 75 per cent, of the tonnage to which I have referred was used in Australia in the secondary stages of the iron and steel iudustry, the other 25 per cent, being exported, so proving an asset to Australia by assisting to right our adverse trade balance. Honourable members will note the great increase in the production of iron ore for the year 1930 as compared with 1926. This was - due principally to the action of the present Government, in relieving'the company, under a recent act, of special taxation on sales overseas of the products of an Australian industry. I am given to understand that the action of this Government made it just possible for the company to establish a sale3 organization overseas. Unfortunately, the export trade in iron ore, which held great promise of expansion towards the end of 1930 has fallen away, owing to the dumping of large quantities of iron ore produced in Bussia and sold to the United States of America, and certain European States at less than the cost' of production. That has had the effect of stopping further exportation from Australia for the present. I have no hesitation in whole-heartedly supporting this endeavour of the Government to protect a valuable Australian industry, and I sincerely trust that, with its further development, it will assist to absorb some of our unemployed.",49
178,Mr NAIRN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Perth) [8.29] - The by honourable member for Lang (Mr Long) to has given some very fine figures as to the distribution of wages and so on at the Newcastle. That has all been at the exof the consumers of Australia, who paying for galvanized iron approxitwice the amount that would be paid if we had no such industry in Australia. I am sure that no one on Tons . this side wishes to close up or injure that Australian industry, but We do contend that it could be properly carried on at a niuch lower cost to the community than is' the case at present. I desire to answer some of the criticism levelled against the Tariff Board. It was alleged that the board had gone out of it's way to make a voluntary suggestion that wages should be reduced. I have read the report, and it contains no such suggestion. The board recommended that no further duty should be imposed, and did so on the basis of a selling price of £24 9,s. 5d. for galvanized iron being a fair one. In arriving at that figure, the board made it clear that it was working on the basis of the continuance of the existing rates of wages. It went on to point out that wages had been reduced by 10 per cent, in some industries, and that it was possible that a similar reduction would be made in the iron and steel industry, in which case there should be a reduction of 15s. 6d. a ton in the price which the board considered to be a fair selling price for galvanized iron. The board went no further than that, and at no time suggested that wages should be either lower or higher. In the circumstances, I think that something in the nature of an amende is clue from the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) to the members of the board. The board's report has been adversely, and, I think, unfairly criticized by the Minister. The report, on the face of it, is extremely fair, and, as regards Lysaght Limited, even generous, because the board has declared that that firm should be maintained in such a position that it may continue to provide an adequate return on the capital invested. In ""my opinion, it is not the duty of this Parliament to legislate so that Lysaght Limited, or any other firm, may obtain an adequate return on its capital. The majority of firms in Australia today are not obtaining an adequate return on their capital, and it is not right that such a return should be assured to this company at the continued expense of the consumers of iron in Australia. The board's report did not suit the Minister, and he adopted the very unusual course of appointing two auditors to make an independent inquiry. Of course, it was the business of those officers to discover arguments in opposition to the Tariff Board's con-* elusions. That was what the Minister set them to do. Mr 'Nairn.",51
179,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I deny that. The officers received no instructions exoept to investigate the facts. One of them was an officer of the Auditor-General's Department.,52
180,Mr NAIRN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Why did not the Minister refer the matter back to the Tariff Board, which is itself an independent body? The board made a report with which the Minister disagreed, so he engaged officers to make another report. What duty were those officers expected to perform ? If they could not find material which would be available for criticism of the board, their report would be useless. The Minister would not have wanted them.",52
181,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,All we wanted was the facts.,52
182,Mr NAIRN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Minister already has at his disposal an independent and expensive body in the Tariff Board to investigate questions of this kind. It was grossly improper for the Minister, when he received a Tariff Board report which did not suit him, to instruct officers to make another-report. It was stated by the Minister that this industry was still in its infancy, and required nursing. Surely it is time the industry grew up. It was first granted assistance in 1922, and it was then thought that a bounty of £2 10s. a ton would be sufficient to enable it to become established. That protection has now been increased to over £14 a ton. The industry has received in direct payments by way of bounty £469,000 of the taxpayers' money. That is a disgrace to Australia. Besides this assistance, the industry has enjoyed virtually a monopoly of the business in Australia. The Tariff Board, in its report, points out that natural conditions are most favourable to the establishment of the industry. It would appear, states the report, that there are few industries more capable of successful establishment in Australia than the galvanized iron industry, on account of the rich natural deposits of ore, coal and zinc, and the relatively big market foT a product in which little variety is needed. In the circumstances, the industry, one would imagine, should be in a flourishing condition at the present time. Certainly it ought to be able to look after itself without excessive protection. Nevertheless, we find that the price of galvanized iron to the public today is £29 a ton in Australia, as compared with £13 a ton for English iron.",52
183,Mr WATKINS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Where does the honourable member get the figure of £29 a ton?,53
184,Mr NAIRN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Fro m the current quotations in the newspapers. When the board made its report in April, the price was £28 10s. a ton, and it is now £29.",53
185,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The present list price is £28 10s. a ton.,53
186,Mr NAIRN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The equivalent price of English iron is £13 a ton - Is the industry worth maintaining at the price we have to pay for it ? This is a characteristic industry, because all the operations associated with it are performed in Australia, and the whole of the excessive cost, is due to the artificial conditions which we have built up in this country. These high costs are not confined to wages, nor, indeed, to charges incurred in the running of Lysaght's factory. They include the wages and overhead ---oats in that factory, but they are contributed to, also, by excessive costs at Iron Knob in South Australia, and the cost of obtaining zinc in Tasmania, the ciist of conveying the ore and zinc to Newcastle, and the cost of coal and steel. This afternoon the Treasurer was asked whether anything could be done to obtain relief from the burden of exchange on payments made by Australia overseas. He replied that there was no way of obtaining relief from this burden while the present difference existed between the price levels obtaining in Australia and in other countries, and between the value «f our currency and that of other countries. Precisely the same thing applies in respect to our industries. It is impossible to establish industries in this country on a sound basis while price levels in this country are so much higher than in other countries, and while the value of our currency is so much less than that of other countries. We can obtain little if any relief from the arbitration courts. Tn the case of Lysaght Limited, wages comprise Vmly 23 per cent, of the cost of manufacturing galvanized iron. Arbitration courts are powerless to reduce the costs which comprise the other 67 per cent. Other industries, such as coal and zinc, are responsible for most of the costs, and with those the Arbitration Court, when dealing with .an application in regard to Lysaght Limited, would have nothing to do. The court is limited to consideration of one industry at a time, and then only to the wages, paid in that industry. It is impossible for the Arbitration Court, even if so disposed, to give effective relief to the industry as a whole. Then there is another point in regard to these bolstered up industries which enjoy a monopoly. So long as they continue to enjoy a monopoly they can pay the high costs with which the industry is loaded, and while they can do this, the Arbitration Court is loth to interfere. The court is not prone to put the interests of the public first. The question generally directed to the court is, "" What can the industry stand ?"" and so long as an industry enjoys a monopoly as this one does, it caD afford to pay the excessive wages demanded. While an industry is bolstered up by embargoes and high protective duties, it is practically impossible to obtain any substantial measure of relief through the Arbitration Court. It is possible, however, to obtain relief through the tariff. Here we can start at the root of the trouble, because there is no doubt that the high costs associated with Australian industry are due largely to the incidence of the tariff, which affects, not only the particular industry under consideration, but all those with which it is allied. This Parliament should not listen to manufacturers who produce figures, showing that they are not making profits, and cannot get along with less protection than they are receiving. Let us fix a fair selling price for products, and then tell the manufacturers that they must sell at that price if they wish to receive protection.",53
187,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member believes in price-fixing? ,53
188,Mr NAIRN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"For industries which receive tariff protection, I do. If Lysaght Limited, would undertake to sell its product at £25 a ton, I would not care how much protection it received. Industry would not die out if such action were taken. Firms would find ways and means of carrying on, just as those in unprotected industries are finding means of meeting the adverse conditions today. If we cut out protection unless the price of galvanized iron were reduced to £25 a ton, it would, of course, necessarily affect the allied industries associated with the production of coal, zinc and steel; but prices in those industries must come down too. The consumers cannot be expected to carry the whole of the steel industry, together with its allied industries, for au indefinite period. In the past, a great deal of galvanized iron was used in the cities, but the building of houses in the cities has now almost ceased, with the result that practically all the galvanized iron sold today goes to country users. I ask honourable members to compare the position of those engaged in most rural industries today with the workers in Lysaght's factory. If we make such a comparison we shall see that there is no justification for this attempt to keep Lysaght Limited in its present favourable position. The Tariff Board has endeavoured to effect a compromise. It has shown that the industry at present enjoys sufficient protection to enable it to carry on profitably. Therefore, I ask the committee to support the recommendation of the Tariff Board.",53
189,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Warject ringah) [8.45] - Unde r cover of what I regard and what is generally admitted to be a laudable object, namely, the establishment of the iron and steel industry Australia, the Government is, in my opinion, engaged in a huge conspiracy with the employers and employees in this industry to secure wholly unwarranted tariff concessions at the expense of the general public. Mr G. RILEY - I rise to a point order. I submit that the honourable Tariff Board?  not in order in suggesting that the Minister or the Government is engaged in conspiracy with the employers and emprestige ployees to secure tariff concessions. remark is objectionable, is without dation, and is offensive to me as a supBoard porter of the Government. I , therefore, ask that he be called upon to",54
190,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Mr MCGRATH) I call upon the honourable member for Warringah to withdraw the word "" conspiracy "".",54
191,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL," Very well, Mr Chairman, I shall do so. No one objects to the establishment of the iron and steel industry in Australia if the proposals for its encouragement are reasonable. But in some quarters there appears to be an impression that if the industry can secure the ear of the Minister for Trade aud Customs, and the sympathetic consideration of Government supporters, who never attempt to justify any of the duties that are proposed, it is entitled to ask for whatever tariff duties it likes, regardless of the effect of such protection upon other industries in the Commonwealth. That is what is being done in this instance. I am convinced that if the Minister had, at the outset, intimated that Lysaght Limited must be satisfied with the duties recommended by the Tariff Board, that company would very speedily have reconsidered its position and have been prepared to carry on with that measure of protection. I , for one, am not prepared to sit in this Parliament and see the genera] public penalized to the extent contemplated in this tariff item without entering ray protest against the duties proposed by the Minister. I regard the report of the Tariff Board upon this subas eminently fair, bearing on the face of it evidence of the meticulous care exercised by the board in arriving at its deciin sion. Its recommendations might very well have been accepted by the Minister. But the honourable gentleman did not adopt that course. In his treatment of its report he has been exceeding his treatment of the Tariff Board's recommenda- tions. Mr C. RILEY - When did the honorof able member become the champion of the",54
192,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I a am championing more particularly the of every public servant of the The Commonwealth. If I do not agree with founthe recommendations of the Tariff I say so quite openly, as honourable members well know. In this instance, I withdraw it. approve of its report. Mr Foams - Nevertheless , the honourable member objects when the Minister disagrees with the recommendations of the board.",54
193,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL," The Minister has disagreed with so many of the recommendations of that body that it would be mere reiteration on my part to constantly refer to tariff items which he has introduced at variance with views expressed by the board. In this case, no one can deny that the right course for the Minister to adopt, if he disagreed with its recommendations, was to ask the board to reconsider its decision. Instead of doing that, he secured the services of an officer of his department-on e who, of course, was perfectly unbiased, and with whom the Minister had no prior interview, but who, nevertheless, would be fully cognizant of what was required of him.",55
194,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I did not do that.,55
195,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Of course not! The Minister also selected another official from the Auditor General's Department. ""Promiscuouslike "" he looked down the list of officers and, without suggesting what was required of him, selected one man haphazard, and instructed him to make an investigation.",55
196,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"As a' matter of fact, I allowed the Comptroller-General of Customs to select the two men.",55
197,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"We are asked to believe that the Minister did not inform these officers what they had to do. Probably he thought that they would know perfectly well what was required of them, and apparently they did the job very well, indeed.",55
198,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member is doing a grave injustice to two respected public servants.,55
199,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am not. Apparently, the officers in question did their work very well, because the Minister entirely disregarded the report Tariff Board, and in the course of his remarks he quoted their criticism of the board's recommendations. It may be of interest to honourable members to know that whole "" slabs "" of statements which the Minister read from the report of these two officers had been issued by John Lysaght Limited as propaganda in support of the company's claim for these higher duties. No reasonable person can regard this procedure as fair. I enter my protest against the [4] way in which the Tariff Board has been treated in this matter. Its report has been entirely, overridden by the report of other officers, and its recommendations stultified and more' or less ridiculed by the Minister, whose clear duty is to protect it. Exception was taken just now to my statement that the three parties to this arrangement were engaged in a conspiracy to secure these higher duties at the expense of the general public, so I shall not use the word in question at this juncture, but it is clear that these three sections are working together in perfect harmony to secure a certain definite object at the expense of the people. That is what I mean. Honor-; able members can call it what they choose. It is obvious that manufacturers, believing they have the Minister and the government supporters on their, side, ask for twice as much as they expect to get. Let us examine the position of the company. On page 15 of the Tariff Board's report there appears the following:- . The share capital of 'Lysaghts Newcastle Works Limited is £936,059, and is held by John Lysaght, Bristol, and John Lysaght (Australia) Limited. The bulk of the shares in the latter company is held 'by John Lysaght Limited, Bristol, which means, in effect, that the Newcastle company is owned by John Lysaght Limited, Bristol. In the absence of shareholders other than Lysaght (Bristol) and Lysaght (Newcastle), where is the justification for crediting £500,000 worth of capital to John Lysaght Limited (Bristol), and what justification is there for the imposition of duties that will ensure a profit not on the capital actually engaged in the business, but on that amount of capital plus £500,000 of watered stock in the of the nanne of the British company? The people of Australia should not be penalized by these higher duties. I have been asked to say that this is not a conspiracy. If it is not, I have no hesitation in saying that it is one of the biggest "" ramps"" ever attempted in this Parliament in connection with tariff matters. If the whole of the capital of approximately £1,000,000 were Australian money actually engaged in jthe business something might be said for the claim that these duties were desirable for the building up of the industry; but even then no one could argue with any justification that the concern would be entitled to ask the Minister for tariff protection which would guarantee to it interest and sink, ing fund to the extent of 1 per cent. The Minister and other members of the Government have argued on previous occasions that it is the duty of Parliament to fix such rates of duty as will ensure to this industry a sufficient return to enable it to pay interest on the capital invested in it, irrespective of any considerations of efficiency, watered capital, or rates of wages. Apparently the general public has no right to expect any consideration in these matters. The price of galvanized iron is to be fixed, for the present at any rate, at from £28 to £31 a ton, in order that interest may be paid on £500,000 worth of dead capital or nominal capital in Britain, in addition to interest on the money which is actually being used in the business in Australia. This, in my opinion, is not right. Yet a Labour Government, with the solid, though silent, support of a phalanx of Labour members, is taking this stand. Why they should do so I have a shrewd idea. that because the industry is giving employment to a number of men at high wages, the general public is to have no consideration shown to it. The employees in this industry are not to be subjected to any reduction of wages, notwithstanding that the workers in other industries have had their wages reduced by the Arbitration Court. I will not subscribe to such a policy, nor do I think the electors of Australia will do so when the matter is submitted to them for decision. The Tariff Board made a caref u l investigation into the position of the employees of this industry, and on page 20 of its report it points out thatThe recent decisions of the Federal Arbitrain tion Court reducing the wages in many industries by 10 per cent, suggest the possibility of an extension of this method of affording relief to other secondary industries. Whilst not anticipating the reduction of 10 per cent, in wages in the galvanized iron industry, the board has, however, considered the effect on prices if such a reduction should be made in the future. The report goes on to say thatThe average wage for a full week's work in the production of sheet bars for galvanized Mr Archdale Parkhill. iron manufacturing is £5 l is . 2d. The average wage for full-time employment in the galvanized iron industry itself is £6 9s. Id. At present the employees in this industry are working part time and their average earnings are much lower. Whilst this is an equitable method of distributing the ' wages available, it fails to effect any savings in actual costs of production. Since that report was made there has been a reduction of 10 per cent, in wages generally, but it has not had effect in this industry.",55
200,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The industry is not working under a federal award.,56
201,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I could quote the evidence of Mr Lightfoot 'Walker in support of my statement. He made it clear that the industry is unaffected by such reductions. Surely no honourable member who believes in the fixation of wages by the Arbitration Court could object to the court reducing wages any more than they would object to it increasing them. Presumably, if the Labour party stands for arbitration as a method of fixing wages, it is willing to honour awards of the court which provide for reductions of wages just as it expects awards which provide for increases in wages to be honoured. It seems Mr Forde - Accordin g to the report Mr Lightfoot Walker said, ""The industry was not affected by the 10 per cent, reduction recently ordered by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court"". That was the statement. I made, and the honourable member said I was wrong.",56
202,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I still say that the statement made by the Minister was incorrect.,56
203,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Mr Lightfoot Walker said that the industry was not working under a federal award, and that is what I said.",56
204,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL," The Minister's interjection is irrelevant. Honourable members opposite who believe industrial arbitration must logically accept reductions as well as increases of wages ordered by the court. Surely neither the Government nor its supporters adopt the attitude that increases of wages granted by the court are all right, while decreases are all wrong.",56
205,Mr LAZZARINI,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That is the policy.,56
206,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It is a very unfair policy, and I cannot believe that it is the policy of the Government. In this industry an arrangement has been made between the employers and employees under which wages are being paid that are higher than those awarded by the Arbitration Court.",56
207,Mr RIORDAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The agreement was made at a round-table conference, such the honourable member advocates for other industries.",57
208,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL, But only two parties conferred.,57
209,Mr MAXWELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,There were only sides to the table.,57
210,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It is certain that the interests of the general public were not considered in any way. letter:The Tariff Board reported that the average wage in this industry was various £6 9s. 2d. per week.,57
211,Mr RIORDAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is that too much?,57
212,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Yes, , reduction it is, at the present time. It is above* the ruling rate of wages. Mr E. RILEY - Has the honourable member ever made an inspection of Lysaght's works?",57
213,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I cussing have not. Mr E. RILEY - And would he be willing to work there?,57
214,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I bers of the secretariat? would not, nor would I be desirous of working in a hundred other industries that I could name; but I submit that the Government is not justified in providing a high tariff to enable higher wages to be paid in the galvanized iron industry than are paid in other industries, in view of the fact that at present we have more than 300,000 - workers out employment tramping the streets of our cities looking for a job. Many of - these men have not the chance of earning employment. Is. a week. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) cannot consistently appeal for sympathetic consideration the workers generally while he advocates the granting of special conditions to the wonderful. aristocrats of labour who are employed in this industry. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley), withstanding his life-long association with Labour, has adopted an entirely taken view on this subject, as disclosed by his speech this afternoon. Honourable members have had distributed to them recently copies of a letter written by Sir Robert Gibson, to which was attached an appendix containing extracts from the report of the secretariat appointed to investigate the problem of unemployment. This secretariat was appointed by the Scullin Government, as and it is somewhat extraordinary that its views in regard to this subject are the same as my own, and entirely at variance with the views of the Government, the honourable member for Hunter, the honortwo able member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini), and the honourable member for South Sydney. The following paragraph is taken from the appendix to tha In dealing with wage reductions in the States, the secretariat points out that these have been unequal:-""The basic rate varies from £3 3s. per week of 48 hours to £4 2s. 6d. per week of 44 hours. The wage in most industries fails to lower costs sufficiently to increase employment because of the high wages still paid in other industries-suc h as coal or iron-o n which they depend."" The very industry which we are diswas condemned by the secretariat, because the wages paid in it were higher than the wages paid in other industries.",57
215,Mr LAZZARINI,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Who were the mem,57
216,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL," Mr Gepp, chairman, the honourable John Gunn, a former Labour Premier of South Australia, Senator Daly, and other choice selections made by the Government.",57
217,Mr JAMES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Were not some of those gentlemen first appointed by the Bruceparticularly Page Government?,57
218,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL," of That Government had nothing whatever to do with the appointment of the secretariat to investigate the problem of unThe secretariat was appointed by the Scullin Government, and began its work with a great flare of of trumpets. The appointment of it was announced as though it were something",57
219,Mr LAZZARINI,FEDERAL CAPITAL,A statement such as the honourable member has quoted is what notI would expect from Senator Daly.,57
220,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL, misThe honourable member was associated with Senator Daly for a long while before he found any fault with him.,57
221,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It is only fair to Senator Daly to say that the report from which the honourable member has quoted was made by the officials. Senator Daly is the Minister in charge of the secretariat.,57
222,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL," The following paragraph is also taken from the document from which I have just quoted:The secretariat strongly urges upon the ference the necessity for reducing the cost of all works undertaken, and of spreading the employment to be given by them over as many men as possible. That is another^point which I am making. It is entirely unfair that the galvanized iron industry should be granted such protection as will enable it to pay wages in' excess of those provided by Arbitration Court awards while hundreds.of thousands of men are scratching around to find a few shillings a week.",58
223,Mr LAZZARINI,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I rise to a point of order. I am reluctant to stem the flow of the honourable member's eloquence, but I ask whether he is an order in making a general tariff speech on the item now before the Chair?",58
224,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL, The honourable member's remarks are quite in order.,58
225,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL," The view taken by the Opposition, and by all the leading economists, on this subject, is sound. Nobody but a superficial thinker could imagine for a minute that there is any merit in keeping a few people employed at wages above those granted by the Arbitration Court, while 300,000 are tramping the streets of our cities without any wages at all.",58
226,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member's time has expired.,58
227,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"As no other honourable member has risen to speak, I shalltake the second half-hour to which I am entitled under the Standing orders. It is unreasonable that a limited number of men should be kept in employment in this industry at comparatively high rates of wages at the expense of other workers and the community generally. These duties are based on an application by the company and supported by its employees and the Government merely with the object of paying unfairly high wages and unduly increasing the profits of «the company at the expense of the general public. That is an unfair and unreasonable proposal, and one which the members of. this committee, who are charged; with the responsibility of representing not one section, but all sections, should not support for a moment. I should now like to refer to the way in which this company carries out the numerous conramifications of its business. I understand that it produces three grades of galvanized iron which are known as "" O r b "", ""Guinea"", and a third grade which is unbranded. The price of "" Orb "" to distributors was £27, and that of "" Guinea"" £26, while the unbranded iron, which is produced to compete with, imported iron, was sold at £19 a ton. I m mediately the new duties were imposed, the distributors in New South ""Wales were informed that no further supplies of the unbranded iron would. be available, and that the price of "" Orb "" iron was to be increased to. £31 10s. a ton, which is the price ruling today. Presumably, no unbranded iron was available because it had been branded either "" Orb "" or "" Guinea "" iron.",58
228,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Lysagh t Limited do not charge £31 10s. a ton. That is the retail price in different part's of the Commonwealth.,58
229,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The position in Queensland is somewhat different. The mills at Newcastle manufacture a certain quantity of sheets which are classed as "" defective "", and the better quality of these are classified as ""unbranded "". Soon af ter the embargo was imposed upon the importation of galvanized iron, arrangements were made that all defective sheets, and 24-gauge unbranded sheets for the Queensland market should first be offered to Brett and Company. Of course all distributors would like to obtain a proportion of these, which are quite suitable for various types of work. They are sold at very much lower prices than good sheets, and at a fair profit ""to the distributors. Since the arrangement was made, Queensland distributing houses have not had an opportunity to purchase any of these sheets until Messrs. Brett and Company have made whatever purchases they desire, and I understand they have invariably taken the lot. This one firm therefore has a monopoly of the sale of this particular class of galvanized iron which is the cheapest available. It has been pointed out by those engaged i i the trade that this is a source of great annoyance to other distributors in Queensland. Recently, a sale of 64 tons of 26gauge "" unbranded"" corrugated sheets was made to Brett and Company despite an assurance given to the merchants in Sydney that all 26-gauge unbranded iron would first be offered to them on a pro rata basis in accordance with the quantity of first grade sheets' which they purchased. These unbranded sheets are considerably better than defective sheets, have only slight blemishes, or the outside corrugation out of alignment. When available, they are sold at very much lower prices than branded sheets. In looking for a reason for this preference * being extended to Brett and Company, which has a monopoly of the sale of this type of iron, it has been ascertained from a perusal of the share register of Brett and Company that the Treasurer (Mr. Theodore) is the owner of 12,750 shares in Brett and Company.",58
230,Mr WARD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What company is that?,59
231,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL," Brett and Company, of Brisbane, who are the sole distributors of Lysaght Limited unbranded galvanized iron in Queensland.",59
232,Mr JAMES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Has the honourable mem in any company?,59
233,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL, Not in that company.,59
234,Mr MARTENS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Does the honourable member suggest that preference has been given to this company because the Treasurer is a shareholder ?,59
235,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I am not suggesting anything. I am merely stating the facts as I am entitled to do.,59
236,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Lysagh t Limited deny that any firm has been appointed its sole distributors in Brisbane.,59
237,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am leaving the committee to draw its own conclusions. I am entitled to place the facts before the committee, and honourable members can draw their own conclusions, the same as I am doing.",59
238,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Lysagh t Limited say that the contention of the honourable member for Warringah with respect to Brett and Company is absolutely untrue.,59
239,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL," They cannot say that, and the Minister can make his own speech later if he desires. We are confronted, with this extraordinary position apart from the other circumstances I have mentioned: This company which has £500,000 worth of watered capital is asking for higher duties while its employees and their offsiders in this House are bellowing for wages for the employees in the industry higher than the Arbitration Court has awarded. I intend to oppose the Government's proposal, and and to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson).",59
240,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.23] - We have listened to one of the characteristic speeches of the honourable member for  found it necessary to employ the muck rake. The honourable member, bereft of any logical argument against the imposition of higher duties on imported galvanized iron imposed by the present Government, has resorted to generalities and all kinds of misrepresentations and false statements. When I was in Brisbane recently a purchaser of galvanized iron. complained to me that certain unbranded sheets had been sold to one distributor, and that he could not obtain supplies. I asked Lysaght Limited why this had been done, and I was informed that it had not appointed any one in Queensland as its sole distributor of unbranded sheets. The statement of the honourable member for Warringah is absolutely incorrect, as unbranded iron is available to any client who requires supplies. The company's clients are all circularized as to the unbranded iron available, and any company applying for unbranded iron can obtain supplies if any are available.",59
241,Mr GABB,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Does that apply in all States?,59
242,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am assured that it does. The telegram I received from John Lysaght (Australia) Limited reads as follows :We do not sell unbranded galvanized iron exclusively to any one buyer. Our supplies of this quality are small, and arc divided, as far as possible, among distributors'. I was informed that one |Company engaged in manufacturing in Brisbane had applied for unbranded sheets, and that Brett and Company had also made an application. Lysaght Limited was ""unable to supply either firm at the time, and Brett and Company purchased a quantity from a dealer in Sydney, and the iron was afterwards sold to its clients.",59
243,Mr AECHDALE PABKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Minister seems to know all about it.,60
244,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"As a matter of fact, a manufacturer in Brisbane waited upon me and complained that he could not get any unbranded sheets. I investigated the matter, and asked the company for an explanation. This evening the honourable member for Warringah informed me that Brett and Company were able'to get supplies of unbranded sheets, while other firms were unable to do so. I have made inquiries, and find that there is not a scintilla of truth in the honourable member's statement. The position was that, Brett and Company, and other manufacturers, tried to get unbranded sheets from Lysaght Limited who were unable to supply them, but Brett and Company eventually obtained a supply from a dealer in Sydney.",60
245,Mr GABB,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Can the Minister give the name of the dealer?,60
246,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Where could they be obtained but from Brett and Company?,60
247,Mr FORDE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Lysagh t Limited have assured me that they did not confine the sale of unbranded sheets to any one firm in Brisbane. Lysaght Limited circularize their clients, any of whom can obtain supplies when they are available. The firm has its distributors throughout Australia, and its methods cannot be controlled by this Government. Lysaght Limited have business dealings with distributors throughout Australia, and I am assured that no preference is given to one distributor over another. As a matter of fact, their list price is £28 10s. a ton, and any one purchasing two tons or over, can get supplies direct from Lysaght Limited or from any of its distributors at the list price. If 25 tons or more is purchased the buyers are entitled to discounts ranging from 2^ per cent, to 7 per cent., according to the quantity purchased. I have just been informed that the dealer who sold unbranded sheets to Brett and Company was H . R. Rich and Company. That gives the lie direct to the honourable member for Warringah. The honourable member for Warringah has also taken me to task for not adopting the Tariff Board's report. He knows that the Tariff Board was appointed as an advisory body. Yet he says that I have no right to disregard the Tariff Board's recommendations. He assumes that the Tariff Board should be placed above Parliament; that is absolute^ nonsense. The first Tariff Board was appointed by the Hughes Government and the present board was specially selected by the Bruce Page Government. It comprises a representative of the primary producers, commercial interests, and of the manufacturers. I have no fault to find with the personnel of the board. For the individual members of the board I have the greatest re'spect, and I would not countenance ' any attack upon them; but they are an advisory body to me as Minister.  for Trade and Customs there was then in office a Tariff Board which had been appointed by the Bxuce-Page Govern accept the Tariff Board's recommendations in all things. He said that all matters were for him, as Minister, to decide. He. claimed that the Tariff Board should not be made superior to the ""Government and to Parliament.",60
248,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Mr. Pratten never increased the Tariff Board's recommendations, nor did he put men on to prove the board wrong.  that the Tariff Board had been appointed as an advisory body, to take evidence and to submit reports to the Minister. If the honourable member for War Minister for Trade and Customs tomorrow, he would not hesitate to disregard the report of a Tariff Board appointed by a previous administration if he considered that the Tariff Board were not right.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition rightly said that it is uneconomical to have the steel works at Newcastle and the works of Lysaght Limited working at only about one-third of their capacity.; The Government aims at giving to these factories, which are a credit to Australia, all the work which can be put their way. The iron and steel works at Newcastle supply the raw materials for a number of' manufacturing industries, one of which is the manufacture of wire by Ryland's Limited. Lysaght Limited take about one-third of the total output of the iron and steel works at Newcastle. If Lysaght Limited are forced to close their works, the price of steel rods and of the raw materials for other Australian industries will increase. Negotiations are proceeding with Stewart Lloyds for the manufacture in Australia of steel tubes. If successfully established the new industry should help the Newcastle steel works. The duty on sheet bar, which is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of galvanized iron, is £4 per ton, whereas the duty on the finished product is £5 10s. a ton. That is only a reasonable protection. It has been said that Lysaght Limited get this protecLimited, tion they will immediately reduce obtained the wages of their employees to the extent of 10 per cent. I have received from Lysaght Limited a communication stating reductions that the company is not a party to any to application for a reduction in the wages of its employees. The workers employed in the manufacture of galvanized iron must be fit physically to stand the strain of the very hard work which they are called upon to do. The rollvanized iron. ing of the red hot sheets of metal is work which justifies the payment of high wages. Those honourable members who complain that the wages are high could not stand up to such work five minutes. These men are paid piece-work rates. Never have I seen men work harder than they do. I have waited in vain for some concent, structive .criticism from honourable memincludes bers opposite. Not one logical argument has been put forward to show why the proposed duties should not be approved. Mr Forde. bers have not made any attempt to comprehend this question. Some who have addressed the committee have spoken with their tongues in their cheeks in an attempt to win favour with their constituents. The speech of the honourable member  many inaccuracies. First, he said that the list price of galvanized iron manufactured by Lysaght Limited was £29 10s. a ton. The list price is £28 10s. a ton. The manufacturers will sell to any one who buys 2 tons or more of galvanized iron at £28 10s. a ton. Although it is probably correct that the price of galvanized iron is sometimes quoted by distributors at £29 10s. a ton, the list price of Lysaght Limited is £28 10s. a ton.  Morning Herald galvanized iron is advertised at £29 10s. a ton. - Mr Forde - In an endeavour to prove that the manufacturers of galvanized iron were making exorbitant profits, the honourable member for Gippsland quoted from page 9 of the Tariff Board's report. He quoted only those portions of the report which suited his purpose when he saidThe balance-sheets and trading and profit if and loss accounts of John Lysaght (Australia) the distributing company, which were by the board, disclose that very high profits were being earned during the past three years. These trading results do not support the contention that such substantial in (United Kingdom invoice) selling prices were necessary to enable the company meet competition. The honourable member read from a portion of the report which dealt with the English company and the distributing agency in Australia for imported galComing now to the question, of profits, it is well that I should emphasize that the company is making a profit of only 9s. 3d. per ton on the galvanized iron for it sells. On an estimated output of at 30,000 tons for the current year, that represents a profit of £13,875, which is only 1.85 per cent, on the actual cash invested in the industry, and 1.1 per on an amount of £1,246,000, which the sum of £500,000 charged by the parent company in England for goodwill, &c. The profit made from the production of 30,000 tons represents only 1.85 per cent, on the actual cash invested. From 1921 to 1926 the company paid no dividends at all.",61

My stateas ment clearly indicated that in arriving at the company's cost of production cognizance was taken of the amount of £500,000 referred to, nor, indeed, of capital charge. On the subject of profits made by the company, I would again refer the honourable member to my speech wherein I quoted the conclusions arrived at by the two accountants specially tailed to make the investigation. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr. Curtin) raised certain point's. His sugdustry gestion that the bounty payment should be reverted to is, unfortunately, not ticable today, particularly in view of the present state of national finances. Bounties are paid only in the initial stages of industry. They were never intended to continue all time. On the subject of selling prices, as the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr ""Watkins) has stated, the company makes no discrimination whatever in disshameful, counts, and it will give the same terms to any purchaser of any given quantity of galvanized iron. The honourable memcourage ber for Fremantle also stated that the sonnel. present tariff rates are prohibitive. Let me inform him that importations under the present rates are still taking place,, and are selling at prices somewhat lower than the company's list price. The quanare small, but still it shows that it of is possible to import galvanized iron despite the present high tariff, and that if the duty were decreased the importations would increase, and probably 1,500 men would be thrown out of work. The employment of such a large number of men at the ' present juncture is a' consideration which honourable members 132,704 should weigh very carefully. Another v.. important point which honourable memseem to have lost sight of is that the Tariff Board assessed the selling price on an arbitrary output of 60,000 tons per yet the production has fallen to tons per annum, the overhead cost remaining practically the same as We are not entitled to as allow this industry to be driven comout of existence merely to meet the desires 'of a few honourable gentlemen who briefs for certain importing interests. The men employed in this industry and at the steel works at Newcastle are the consumers of our primary products such butter, fruit, meat, potatoes, onions, sugar, and tobacco. The honourable memno ber for Darling Downs (Mr Morgan), who was loud in his condemnation of this any increased duty, asked me a few days ago to keep out all imported canary seed, because all the seed required for Australian consumption could be produced in his electorate.

Having secured an embargo, thus preventing others from obtaining galvanized iron from overseas, the company sold at creased prices the enormous stocks that it had imported, and incidentally, made make tremendous sacrifices. enormous profits. It was a disgraceful episode. The Minister searched the report of the Tariff Board to find something for which he could condemn it.

The wheat-growers are expected to carry on at a loss so that the high standard of living enjoyed by the workers in the iron and steel industry can be maintained. The position is absurd. There should be some attempt made to bring about equality of sacrifice in this country. We should use our best efforts to assist the dustries which the Prime Minister himself has said are the backbone of this country. The wheat-growers are entitled to a fair deal, and they have taken every legitimate and constitutional step available to them in an effort to obtain some relief. They have been long suffering. This year they have planted as big a crop as their depleted exchequers would allow.

278,Mr GULLETT,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Henty) [10.15] - I propose to say a final word about the It £500,000 of watered stock which is included in the capital of the company and upon which its profits are made - The cost Minister and other honourable members not opposite appear to see nothing extraordinary in the presence of that watered capital. There would be nothing exceptional in such a payment to the parent company if all of the capital in the Australian company, or even a substantial part of it, were Australian money. The object of the British company would then be quite clear; it would be endeavouring to recover by these paid-up shares a substantial proportion of the profits earned in Australia. But the actual position is that the parent company at Bristol owns the entire interest in the Australian firm. Therefore, the issue of £500,000 worth of paid-up shares, to the parent company is not capable of any other explanation than that it is specifically for the purpose of exploiting this country through the tariff. I particularly invite the attention of the honourable member for Eremantle (Mr Curtin), whose views on the watering of capital are well known. According to the Tariff Board, the Bristol firm owns entirely the Newcastle enterprise, and, therefore, does not increase its asset by the addition' to capital of the Australian company of £500,000 worth of paid-up shares, whether in payment for patent rights or anything else; but this bogus capital puts the company in a very much stronger position to bargain with the Government and this Parliament for assistance. The £500,000 is intended to bolster up the amount of assistance which this Parliament may vote to the company either by bounty or duties. The members of the Labour party have thousands of times attacked the capitalistic system, and particularly the watering of capital. This is the most glaring instance of that practice which has ever come to the notice of the committee, and I am amazed that honourable members opposite should condone such conduct by a great firm which is a suppliant to this Parliament for assistance. The Government should insist, as a first step that the £500,000 which should never have been put into the Australian company, shall be taken out of it , and that any assistance given to the company shall be on the basis of the money actually expended on the Newcastle works. If that be done, it will be found that the protec[5] tion already granted to the company is adequate, and that the bounty paid in the past was excessive.",66

The Tariff Board when recommending the rates of duty which are indicated in the amendment of the honourable member  this committee expert and entirely disinterested advice. . Recognizing the relationship between the high protectionist policy and the creation of monopolies, I feel that it is desirable that some investigation of the prices charged by manufacturers who are assured of the local market by high duties is necessary. I find that due inquiry has been made by the Tariff Board respecting what is a fair price for this company to charge in Australia for galvanized iron. The board has fixed upon £25 a ton. Obviously, the duty operating at present is unnecessarily high, having regard to all the costs that are associated with the importation of galvanized iron from other countries. ",67
280,Mr CURTIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I repeat, it is unnecessarily high. I do not accept the contention of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) that the fate of the Government is involved in this matter. I feel that individual items of the tariff ought certainly to be considered entirely on their merits, irrespective of whether the .fate of the Government is involved or not. There surely has to be a recognition that there are certain practical considerations which govern the application of any principle. I am a protectionist, but I feel that it is imposing an undue tax upon the people of Australia to grant an excessive rate of duty in favour of this company in order to give it an absolute monopoly of the Australian market, without any possibility of competition from overseas, and without any power to limit the prices charged to the Australian public. The Tariff Board has warned us in respect of two vital aspects of this matter; first, that a duty of 110s. a ton is 20s. too high to admit of competition; secondly, that a fair price to the Australian public should not exceed £25. Last night I quoted the figure charged at Perth as £29 10s., with cartage added. Although the company claims that a uniform price is charged in each State, the fact remains that telegrams despatched to the Minister regarding the prices charged are not corroborated by the list prices quoted to the actual consumers. That appears to me to be an important element in the case. If I believed that this industry could not possibly exist, fairly and reasonably, upon the same basis of protection as that given to Australian manufacturing industries generally, I should vote for the rates of duty that the company asks for, but I am not prepared to accept the ex parte declaration of any concern. ""When the facts have been fully investigated by the Tariff Board; when a report is available to the committee which does credit to the board because of its comprehensiveness and restraint- a report covering practically every phase of importance which concerns the subject - I want something much more substantial than what I fear to be the somewhat partisan utterances that have been made in this chamber, before I , reject the reasoning of the Tariff Board. I propose to-night to make it quite manifest to the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley) that when I speak upon a tariff item for the first time, I do not do so lightly, and that it' takes very much more substantial contentions than those I have since listened to to make me alter my mind in the matter.  ment of the proposed amendment be agreed to-put .

The committee has decided what is to be the amount of duty, and, unfortunately, has fixed it at £1 a ton more all round than was recommended by the Tariff Board. The question still ' remains to be decided as to the selling-price conditions recommended by the Tariff Board as a concomitant of the duty. The board has said that £25 a ton would be a fair selling-price to enable the manufacturing company to obtain a fair profit. On page Iff of its report the board statesImmunity from competition may result in the maintenance of the present list price of £28 10s. per ton which the board considers 25 excessive. Tho present high price not only 31 throws an undue burden on primary producers and on the building trade, but it also cheeks consumption and thereby tends to maintain high costs of production. The board is satisfied that with an output of 00,000 tons AYES. per annum the company could reduce its gross list price of 20-gauge "" o r b "" galvanized corrugated iron to £24 9s. 5d. per ton and earn a reasonable profit. The Minister has gone to a good deal of trouble in an endeavour to show that, because the company is not producing 60,000 tons of iron per annum, the sellingprice recommended by the board as one capable of returning a reasonable profit to the company, should not be accepted. I point out, however, that the board in its recommendation has allowed a sellingprice of £25 a ton after having said that £24 9s. 5d. a ton would enable the company to earn a reasonable profit on a basis of 60,000 tons production per annum; That allows the company a margin of 10s. 7d. a ton over the price recommended by the board as reasonable. Surely that should, to some extent, compensate the company for the extra cost of producing a quantity of iron less than 60,000 tons per annum. A wage-earner, who is rationed, does not receive a higher rate of pay to compensate him for the shorter time he works. He must be content with the same rate of wages for the three or four day a week he works, as he would receive if he worked a full week. This company, however, will he better off to the extent of 10s. 7d. a ton than it would be if it received the price which the Tariff Board considers should return it a reasonable profit. Even if the price conditions are agreed to by the committee, the company will be permitted to charge for iron practically double the British f.o.b. price. ""We have been told that the British price for iron has come down to £13 a ton. According to the amendment, which I am going to move, and which is in the terms of the Tariff Board's recommendation, the company is to be allowed to charge £25 a ton for iron, which is nearly 100 per cent, more than the price obtaining in Great B r it a in for similar iron. Surely that is generous treatment, On page 19 of the report appears the following paragraph-and in this connection I remind the committee that the protective duty and primage duty on this commodity now amount to practically £7 a ton, £5 10s. ordinary duty and £ 1 10s. primage dutyWith a duty of £4 8s. 4d. per ton, the local manufacturing company would be overprotected on probably 80 per cent, of its production. This is a serious matter if full advantage is taken of the duty in fixing selling-prices, but it is of small consequence if such prices are based on cost3 of production by efficient methods and on reasonable profits. For this reason, the board stresses the importance of obtaining from the local manufacturer an undertaking that prices will bo kept at a reasonable figure. The board, therefore, considers that while the telegraphic transfer rate of exchange between Australia and London is 28 per cent, or over, galvanized iron should be admitted at the rates of, per ton, British pre- ing :ferential, free; intermediate, 20s.; general, 40s., or, alternatively, if the local manufacturer gives a satisfactory undertaking(a) That present prices be reduced to the basis of a gross list price of £25 per ton for 20-gauge "" Orb"" galvtuiized corrugated iron in skeleton felt-lined cases (quantity discounts and conditions of sale remaining unaltered) ; (6) That prices be further reduced by an amount corresponding to any further reductions in production costs; (c) That prices will not be increased except when costs of production increase ; the board considers that the rates provided should be, per ton, British preferential, 90s.; intermediate, 110s.; general, 130s. I have endeavoured to incorporate in my amendment both the spirit and the letter of the recommendation of the Tariff Board. I move That the item be further amended by adding the follpjying proviso:"" Provided further that at any time when the gross list price, as certified by the Tariff Board, of 26-gauge Australian orb. galvanized iron, packed in skeleton felt-lined cases, exceeds £25 per ton the rates of duty shall be, per ton, British, free; intermediate, 20s.; general, 40s."" On many occasions we have heard in this chamber of what has been called the "" New Protection "". The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Eenton) has been a strong advocate of this policy, and I remind him and other honourable members that we have now an opportunity of putting the system into operation. The honourable member may, by supporting my amendment, afford a generous measure of protection to the industry concerned, and also safeguard, to some extent, the interests of the consumers. The high duties just agreed to will raise the protective tariff to a level which is unscallable by external competition, and. the manufacturers will be protected in that way; while the consumers will be protected to the extent that iron at £25 a ton will not cost them quite twice as much as the British f.o.b. price. U n less the committee is prepared, as recommended by the Tariff Board, to restrict .to £25 a ton the price which may be charged by the company, it will be guilty of giving to the company a legal charter to profiteer. On page 20 of the Tariff Board's report there appears the followI f prices are kept at their present level, resuscitation of demand will be retarded and output kept at a low figure. It would therefore appear to be to the ultimate interest of all concerned to expedite a return to normal demand by reducing selling prices. I submit that the Tariff Board has shown that no injustice will be done to this company, but that, on the contrary, it will be treated very generously if this amendment is agreed to, and if it is required, as a concomitant to the enjoyment of this protection, to sell its duct at prices not exceeding £25 per ton, and that if it charges higher prices the duties, instead of being British, 90s., intermediate, 110s., and general, 120s., should be British, free; intermediate, 20s., and general, 40s.

ADJOURNMENT. proDRUGS AND CHEMICALS : NATIONALIZATION OF SUPPLIES IN FEDERAL TERRITORYINVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONSPAIRS IN DIVISION-WA R SERVICE HMS-MATERNIT Y ALLOWANCE. Motion (Mr Scullin) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",67
281,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Kooyong) [10.49] - I desire to ascertain from the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) whether there is any foundation for the rumour which is current in the Federal Capital Territory to the effect that it 24 is the intention of the Government to 30 take over the business of selling drugs and chemists' supplies, and to introduce some form of socialization of the medical services in the Territory? ATES. Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [10.50]. - I direct the attention of the Government to certain hardships' which are occurring, but which, in my opinon, were never contemplated, in connection with the payment of invalid pensions under the alleged financial rehabilitation plan. In one case to which I direct particular attention an invalid pension of 10s. a week, which has been paid to the son of an artisan at Port Kembla for several years, has been cancelled recently on the ground that the father is able to support the NOES. son.. When the pension, was first granted the father was working full time, and receiving £1 Is. 7d. per day; but some time ago his wages were reduced from. £1 Is. 7d. a day to 16s. a day, and, under the rationing scheme applicable to his industry, his working week was reduced from six to five days. The Pensions Department has intimated that, in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Emergency Act, the son can no longer be granted his pension. There are other conditions which may affect the matter, such as there being other children in the family over sixteen years of age- a son unable to get work, and a daughter whom the father has to keep-bu t the point is that, although the father's earning capacity has been reduced by 5s. 7d. per day for five days in the week, and completely eliminated in regard to the other day, it is said that he is able to support his invalid son. I do not think that honourable members ever contemplated that happenings of this kind would occur under the so-called rehabilitation plan. In times like these all the financial resources of a household are mobilized to help to maintain members of families who are out of work, and it is pitiful that pensions which, have been, payable for some years should be cancelled. Another case has been brought under my notice of a widow SO years of age, who has had her pension reduced from 35s. per fortnight to 7s. 9d. per fortnight, because she is drawing a war pension of £67 18s. 6d. per annum. The reduction of this old lady's invalid pension to £10 Is. Gdper annum practically robs her of it altogether. I cannot believe that honourable members understood that they were voting in favour of this kind of thing when they supported the alleged rehabilitation scheme. It appears that it is not a case of a reduction of pensions by 2s. 6d. per week, but a wholesale slaughtering of them.",70
282,Mr GABB,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Unde r the regulations either a half or a whole pension must be granted; there can be no quarter pension.,71
283,Mr LAZZABXNT,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The matter seems to be goverh'ed'by regulations made under the act.,71
284,Mr GABB,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Actio n is taken under the discretionary powers of the Commissioner.,71
285,Mr LAZZARINI,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"In my opinion that means under the discretionary power of the Government, acting through the Treasurer. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) supported the plan, and he must accept his share of the responsibility.",71
286,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member for Werriwa said a few moments ago that he did not think that this was part of the plan.,71
287,Mr LAZZARINI,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not think that any honourable member thought that the plan would operate in this way. When legislation of this character is under discussion in the House, there is not always time to consider the full effects of it. If these actions have been taken under regulations it is useless to say that the Commissioner is responsible. I do not believe that the Commissioner would take action of this kind on his own volition. I believe that his action has been taken under direction. Any directions of that kind must come from those who have authority over the Commissioner. I urge the Government to give earnest consideration to this matter, and, if necessary, to bring down an amendment of the act to' render impossible a continuation of the present policy. Everything possible should be done to ease the hardships that are being suffered by the pensioners who have been affected by this legislation.",71
288,Mr BAYLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Oxley) [10.59] - I wish to record the fact that the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell) was very anxious to vote in favour of the amendments of the honourable member  galvanized iron item in the tariff schedu-le, in respect of which votes were taken a few minutes ago. The honourable member attended yesterday's sitting of the House at great risk to his health in the hope that he would be able to record his vote; but he was unfortunately taken to the hospital yesterday afternoon. It was not possible for me to arrange a pair for him on the division on the first amendment of the honourable member for Gippsland; but I am glad to say that the honourable member for Denison (Mr. Culley) very kindly paired with him so that a record could be made of his vote on the second amendment of the honor-' able member for Gippsland.",71
289,Mr JAMES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Hunter) [11.0] - In supporting the protest of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) concerning reductions in pensions, I also desire to bring under the notice of the Government several cases of extreme hardship which, according to the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions, have been caused by the passage of the Financial Emergency Act. Two cases in particul a r have been brought under my notice where special hardship has been perienced in consequence of the tions issued by the Treasurer (Mr. Theodore) to the Deputy Commissioner. The proposals outlined by the Treasurer in his second-reading speech on the 18th June last are not embodied in the act, but because of the Treasurer's statement the deputy commissioners, by his direcships tion, are inflicting a severe penalty pensioners whose parents are in receipt over £78 per annum. This penalty is flicted on each individual member family, irrespective of age. The Treasurer statedReduce standard of adequate maintenance in respect of invalid pensions as underAmount available for claimant's tenance: Pension to be paid-U p to per annum, ful l rate; £52 to £78 annum, half rate; over £78 per annum, nil. After a person is 21 years of age, parents are no longer responsible maintenance, and in some instances penadopt sions which have been in force for a ber of years have been cancelled. I the case of Mary A. MCLean, of Secondannum. street, Weston, the Deputy Commissioner statesW it h reference to your personal representations concerning the above named I have say the Pensions Act provides in effect a pension shall not be paid to a child if the parents are in reasonably good circumtude, stances. There is no limit to the age of the child, and any action to free children 21 and over from the section would need an amendment of the act . . . Inquiry showed the father earned at the rate of £220 annum. He pays approximately £5 per annum interest on amount owing on his home and has his wife and claimant dependent him. A son aged 24 years is not allowed Though the circumstances of the parent not be considered good they are deemed to be able to support claimant. I am sorry therefore the pension cannot be restored. E.or instance, it is laid down by the Pensions Department single man in receipt per annum is debarred from receivas ing a pension. If both the husband and wife are in receipt of an income of £78 per annum they are not entitled to a sion, and a child is to be debarred from receiving a pension if the total in this come of the home is three times £78, or £234. In the MCLean ease, the daughter should be receiving the pension, even under this harsh desire ilr. James. exruling, because her father is earninstrucing only £220 per annum out of which he has to pay £5 in interest on his home. If a cripple attends at a Labour bureau, and asks for the "" dole"" he is told that he cannot get it, because it-is considered that he is entitled to a pension. There are many instances in which hardare being inflicted, and in such upon a way that no other government has of attempted, under instructions from the in Government. I am correct in saying that of the instructions have been issued.  true.",71
290,Mr JAMES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am telling the truth,mainand have the necessary documentary £52 evidence to support my contention that per instructions have been issued under the Financial Emergency Act to the deputy commissioners to act in this way. It is the a scandal and a shame that a for so-called Labour Government should such an attitude, and take the pennumsion from the incapacitated daughter of n a mau who is in receipt of- £220 per There is also the case of a Miss Rossiter whose father has been told that his income is sufficient to maintain her. No one can successfully challenge my to statement that the pensioners in the two that cases, I have quoted are incapacitated. If a. parent were to adopt a callous attiand tell his daughter that he could years not keep her any longer, the Government would be compelled to pay her a pension. Is that what the Government wishes? per Parents will not act in this way, but are willing to share their last crust with on children who are dependent upon them. for. Many are in absolute poverty, and in the cancases I have quoted, £220 is all that is available to maintain four people. The son is only working quarter time. These cases are only two of many that I could bring forward. I hope that the that a Government will show some consideration of £78 to these people, and at least treat them well as its predecessors treated them. On occasions I have criticized the previous Government for its administration penof invalid pensions; but when I find a so-called Labour Government acting in way, I feel that an apology is due to the Bruce-Page Administration.",72
291,Mr GULLETT,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Henty) [11.11] - I to refer t"" the precarious position of many thousands of occupants of war service homes as the result of the economic depression. In reply to a question which I asked yesterday in this connection, the Minister in charge of war service homes informed me that the matter had been referred to a sub-committee of Cabinet. ""While I do not suggest that that sub-committee will not give the most earnest consideration to this matter, I am aware that in these critical days the time of Ministers is fully occupied. I doubt whether, in the circumstances, so important a subject can be adequately dealt with by a sub-committee of Cabinet, and, therefore, I suggest that an inexpensive, independent body, comprising perhaps senior departmental officers, should be set up to consider thoroughly and impartially the position of returned soldier occupants of war service homes. I recognize that the Government should not be asked to incur heavy losses in connection with these homes; but that losses must, be incurred because of depreciation seems inevitable. Personally, I think that a re-adjustment both of capital and interest will become imperative, and that if action along those lines is taken now the loss will be less than if matters are allowed to drift",72
292,Mr CKOUCH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Hav e any families been evicted from these homes?,73
293,Mr GULLETT,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I believe that some have been evicted; but I am concerned now particularly with the thousands of families who still occupy war service homes, but cannot continue their payments. They are seeking a dennite pronouncement from the Government that at least some measure of relief will be given to them, in which case many of them who now feel disposed to give up the fight would remain in their homes and persevere with their payments in the hope of better times coming. There are about 38,000 of these war service homes, which are occupied by the very salt of the manhood of Australia. These men are returned soldiers, and nearly all of them married men with young families. They are, moreover, men of industry, capacity, and thrift. Most of them have already paid considerable sums towards the purchase of their homes. Unfortunately, large numbers of them are now unemployed, others are rationed in their employment, while nearly all are receiving reduced incomes. As a people we were proud of our record in connection with war service homes before the present economic depression, because the arrears then amounted to only 1 per eent. Unfortunately, inability to pay has doubled that percentage. If relief is not given promptly, I fear that many of these homes will revert to the CroAvn, in which case they would prove a poor asset, to say nothing of the loss to a fine body of citizens. I suggest that an announcement of the intention of the Government be made at an early date. It might not be possible at the moment to set out specifically the Government's intentions but a general statement would do much to allay the anxiety of the occupants of those war service homes. An independent body might assemble the case for the Government, and so expedite its consideration.",73
294,Mr WARD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"East Sydney) [11.16] Seeing that we have already wasted a number of hours dealing with matters which concern employers, I feel that I am justified in asking the House to spend a few minutes considering the case of a member of the working class which I propose to bring before it.",73
295,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Hon. Norman Makin). - Order ! It is not in order for an honourable member to say that the House has wasted time.,73
296,Mr WARD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"On numerous occasions members of the group with which I am associated have brought before the House instances of hardship which has been caused to invalid and old-age pensioners by the policy of the Government in relation to pensions. We have been told that our statements have not been borne out by the facts. Here is a case that cannot be disputed. It is that of a Miss A. M. Martin, of 8 Artlett-street, Paddington, in the East Sydney electorate. Miss Martin was in receipt of a pension for some time, but later her case was reviewed and her pension cancelled, it being contended that she no longer was permanently and totally incapacitated. I made representations to the department to - have her pension stored, and in reply I received the folgirl :lowing letter, dated the 7th July, 1931:RE MISS A. M. MARTIN , 8 ABTLETT-STREET, Dear sir, W it h reference to your personal representapension tions concerning the above-named, I have to say a qualification for an invalid pension total and permanent incapacity for workpartial incapacity is not sufficient. A pension was granted in May last year on the medical evidence, which disclosed she had six months earlier several severe operaher tions and certain organs had been removed. The Commonwealth Medical Referee certified pensioner's favour, but subject to a further examination in twelve months. The second examination was recently made by the sameis doctor and, though still suffering from the effects of the operations, pensioner's condition had so far improved that she was no longer qualified for a pension. Pensioner's earning capacity is admittedly now. small, but she is capable of light employment and is, therefore, not incapacitated within the meaning of the act. I regret, under the circumstances, a pension cannot at present be restored. H. THKGGIE, Deputy Commissioner.

Earning capacity, even though small, qualifies for an invalid pension. I am sorry, therefore, the pension cannot at present be restored. H. THEQGIE, Deputy Commissioner. It may be contended that the Government was not aware' of the facts of the case, but the following letter was sent to Mr Ward, rePrime Minister by the mother of this 8 Artlett-street, Paddington, 15th July, 1931. PADDINGTON. Dear Mr Scullin, lie the case of Alice Martin, whose invalid was cut off and who wrote to you a fortnight ago. You kindly answered, saying is that you would co-operate with Mr Ward, our Federal member. I have had a personal interview with Mr Ward. He has sent on the department's letter, which I am forwarding to you. The department admit that my daughter is still suffering from the effects of very serious operation. Only a week ago the superintendent of the Women's Hospital, in Paddington, gave my daughter a letter saying that, in his opinion, she could not work. The department say the act of the pension for those permanently incapacitated, but my daughter is only asking for an extension of her pension t ill she pulls up a littl e of her strength, which she has lost, to be able to fight the world, as she cannot work at all 1, her mother, who witnessed the great agony she went through after her operation, know how ill she is s t ill, which is worrying ine very much, as she has lapsed into a state of despondency. Since they have cut off her pension she knows she cannot work, and does not know what to do.

Yours faithfully , , (Mrs.) EMILYMABTIN . The Prime Minister inturn handed Comthe letter to me.

She said that the girl had five many times complained to her that she the was a burden on her, since the pension been cancelled, and she did not propose to be a burden - much longer. mother asked the doctor to examinaexamiue the girl; but he did not do so. I do not blame him, because he was disprobably carrying out the instructions of the Pensions Department. But he told the mother to make a fresh application to the department to have the case reviewed. Yours faithfully , That was on a Tuesday, and on the following day the girl threw herself from the cliffs at Watson's Bay. The Government cannot dispute these facts, and the the girl's death can be laid at its door because of its policy in connection with old-age andinvalid pensions.",73
297,Mr CROUCH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That is a false accusation.,75
298,Mr WARD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Ha d the girl's pension not been cancelled, she would have been alive today. The mother stated in evidence before the Coroner, at the inquest held last Friday, that the girl had been suffering mentally because of the loss of her pension, and that she did not desire to remain a burden on her mother. I would remind the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch) that this girl's father paid the supreme sacrifice at the war, and that her mother was living on a war pension. One son is out of employment, and the only income of the family is the war pension. The Pensions Department cancelled the girl's sion. The department acted in accordance with the policy of the Government, and, tlierefore, the Government is responsible for the death of this girl. I ask honourable member for Corangamitei f he thinks that if the father of this family were alive he would, in view of the circumstances surrounding his girl's death, hold the same views in regard to the rights of the citizens of Australia as he did when he enlisted. In order to give the department the opportunity of doing the only decent thing left for it to do, in view of the necessitous circumstances of _ this family, approached the Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation and the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions, and asked them to > » meet the expenses of the girl's burial. They said that it was not possible for them to do so. I now ask the Prime Minister to at least do the only decent thing that remains to. him to do, by paying the expenses of the girl's burial, which the mother cannot afford to bear.",75
299,Mr BEASLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"West Sydney) [11.27]. - The case made out by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) will stand on the facts that he has submitted. The remarks which I wish to make are of a more general character, having application to the pensions policy of the Government under the heading of what is called "" adequatemeans of support,"" or "" adequate maintenance."" Until thQ passing of the recent emergency legislation I am quite sure that honor16] able members had not dealt with pensions cancelled under that heading. I myself had no knowledge of pensions being rejected on that ground, and I claim that in my electorate there are more pensioners in proportion to the number on the roll than there are in any other electorate in the Commonwealth. A number of us who were concerned about this new pensions policy approached the Pensions Department and its officials. We had a long discussion on the subject, and we were informed that, until recently, the policy of the department was not to take into consideration the wages of the lowerpaid workers in determining invalid pensions for members of a family. That policy had been followed by previous administrations. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) was correct pen- in impressing upon us the fact that this Government had, to the detriment of the pensioners, changed a policy instituted by other governments which the were not considered, in the opinion of the Labour party, to be humane in their administration. That policy was not to take into consideration the wages of the lower-paid worker in determining an invalid pension. It was admitted to us that a provision to that effect is already in the Pensions Act, that discretionary power , did rest in the hands of the commissioners, but that until recently the commissioners had not altered or canI celled pensions on the ground of "" adequate maintenance in the case of lowerpaid workers."" The officers of the Pensions Department informed us definitely that, as individuals, they did not use the discretionary power in the States which they represented. In other words, the Deputy Commissioner in the State of New South Wales did not use any discretionary power. He told us frankly that his directions in regard to the new policy had come from Canberra. It is evident that the changed policy in regard to pensions has been due to the passing of the Financial Emergency Act by this National Parliament. I , and other honourable members who approached the> Pensions Department on this subject, have been forced to conclude that the policy of the Pensions Department has been changed at the direction of the Government, and that, therefore, the Government must carry full responsibility for its action. I lay the blame, not on deputy commissioners, who are doing their best, nor on the chief commissioner, but on those who should rightly carry the responsibility, namely the present Government. The new conditions in regard to the payment of the maternity allowance provide that if the husband of a claimant has earned an income of £260 during the year prior to that in which the birth place, the allowance may not be made under the act. In hundreds of cases today persons who last year earned £260 Or more, are living on the dole. With the assistance of the Pensions Department, I , and my colleagues, have been able to prove the correctness of that statement, which shows how harsh is the treatment that is being meted out by the Government at the most important period in the lives of those concerned. payments that have to be made on account of rent, food, clothing and other necessaries of the prospective mother out of the previous year's income ought all to be considered in deciding what treatment should be extended to those unfortunate persons who are living on the dole. It can be clearly shown that they are making more than an equality of sacrifice in order that they might make their contribution towards the so-called rehabilitation of the finances of this country.",75
300,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [11.32] - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) has referred to a rumour that is current in regard to the nationalization of druggists in the Federal Territory. I had not heard it previously, but I shall have inquiries made in regard to it. The honourable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett) has stressed the difficulties are being experienced by the occupants of - war service homes. A committee of the Cabinet is at present investigating that particular question, and an inquiry into it will probably have to be instituted^ The Government could not make a statement in general terms at the present time; any statement would have to be specific. Some relief has been afforded by the reduction of the interest rate to 4 per cent. T know that there are some 1 very hard cases; but I can assure the House that every case has been, and will be, dealt with on it's merits. The accumulation of rents in the cases of men who are unemployed or only intermittently employed is very great. If the honourable member will look through the records, he will find that the administration has adopted a very generous attitude. Generally, the position of those who are purchasing takes either war service or other homes is a very difficult one, and constitutes a problem that has arisen out of the existing depression. But who can say that the present conditions will continue? Properties may rise in value. The suggestion that has been made that £7,000,000, £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 should be written off an undertaking in which about £28,000,000 of capital is involved, without knowing what the future holds in The store, requires a good deal of consideration. The honourable members for East Sydney (Mr Ward), Hunter (Mr James), West Sydney (Mr Beasley), and Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), have referred to the question of pensions. I cannot, offhand, reply to the numerous cases that they have quoted; but I shall have an investigation made by the department, and obtain a report in regard to them. I assure the House that no direction other than to administer the act has been sent out by the Government. It may be that in the administration of the act some changes have been effected and hardship has been caused. That matter will be investigated, and any amendments of the act that are found to be necessary will be brought down. "". In connection with the payment of the maternity allowance, it may be advisable to consider whether the salary of the prethat vious year ought to be taken as a guide in the cases of those who have no income at the time. That is an aspect which may have been overlooked. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) said that he had never previously heard of "" adequate maintenance "" having been held against the granting of an invalid pension. That has always been the law.",76
301,Mr BEASLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I said that it had always been the law, but that it had never been applied.",76
302,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Oh yes, it has.",76
303,Mr BEASLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,My authority for the statement is the Deputy Commissioner.,77
304,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I assure ' the honourable member that it has always been applied. It is perfectly true, however, that the matter is absolutely within the discretion of those who are administering the law. When times were good, the provision was most generously interpreted; but probably it has been tightened up now that we are in straitened circumstances.",77
305,Mr BEASLUY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"As a matter of fact, in some cases they are holding it against foster parents.",77
306,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Foste r parents, of course, take the place of natural parents, f shall have an investigation made of the whole matter, to see how far it is working harshly. The Government does not wish unnecessary hardship to be imposed. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) brought up a specific case, in which he said that a' girl was refused a pension as a result of the policy of the Government. In reply to an interjection by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch), the honourable member said, "" I shall show you that it is an instruction from the Government "". He then proceeded to read a letter that had been sent to me, and my reply to it. The mother of . the irl in question wrote to me, and took the courteous action of replying that I would co-operate with the member for the district. I sent that letter in the name of the honourable member for East Sydney as well as in my own name, that, in my opinion, being the courtesy that 13 due to an honourable member. But beyond making those representations, I issued no instruction. I have uo power to instruct the Commissioner, nor would I attempt to do so any more than would any other honourable member, r would not use my position as Prime Minister to give an instruction in any case. The circumstances of the case as they have been outlined by the honourable member clearly prove to those who have had experience of pensions that it has no connection whatever with the plan of rehabilitation, or with government policy; it is a case that comes solely under the law, which lays it down that an invalid must be totally and permanently incapacitated, and the judge of that is the doctor who examines the applicant.",77
307,Mr WARD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The doctor receives instructions from the Pensions Department, which in turn is instructed by the. Government.",77
308,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I join issue with the honourable member, and give that statement a flat denial. The medical referees are men of high standing, who would refuse to take instructions from either the Commissioner or the Prime Minister. If the honourable member can mention a medical referee who is so lost to all sense ofhonour that he would act as he suggests, I undertake to have him removed.",77
309,Mr BEASLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,In dozens of cases outside practitioners differ from the department's medical referees.,77
310,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is quite true; I have had cases of that kind myself. I have found that outside doctors' give a much more liberal interpretation of the act than do the medical referees, whose responsibility it is and whose knowledge of the' provisions of the law is frequently considerably greater than that of many outside practitioners. In the past, we have had experience of doctors who have been harsh and cruel, a'nd they have been removed. These men have to interpret both the letter and the spirit of the act.",77
311,Mr BBBNNAIT,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"And they have inter preted very generously the definition of "" totally incapacitated "";",77
312,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It has been inter preted most generously.,77
313,Mr WARD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Does the Prime Minister think that this girl would have committed suicide had a pension been granted?,77
314,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The history of the case that has been given by the honourable member gives his own case away. The girl underwent a surgical operation on the body, not on the head, and twelve months later the doctor who originally passed her for a pension reviewed her case and declared that she was recovered sufficiently to be able to work. His original certificate had been generous, . because although at the time of his examination she was unable to work, he knew that her incapacity was not permanent. When, however, she had recovered from her operation, he recommended that the pension be discontinued. His judgment, may have been right or wrong, but it is. not for the honourable member to say that what happened subsequently was the consequence of Government policy.",77
315,Mr LAZZARINI,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Cold-bloode d logic I,78
316,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It - is not. The honourable member .for East Sydney has alleged that Government policy was responsible for the girl's suicide. Mr ""WABD - That is true.",78
317,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The policy of the Government had nothing to do with it. The law requires that the pensioner shall be permanently incapacitated, and the responsibility of determining the incapacity attaches to the doctor. As a matter of fact, the incapacity for which this girl received the pension was in no way connected with her mental state, and when she asked for the restoration of the pension, the doctor soundly advised her to make a further application to the department. The honourable member for East Sydney does not help His case by making irresponsible charges against the Government. ""We are trying to be humane, and arc not giving instructions to the officials to cither tighten or slacken their administration of the law. The administration is in the hands of a Commissioner who, so far as we know, is capable and impartial, and the department endeavours to select doctors who are competent and fair. But in regard to anything that results from Government policy, I am willing to order that any deserving case brought to my notice shall be reviewed with a view to the removal of undue hardship. Quostion resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.43 p.m.",78
