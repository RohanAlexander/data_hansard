PERSONAL EXPLANATION.  way of personal explanation, I wish to say that the two morning Melbourne dailies have devoted leading articles to the speech I made yesterday, an atten4 ion for which it may be supposed I hould be thankful; but I take exception to a statement occurring in both of these articles. It is made to appear that yesterday I threatened the Government with sundry no-confidence motions. There is nothing in the Hansard report of my remarks which could be construed to convey that meaning. I certainly spoke of further opportunities for discussing the matters with which I was dealing-th o proposals in the Government programmewhich, I presume, will be open for discussion when they come' up again in the ordinary way. I emphatically deny that I threatened . further no-confidence motions. Life is far too short for that. PUBLICATION OF STATISTICS .",12

GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH : ADDRESS - IN - REPL Y. Debate resumed from 20th August (vide page 331), on niotion by Mr AHERN That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to by this House :MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to ParliamentUpon which Mr FISHER had movedThat the following words be added to the proposed Address :But regret your advisers(1) propose to destroy the beneficial character of our social and industrial laws; (2) indicate no intention of taking such steps as will reduce the high cost of living; and (3) fail to realise the urgent necessity of an immediate revision of the Tariff.",13
3,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"Gippsland) [2.35] - A good deal was said yesterday, and throughout the debate, about the holding of another election. It is well that elections cannot be held without lic expenditure, the cost of a general election being considerable. tionable, therefore, whether honourable members opposite are justified in attempt the ing to force an appeal to the country without the hope of gaining something definite. I echo the statement the Prime Minister made yesterday, that on a concrete proposition a thoroughly democratic result may be obtained by an elecquestion. tion, and the members on this side of the Chamber will have no objection to an election of that kind. The speeches of the Opposition have evidently the object of preventing the performance of the imwhich is portant business of Parliament for which Does the country is crying out. Those honourable members are giving no consideration to the claims of the taxpayers who bear the cost of elections, and send representatives here to do the work of legislation. When an election is held, let it be on a question regarding which there can be a positive verdict by the electors; let us not have an election which can only be futile. The Government has wisely directed the attention of Parliament to the need for amending the electoral law. No doubt, members on both sides are democratic. We, on this side, are anxious to conform to the principles of democracy, and we therefore conceive it necessary that our laws must be democratic. The Government programme opens with a proposal for the amendment of the electoral law. It is clearly laid down that if the country is to be soundly' governed on democratic principles, the electoral law must be sound and democratic. Honourable members on both sides will agree that a great deal can be done to improve the electoral rolls. Neither of the political parties represented in this Chamber is desirous that tliere shall be any election, the result of which does not represent the will of the majority of the people of the continent; and, tlierefore, no objection will be raised to any revision or preparation of the electoral rolls that, in the event of another contest, would give us clean lists.",13
4,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,We on this side do not say that the rolls last used were unclean.,13
5,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"No r does any honourable member on this side say that either political party attempted to secure election on rolls which were not clean. I have always maintained, however, that there known are a great number of duplications which pubshould be removed. I am as anxious as any one here that every elector shall have It is questhe right to vote: but when we hear of names being objected to, and find from electoral officers that the electors whom those names are supposed to represent cannot be found-whe n we find the local constable, who knows the district from end to end, stating that those electors are not in the subdivision-surel y these facts are sufficient to justify the Department in erasing the names?  the district, though not in that particular subdivision.",13
6,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"The electors should be enrolled for the subdivision in which they reside, and not for a subdivision in which they are not known, and never have been known. This matter is worthy the consideration of the Government, and it is gratifying to see from the Memorandum that the electoral machinery is receiving immediate attention. The honourable member who preceded me said a good deal about the postal voting system being open to objections of various kinds. We all agree that no matter what the electoral system may be some one will be found prepared to declare that there are abuses.",14
7,Mr LAIKD SMITH,Unknown,The honourable member is rather illogical in view of his previous remarks.,14
8,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"I do not think so. It is a recognised fact that there are always people ready to take advantage of any law from time to time; if it were not so, there would be no necessity for any law. The absent vote, which was in use at the last election, is just as much open to objection as is the postal vote, though in the case of the absent vote there are certain propositions which honourable members on both sides will feel disposed to agree with . Under this absent vote, concessions are given to certain sections of the community, and those concessions could, I think, be very well extended to others. Eor instance, sailors and others whose avocations necessitate their travelling, have the right to record their vote before leaving the country; and this privilege, to which I am sure there can be no objection, might be granted to other classes, thus making our electoral system fair and free to all. It is quite impossible for all the electors throughout the Commonwealth to record their votes on any particular day. Many of our back-country residents are many miles from a polling-booth; and the law might be so amended as to make it possible for them to record their votes at any time when they happen to be in town after the issue of the writ. These people are doing pioneering work, and developing this continent for the benefit of all .",14
9,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,They can vote at any polling booth.,14
10,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"If the honourable member knows anything about country life, he must recognise that it is impossible for all the members of the family, for instance, to get to the polling-booth on one day, and, further, we must remember the adverse weather conditions that prevailed, especially in the mountainous districts, on the occasion of the last election. Those people may be 40, or even 100, miles away from the nearest polling-booth; and it is absurd to expect them to attend on a particular day under such circumstances as I have indicated. Another class who are placed at a disadvantage by the present conditions are those who conduct hotels on country roads at a very considerable distance from any polling centre. The Licensing Act of Victoria, at any rate, provides very clearly that no hotel shall at any time be lef t under the control of a minor, so that some responsible person must always be in charge. It will readily be seen that in many instances it is impossible for one person to go to the polling-booth, and return in time to enable another to exercise his rights of voting. Then there is the postal vote, to which some reference has been made. A great deal has been said on this subject, not for the purpose of hindering the developing of an Electoral Act to benefit every section of the community, nor with the desire to prevent people going to the poll, but in many instances because honourable members did not realise the great disadvantages very many people are subjected to in their avocations.. At the last election I saw a man being carried on a stretcher from a hospital five days after a serious operation in order to record his vote. It was necessary for him to do so. The honourable member for Bass said last night that it was not known that such people were anxious to vote, but it became compulsory for this man I saw to vote. I say it is known that these people are anxious to vote, and they have just as much right to record their votes as others I trust the Government will carry out their intention, as expressed in their announcement to the House, to restore the postal vote to the statute-book, not for the benefit of any section of the community, but in order that every elector shall have his just right of recording a vote. Mr BRENNAN,-Do not forget that we did our best to give every facility for voting.",14
11,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"The honourable member's best was a very poor one. it to honourable members who were here in the last Parliament, and witnessed the efforts of the then Government to curtail the electoral system of Australia, to the advantage of some and the detriment cf others, to say whether honourable members opposite did their best.",15
12,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The position that if a man was away from home he could vote, but if he was sick in a hospitalhe could not.",15
13,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"The case that came under my view was that of a man who had undergone an operation in a large town, and had to be carried 15 chains to a polling booth. In the process the stretcher broke down, and the man ran the risk of his life. A law that compels a man to do this is not democratic, and is not a credit to any Parliament. On the same occasion I saw an aged lady who had been invalided for two years being wheeled half-a-mile in an invalid chair to the polling booth. She said she had been a resident of Australia for seventy years, and that this was the first and only time since she had the right to exercise a vote that she had been denied the opportunity of doing so. Surely that is not a credit to any country. Members opposite must realise that the people of the country have a decided claim. We all recognise that the whole success of the community depends on the development of Australia's agricultural and mining resources. The success of society, or of the government ""of the country, stands upon the development of these, and if the electoral law is not fair to the people engaged in these industries it is no credit to the Parliament. I do not wish to touch all the subjects in the Ministerial announcement; time would not permit me to do so; but there are various items that call for serious consideration. Much has been said by honourable members opposite in reference to arbitration. Every one is agreed that the time for arbitration is well at hand, not only in industrial matters, but in national matters also, and in the course of the next few years we shall probably see an arrangement amongst the nations whereby it can be brought about. I do not turn a deaf ear to the progress of arbitration, but I [14] have spent all my life in an industry in which I claim that arbitration or the fixing of rates and conditions is absolutely impossible. I refer to the agricultural I leave industry. One of the items to which honourable members of the Opposition raise cousiderable objection seems to be the paragraph dealing with preference. They are of opinion that preference should be given to one section of the community, but I ask those honourable members to be open and frank, and tell us what is behind all this. It is only a was pretence to say that they want preference for a certain section of the community, because they have done so and so. The real point is how they are going to enforce this preference, how they are going to follow it up. These honourable members know perfectly well that the natural result of carrying this preference, and the only method by which it can be effectively carried out, is the establishment of the union label, of which we have heard so much in the past.",15
14,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,You offered preference in your policy.,15
15,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,Preferenc e to what?,15
16,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,Preferenc e to unionists.,15
17,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"No doubt the honourable member is trying to side-track me. I maintain the Prime Minister's manifesto does not lay down that preference is to be given to one section of the community over another. We give, if we have the opportunity to do so, freedom of action to every section of the community and preference to none, which is a fair proposition. As I have said, the natural result of preference, if carried out in its entirety, which, no doubt, honourable members opposite are aiming at, is to bring into existence the union label, the only method under which complete preference can be given effect to. Everyone knows what that means. Farmers and producers of Australia are just as much awake to this as honourable members opposite, and they know what it means. It means that everything produced by the unionist will need to carry a label, and if an article does not bear that label the kindred associations will not carry it . It is that very thing that has driven the producers of today, and will drive the producers of tomorrow - who are the workers of today - into the most determined opposition to the penalizing of any section of the community. As one who has spent the whole of ray life in agriculture, I maintain that it is impossible for any Court or any body of men to lay down the conditions of employment in agricultural pursuits. It is not a question of wages or hours or anything like that; it is a question of doing your work when you can do it . There are times in the season when it is impossible to do any work. Who will lay down a fixed rate of wage for harvesting operations in the wheat area? seen the thermometer at 104 degrees at 9 o'clock in the morning, and still at that point at dark. Who could work under those conditions? Honourable members opposite know perfectly well that no one could. Even if the human being could the animals could not. So I maintain it is impossible fco carry ou under those conditions. It is just the same in the winter. If there is a fal l of snow or bad weather of another kind it may utterly forbid the use of the animals and the men, and, seeing these abnormal conditions will cease to prevail only when those gentlemen who wish to legislate in this direction can control the elements and guarantee an average rainfall, will the producers of Australia be ready to accept the application to their work of the principle of arbitration ?",15
18,Mr RILEV,Unknown,They have just passed a Bil l in the Queensland Parliament regulating the rate of wages in the cane-fields.,16
19,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"Cane-growin g and wheat-growing are two different things. Cane will stand on the field for twelve months, with a depreciation of 15 to 20 per cent, in the cane value, whereas grain will stand on the stalk only until the next storm, so that it is necessary to harvest it when you can. The difference between cane-growing and grain-growing is as great as the difference between the sun and the moon, and the honourable member would have known it long ago had he studied the question. thing made a great deal of by speakers on the other side of the chamber is the question of this bounty. I do not propose to offer an opinion as an expert on this question, but I wish to make a few observations on it , because it affects the locality I have the honour to represent very materially. A great deal has been done during the last few years to re-establish in Victoria the production of beet-sugar. An effort of that kind on behalf of the State Government to establish an industry is a laudable one, and should receive reasonable consideration from every member of the House.",16
20,Mr LAIKD SMITH,Unknown,Does the honourable member not think it would be better to try to raise reindeer?,16
21,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"I think that there is every probability that Victorian producers will be able to establish the beetsugar industry on a sound financial basis. I have no doubt that, in the course of I have time, when the population of the State is three or four times what it is today, the cultivation of the sugar beet will be one of the leading industries of the rich agricultural areas of this State. I believe that this may be made a profitable industry, and certainly no obstacle should be placed in the way of those who are attempting to establish it . I have no hesitation in admitting that I was one of those who were anxious for the issue of the proclamation repealing the Sugar Bounty Act. I was anxious because the present is the planting season for the beetgrowers of Gippsland. Mr Knibbs, at page 395 of the Commonwealth Year Book, saysDuring ihe past few years an effort has been made to revive the sugar-beet industry in Victoria. During i g i o - n ,£5,5,4 was paid as bounty on 1,847 tons of beet, and £2,244 on 7,481 tons during ign-12. It is anticipated that the latter quantity will be increased by at least 75 per cent, during the coming season. With such a prospect before us for the production of an agricultural commodity, I venture to say that honourable members who consider these niatters from a national point of view will offer no opposition to anything calculated to remove restrictions upon that production. The beet-growers of Gippsland are particularly anxious that this matter should be brought under the consideration of Parliament, and I have received a large number of communications on the subject. The Ministry are anxious to assist the producers of the Commonwealth, and by so doing they will Another benefit the rural workers and every other section of the community. The greater the area under cultivation, the greater the number of men employed in the agricultural industry, the greater the volume of production, and the better for every section of the comniunity. The development of the beet sugar industry has been arrested by the conditions laid down in the Sugar Bounty Act, and consequently those who desire to see the progress of that industry welcome the repeal of that Act.",16
22,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Who refines and sells the sugar produced at Maffra ?,17
23,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"It is at present under the control of the State Government of Victoria. The Government have taken the matter in hand for the purpose of establishing a national industry. The industry is one which, if given a fair chance at its inception, will be of benefit to every section of the community.",17
24,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I hope the State Government will assist it even more.,17
25,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"The State Government do not propose to carry on the in dustry in all districts. They have established the factory at Maffra for experimental purposes, and that was a proper thing for the Government of the State to do. When they have proved that the in dustry can be conducted on a financial basis, tliere will be a number of people, among whom I hope the honourable member for Maribyrnong will be included, who will be prepared to enter upon the work.",17
26,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I am in the ready so far as the farmers are concerned.,17
27,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"The honourable member was, when he was down at Bairnsdale for a week.",17
28,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I was only there for a day.,17
29,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,Fro m personal knowledge I am aware that the conditions imposed by the late Minister of Trade and Customs under the Sugar Bounty Act operated harshly and unfairly upou those who had taken up the work of beet cultivation.,17
30,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,What conditions operated unfairly ?,17
31,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"The conditions fixing minimum hours of work and a minimum wage. I am personally aware that no fewer than f if t y men, from one cause or another, were incapacitated from earning the minimum wage laid down, and when they applied to the Department for an exemption under the A ct to permit of their employment they never received a reply to their communication. These men lost their work and the wages they might have earned, and the producers lost services for which they were willing to pay. I say that that was an unfair and harsh condition, and I consequently welcome the repeal of the Act and the fact that the matter is now lef t to the control of the State Government, as I hope will be the case with all our industrial work. One of the clauses of the censure motion sets out that the Government have failed to realise the immediate necessity for a revision of the Tariff. Surely it is evident from the memorandum submitted by the present Government that it is their intention to make a strenuous effort to secure for the benefit of the community a satisfactory Tariff. They have lost no time in giving effect to the policy which honourable members on this side have all along been advocating. They did not lose a moment in the appointment of the Inter-State Comniission, which the last Government shelved for five or six months. Their action in that inatter should be accepted as a guarantee of their intention to go forward with this great policy. We are all aware that the importations of goods from abroad have been very extensive. This results in lack of employment for our own artisans, and in the exportation of a considerable amount of coin and bullion to meet the cost of the imported goods. The work al- first necessity of any nation is to increase its population. By doing that we increase the possibilities of our defence, and so insure the security of our homes and the lives of those near and dear to us. No doubt the importation of dutiable goods into a country such as Australia affords considerable relief to the Treasury, but I maintain that it is not a good national policy to import goods which could be made in the Commonwealth. I welcome the fact that the Government are determined to take this matter up with a serious intention to do what is necessary.",17
32,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Where is the evidence of their serious intention? They have referred the matter to a Commission.,17
33,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"In referring the matter to the Inter-State Commission for report they have at least done more than our honourable friends opposite did, though they had ample opportunity to deal with it.",17
34,Mr FENTON,Unknown,We want the Government to go on with it now.,17
35,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,It is one of the subjects on the business-paper which w l ; l come up for consideration when we have disposed of this motion.,17
36,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Will the honourable member help us to consider it ?,17
37,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"I am helping by placing my views on the matter before the House now, and I do not propose to make a second speech on the subject. If Parliament is anxious to proceed with the work, this debate should be curtailed as much as possible, to enable the Government to get on with the programme they placed before the people, and which the people approved. Another which is vital to the progress of the country is the matter of land settlement; every one will welcome the fact that the Government have submitted a proposition for the adoption of a definite land policy for the whole of the areas under ihe control of the Commonwealth. is little to discuss in this connection the Bill dealing with the subject is actually before us. I have looked into the inatter as carefully as I could in the limited time at my disposal, and I find that legislation dealing with it in other pares of the world is very similar to that which has been adopted in But I am of the opinion that efforts should be made to provide for tralia more lenient land laws obtain elsewhere. Every one of us must recognise that unoccupied areas are dangerous to a nation. If our unused land could be utilized, it would tend to the security of the country. Some honourable members have asserted that we are anxious to give land away. very much prefer that the land should be given to the workers and producers of Australia than that it should come into the occupation of any Asiatic races, as must inevitably occur unless we do something with it at an early date. That being so, I welcome the proposition that the Government have placed before us for the early consideration of a Land Bill to establish freehold tenure in the Northern Territory, since that is the only tenure which will eflect security for this country. The question of defence probably the most important Australia has to face. There is no doubt that the late Government did a great deal in this connection, but there is still a great deal to be done; and I think it is a pity that this House should be occupied in debating a censure motion which will have no material effect, very important questions, such as defence and the Tariff, are held in These questions should receive early attention from this Parliament. we are discussing a subject which can result in no good to any one. honourable members opposite have intention of legislating-and that is what they were sent here for-if they have any Mr Bennett. intention of carrying out the mandate of the country, we should at once take which these propositions which have been submitted to us into consideration.* There is matter one thing which I notice with particular pleasure in the Ministerial programme, and namely, that the Government propose to obtain the highest professional advice in military matters. There is no doubt that economy and efficiency will result from the utilization of the best knowledge that There can be obtained. until Mr Laird SMITH - That is only pursuing the policy of the Pisher Government.",17
38,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"Surely we do well in continuing a good policy. Honourable members opposite would not be anxious to see us reject anything good in the Australia. policy of our predecessors. But are they sure that this policy was initiated by the Aus- Fisher Government? I understand than that the present Prime Minister, in 1909, initiated the new defence policy. He it was who invited Lord Kitchener to come to Australia for the purpose of advising the Commonwealth. The late Government continued the Liberal policy, and we hope to continue whatever is good in I should theirs. Anything that is not good we unoccupied shall pass out, as the Ministerial statement informs us.",18
39,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Is the honourable member in favour of borrowing money for defence purposes?,18
40,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,Nothin g is mentioned in the Ministerial statement as regards borrowing for defence.,18
41,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,But is the honourable member in favour of that?,18
42,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"I am not; there is is no necessity for doing so. If we pursue one that a sound financial policy in regard to the construction of our national works, there will be sufficient revenue for defence purposes without any borrowing. I welcome heartily the announcement in the statement of policy in regard to the extension of the rifle club system. Having been whilst for many years a member of a rifle club. I am satisfied that, in time of need, some abeyance. of our most efficient defenders will be proved to be those who are masters of the Yet here rifle. The most efficient masters of the rifle in Australia have been proved over Surely if and over again to be the men associated any with the rifle clubs. I concur in any policy that will extend their privileges, make them more efficient, and assist them to extend the popularity of the system. One thing in particular we have to maintain, and that is a sense of absolute loyalty - to our country. some danger of interfering with or sapping this sense of loyalty. We often hear statements made by , admittedly irresponsible individuals of a wholly improper nature, and which lead to thoughts of disloyalty to our own nation. No Government or party should lend colour to ideas of that description. Another question which requires our serious consideration is that of establishing a uniform railway system throughout Australia. .This requires i m mediate consideration, and it is a pity that it is not one of the subjects for immediate discussion instead of the no-confidence motion with which we are engaged. establishment of a uniform railway system is, in my humble opinion, of the utmost consequence to the well-being of Australia. It is not a question of expense; it is not a question of the number of miles of a certain gauge which one State may have in comparison with another; but it is a question of what gauge will give the greatest efficiency in working for the benefit of the Commonwealth as a whole, bearing in mind not merely what is good for today or for tomorrow, but what will redound to the interests of the country in fifty, or perhaps a hundred, years' time. This is a matter whioh every one of us should be anxious to take in hand as soon as possible. I am also of opinion that the Government should set out immediately upon the policy of maintaining economy in expenditure. This is a subject has led me into some amount of trouble during the present debate. ported to have made certain statements about economy during my election campaign. I full y admit that I did deal with the question of expenditure upon administration. I dealt with items many of which I believed to be unnecessary. I pointed to expenditure from which the taxpayers receive absolutely no returnfrom which they obtain positively no valuable results. If the present Government can maintain economy in expenditure, their policy will be welcomed by every section of the community. I have endeavoured to place before the House the views which I hold on various matters, and I trust that they will receive consideration. They are certainly matters which are fraught with greater advantage to the community than a motion such as that which we are now discussing, which will have no material result. The censure motion appears to me to be futile as There is far as effective legislation is concerned.",18
43,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The honourable member himself is taking part in the debate.,19
44,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"1 do not propose to speak more than once. I shall be no party to such a course of procedure as has been indicated by an honourable member opposite, who has told us that when this motion is disposed of, others of a like character will be submitted. I maintain that we are all democrats in this House, and, therefore, none of us can honestly object to a fair electoral law, which will extend to every elector the right to record his or her vote, irrespective of health The considerations.",19
45,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I do not hear the honourable member for Riverina re-echoing the sentiment that we are all democrats.,19
46,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"The honourable member for Riverina is as good a democratperhaps a better one-tha n are some honourable members upon the other side of the chamber. If the honourable member for Capricornia is the democrat which he ought to be, judging by his appearance, he will support the proposal of the Government to introduce an amending electoral Bill , which will grant to every elector in the Commonwealth the right to exercise the franchise, irrespective of considerations of health or distance from the polling-booth. In regard to other matters of industrial concern, I know that my honourable which friends opposite hold very strong views. But I ask them to consider for a moment I am re- what would be the effect of granting a preference to unionists if that principle were adopted in its entirety. I venture to say that if the agricultural industries of the Commonwealth are placed under the control of the Arbitration Court, they will at once enter upon the down, instead of the up, grade. Australia needs a strong rural community, and with that end in view, we need to encourage our present farmers to continue to be farmers, whilst enabling our agricultural labourers to become the farmers of the future. There is no industry which makes masters of so many of its workers as does the agricultural industry. How many factory workers ever become factory owners ? Very few indeed. On the other hand, 50 per cent, of the agricultural workers of today will be the farmers of ten years hence.",19
47,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wannon said that 90 per cent, of our agricultural workers would be farmers within a few years. The average is coming down.",20
48,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,"What the honourable the resultof a defective member for Wannon said is perfectly true, namely, that 90 per cent, of the farmers of today were agricultural workers a few years ago. The higher the percentage of employers and producers, the better will it be for every section of the community. The agricultural industry is the only industry which Australia must maintain, because upon it depends the success of every section of the community.",20
49,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [3.25] - I take this opportunity of addressing a few remarks to the somewhat depleted cohorts of the chorus party opposite. When they were acting in complete unison the other day, and were chorusing their leader's every statement, they irresistibly reminded me of a boy whistling in the night to keep up his courage. The present position of parties in this House is certainly unique. The amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition makes tliree distinct charges against the Government. The one important charge, which is not included in his indictment, is that of maladministration. Two days ago the honourable member for Yarra accused the Government of having allowed the Commonwealth revenue to be depleted to the extent of £100,000 or £150,000. Undoubtedly, that charge has been substantiated. This morning we learn from the newspapers that that philanthropic society, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, were the first to indicate the blunder which the Ministry had committed.",20
50,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Owing to the defective Act of the late Government.,20
51,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Owing to the maladministration of an incompetent Minister of Trade and Customs. There are not many honourable members upon this side of the House who believed that disaster to the public revenue was likely to be evaded very long, seeing that the Trade and Customs Department was under the control of the honourable member for Darling Downs; but few imagined that such a blunder would be committed so soon in the history of the present Government- a blunder which has undoubtedly cost Australia anything between £100,000 and £150,000.",20
52,Mr FENTON,Unknown,It may be a great deal more.,20
53,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It may be. The honourable member for Darling Downs has asked whether that blunder was not Statute which was passed at the instance of the late Government. I do not admit that it was. But let us view things from the worse possible standpoint, so far as the Labour Ministry are concerned. The Sugar Bounty Abolition Act and the Sugar Excise Repeal Act were proclaimed on the 26th July last. If the Minister of Trade and Customs knew that the revenue of the Commonwealth would be depleted by the proclamation of those Acts, and if he were considerate of the interests which he has sworn to safeguard, he would have delayed bringing those Statutes into operation until he had appealed to the Legislature. He knew that Parliament would reassemble on the 12th August. That being so, was there any particular urgency to proclaim the Acts, and thus to sacrifice the revenue? Mr GRO.OM - The honourable member knows that the revenue will not be sacrificed.",20
54,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I do not know anything of the kind. If it is not going to be sacrificed, it is because that philanthropic institution, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, has recognised that the Government have made fools of themselves, and deems it its duty to help them out of their difficulty.",20
55,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,They are playing the game straight.,20
56,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Her e is an admission by the Postmaster-General. In effect, he says to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, "" Under the provisions of the Sugar Bounty Abolition A ct and the Sugar Excise Rejseal Act you are entitled to pocket this money; out for goodness' sake give .it back to us, because we are being denounced in Parliament for having committed a great blunder."" Does the Minister of Trade and Customs deny that it was the intention of the Legislature that the Sugar Excise Repeal Act should apply only to sugar upon which bounty had not been paid ?",20
57,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,Why did not the late Government put that in their Bill 1,20
58,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If the honourable gentleman had held office as Minister of Trade and Customs, I do not think he would have blundered in this way.",20
59,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Does the honourable member repudiate the agreement made by his Government ?,21
60,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I repudiate nothing. Does my honourable friend say that the matter was of such pressing urgency that if there was a defect in the Act he could not wait for a fortnight and give Parliament an opportunity to amend it? Were the interests of the sugar-growing industry going to be sacrificed by the continuance, for a fortnight longer, of conditions that had prevailed in Queensland for the last twelve years ? No ; the position is that the present Government have, in consequence of their blundering maladministration, sacrificed, except for the good grace of the people directly interested in the matter, the revenue of the Commonwealth to the extent of probably £150,000. Apparently they themselves did not discover the difficulty. It was pointed out to them. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company said to the Government, "" We are not entitled to this money. You have got yourselves into a fix, but we shall try to get you out of it."" Would that company have gone to the Labour Administration in that way ? ",21
61,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable member, for spontaneous combustion, says "" Yes."" When he gets out of his political swaddling clothes, and has a little more to do with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, his answer will be different. It cannot be denied that the present Administration , within less than two months after taking office, have exhibited absolute incompetence and a total disregard for the people's interest. Now the Prime Minister goes off to a Women's Political League meeting in Toorak, and whines because, he says, the Opposition will not grant any pairs. I would remind honourable members Liberal party that when they accepted the responsibility of contesting an election they took upon themselves the obligation of being in their places in this House if they were returned. Our party, i adopts my view of the matter, will refuse, save in exceptional cases, to give pairs. I do not say that there will not arise cases in which it will be satisfactory to both parties to give pairs, but in ordinary circumstances, if we were to give pairs indiscriminately, my honourable friends opposite, when they found themselves hard pressed, would have simply to rely on our good graces to pair up their recalcitrants, and so to remain in office for ever. We are not taking part in a business of that description. The Opposition will give every consideration to the Government so far as the conduct of legitimate business is concerned, but when the Prime Minister throws a policy statement on the table, saying in effect, "" Take this, without any explanation,"" and we find in that printed statement proposals designed to destroy the effective legislation which was passed by our party during the three years that they were in office, he cannot expect any consideration from us. There have been some achievements on the part of the present Government. My distinguished successor, the Postmaster-General, conceived the brilliant idea of carrying farmers' produce, such as eggs and butter, by parcels post. He entered upon his duties with all the enthusiasm of a newcomer, but I am in clined to think that by this time he has realized that there are many difficulties to contend with in connection with the Department, and that an enormous in crease of expenditure would be involved in so extending country mail services as to make them a convenient means of carrying such produce. There is another proposal with which I am in absolute disagreement, and that is the declared in tention of the Government to place the Postal Department under the control of three Commissioners. The Department is, roughly speaking, carried on at a loss of about £500,000 a year, and the obligations which it has to accept in the effort to meet the necessities of the people, are tremendous. Wherever a few people are settled-fro m the Gulf of Carpentaria to Cape Leeuwin-the Department is under an obligation to give those people some sort of communication with the larger centres of population. There of the are, consequently, in the outlying districts, many mail services that are run at a very heavy loss. Whilst administering the Department, I always kept an eye on legitimate expenditure, but never f it worried very considerably about making the Postal Department a paying proposition.  ber serious?",21
62,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am.  applications made, during the honourable member's rigime, to various settlers to make good any deficit on the working of a line?",21
63,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I have already said that the Department is run at great loss, that it has to meet the necessities of residents of sparsely-settled and outlying districts, and must bring them into touch with civilization. It was because I was endeavouring to bring people so situated - the pioneers of any industry in any part of the Commonwealth-int o touch with centres of population that I did not give first consideration to the question of whether or not the Department was a paying concern.  General, the honourable member invited these people to pay.",22
64,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I shall tell the honourable member what I did. When we took office the rule in the Department was to call upon the persons served by a mail service to an outlying district to make up any deficit that arose. They were asked to take the revenue from the service, and to make good any deficit. The honourable member for Barrier, as Postmaster General, liberalized that rule, his policy being to establish a required service, to give the residents concerned the revenue from it , and to pay 25 per cent, of the loss incurred. He initiated that system, and when I took office I made the conditions still more liberal. I provided that in the case of these out-back settlements the parties served should be allowed to take the revenue from the service, and that the Department should bear half the loss incurred, and I did the same thing in regard to country telephonic . extensions.  to the congested centres ?",22
65,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"In the congested centres the mail services were al l payable. There is no doubt about the centres paying for the country extensions, and personally I think it is a fair thing. It is because I believe in extending these facilities, whether they are likely to be paying propositions or not, that I am absolutely opposed to a Commission which would be independent of Parliament taking control of the Department, which assists so much in the settlement of this country, and contributes to the peace and happiness of the residents in the more remote parts. As an indication of the tremendous extension that is going on in connection with the Postal Department, I might mention that from the 1st January, 1911, to the 1st January, 1913, 356 new post-offices were opened, 8,475 miles of telegraphic lines erected, and 98,000 miles of telephone lines constructed. The great bulk of the telephone extensions- 1 believe that I could say with safety 70 per cent, of them-hav e been in the direction of providing facilities for the outbackers who had no conveniences before.",22
66,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,What about the undergrounding in the cities?,22
67,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,That does not affect the mileage.,22
68,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,It means an expendias Postmasterture of money.,22
69,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I am not now dealing with the expenditure of money.,22
70,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"Where are the more remote parts where 98,000 miles of telephone lines were constructed ? None at ail.",22

73,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That issue does not enter into the consideration of this question.  in it , though.",22
74,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I do not say that it is not a factor. I am not questioning that fact for a moment, but arguing against the proposal of the Government to place the Postal Department under a Commission.",22
75,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,No hope.,22
76,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am very glad to hear the interjection. As long as we have the honourable gentleman with us the proposal is doomed, because the Government majority will have gone. A f t e r getting this assurance it is almost unnecessary to further argue the matter, because, sir, in that case you would be powerless. I do suggest quite seriously to my honourable friends opposite that, whilst with the bigger projects of railway extension and the control of Government railways, a Commission may be successful, to place the Postal Department, touching as it does the interest and the convenience of every person in the community, under a Commission where a business proposition is the only thing which would commend itself, would be calculated to inflict the greatest possible hardship on the outbackers in this country.",22
77,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Would not that mean that the whole policy would have to be handed over to the Commissioners?,23
78,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am absolutely opposed to the whole policy being handed over to the Commissioners. If it tended to create a Commission, subject to the Minister, so that he would have the last say on a question, it is tantamount to appointing three general managers.",23
79,Mr ANSTE Y,Unknown,Without power to manage.,23
80,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"In my opinion, to place the Department under three men would be highly unsatisfactory. What has happened in the past in connection with Deputy Postmasters-Geueral, who - ought to accept more responsibility? they did accept responsibility, honourable members used to bring the proposition before Parliament and the Deputies very often had to swallow what they had said When I believed that a Deputy Postmaster-General had reasonable ground for the action he was taking, I always encouraged him to do the business in his own State, without referring it to Melbourne. I suggest to my successor that the more he can get the Deputy Postmasters-General to accept responsibility and deal witn matters in their own States, the more satisfactory will be the results to the country.  them more power?",23
81,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I did, and I backed them up very solidly. My successor has distinguished himself in another direction. Almost before he had got used to his chair in the office, he willed that the kangaroo stamp was to go.",23
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"He was quick off the mark, was he not?",23
83,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Yes ; he was quicker in saying that the kangaroo stamp was to go than he is in getting the other stamp' out. He announced that the new stamp was to be out in a few weeks. Mr AG AB WYNNE - In three months, it was said ; and it will be out in less than that period.",23
84,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That was not stated in the announcement that the kangaroo stamp was to go. My honourable friend is in this extraordinary position, that while he announced that the new stamp would be out in three months, and says now that it will be out in less than that period, he told the honourable member for Maribyrnong the other night that he is still prepared to accept suggestions.",23
85,Mr AGAB WYNNE,Unknown,So I am. There are more stamps than one to be issued.,23
86,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I think that my honis in - orable friend realizes now that, while it was very easy to say that a thing was going to happen in the Department, it is not easy to do the thing when the responsibility falls upon him. A suggestion has been made in regard to showing loyalty by putting the King's head on the stamp.",23
87,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Who is responsible for the kangaroo stamp f,23
88,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I was the Postmaster General when the kangaroo stamp was issued, and I accept responsibility for it . When There is just a chance that it may not disappear. My successor may disappear from the Department before the kangaroo stamp does.",23
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not like that.,23
90,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"When my honourable friend sat on this side of the chamber, he used to denounce those who sat on the Government bench; but the first thing he did when he got on his feet as Prime Minister was to whine, "" Why will you not give us pairs?"" Then he went all round the country addressing meetings and saying, "" We want fight."" The fight has only just begun. I do not think the honourable member wants much fight.",23
91,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,He would rather have th© pairs.,23
92,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Yes . The honourable gentleman looks very comfortable on the Treasury bench. But it was put to him very nicely by the honourable member for Grey yesterday that, if it is not hypocrisy he indulges in at different meetings, and if he really does want fight, he pretty has only to do one thing when we take the division on our amendment; he has only to absent himself or to let one of his supporters be absent, and that will be the end of his Government. We recognise that the position is intolerable. Ministers have no right to make the Speaker, who should be the unbiased custodian of the rights and privileges of members, an instrument for keeping them on the Treasury bench. We have never had a position like this before, and I hope we never shall again.",23
93,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,Let us go to the country.,24
94,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"That is what we say, long. and the Prime Minister says that he wishes to go to the country. for doing so is open, unless his talk is merely so much wind.",24
95,Mr AHERN,Unknown,The Opposition desires that only one branch of the Legislature shall go to the country.,24
96,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,We wish to send this House to the country.,24
97,Mr BOYD,Unknown,It has just come from country.,24
98,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Yes , but the position intolerable. Mr Speaker has been a partisan instead of an impartial judge.",24
99,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memthe ber must withdraw that statement. He has no right to cast reflections on Chair.,24
100,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"O u t of deference you, sir, I withdraw it unreservedly; but should the occasion arise when you must occupy that position, I shall repeat what. I have said.",24
101,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"The Constitution makes provision for what has been done; why, then, does the honourable member make so much fuss about it ? If the Labour party were in our position, what would they do?",24
102,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable mempaper, ber sees nothing objectionable in present intolerable situation. Honourable members opposite, when they shouted chorus in support of the Prime Minister's statement that he wants fight, and desires to go to the country, were like a boy whistling in the night, in the effort convince himself that he is not frightened. Reverting to the Postmaster-General's i tention to alter the design of the postage stamp, let me say that I do not think we should place the King's head on our stamps. The question of loyalty does not enter into the consideration of this General. matter. The Minister has had to get the artist who drew the design that took first prize to alter it , adding some wattle fellow. and other things. If the kangaroo stamp is to be known as the "" Frazer stamp,"" this is to be the "" Wynne stamp.""",24
103,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The winning stamp.,24

105,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member The way for Darwin ought to criticise us.,24
106,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"He can defend himself. A postage stamp is one of the best advertising mediums the country' can have. Every letter leaving our shores bears an advertisement of the country on its stamp. Stamps with the King's head in the design are 'generally regarded as the proper to communications from Great Britain . In designing our stamp we put is into it the outline of the coast of Ausmade tralia. The stamp shows a White Australia, indicating the Commonwealth's policy in regard to its population. In centre of the stamp is a kangaroo, an animal peculiar to Australia, and comthe mon to every State of the Union. That animal was drawn from the design which to took the second prize.",24
107,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,It looks as though it had gone through a six-years' drought.,24
108,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Probably had the officer who was formerly responsible for the printing of stamps in South Australia been retained in the State employ, instead of being given charge of the Commonwealth stamp printing, the design would have been produced on better the perforations would have been the better, and the gum would have been better. Then there would not have been in half as much trouble about the stamp. The manner in which the stamp was turned out by the Government Stamp. Printer led to most of the trouble. The to design which the Postmaster-General proposes to substitute for the present den - sign will not advertise the country.

155,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Richmond represents a constituency he understands, and he does not take up the attitude that his special mission in life is to look after the interests of the farmers. On the Government side there are ten who farm the farmer in Chancery-lane, and the others deal very considerably in the by-products of the farmer instead of being directly associated with the land. I asked the Attorney-General the other day if he was associated with the Marconi Company. I submitted to the honourable gentleman what I thought to be a very fair series of questions. The Marconi Company had an action against the Commonwealth Government for the right, to inspect, and they were successful by a majority of the High Court in getting an order to inspect, the'decision of the majority of the High Court being ultimately sustained by the Privy Council through the Privy Council refusing the right to appeal. Now, the Attorney-General in that action by the Marconi Company against the Commonwealth was counsel for the Marconi Company, and naturally became cognisant of all the facts the Marconi Company could get against the Commonwealth. This is the position of the Marconi Company, so far as their Australian rights are concerned. They originally intended to set out in opposition to the Telefunken Company, disputing the rights of that company in Australia. When the Commonwealth, as a consequence of the change of Government, and another decision, adopted the Commonwealth system assigned to them by Mr Balsillie, the Marconi Company and Australian Wireless-the company having the Telefunken rights in Australia-amalgamate d their Australian rights in order to fight the Commonwealth. They stopped the contemplated action between themselves, and proceeded as one party to fight the Government. They offered their rights to the Commonwealth for £45,000. I say that, in my judgment, whilst the honourable member for Flinders occupies the position of Attorney-General, he ought not to be associated in any way with a company which directly or indirectly is challenging the position of the Government. It is all very well for my honourable friend to say that he has handed this particular matter over to his colleague, the Minister of External Affairs. I accept the honourable gentleman's assurance on that point, but I want to point out the position in which the honourable gentleman has placed himself in having a general retainer from the Marconi Company, which is in litigation with the Commonwealth. Suppose that the Minister of External Affairs comes down to the Cabinet and recommends a compromise with the Marconi Company to bring about the stoppage of the action between them and the Government, what position will the Attorney-General occupy then? He is not disposer! to tell me. He told me very politely the other day that I did not understand what a general retainer meant. I think I do. I believe that the honourable gentleman would not be holding a general retainer from the Marconi Company without being paid for it , and, if he is in the employ of the Marconi Company, how is he going to do justice to the interests of the people of Australia in a position such as that which I have described ? In my judgment, the honourable gentleman's position is positively and absolutely untenable. If he is going to retain the position of Attorney-General, he should dissociate himself absolutely from every interest which is likely to clash with the interests of the Commonwealth. may say that I am in very distinguished company in holding this view, and I do not submit the opinion merely as my own. A scandal, involving the British Cabinet, arose only the other day over this same Marconi Company, and Sir Rufus Isaacs and Mr LLOYD - George, of the Asquith Administration, had that Government absolutely tottering in the as a consequence of their association with outside interests. I want to remind the Attorney-General that it was not in the Marconi Company that was dealing with the Imperial Government that the M in isters referred to had their interests, but the Marconi Company formed for the purpose of exploiting the American market. There was no association between that company and the Imperial Government at all. I propose to read, for the edification of the Attorney-General, what Mr . Asquith said in connection with this matterProceeding to challenge some of the standards of Ministerial conduct which had been set up during the controversy, the Prime Minister formulated a code of rules of "" positive obligation."" They were these :Ministers ought not to enter into any transaction whereby their private pecuniary interest may even conceivably come into conflict with their public duty. How does that f it my honourable friend? May not his pecuniary interest in holding a general retainer for the Marconi Company, which is contesting a matter with the Commonwealth Government at the present time, conceivably clash with the interests of the public? My honourable friend has his own code of morals, evidently, and the code of positive obligation set out by Mr Asquith is of no use to him. Mr Asquith went on to sayNo Minister is justified in any circumstances in using official information that is given to him as a Minister for his own private profit or for that of his friends. I say q u it e frankly that I do not think my honourable f r i e n d w o u l d do that ; but there is another r u l e l a i d d o w n . No Minister ought to put himself in a position to be tempted to use his official influence in support of schemes or in furtherance of contracts in regard to which he has an undisclosed private interest. I do not think that my honourable friend is touched by that rule either.  ing with the case of men who were shareI holders in the company.",28
156,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Mr Asquith does not refer to shareholders when he saysMinisters ought not to enter into any lrans-i*i action whereby their private pecuniary interestTjjg may even conceivably come into conflict with their public duty. The honourable member for Echuca cannot get over that. There is, however, still balance another rule laid down which seems to fit my honourable friend the AttorneyGeneralNo Minister ought to accept anv kind of favour from persons who are in negotiation with or seeking to enter into contractual or pecuniary relations with the Government. That hits the Attorney-General where he lives, does it not ? - If it does not, all I can say is that the code of morals formulated by Mr Asquith, as a consequence of the indiscretion of members of his Government which made the Administration totter in the balance, apparently does not appeal to the Attorney-General at all. Mr W . H . IRVINE - On the contrary, I think it is a very good code.",29
157,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman has broken his silence at last,* and will he tell me now that he accepts a retainer from the Marconi Company for nothing ?",29
158,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,No .,29
159,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Then my honourable friend is pecuniarily interested as a consequence of getting the Marconi Company's work.,29
160,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,No .,29
161,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"He is not ? My honourable friend says that he gets money from the Marconi Company, and then says that he is not pecuniarily interested.",29
162,Mr BOYD,Unknown,This is a kind of billet which the honourable member for K a l goorlie does not understand.,30
163,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It is a kind of billet which I do not want to understand. want Ministers, no matter to which side they may belong, to be absolutely free as members of the Cabinet. my honourable friend is in the employ of the Marconi Company, and he is Mr W. H . IBVINE - No .",30
164,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable gentlei man gets a retainer in order that Marconi Company n.ay the first call on his services should they require them. They pay a certain him in return for having the first on his services.

IBVINE - I believe, I do not know, that they are negotiating with the Government.",30
165,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Here , then, is extraordinary position. of things to bring about. Suppose that the Marconi Company are negotiating with the Commonwealth Government; suppose that a proposition is agreed to by the Attorney-General's colleague, the Minister of External Affairs, and matter is brought before the Cabinet ratification. What friend going to do then ? Mr W . H . IBVINE to do? It depends upon what the proposals are.",30
166,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Will the honourable gentleman vote upon the matter ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Certainly .,30
167,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"He will? Then his is a code of honour which can be tolerated only in a lawyer. It is a code of honour for subscribing to which the newspapers would absolutely drive any man side of the House out of public life. one of us would be permitted to such a position. We should be denounced from one end of Australia to the other getting entangled in the financial interest of the Commonwealth and the public interest clashed with private interests. I say that it is an intolerable position. It is one to which I the Prime Minister ought to have his attention particularly directed, and it is one that ought not to be permitted to conWhen tinue.

IRVINE - It is always in the honourable member's power, if he thinks t right, when this motion is disposed of, the to, formulate a motion which will raise be able to have this question.",30
168,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I have not the sum to slightest objection to formulating a mocall tion on this particular question. I have is devoted more attention to it today than in the limited time at my disposal would down justify if I intended to travel over the obwhole gamut of matters that have been raised in this House; but the issue apfavour pears to me to be of such importance that with or I shall willingly accept my honourable friend's invitation to test it by a separate motion, in order to see whether honourable the members opposite are prepared to tolerate the position of affairs that has been with revealed. I shall be glad to have an opportunity of asking them whether they apthough prove of the Attorney-General's action in accepting a general retainer from a company which is doing its best, and has done an its best, to mulct the Commonwealth in It is a nice state heavy damages.",30

172,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I should like to say a few more words affecting the Attorney General before he leaves the chamber. We read in the newspapers the other day that he had accepted a position as a director of a bank in this city.,30
173,Mr BOYD,Unknown,What a shocking crime!,30
174,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It is a question of how on this honourable members view these things. No The Attorney-General's colleague, the occupy Postmaster-General, immediately on assuming office resigned from the directorfor ship of a bank. He washed his hands of business in which the business.",30
175,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"He had to, because he knew he would be so busy in cleaning up his predecessor's work.",31
176,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"But the Attorney General took on a bank directorship. Can he not imagine that the banking interests of the Commonwealth are likely to clash with the interests of the bank of which he is a director ? We had the Treasurer saying a few nights ago that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank had too much power. We are promised banking legislation. That legislation may, or may not, interfere with the power of the Governor of the Bank. It certainly will affect the question of the gold reserve. I say, therefore, that the Commonwealth banking interests and the interests of the private banks are in direct conflict. Very likely the banking institution with which the Attorney-General is now connected by reason of the directorship he has accepted, may be affected.",31
177,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,A bank manager has said that the Commonwealth Bank is going to strengthen the private institutions.,31
178,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It may do that, and yet be in opposition to the private banks as far as business is concerned. The At torney-General, as the law adviser of the Government, will be responsible for drafting the new banking legislation. is to say, he will have the drafting of the legislation affecting the interests of a bank of which he is a director. In otlier words, he occupies a position on the d i rectorate of an opposition show.",31
179,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Why did the Postmasterber General resign his bank directorship ?,31

188,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"This is a Government of marvellous achievements. They have threatened to abolish the present postage stamp; they have abolished preference to unionists; they have sacked men on the transcontinental railway, at Cockburn Sound, and at Cockatoo Island; and, in cidentally, they have thrown away revenue to the extent of £150,000 by their bungling in the sugar business. The Treasurer professes to be very enthusiastic over the matter of the construction of the trans-Australian railway. But, so far, his enthusiasm has resulted only in 60 miles of earthworks having been built, and in 9 miles of rails having been laid.",31
189,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,Unknown,We have not the trucks.,31

230,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Is that the place where the late Government had another banquet ?,33
231,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I was not at any banquet. That interjection is typical of the taste and manners of my honourable friend. As soon as one expresses an opinion in regard to work at a particular place he associates it with banquets or junketings.,33
232,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Y o u always had them.,33
233,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"And my honourable friend used to take his whack of them, too.",33
234,Mr KELLY,Unknown,No. 1 was never invited.,33
235,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I was not at any of them. Many statements have been made by honourable members opposite as to the party that is really assisting the farmer. As I have already pointed out, the Government and their supporters comprise ten lawyers, as well as squatters and commission agents, and all these are the friends of the farmer! There are only two genuine farmers on that side of the House. On the other hand, the Labour party, while in office, did something practical to assist The base the farmers. We introduced and carried into law the Federal land tax, which made Bay is the squatters disgorge some of their best land and cut it up into blocks so that it could be tilled by the willing hands of the country. During the first year of the operation of the tax, £20,000,000 worth of land was made available.",33
236,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The Commissioner says that the cutting up that took place consisted only of family subdivisions.,33
237,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,He does not; but he does say a good deal has been done in that direction with the object of evading the tax. Honourable members opposite talk about the farm employee of today beiug the farmer of tomorrow.,33
238,Mr RILEY,Unknown,He is not likely to be until he gets better wages.,33
239,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Where is the farm employee to obtain the money with which to buy a farm ?,33

241,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Does he ? The truth is that the farmer of tomorrow is not the working man, but the son of the farmer I merely of today. I know as much about farming as does the honourable member for Wimmera. I am the son of a farmer, Men have and was brought up on a farm. Out of the wages they receive not 10 per cent, of the farm hands can hope to save sufficient to enable them to become farmers. Honourable members opposite say that their special mission in life is to look after the producers. The men who are looking after, the producers of this country, however, are to be found on this side of the House.",33
242,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Is that why they tax their agricultural machinery ?,33
243,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,We tax the squatter so that more land may be made available for the farmers.,33
244,Mr CONROY,Unknown,And tax all agricultural machinery.,33
245,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"When the Tariff is before us, what does my honourable friend intend to do with regard to agricultural machinery ?",33
246,Mr CONROY,Unknown,I intend to try to free it from taxation.,33
247,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Will the honourable member vote against his own Prime M in ister, who says that he is going to maintain the present Tariff?",33
248,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The Prime Minister simply allows the matter to remain where it is for the present, because tliere is no hope of a change.",34
249,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I regret that this dialogue is cutting into the limited time at my disposal. The Treasurer' has said that he is going to maintain the present Tariff policy "" as may from time to time be determined by the electors."" That is really the fiscal policy of honourable members opposite. In other words, they say, "" We will do this, but if it does not suit we will alter it . "" We say that, while they remain in power, our social legislation is in danger, and there can be no doubt that it is. It is not long since the present Attorney-General, speaking in this House of the old-age pension system, said I feel that it is not only repugnant to common sense, but opposed to the best instincts of our people, that we should plant here a tree which will not stop at the growth that it has already got, but which will go on growing if we do not substitute for it something based upon the contributory system. That was his declaration, and it sums up the attitude of the Government. We contend that the old-age and invalid pensions systems are in danger while under their control.",34
250,Mr KELLY,Unknown,No wonder the honourable member has crowded this charge into the last five minutes of his speech.,34
251,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I ask the Government Whip, who has remained silent, whether the Attorney-General is a man who is likely to eat his own words? Do honourable members opposite say he was only joking when he made this statement?",34
252,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The last quotation made from his speech stopped short deliberately at one word. If that last word had been given, his statement would have appeared in a different light.",34
253,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If the honourable member thinks that anything of the kind has occurred in this case, I invite him to read the quotation which I just made. Here is the copy of Hansard in which it appears.",34
254,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is a little bit suspicious, because the honourable member has put it into the last five minutes of his speech.",34
255,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Her e is yet another result of the honourable member's association with Oxford; he has developed a suspicious mind.,34
256,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The Attorney-General distinctly said, some time ago, that he would not alter the existing pension system.",34
257,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I have no doubt that since the Attorney-General is able to justify his association with the Marconi Company, and his acceptance of a seat on the directorate of a bank-sinc e he is able to find the holding of such offices consistent with his occupancy of the Attorney-Generalship-h e will be able to adopt an attitude with regard to old-age pensions that will make him acceptable to his colleagues. I submit, however, that the social legislation of this country is in danger while the present Government remain in office; that they have not submitted any proposal to bring about more reasonable conditions for the people, and that in deciding to place the Tariff under the control of the Inter-State Commission they are simply putting off the consideration of that question. Those who have been associated with Commissions know what such a proposal means. It means an end to Tariff revision for the rest of this session. No serious effort is going to be made by the Government to do anything except to try to destroy the beneficent legislation which was placed upon the statute-book of the Commonwealth by the late Administration. There is no indication of any effort on their part to build up; their policy is to do nothing except to alter the legislation of the previous Government. I wish them luck, but I do not think that they will remain where they are long enough to do so.",34
258,Mr KENDELL,Unknown,"Corio) [4.58] - As a new member, I rise with a great deal of diffidence, and with the hope that the House will adopt the suggestion made the other day by the large-hearted Whip cf the Opposition when he said, "" Give the new members a show."" I feel that the Opposition will realise, before I have completed my remarks, that I need all the show they can give me, and, what is more, that I deserve it . Coming to the policy put forward by the Government, I may say at once that I can generally support it. The first paragraph in the policy statement deals with the question of electoral reform, and that, to my mind, is a very important one. I have listened with a great deal of attention to the debate, and, whilst I think that the speeches have excelled possibly in length as much as in anything else, they have undoubtedly been of a high order. am not one of those who declare that great abuses of our electoral law took place during the last general election; but I defy any member of the Opposition to say that great abuses might not have taken place without a chance of detecting them. We know quite well that it is not wise to place temptation in the way of any man, and in the amendment of the law which the Government propose, they will, I presume, take temptation out of the way of the electors in this respect. It has been stated that the proposals mentioned in the Ministerial programme are too ambiguous. Naturally the Government were not able to go into any details, but I presume that, in any measure they submit, they wil l endeavour to improve the electoral law. opinion, the improvement of the electoral law will not be perfect unless it establishes preferential voting and restores the postal vote. The ex-Prime Minister said that one of the grave charges he had to make against the postal vote was that the employers had a great "" p u l l "" on the employees and their wives in mining districts and other places. The employees and their wives, he said, were obliged to vote against the employers, and in connection with the postal vote the employers had a lot of influence. In the same speech, he mentioned that more postal votes were recorded in Kooyong, where there are no miners, and very few employees, than were recorded in the whole of Queensland, where most of the miners and the employees reside. It goes to show that his statement about employers endeavouring to influence electors had no force at all in connection with a large ber of the postal votes recorded in Kooyong. W it h regard to the absent vote, I do not think that one of my honourable friends on the Opposition side will deny that there are possibilities of abuse. I do not intend to traverse the ground which has been covered by various speakers, but to touch only a few questions. In the first place, I want to refer to the rural workers. The minds of various speakers in this debate have been exercised as to the occupations of honourable members sitting on this side. They say that they doubt if there is more than one farmer amongst us. I believe that I have the honour and glory of being that one farmer on this side. At any rate, I can claim that I am a farmer, 1 though possibly retired at present. The honourable member for Werriwa claims that he is a farmer, and he is just the stamp of man to make a good solid farmer. I can speak with some authority in connection with rural workers. I am not one of those who say that the rura l workers sliould be kept without the pale of some tribunal under which their work and wages may be regulated. I am not one of those who think that the rural workers are the only parties who should be kept outside. But, in my opinion, as I said before, the Federal Arbitration Court is not the right tribunal to settle industrial matters relating to rural production for the whole of Australia. It seems to me that any sort of Wages Boards or conferences between the In my masters and the men from the various districts would be the best means of settlin g industrial disputes. If you established cast-iron rules regarding the hours of labour, and how the men shall work in rural industries, you would simply deplete those industries and throw hundreds of rural employees out of work. The whole system would recoil upon tlieir own heads. That is where the trouble would come in . A sneering remark has been passed here in regard to share-farming. Now, in Australia today there are thousands of farmers who started as share-farmers. As an old rural worker I was able to start as a share-farmer many years before I could have started on my owu account. Many a man has started as a dairyman. An honourable member of this House has. started numbers of young men in dairying on the share system who are successf u l men today. I would strongly adnum- vise every young fellow who gets the chance to start on share-farming, assuming that he gets fair conditions under which to begin. Questions affecting the rural workers, it seems to me, should be settled distinctly between themselves and their employers. Let them confer together. The conditions vary so much in different parts of Australia that they call for varying treatment. I have in my pocket a copy of the rura l workers' log. I have not so much fault to find with the demand as to wages as with the conditions as to the hours of work. As we all know quite well, there are times in the year when a man may have the whole of his harvest hands waiting about the stable or elsewhere unable to do anything on accountof the wet weather. But when the sun. does shine, then they have to ""go for it"" for all they are worth. When I was actively engaged in farming, used to ""go for it,"" for they knew quite well that I would treat them fairly other directions. The trouble with regard to the present-day unionism is that Labour organizers-I will not call them agitators-do not want men, as the honourable member says, to rise and become farmers. On the contrary, they men to remain members of the union, contributing to its funds. As soon as men become farmers and employers, they are no longer any good to the organizers. Consequently the organizers are trying to get all the men into their organization and to breed strife. One or two other remarks have been made in this debate which astounded me. It has been stated by more than one honourable member that there have been no strikes as the result of arbitration awards. I want to know what is the difference between a strike and refusing to work. It was only in Monday's newspaper we read that shearers in a certain shed refused to go on, and cleared out because the boss had arranged to have his wool carted by a motor lorry. What is the difference between that act and a strike? The result is the same to an employer. statement that the Arbitration Court has brought about universal industrial is so much moonshine. I wish to compliment the Government, not only upon the appointment of the Inter-State mission, but upon its personnel. compliment them on the fact that one of the first duties devolving upon the Commission is to inquire into matters to the Tariff. One part of the amendment which has been launched against the Government relates to the Tariff. seems to me to be most astounding. Opposition say to the Government, "" You are not fit to occupy the Treasury because you have not done more in three weeks than we did in three Summed up, that is really the whole position. The late Government had three years in which to revise the Tariff on lines which should suit them at the moment. We have only to analyze the "" innards "" of this thing to discover why they did not revise the Tariff during their term of office, and are so to have it revised at once in the first session of the new Government. The existing Tariff is a huge revenue-producing Tariff. Under it our 'jnports have Mr Kendell. reached something like £70,000,000 per annum. The last Government opened its my men arms to this revenue, being anxious to splash money about, especially when the in election was coming on. Now, the Labour party do not want a revenue-producing Tariff. They know that money makes the mare to go, and that money talks, especially at election time, and the Liberal Government being in power, they are trywant ing to harass them by clamouring for a revision of the Tariff and a reduction of the revenue. I am of opinion that the Tariff should be revised. There is something wrong when 4,500,000 people import nearly £70,000,000 worth of goods per annum, although there are thousands of persons unemployed. A proper Tariff would enable all those persons to be employed in the manufacture of Australian raw material into finished goods for home consumption. The policy that we should pursue should make that possible. I am glad that the Government intend to work in the harmony with the Governments of the States. This is a time when much good might be done by co-operation between the Commonwealth and the State Governments. There is a partial drought in South Australia, which may bring great The loss there; and there may be droughts in other States. As a result, there will be peace a falling off in our exports and less employment. This is, therefore, a proper time for the Commonwealth and State GoCom- vernments to co-operate in great national I also works in which both are interested, such as the unification of railway gauges and the conservation of water. I am in favour relating of going into the money market to borrow for reproductive and permanent works. It is unwise to tax the people off the land so It that posterity may possess permanent The works free from debt. That is a wrong policy. During the past three years, the bench, relations between Commonwealth and State Governments have not been haryears."" monious ; but such a state of affairs is not in the best interests of Australia. The honourable member for Bass last night referred to a farmers society in Tasmania present which he had been asked to join. He is a gentleman of such splendid proportions that it might be taken as a personal reflection if I made any reference to the anxious fable of the mountain and the mouse. What I wish to point out is that, although he was asked to join this union, there was no compulsion. No bluestone arguments were used. The committee of the society seemed eminently respectable, most of them adding "" J . P . "" to their names. There is no analogy between a society like that and a trade union. A farmer in Tasmania may or may not join the society as he likes; but the unions seek to compel workmen to join them. I am an old worker, having commenced at the age of ten, and no one has greater sympathy with the workers that I have; but I know that if my friends tie up the workers with too much legislation they will chafe under it .",34

261,Mr KENDELL,Unknown,"It was rather unfair of the honourable member for Darling, in dealing with the receipts and expenditure of the Australian Workers Union, to strike an average for a period of twenty-five years, because in the beginning the Australian Workers Union had few members, and the contribution was, I think, only 5s. a year. Had the receipts of late years been given, it would be seen that a great deal of money is paid into that union. Where it goes, I do not know.",37

It has been said that the land tax has had the effect of bursting up large estates. Those who introduced it said that it would burst up large estates and provide revenue for defence purposes; but, apparently, it does neither. imposition of the tax and Socialistic legislation generally has frightened people from buying land, so that not so much is changing hands today as was changing hands three years ago. did succeed in bursting up large estates, there would be no revenue from it In order to raise revenue for defence purposes, the exemption will have to be lowered-that is inevitable, if the present policy is continued. There is one particular defect in the land tax to which I desire to call attention. For this defect, I do not blame the men who in troduced the measure, because it cannot always be foreseen what is necessary. It was said by the Labour Government that they were going to make it easier and cheaper for young men to get on the land. Under the old conditions of three years ago, it was possible for a young fellow to acquire land with a deposit of 5 petcon t., and it was a common occurrence in the Western District of Victoria to take 10 per cent., but, under the operation of the land tax, 15 per cent, is demanded. are doing so",37
264,Mr WEST,Unknown,"A man has to possess land worth £5,000 before he pays any tax.",37
265,Mr KENDELL,Unknown,"I am now speaking of the deposit that is necessary when a young fellow wishes to purchase a farm from a big land-owner. Another regulaare not even tion under the land tax which appears to me to work harshly is that which imposes a fine of 10 per cent, when, by some oversight, a man may be only two days behind in paying the tax. Considering the time that the man is behind, this means in many cases a fine at the rate of some 600 per cent, per annum; and the law should be altered so that the fine shall be at the rate of 10 per cent., with a minimum penalty of halfa-crown or 5s. It is not fair, because of a little omission, for which the taxpayer is uot really responsible, to fine him at the rate of 500 or 600 per cent. We have been repeatedly told during the last three days that there will be a dissolution of the House of Representatives, because, if one of the members on the Government side remains away for one day, the whole business may be stopped. But the position today is the same as when the Leader of the Opposition tendered his resignation. Why did he not ask for a dissolution then? If a dissolution is a good thing today, it was a good thing at that time; and, under the circumstances, I think it would be wise if I endeavoured to pour a little "" oil on troubled waters."" The Our friends opposite, it seems to me, are suffering a certain amount of disappointment at the reverse they have met; and are now, as it were, "" getting it off their chest."" I believe, however, that, after If the tax this no-confidence question is decided, they will settle down to work, realizing that"" they have responsibilities to the electors, no matter on which side of the House they may sit. We can quite understand receiving a certain amount of "" vitriol "" from honourable members on thefront Opposition bench, because their position was better under the previous circumstances; but the rank and file are just as content as the rest of us, and none of them are, I believe, any more anxious to go before the electors than I am. The ex-Postmaster-General some reference to statements by Mr . Blackwood; but if we on this side were to condemn the whole of the Labour party for statements made by some union president or secretary, it would not be fair to them as a body. Mr Blackwood is presi dent of a certain Employers Federation, but a very small number of the employers of Australia are connected with that association. I know that I am not, and thousands of others are in the same position as myself; and I therefore contend that honourable members on the Government side of the House should not be held responsible for any statements made by a prominent Liberal in any other place. We are here, I take it , to do the best we can in the interests of Australia, and that, I believe, the present Government are desirous of doing; but, so fa r as I have seen during this week, the Opposition are determined not to give them the opportunity. I trust, however, that, after this little "" blow o u t ,"" honourable members will settle down to work, when we shall be able, the whole of us, to justify our existence here. If not, then, as I said before, let us clear the decks for action.",37
266,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [5.29]. said - Some honourable members, who, like I myself, had the honour of a seat in the last Parliament, must feel it a ter for regret that eight months have elapsed since we had an opportunity to really deal with the affairs of the country. This afternoon, when the Leader of the Opposition made a request for some i formation, he was politely told-and am not altogether quarrelling with the ply-that , owing to the no-confidence bate, no information could be given. am sure that a great number of the versial matters. supporters of the Government are very much dissatisfied with the position of affairs today. Many people outside this Chamber also consider that the business the country might be in progress. Let go back to the time of the general elecopposing tion. A few weeks after the election the country knew the relative strength of the parties, with our friends opposite in a majority of one in this House, and with an overwhelming majority against them in the Senate. Then we heard the Labour Government had resigned. Some people blamed them for doing so, but I think they acted rightly. I have not the slightest doubt tliey would have been put made out if they had faced the House. Mr Ho AVE - Rightl y so, too.",38
267,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"I am not going to touch that aspect of the question, but some of my constituents have said to me, "" You know these new men; what do you think of thern ? "" I said that they were a fairly able body of men, and that I had no doubt they could carry on the affairs of the country. But they said, "" What do you think they are going to do? "" and I had to reply that I did not think any one' knew, though very possibly they might adopt a certain attitude in regard to public business. I knew that the bulk of tlieir supporters did not care much about a policy before the country. We have heard a great deal on the other side about their policy, but I do not think that during the election the Government or their supporters worried very much about a policy. In fact, they had only one policy-to get the Labour Administration out, and to get themselves in .",38
268,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Hear , hearl",38
269,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"The honourable member admits that I am right. When I was asked by my constituents what I thought the new Government would do, I they might stop in office a long while. thought they might interpret the verdict of the country to be that the Commonmatwealth was of the opinion that there was ample Liberal legislation from the previous Administration, and that Australia needed a spell of legislative quietude. There are still many non-controversial n - matters that could be dealt with under I the powers given us by the Constitution, reand many people thought the Government demight have gone on those lines, and in I troduced legislation upon non-controTn that case, it would have been impossible for members of the Opposition to hamper Ministers in legislation proposed in the best interests of of the country; in fact, we have no intenus tion or ever will have the intention of such legislation; provided, of course, there was in it no attack upon our principles. I do not wish to enumerate the many things we are permitted to legislate upon under the Constitution. New members may not be familiar with the legislation to which I refer, although the old members know it well; but there is one in particular, the question of marriage aud divorce, which must be settled by this Parliament at some time. These matters are not party questions, and that the business of the country could have been proceeded with was the opinion of many outside; but despite that opinion we were doomed to a grievous disappointment. No sooner did the House meet than the honourable gentleman at the head of the Government, in placing his memorandum or manifesto on the table, gave us to understand emphatically and distinctly the attitude of the present Administration towards past legislation. It was a declaration of war on the workers of Australia. I am quite willing to admit that the honourable member for Corio does not understand the game like those on the Ministerial bench, but they were aware that putting the memorandum on the table was a challenge that members of the Opposition could not ignore. H a d we ignored it , and accepted the invitation of the Government to go on with the business of the country, Ministers would have had their tongues in their cheeks, and gone to Sydney, and said, "" We put a memorandum on the table of the House, and challenged the Opposition, but they took it like whipped curs, and we can walk over them any time we like."" That is what the present - A dministration would have done if they had had the opportunity. As I say, I was charitable enough to believe that they would have gone on the lines I have already indicated, considering the state of parties, but that was not their game. Honourable members on the Government side ought to realise that we exist here in consequence of a British Act of Parliament; that we take our life from the Mother Parliament in the Old Land, and that we belong to a people who understand parliamentary government better than their brethren of European civilization. And what has been laid down by the greatest statesman, who has spoken our language? That whenever a measure of reform has been passed the Conservative party cannot repeal it . That principle has been recognised by the Marquis of Salisbury-who , although he was a Conservative, was a statesman, and not a political "" messer ""-and Lord Derby. All the distinguished and able men of the Conservative party and not the "" rag-tag and bobtail "" allowed to act unrestrained in Australia-admi t that reform legislation once passed by the Parliament of England cannot be reversed, but here in Australia we have the new doctrine, that whenever the Conservative party get into power they are to reverse all the legislation passed by their opponents, or, if not all, certain sections of it . I hope the country w i ll speak out in no unmeasured language against this monstrous innovation. For some time past the tide has run in a certain direction, and reforms have been carried, and now the Conservative party have come in to reverse them. We shall have endless trouble. British statesmen recognised such a course would lead to trouble, and laid down the principle I have indicated. It is left to the brilliant geniuses who adorn the Treasury bench in the Commonwealth Parliament today to lay down this new doctrine and set this pernicious precedent. Whatever the result of this debate may be, I have no doubt that before long the people will condemn it . I think that the Prime Minister must be aware of that. Probably no one knows the feeling of the people of Australia better. He has issued a declaration of war against the working classes of this country, and the man who goes into a job like that with a light heart may be a poli'tician, but he is not a statesman. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - That is very rough, but merited, I dare say.",38
270,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"That is right , and the honourable gentleman will get some more of it presently. I wish to say a word or two about the administration of the present Government. I think, in this connection, that our motion of censure was launched a little too soon, because we did not give the Government sufficient time in which to disclose their brilliant administrative abilities. Every day that passes gives only greater proof of their incapacity for the positions which they hold. However, the motion - was tabled with my hearty support, and with the support of all my friends on this side, for the reasons I have already given. A leading instance of the adminstration of the present Government occurred only a day or two ago. By legislation passed in the closing days of last session, the late Government repealed the bounty and Excise on sugar. The matter was one which had long bsen discussed between the Queensland and Commonwealth Governments. A condition precedent to the repeal of the Commonwealth legislation to which I have referred was that the Queensland Parliament should pass certain legislation for the maintenance of the White Australia policy, and, briefly, to guarantee protection to the workers of Queensland in this industry. fulfilment of that condition by the Queensland Parliament the Commonwealth Government undertook to repeal, by proclamation, the Acts providing for the bounty and Excise on sugar. In the first place, I should say that I have not seen, and do not know, what is contained in the Acts passed by the Queensland Parliament. No doubt the Government do know what they contain; but I am given to understand that, in order to preserve the White Australia policy, the Queensland Parliament has provided for an education test. Honourable members know that the value of this will largely depend upon the officers administering the test, and any' Japanese or other aliens who can pass the test applied will have a perfect right to settle and work in Queensland in the sugar industry. Some honourable members, in common with myself, do not believe that that gives a sufficient guarantee for the preservation of the White Australian policy.",39
271,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,The .test is exactly the same as that provided for in the Commonwealth Immigration Act . ',40
272,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,We opposed that on this side.,40
273,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,We enact anything else which would be approved by the British Government.,40
274,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"When my honourable friends talk about the British Government, I would ask them to be good enough to shoulder their own responsibilities, and let the British Government alone. The question of immigration from the point of view of the British Government is on a very different footing from the question of the employment of labour in the sugar industry. hear this reference to the British Government I am reminded of something which has been ringing in my mind all day, and which shows that the British Government are far more liberal than are the present Commonwealth Government. A wire has been received announcing the fact that His Majesty the K in g has given his assent to the Navigation Bill . mon with other honourable members representing ports in Australia, it was my opinion that it would be twelve months at least before those whose business it is to advise His Majesty would be able to see their way to tender him the advice upon which he has acted. Evidently they have had a strong reason for the Upon the advice they have given. I do not know what occurred in the British Cabinet, but I think I can make a pretty good guess as to what really occurred when the matter of the advice to be tendered to His Majesty in this connection came before the members of it . It is not difficult to realise that, with men like Mr Asquith, Mr LLOYD - George, Mr . Winston Churchill, the distinguished Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and others I could name in the Cabinet, the discussion would be something on these lines: ""The ship-owners of Great Britain are opposed to the measure, but the people of the Commonwealth of Australia are very strong on the question. The people of our Dominion overseas are so strong upon it that they regard the provisions of the measure as necessary to maintain their standard of living."" These British statesmen, no doubt, said, "" It is not desirable that there should be bad blood between us and any of our brethren across the seas. They feel strongly on this; they have fixed the mat: ter up in their own Parliament; and, in our opinion, they should be given what they require."" So far as this matter is concerned, I have no doubt that we shall could not find the British Government more liberal than the Government who occupy the opposite benches. I would advise my honourable friends not to talk so much about the British Government, but to let them alone. If we had the good fortune today to have a Government in the Commonwealth one-hundredth part as good as the present British Government, we should do remarkably well, and we should not be challenging them this afternoon on a motion of want-of-confidence. ReWhen I ferring again to the administration of the Government in the matter of the repeal of the bounty and B&cise on sugar, I may say that there were two contracting parties interested in the matter. Under the contract, certain legislation was to be passed in Queensland, and that having been passed, it was lef t to the present Government to issue a proclamation repealI n com- ing the Commonwealth Acts referred to. Honourable gentlemen who occupy the Treasury bench have taken an oath office to serve His Majesty the K in g how can they be said to have kept their oath when they have practically been parties to defrauding the revenue of Commonwealth of from £100,000 to £200,000 ? What was the position of Minister of Trade and Customs in this matter ? Here we had a compact between the Queensland Parliament on the one any amount of sugar in bond. hand and the Commonwealth on the other. It was assumed that the statesmen of the Federation had brains, and could look wealth must lose. after the revenue of the country. I do not wish, in this matter, to pass any flection upon the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I look upon that company as, pox scare. according to law, a legal organization about as shrewd a crowd of fellows as are to be found in Australia. They are up to every game on the board. The position is somewhat similar to that which would occur if the Treasurer of the Commonwealth proposed to alter incidence of taxation in such a way affect the profits of merchants. We all State. know how eager these men are to obtain information as to any proposal of a Treasurer likely to have an influence upon business. But the present Government had not wit enough to see that they ought to exercise vigilance with respect to the revenues of the Commonwealth in the same way as a Treasurer would exerbeen. cise vigilance regarding a proposal to the sickness was small-pox at all. alter a duty. In the olden days in tralia a Government that had been guilty opinion. of such conduct would have been removed from the Treasury bench. But, course, the supporters of the present M i istry are bound to cling to them whatUnion ever they do. What is their reply ? The Minister of Trade and Customs tells us that a compact was made, that he had adhere to it , and that there was no tion in the Act to protect the revenue. If that had been the case, it would have nical as the Medical Union. been easy for the Minister to withhold the proclamation u n t i l Parliament Then he could have asked Parliament to alter the law in such a way as to protect the revenue. This is one of the strongest indictments that can be brought against the present Government, and is, in itself, sufficient to condemn them.",40
275,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The Colonial Sugar Refinask ing Company actually had to tell the Government.,41
276,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"The r e is a gentleof man named Knox at the head of the , and Colonial Sugar Refining Company, who knows more about this business than any other man in Australia. He gave the the Government a hint, which he was not bound to do. He went out of his way to the warn them as to what would occur. There is no doubt about it that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has Of course, the. company is entitled to get whatever is due to it , and the CommonAnother matter to which I wish to refer is that which has rebeen dealt with by the honourable member for East Sydney. I allude to the smallI t does not affect my own of State. We have had one or two cases of chicken-pox in Adelaide, but we did not go mad and insist on vaccinating everybody. But New South Wales has been made to suffer seriously by what has occurred, and the trade of l i e whole Comthe monwealth has been injured. I know as to that from my experience in my own Port Adelaide is in my electorate, and I regret to say that a number of my friends who get their living on the wharfs have had to suffer because the 'shipping trade has been seriously affected. There is no honourable member representing a waterside constituency but knows how widespread the in j u r y to trade has Personally, I do not believe that It Ausmay be asked what right I have to that Perhaps I have none, but, at all events, I know that some of the ablest of men in Australia, including some doctors, n - are of the same opinion. But the Medical have decreed that the disease is small-pox, and they will hold to that verdict. There is not a trade union in the to world-ther e has not been one since the sectime of the K n if e Grinders Union of Sheffield-whic h is so compact and tyranThe Chancellor of the Exchequer found that met. out in connection with his new scheme of national insurance. Medical men whisper to each other in confidence, and what they agree upon the whole profession sticks to. The reply of the Government simply is, "" We were bound to take the advice of our advisers."" Were they? Could they not discuss the matter with their advisers? Were they bound not to their advisers to give them further information about small-pox and its nature? I have been told-and the in formation which I have Ministers ought to have; if they have it not, they are not fit to be where they are-that an break very similar to that in Sydney curred in the island of Trinidad a few years ago. There were 8,000 cases and twenty-eight deaths. Assuming that the disease in Sydney was similar to that which occurred in Trinidad, where i chiefly affected the coloured population, what probability was there of a single fatal case occurring amongst the white pox, race in this country ? We know, from experience of bubonic plague, that the fatalities amongst the white race are nonot thing like so numerous as they are amongst coloured people. If the Fisher Administration had been in office would not things have been made lively for us in reference to this alleged small-pox? Speaking as a public man of twenty because years' experience, I venture to say that all the irritating things that can occur one of the most annoying is to get from a Minister, in reply to a question, answer, "" I have been advised by my adW it h what result? visers."" Of course they are advised; I have known statesmen in Australia to their advisers, "" Take that back, and give me another report."" I have known more than one Minister to do that. Minister who has the courage to do such a were absent through that illness. thing is worth a great deal to a country. Would not the Minister have been justiof fied in obtaining from his advisers a report on the real nature of small-pox ? Would he not have been justified in the interest of the public in ing upon caution ? Possibly honourable members know what' the real burden of the day. nature of small-pox is. 1 can recolquestion lect how it raged in London in 1871-2-3. The small-pox which came to Great B r tain from the camps of the armies of France and Germany has always followed upon a big war. When the people of the what they intend to do.

I suppose that many honourable members have passed' through those outbreaks in Great Britain unvacSuperintendent cinated, and have never been attacked. But what has happened in Sydney ? at Talk about administration! We have recollect that the gentlemen who occupy Mr Archibald. - the Treasury bench in this Parliament today are the distinguished blue-bloods of Australia. There is none of the comoutmon working man about that brigade, if ocwe exempt the Prime Minister, whom, I suppose, we may consider a working man, as the term is generally understood. These Ministers, we are told, have accepted the advice of certain medical men. t Why, if a dozen of these doctors could have been got together in a room to diagnose this alleged outbreak of smallthey would have been fighting the amongst themselves within an hour, and the result would have been that we should have got an opinion from thera at all. I protest against the action of the Government in quarantining an area within a radius of 15 miles of the General Post Office, Sydney, because of the in j u r y which it has done to my own State, and of the damage which it has in of flicted upon New Soutli Wales. In certain of the large business establishments 4 in Melbourne the employers have insisted the upon their employees being vaccinated.

I should not be all surprised if , when the Government to are about to make that appointment, they seek the advice of the Naval Board. It seems to me that no Government can walk if the Naval Board does not prop them up. I am very anxious to affirm the principle that the Naval Board should have no more to do with this appointment than they have to do with anythiug in Mars. To me it is doubtful whether the Commonwealth Government can do other than create jobs for. half-pay naval omcers. So far as the Navy itself is concerned, I say, "" Let the naval men go there."" I am not a naval expert, and am not competent to criticise naval actions. But I say that the mercantile marine of Australia has no right to be controlled by any man of that stamp. Let it have the superintendence of a man from the mercantile marine- a man who is familiar with the navigation of the great waters of Australia. hear a good deal of the noble professions of the law and of medicine. I think that one of the noblest professions under the sun is that of the shipping masters and of the shipping officers. Brave men they are, too. We find them in all weathers battling round our coast, and what are the plums which f all to them ? Look at the precarious position of the master of a vessel and of his officers as compared with that of the chief engineer and his comrades. engineer has a dispute with the shipping company by which he is employed, he is paid off, takes his k it ashore, and goes into the first engineering shop he encounters, where he obtains a job.. what can the unfortunate officer on the bridge do in such circumstances ? He has spent the best years of his life at sea, and must take what he can get. that if there are any plums to be given by the Government in the administration of our Navigation Act they should be given to these men. Not very long ago an expert was required in connection with our lighthouses, and a half-pay naval officer was offered the appointment. There were a dozen men in every port of Australia who were more familiar with the Australian coast-me n who had battled bravely on many a dark, wild night, straining their eyes to pierce the gloom, and to pick up the lights. have had the good fortune to be invited on the bridge of vessels in my own State - by master mariners, who have given me the benefit of their advice as to the places which should be lighted, and the reasons why they should be lighted. We all know that if a master mariner loses his ship that is about the end of him . The insurance people black-list him, and his opportunity to obtain employment has gone. One would naturally have expected a master mariner familiar with the Australian coast to be selected for the position to which I have referred. There were in all the principal ports of the Commonwealth at least half-a-dozen such men who would have filled the bill ; but a half-pay naval officer was chosen. I ""hope that the same kind of thing will not go on in connection with the administration of the Navigation Bill . Rumour is a busy i'ade, and she has it that the Government Lave appointed a Mr Ramsbotham as Director of Light-houses.",41
277,Mr WEST,Unknown,It is true that he has been We appointed.,43
278,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"I have not met him, but from what I have heard I am inclined rather to think that he is an able engineer, and that we should not be far at sea in taking his advice concerning engineering matters. I do not say, however, that we should always follow the advice of only one expert. I rather favour the policy pursued by a merchant in a large way of business in South Australia, who was a colleague of mine in If an the State Parliament. One afternoon, while the debate in the House of Assembly was languishing, I said to him, "" In carrying on a large business concern such as you control, do you But not find it necessary sometimes to obtain the advice of an expert?"" "" C e r t a in l y ,"" he replied, "" and I take the advice of, not one expert, but of two, I say and sometimes three, experts. I read very carefully what they recommend, and then I do what I l i k e . "" I do not think that he is the only business man in Australia who follows that practice. I have no reason to believe that Mr Ramsbotham is not a very able man ; but is an engineer the best man to .select for the position of Director of Light-houses ?",43
279,Mr LAIJRD SMITH,Unknown,Is he not a civil engineer ?,43
280,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"The r e are engiI neers and engineers; but the best type of . engineer to consult is the man who has had practical experience. In the in terests of Australia, I say that in filling positions in connection with the Navigation Act and the light-house services, we should warn off the half-pay naval officer. Such positions should be given to our master mariners, who have spent the greater part of their lives in trading round the Australian coast. I come now to the Government memorandum. the opening paragraph we are told that the existing electoral law has not been found to work satisfactorily. I do not desire to cover ground that has been traversed by previous speakers, and I shall, therefore, say shortly that I agree with those who have asserted that, in connection with the recent general election, there has been circulated a most infamous slander on the people of Australia. I believe that the rolls, so far as the number of electors enrolled is concerned, are in a very healthy condition; and I am pretty well convinced that there is no foundation for the allegation with regard to duplicate voting. Before my return to this House, there was scarcely an election in South Australia in which I did not act either as a scrutineer or in some other capacity. I , therefore, claim to know as much about the conduct of elections as do honourable members opposite and their supporters outside, who are "" skiting "" all over the country. If the Attorney-General could supply me with the information for which I asked regarding the number of duplications alleged to have taken place in connection with previous elections, making due allowance for the enlarged rolls Mr W . H . IBVINE - I have asked for the information, but am told that it is impossible to obtain definite information, because there has never previously been a general scrutiny in respect of the whole Commonwealth. The omcers express the opinion, however, that there is no evidence that the duplication of votes at the last general election was much in excess of the average.",43
281,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"I am not complaining because the Attorney-General has failed to supply me with information for which I asked. I was merely leading up to the point that a cruel and infamous libel on the people of Australia had been circulated by those who have alleged that at the last Federal election duplicate voting was largely indulged in , and that there were many cases of impersonation. The statement just made by the Attorney General shows that there is absolutely no proof of the truth of such assertions. Mr W. H. IHVINE - The honourable member will recollect that, when I referred to the matter on a previous occasion, I expressly said that we had no knowledge of whether there was any In duplication whatever.",44
282,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,I do not suggest that the honourable member uttered the libel of which I complain.,44
283,Mr ROBEBTS,Unknown,He never spoke of it .,44
284,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"I do not say that he did, but many others did so. It was not so much honourable members of the Liberal party, or their supporters, as the press who lied all over the country about this matter. The press supporters of the Liberal party were responsible for it . I come now to the question of absent voting. Why is the old system of voting by post so highly valued by members of the Conservative party? They value it , not because of their large-hearted humanity, not because of their solicitude for the sick, or for those living in sparsely-populated districts, but because their advisers - expert s in electioneering-tel l them that it is the easiest method of corruption that could be employed.  the absent voting system. Mr ARCHIBALD . If the honourable member would only apply to this question a little of the common sense that he applies, no doubt, to his own business affairs, he would admit that nothing lends itself more readily to corruption than does the postal voting system. I am strongly of opinion that we might wisely go back to the old system of voting by ballot-that we should declare that men and women shall be entitled to vote in the districts in which they reside, and that if they cannot do so they shall not be allowed to vote at all. l t may be said that that would be a very great calamity, but we must all recognise that the purit y of elections is essential, and that those who fought for the introduction of the system of voting by ballot were never in favour of these new-fangled notions. Those who advocated the adoption of the ballot had no idea other than that of secret voting in contradistinction to the old system of open voting. This proposal will cut both ways, because there are just as many electors on one side in politics as on the other who will be unable to vote. Great facilities should be given for the transfer of names u n t i l almost within a day or two of an election. That would get over the difficulty now existing. I am not making this suggestion on behalf of my party. I know it is thought by a great many persons in South Australia that there is no justification for all the fuss that has taken place, and that absent voting should be confined to only one class, and that is to persons who are on the ocean while an election is approaching. That would cover the travelling public and a very large section of our workers who get their living afloat. It is utprefer the term, employment. terly impossible if a ship arrives in port for the crew to go and vote as they should do. I have been supplied by the Chief Electoral Officer with a return relating to double voting and personation. no scrutineer owing to the fact that on the last occasion, as on the previous occasion, I had a walk-over. I was not entitled to be supplied with the return, but it was sent to me as an act of courtesy. I was very anxious to know how my constituents behaved in regard to the Senate candidates, and I found that the record for Hindmarsh is similar to other records. I do not mean to suggest that there has been no personation practised in Australia, because I believe that it has been, and always will be, practised to a very slight extent; but I venture to say that no more personation was practised at the last elections than at previous elections. Personation will always be in dulged in , because there is a certain number of reckless persons who are prepared to take the risk. As regards the present system of election, there is nothing, in my opinion, to justify the statements which have been mads. I should like an i quiry .to be made into the allegations, and in default of an inquiry we had better let the matter drop with an admission from the other side that the electors of Australia are not open to any reflection for the way in which they recorded their votes on the 31st May. The absolute necessity for the no-confidence proposition from this side lies' in the fact that the Prime Minister has stated in a memorandum that the Government in tends to repeal preference to unionists. That is a declaration of war with the workers, and we take it up. Whether the Prime Minister intends to do anything in the matter is a horse of another colour. I am inclined to think that if a big breeze should spring up he will hesitate. He will need a good deal of courage to proceed with his proposal; he will need more courage than I give him credit for possessing. I would not call it courage on mypart to submit a proposal of that kind, because I consider it is foolhardiness for a public man to throw down the gauntlet to the workers of Australia, and that is what the Prime Minister is doing. Now, what is preference to unionists so far as the Government is concerned ? Ministers have only control of a certain amount of patronage, or, if you The rest is in the control of the Public Service Commissioner, and there, of course, the rule of preference to unionists does not come in . It only applies, practically, to apI had pointments made by the Postal Department. The rule is that, other things being equal, preference should be given to unionists.",44
285,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,It only applies to casuals.,45
286,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"E x a c t l y . This principle was adopted in our legislation to enable the Court over which Mr Justice Higgins so ably presides to give, when it was essential for industrial peace, preference to unionists. Repeatedly His Honour has said in Court to a party, "" Y o u do not want preference to unionists; I am not going to give it , "" but he would grant preference if he thought it was necessary to do so. It is now proposed to withdraw that power from the Judge, who exercises his jurisdiction in equity and good conscience. The High Court Judges are never guided by equity and good conscience. W it h them equity n - is out of the question, and it is a matter of what the law says. W it h them, too, good conscience is out of the question, and it is a matter of law. If the exercise of this power did not rest with the A r b i tration Court, but with the union secretaries or the Executive Government, I could understand the proposal of the Government. Has the Conservative party in the Commonwealth sunk so low that it will refuse to allow a Judge of the High Court to deal with industrial trouble and bring about peace? It is proposed to take away the Arbitration Court's power of giving preference when, if exercised, it would often bring about industrial peace. The Ministry are not actuated by any other motive than that of deliberately defying the workers, because preference to unionists is the high-water mark to which trade unionism has risen in the present day.",45
287,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 745 p.m.,45
288,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"I shall not say anything more regarding preference to unionists, as my time is limited, and many other honourable members have spoken on the subject, though there is much I would like to say about it . I come now to another matter of very great importance. The Government, according to the memorandum that the Prime Minister has laid on the table, in tends to put the maternity allowance on a contributory basis. We shall have another opportunity to discuss that proposal, if it ever comes before us in tangible form, which I very much doubt. What I wish to refer to now is the honourable gentleman's statement that 90 per cent, of the mothers of Australia do not need the allowance. That is entirely wrong. When I make a denial of that kind I am in a position to prove what I say, and I shall give proof in this in stance. I asked the last Government, and I ask this Government, to give instructions for the preparation of information to accompany the Budget showing as nearly as possible the social conditions and income of the population. I do not ask for statements of average income based on statistics. If the wealth of Australia is divided by the population, poor fellows getting only 30s. a week are allotted an average income much above that sum. Information obtained in that way is of as little value as information regarding the average weight of adult Australians, which may vary in individual cases fro m 8 to 26 stone. The system of averaging, when aggregates are taken, is mere humbug. But a great deal of valuable information can be obtained by averaging in groups. If a statement made up in that way were presented with each Budget, we should know what the incomes of Australians are, and how wealth is distributed in this country. I do not wish to know the in come of Brown, Jones, or Robinson, or of this or that wealthy man; my concern is not with the incomes of individuals, but with the incomes of groups. We get a certain amount of information of this kind from the publications of the Commonwealth Statistician, and I am going to quote now from Bulletin 8, the monthly summary for August, 1912, which gives, at page 49, a table showing the distribution of incomes in Australia, estimated as for the year ended 30th June, 1911. The total incomes above £200 a year amount to £62,637,896, divided among 114,195 persons. The in comes above £ 3 0 0 a year amount to £52,126,765 , and are divided among 57,517 persons, a drop of nearly one-half. The incomes above £500 amount to £41,455,747, and are enjoyed by 25,485 persons. The incomes above £750 amount to £35,408,930, and are enjoyed by 15,393 persons. The incomes above £1,000 amount to £30,664,673, and are enjoyed by 9,257 persons. The incomes above £1,500 amount to £25,397,094, and are enjoyed by 5,001 persons, and the incomes above £2,000 amount to £22,053,874, and are enjoyed by 3,536 persons. I have no faul t to find with the Commonwealth Statistician, because I know what difficulty he has in obtaining from the States the information that he needs. It would be well if honourable members got the State members whom they know to insist OJ. the preparation and publication of returns of this kind on the same basis, so that they might be accessible to the Commonwealth Government. I have heard that in one case a State Government wanted £ 8 , 0 0 0 from the Commonwealth Government for a return for which it asked, although the information was available. The people of Australia should see that that kind of thing is stopped. The figures which I have read take no account of the incomes on which income tax is not paid, but it is not difficult to ascertain the amount of those incomes. Those who have made a study of these questions arrive at the in formation in this way: The average family consists of the breadwinner, his wife, and three children. It is only the head of a household who pays income tax, and only one in nine heads of families have incomes above £200 a year. Will honourable members say that in all other households the maternity allowance is not needed ? I think that it is. Let us consider the question in another way. There are 311,000 factory workers in the Commonwealth, men, women, and children. They earned £27,500,000 in 1911, which, on the average, meant £ 2 a week for the men, £ 1 ls. a week for the women, and 10s. a week for the youngsters. Of course, some of the male workers would earn £ 3 a week, and some considerably less than £ 2 a week; but where is the 90 per cent, that the Prime Minister tells us do not require a maternity bonus 1 I desire to arrive at the wealth of Australia by another method. I have taken some interest in this study, both in the Old Country and here; and, thanks to the statisticians and economists who have written on the question, it is possible to know exactly the condition of the people of the Old Country in groups-thos e who possess colossal wealth and the millions who have not bread for their wives and children. That, however, is of no value to us; we require the same rules and tables applied to Australia as in the Old Country, so that we may know exactly the condition of the working people. One method of arriving at the wealth of the country is to take the value of the deceased estates which come under the review of the various probate omcers; but both we and the public know, of course, that a great number of people leave no estates at all. According to Mr Chiozza Money, if we multiply the deceased estates by thirty we arrive at the value of the property of the l i v in g ; and now let me see if I can prove that. Mr Chiozza Money, in his Riches and Poverty, tells us that from Queen Anne, in 1702, to George V . , in 1910, a period of 208 years, the Crown has passed eight times, on the average about every twenty-six years. This, it appears, is the fair average for the transfer of estates in Australia as well as in England, but the point is that relating to the value of the deceased estates. According to the Year-Book, No. 6, page 814, the value of the deceased estates in Australia, in 1907, was, in round figures, £20,000,000; in 1908 it was £20,000,000; in 190& it was £22,000,000; in 1910 it was £22,000,000; and in 1911 it was £28,000,000, or a total of £112,000,000, showing an average over the five years of £22,000,000. To this I add £4,000,000 a year, because there is a certain amount of plate, jewellery, furniture, and so forth , whioh always eludes the requirements of the law of probate. This brings the figure to £26,000,000, which, multiplied by t h i r t y , gives £780,000,000 as the wealth of Australia in 1911. On page 824. of the Year-Book, No. 2, there are the figures for the previous five years, showing that the value of the deceased estates in 1906 was £18,000,000; in 1905 it was £17,000,000; in 1904 it was £16,000,000; in 1903 it was £19,000,000; and in 1902 it was £16,000,000, or a total of £86,000,000, giving an average of £17,000,000 per annum. When we again add £4,000,000, and multiply the total by [15] thirty , we have £630,000,000 as the wealth of Australia in 1906, showing an increase in five years of £150,000,000. Honourable members have been asking questions about the rise in prices and the increased cost of living. I have a suspicion, as I believe any intelligent man or woman outside must have, that if the wages have gone up proiits have gone up also; and, as the London press has said, we have had a "" glorious time "" in Australia during the last five years. There are people who howl about the "" bottom dog ""-abou t the working man's increase in wages and his wickedness in adhering to his labour organization and to preference to unionists-bu t the wealth of the crowd to which those people belong has increased by £150,000,000. In the face of facts like this, what is the use of the Prime Minister saying that 90 per cent, of the women of Australia have no need for a maternity bonus 1 I am not one to say that the working section of the Australian people are hard-up or starving, or to talk any rubbish of that k in d ; on the contrary, I have said over and over again that this is the best poor man's country in the world. The only astonishing thing about the worker here is how on earth he can, under any circumstances whatever, get it into his thick head that he ought to vote for a Conservative. A peer of the realm said years ago in the House of Commons that the working man who voted for a Conservative was a fool. Of course, he is. Conservatives are the defenders of vested interests and of privilege, and all that sort of thing. Here we have the Government, in spite of the increased wealth and the present condition of Australia, making this suggestion. I have advocated the cause of my fellow-workers for forty years, and I have never seen any necessity for changing my opinion. I hope that the House and the country behind it will insist' that the maternity bonus shall not be interfered with. There might be some excuse for doing so if we were a poor country, but we are a wealthy country.. One honourable member preceding me haa asked where the money was coming from,, seeing that the progressive land tax was being whittled away, but I can tell the. honourable member where we can get the revenue for the maternity bonus. In doing this, I am not binding my party. I simply speak for myself when I suggest that out of the £150,000,000 £5,000,000, which is the amount now paid in Customs duties on the necessaries of life, and on the necessary clothing of the working people, should be set aside for this purpose. In England the wealthy are whining, howling, and cursing Mr LLOYD George, Mr Asquith, and others, but they will have to pay the tax imposed, and they ought to be prepared to pay it. I would never growl at having to pay double my income tax; the Commissioner would never have any trouble to get it out of me; he would be welcome to it, because the income tax is a genuine and honest tax. Government will pause before they interfere with the maternity bonus. stand that the Government, interests of freedom and liberty, the rest of that sort of - bunkum coming from them - are going to remove the "" trammels"" the press. Of course, the ment should stick up for their the commercial press. I do not intend to rail at the press. I look on a newspaper as simply a commercial concern. sells us news for a penny, and the news is good, bad, or indifferent, just what the paper chooses to sell. The newspapers aim at increasing their circulation, they use every avenue and opportunity play on the public to increase their circulation. Eollowing on the adopted in France, they were asked by us to have the articles appearing in the papers signed by the writers of them. Many great French like Gambetta and Clemenceau won their reputations through the people becoming acquainted with their names when they were journalists. Our friends of the Bulletin turned the whole matter humour; they did not mind signing their names to what they wrote. In connection with the Labour journals there was no objection to signing articles; all the men on the staffs signed their names. then, is there in this cant about and freedom in connection with a commercial organization that has no morals? Morality no more comes into than it does into hotel-keeping. newspaper man sells news, and the hotel keeper sells beer. People have ideas about the freedom of the Classic John Milton, the old blind poet whose marvellous powers enriched literature and mada our beautiful Mr Archibald. guage what it is, wrote his best prose work in defence of the press. He pleaded hard for the freedom of the press, and the freedom of the press was gained;, but take the press of today, take the king of newspapers, the London, Times; is it like what it was when Delane was its chief, and Blowitz was its correspondent in Paris? With a staff of men like those two, the Times carried weight, but today it is but a rag in comparison. Now we are asked to defend, not the freedom of the press, but the absolute licence of the press. A I hope the newspaper is a commercial proposition. Ask the proprietor of any newspaper why I under- he does not write so-and-so, and he will in the say, "" What has it to do with you 1 I and am here to make my paper pay. I will bunkum sell news, and put in news that suits me, on not y o u . "" As a matter of fact, the newsGovern- paper is run in the interests of the adfriends, vertisers. It battens and lives on capitalists. The capitalists dictate the policy by putting in advertisements. This is It the freedom and spread-eagleism we are asked to defend! All the late Parliamentasked the newspapers to do was to have the articles signed. An y one who is a and man would not mind signing what he to wrote. I would go further, and have the law of France enforced; but that is a principle matter for the States, and the Legislative simply Councils would not vote for these ""scallywags "" to sign their names. I say "" scallywags,"" because a good many of the men statesmen on the newspapers are nothing else. I do not refer to the journalists of Australia;. I know too many of them. I see that the. member for Wentworth is laughing. He should have his face blacked and get a into banjo. He is an excellent corner-man for the Government. Many journalists in Australia have to get a living, and have largely to conform to the requirements of the papers for which they are working; What, but I know honourable, upright men who, liberty if they had freedom to write as theythought, - would give us altogether different matter. Now we are asked to do journalism something, not in the interests of freeThe dom, but in the interests of licence. The member for Wentworth is prepared antiquated to defend licence and a corrupt press, notpress. the press of the time. I have referred to. I can recollect, as a youth, newspapers our run by men of principle, men who be- lanlieved in their principles, and wrote because they believed i u them. They were not like the wretched press of today.",46
289,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The member for Wentworth did not laugh when one paper referred to him as an "" in n at e cad.""",49
290,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"And they were not very far wrong. There are two ways of dealing with newspapers. One way is by legislation. And there is another way. There are millionaires in Australia. It is a pity one millionaire could not use his money in the interests of freedom, and the improvement of our civilization, by starting a newspaper in Sydney and Melbourne, running it on the same lines as the existing papers, catering for all the news, but running the paper on Labour principles and telling the truth . would smash the existing papers to powder, and beat them at own game. There is money in it , too. The millionaire who did that might very easily add another million' to his wealth in a few years. That would be one way of doing it , but I admit that we cannot expect much assistance in that way. Honourable members on the other side have said that they are Democrats. care very much about that. Like many of the words we use, it does not convey very much meaning. For all practical purposes, honourable members opposite are the Conservative party of Australia. They are the representatives and lineal descendants of the whole crowd of Conservatives who have gone before them. have everything in common with the Oxford and Cambridge educated blackguards who sit behind Bonar Law, and every night blackguard and abuse Lloyd George and other English statesmen. They talk about defending the people, but we know that in the past they have blocked all legislation proposed for the benefit of the "" b o t to m dog,"" and they always will do so. I do not say this of every honourable member on the other side, because I believe some who are there now have drifted in , and do not know where they have drifted. I refuse to believe that some honourable members on the other side will stand out against every demand made from this side in the in terests of the people.

If there is a rich, man in this House or [ 1 5 ] -* outside of it , I do not envy him his wealth, nor do I want it . But every step that we may take in the direction of the better distribution of the wealth earned in the Commonwealth will , I am satisfied, meet with the unmistakable and determined opposition of the Government, and of many of those who sit behind them. Indeed, they can follow no other course in view of the claims of the section of the community from whom they receive their support, their august allies, the people from whom their money comes, and their commercial press. These are the influences which will dictate their policy for them. I wish to make an appeal to the Government, because I am not so narrow-minded as to He assume that the intelligence of Australia will always demand that the Labour party their should be in office.",49

But if there is one thing which I feel proud about, it is the statement of Ministerial policy which has been published by the Prime Minister, because f t makes a clean line of demarcation between honourable members opposite and honourable members on this side. clear, concise, emphatic, and to the point, and that is what honourable members opposite do not like about it . been too much pusillanimity exhibited by this party in the past, and members of it have been too ready to listen to and believe in the statements made by honourable members opposite. I feel that we on this side are representing the people. Honourable members opposite represent one section of the community, and vote every time as their masters tell them. Some time ago, we had a remarkable announcement in one of the Labour newspapers in Western Australia. It is well known that honourable members opposite are controlled by the Australian Labour Federation.

302,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Ha d the honourable member any say in draftin g the policy? Mr GREGORY"" - We have no Caucus here. Ministers frame their policy, not the members of the party. The honourable member cannot understand the independence either of Ministers or their supporters.",50

304,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I should like to make my position perfectly clear as to one matI t is ter. I come here as one who is prepared to defend all the time the interests of the States. I am a thorough Federalist. I There has helped to secure the passage of the Constitution in Western Australia. I believe in Federation; but I have no time for Unification. I think that we should have a National Parliament to look after national affairs, and should leave the States to control social and domestic matters. An y effort that may be made, even if from this side of the chamber, to interfere with the States within their own sphere, I shall resent. There is no doubt that honourable members opposite desire Unification. The changes they sought to bring about by their referenda proposals proved that. They tried to secure Federal control over matters affecting the social and domestic conditions of the people within the States. I am glad that the good sense and conscience of the people led them to reject that policy. I shall at all times strongly object to such powers as were asked for being given to the Commonwealth. While the Socialists were in office, they tried time after time to injure the States financially, and to undermine the powers l e ft with them under the Constitution.",50
305,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Gw e us an instance.,51
306,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Such a case occurred in connection with the arbitration laws. I do not know whether we ought to blame the Court or this Parliament, but undoubtedly it was never intended, when the Constitution was framed, that the Federal Parliament should have power to make laws bringing before the Federal Arbitration Court many matters which are now brought before it . In almost every industry disputes are created for the purpose of bringing cases before this Court. Even the farming community are affected. The case of the miners of Broken Hill was brought before the Court, and a judgment was delivered by it affecting them. In all these instances, industries should be controlled by the States, and the power should Dever have been given by the Federal Parliament.",51

309,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Of course, there would be no scope for honourable members opposite unless they could manufacture these disputes. Then there was the land tax. It was well understood that the power of raising money by land taxation was to be left to the States. Federal Government introduced the land tax and took that source of revenue from the States. Take the subject of banking.",51
310,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,The High Court is against the honourable member in regard to the land tax.,51
311,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I am perfectly well aware that the Socialists originally had no intention of taxing city lands, but they had to do so to keep within the Constitution.",51
312,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"What nonsense ! Where did the honourable member get that from ? He must have been reading the War Cry, I think!",51
313,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Then , take the Commonwealth Bank Act. Undoubtedly, the Constitution gives this Parliament control over banking other than State banking. But a deliberate attempt was made by honourable members opposite to destroy the State Savings Banks. I do not know whether they realise what the State Savings Bank means to the people of Western Australia. Through our Agricultural Bank, which is financed by the Treasurer of the State, we have been able to give cheap money to the farmers. How is the Treasurer going to finance that bank in the future? He cannot, owing to the competition of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, and to the fact that the Commonwealth has turned the States out of the post-offices. I know several instances in which storekeepers have been appointed to take money for the State Savings Bank; but a good many people who have a £ 5 note to put in the bank do not care to go to a storekeeper for the purpose. Why did the Commonwealth Government, under the Labour rigime, deliberately try to destroy the State Savings Banks ? Did they want money? No ; they had an enormous revenue. They had established a Commonwealth Bank of Issue, and had obtained possession of nine or ten. millions. There was no need to treat the States as they did. But I believe that the object they had in view was to destroy the financial balance of the States, so as to force Take the policy adopted by the Socialist Government in regard to our transferred properties. A f t e r the abolition of the Braddon section, when the States were receiving 25s. per head from the Commonwealth, how was it that that Government charged the States 3^ per cent, for money lent, whilst But the they refused to grant them more than 3 per cent, on account of the transferred properties? Was that fair treatment? 1 trust that the present Government will see that the States are paid on account of the transferred properties at the same rate as they are charged for money which they borrow from the Commonwealth. But that is the way the late Government treated them. It is true that at a subsequent stage, owing to the trouble which arose, they raised the rate of interest from 3 to 3£ per cent. I hold that the rate should be the same in both instances, or else the Commonwealth should pay for the transferred properties. In this Federation, surely we should aim at doing our best to build up the States. What have we given to the people for the large amount which we exact from them by way of Customs and Excise taxation ? We initiated a defence scheme, we have established old-age pensions, and we have enacted legislation providing for the baby bonus. Nothing else. people look to the States for their railways, their roads, their water supplies, the education of their children, and for the administration of justice and charities. Yet we find that when honourable members opposite were in control of the Treasury they treated the States in as niggardly a manner as possible. I hope that in the future we shall endeavour to keep to the Federal compact. I quite realise that honourable members opposite desire to vest in the Commonwealth much greater powers than it now possesses. I admit that it does require some additional powers.",51
314,Mr FENTON,Unknown,We want the whole lot.,52
315,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I hope that the people of Australia will not be so foolish as to give the honourable member the "" whole l o t . "" He does not explain to them from the public platform why he wants these increased powers. He merely endeavours to cloud the issue, with a view to bringing about Unification. In the Postal Department we have the means of giving some assistance to the States, and I hope that in the future the Postmaster-General will act with greater liberality towards the persons who live out-back. deal of fuss has been made over the adoption of penny postage. Personally, I would rather that the system formerly in vogue had been continued, and that the £430,000 lost by the adoption of penny postage should have been expended in granting increased postal facilities to residents in remote rural areas. These are the persons who build up the country. The feeling of security that we experience when we are enjoying good seasons is remarkable, but we ought always to bear in mind that it is the primary industries upon which the secondary industries are dependent. Those engaged in our primary industries should, therefore, receive more consideration than has hitherto been extended to them. I hope that' a generous effort will be made by the Postmaster-General to give them greater facilities in the way of postal telephonic communication in the future. I know that the honourable gentleman has already issued instructions which will prove of value to residents in our back country, so far as telephonic communicahave tion is concerned, and I hope that those facilities will be still further extended. I suppose that it ill-becomes a new member to reflect upon any statement which The has been made by an honourable member on the opposite side of the chamber. But when the honourable member for Adelaide read a quotation from a speech made by the Attorney-General, and when it was shown immediately afterwards that the preceding words entirely altered the context, I could not help feeling that what had been done was degrading to this assembly.",52

A good deal has been said about the action of the Government in closing down the plant at Cockatoo Island. I venture to say, however, that, had the Labour party been in power, they would not have delayed action for one moment after receipt of the report of the experts, and that if the It present Administration had not closed gold down the plant as they were advised to do, and the fact that they were so adpart vised had come to the knowledge of honori t able members opposite, they would have been the first to charge the Ministry with of maladministration. It was reported that the plant was being overloaded, and on the lSlh March last the then Minister of Defence approved of Mr Julius being appointed as a special expert to make an examination of it . Mr Julius reported the honourable that the boilers were practically worn elecout, that considerable repairs had to be effected every week-end to keep them running for another week, and that the plant, a whole, was in such a condition as might lead to a breakdown at any time. This condition, he added, had caused in past frequent interruptions in the dockyard work. Then Captain Clarkson he is rereported to the Naval Board1 am of opinion that the Board, having received this report, can pursue no other course than to immediately order the fires in these to be drawn, and the boilers put out of use until a survey can be made by a Board of which engineer officers. The Board of Survey made an inspection, and it seems to me to be a reflection upon Austrathe administration of the inspectors of boilers in New South Wales that these a fit confrere things were found to exist, and that they had heen allowed to exist, even in a vernment dockyard, for one moment. I was a most disgraceful state The Board found thick deposits of slime the scale on tubes, stays, and plates; and in the case of loco, type boilers Nos. 1 to 4, the lower tubes were buried in sludge. Any one who has had practical experience knows the extreme danger of allowing boilers to remain that condition. The Board reported furround ther thatThe examination of the thickness of plates and the condition of the tubes of Nos. i , 2, 4, and fi boilers points to the fact that boilers have been working for years in extremely dangerous condition The Naval Board, after consideration of the report, are of opinion that if the condemned boilers had been worked much longer under the tions disclosed an explosion would have inevitable. They, therefore, condemned altogether six of these boilers. They allowed one boiler to be used, but fixed a limit 20 lbs. to the square inch. In the case of another boiler, they gave a certificate that it might be worked up to a pressure of 40 lbs. to the square inch for a period not exceeding three months.",53
337,Mr HOWE,Unknown,Where did the honourable member get this information?,54
338,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,My information is authentic.,54
339,Mr HOWE,Unknown,The honourable member is quoting a report that I could not obtain.,54
340,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"As an honourable member says, we are being "" blown up here because the Minister would not allow the men at Cockatoo Island to be blown up. In the circumstances, I think Government were quite justified, and that the Opposition ought to be pleased with the action they took. Their objection that these matters should have been made public; but I think it only right in the interests of the people that they should be made public, and every inforthe mation given. Coming to the question of the electoral law, I sincerely trust that the Government will, at the earliest possible moment, bring down an amendbeen ing Bill. If the majority of the people of Australia are to rule, it is absolutely essential that a very great the change should be made in the electoral of those law of the Commonwealth. The existing Act is a disgrace to every one who was concerned in placing it upon the statuteroll; book. It is a disgrace from beginning to Goend. It opens the door to fraud, collut sion, and impersonation, and ought cerof affairs. tainly to be amended.  the honourable member into Parliament.",54
341,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"No : bad as it was, it could not keep me out. Let me put before honourable members a few facts relating to the position in Western Ausin tralia. We had on the general roll, in figures, 148,000 names; but at the last moment there was a great rush to be placed upon the supplementary rolls. 3, In the streets of Perth, tables were placed these in charge of men with whom it became a an parrot cry, "" Come here and help to put a nail in Fowler's coffin."" That was their cry to the passers-by, and 15,000' names condiwere added to the supplementary roll been for the Perth electorate. In all, over 50,000 names were added to the supplementary rolls in Western Australia. Seeing that the electoral law of the Comof monwealth had been in operation for about twelve years, surely the Department should have had the rolls in such a condition as to render it unnecessary, just prior to a general election, to add 50,000 names in a small community like that of Western Australia?  rolls altogether?",54
342,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"About 200,000. Fifteen thousand names were added to thesupplementary roll for Perth, 11,000 in respect of Fremantle, over 9,000 for theSwan, and 8,000 odd for the Dampier. "" The remainder were added to the supplementary rolls for the electorate of Kalgoorlie. We were able to obtain copies the of the general roll and the supplementary roll; but I understand that there were some 10,000 persons whose names is were either transferred, or, because of their death or for other reasons, struck off altogether, and of these we could secure no information. I believe that in case of Fremantle alone there weresome 3,000 transfers. None of the candidates, however, were able to obtain information regarding the names that had struck off. I certainly knew nothing regarding the names that had been transferred, for although the general roll and' the supplementary roll were published, latter did not contain the names who had been transferred. I believe that many of the Presiding Officers carried out the election with a cleanthat is to say, the names of those who had been transferred had not been struck off the roll which was given to those omcers. Their names still appeared on the general roll, and they would have been allowed to vote had they seen fit.",54
343,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,No .,55
344,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"If a roll, without the names of those persons having been struck off, was supplied^ to a Presiding Officer, how would he know that they had no right to vote? He would have no knowledge on the subject.",55
345,Mr BURNS,Unknown,Hav e you any proof of clean rolls having been supplied?,55
346,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I understand that my statement is correct.,55
347,Mr BURNS,Unknown,Where were they used?,55
348,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,They were not used in Premantle.,55
349,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,The excuse made by the omcers of the Department was that they had not had time to get the names of transferred persons struck off the roll.,55
350,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,In Victoria the names were all struck off.,55
351,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Surely there must be something wrong with an electoral system which allows 50,000 names to be placed on the rolls of a State at the last moment! The officials had no possibility of checking the names with the card system; therefore, there was no check at all in regard to names placed on the supplementary list.",55
352,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,A large number of the cards notifying that names were placed on the roll were returned with the statement that the persons could not be found.,55
353,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I understand from honourable members opposite that the postal vote was abolished on the ground that it had led to a great deal of f r a and wrong practices. As a matter fact, the postal vote has not been abolished. We have in the Electoral A c and the regulations a more simple system of postal voting than is contained in any was given. of the State Acts in Australia. An y person can go to an Electoral Registrar in any porti' -"" of Australia, and make a declaration that he will be outside the Commonwealth on polling day. He gets vants employed. his paper, he writes the name of the person for whom he desires to vote, the vote is placed in an envelope, and tion provides that the Electoral Registrar shall forward, by registered post from day to day, these votes to the Divisional employer. Officer concerned. It is the most simple and effective method of postal - voting which is known in any part of Australia.",55
354,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,As that vote has to be recorded before the Electoral Registrar there can be nothing wrong.,55
355,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The reason why this provision was' made in the law was to allow any person who had sold his in terests in Australia, and was leaving its shores, to record his vote. There was a number of seamen employed on our coast, and there was no reason in the world why they should be disfranchised. Although I think that the regulation might be made a little more restricted in regard to identification, at the same time. I quite approve of the postal vote as we had it in the Electoral Act. It should have been left there. There is no reason, I repeat, why all the seamen should be disfranchised, but honourable members on the other side say that they abolished the postal vote because of the corrupt practices it permitted. Last year there were 122,000 births in Australia. Le t us assume that about a sixth of the mothers would not care to go to a polling booth on polling day. Some persons may say that the percentage would be less. At any rate, from 8,000 to 10,000 of the mothers of Australia have been debarred from recording their votes. Are we to believe that the good union seamen on our coast, to whom this special facility had been granted, would do nothing corr up t or wrong, but that the mothers of Australia would be likely to adopt corr u pt practices if allowed to vote by post'/",55
356,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,Nonsense !,55
357,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"From 8,000 to 10,000 of the women of Australia were u d disfranchised at the last election. Why of was it done ? Because honourable members opposite thought that these women would t act corruptly, and I presume that that is why the bribe of the maternity bonus",55
358,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,A big percentage of the postal votes came from districts where there were large numbers of domestic ser,55
359,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Surely a domestic servant can exercise just as much liberty the regulaas a good union seaman!,55
360,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,Practicall y she had to record her vote in the presence of her,55
361,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"It is quite possible that some electors may have acted improperly, but that has also been done in connection with the maternity bonus, and I suppose that honourable members opposite will ask for its abolition on that ground, too, I have no time for the maternity bonus; I believe that a wrong system was started.",56
362,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Why do you not abolish it?,56
363,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"It is difficult to take away things that are given. I would have much preferred if the Parliament had granted some money to the States and asked them to establish maternity institutions in which nurses could be trained, and assisted to go into the back country and give the residents that attention which is required at a critical period in their lives. Apart from the fact that from 8,000 to 10,000 women were disfranchised, why were people in the back country disfranchised ? I know many persons who came over 100 miles to vote for me. I have letters from persons pointing out, more especially in the huge district from Carnarvon to Broome, places 50, 60, 80, and 100 miles away from a polling booth. It would be quite easy for people to come into a town between the issue of the w r it and, say, a week prior to the day of polling. I would not allow any person to exercise the postal vote later than a week before polling day, so that the names of such persons voting oould be crossed off the roll, and they would not have an opportunity to vote again. I hope that the Government will push forward a Bill which will provide for the restoration of the postal vote. It meant in my electorate the disfranchising of a large number of persons, and I certainly object to a special facility being given to one section which is denied to others. I also hope that some system of preferential voting will be in troduced. We shall be able shortly to deal with an Electoral Bill , and I hope that honourable members opposite will help us to try and make the electoral system a good one. In my opinion, the present Act leaves an imperishable stain upon the honour of the Socialistic Government, and all those who helped in placing it upon the statute-book. I am pleased to see that the Government are alive to the necessity of immigration. If we want to doubt about the possibilities of Australia, build up our resources-and there is no - w e must do the best we can to induce people to come to our shores. I hope that the Prime Minister will work in sympathy and conjunction with the State Governments with the view of trying to induce a large stream of immigration. It is somewhat discreditable to us, when we note the wonderful progress which is being made by Canada and Argentina. It is only a short time ago that I read in the press a speech by the Treasurer of Canada, who said that immigrants were going to the Dominion at the rate of 1,200 a day, and that they had brought in during the last year about £30,000,000 of capital. Surely with the conditions prevailing here we should be able to in duce a large number of immigrants to come and help us to build up the Commonwealth ! We want it more particularly in connection with the Northern Territory.",56
364,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"Y o u cannot get land provided for your own people, let alone for immigrants.",56
365,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Le t the honourable member go out into the back country, and he will see room for people.",56
366,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"There is plenty of land, but it is in the hands of the wrong people.",56
367,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"There is plenty of good land, and facilities are given by the Government of the States to induce people to go on it . We must endeavour to settle the Northern Territory. I have no time for the Socialistic fads and theories of honourable members opposite, and no belief in the leasehold system for the settlement of the country. I would like the Prime Minister to introduce a Land Bill dealing with the Northern Territory, and would be prepared to give away the land there free, subject to proper conditions to insure settlement, and prevent any one person from having too large an area. I know very little of the resources of the Northern Territory, but I think that, instead of the Minister framing ordinances to deal with mining there, this Parliament should pass mining legislation to enable investors to know what security they have for their expenditure on the development of the mining industry. It is strange that the mining industry, which is the most uncertain df all, should have the most restrictions placed on it . We need good legislation to aid the development of the mineral areas of the Northern Territory. The most pleasing thing in the Ministerial programme is the abolition of preference to unionists. I should like to see this preference abolished entirely. Preference should not be given to any one. I believe in unionism. It has done good for the working classes, but it is an impertinence for honourable members opposite to .claim that much of the democratic legislation, and the amelioration of the condition of the people have been due to the efforts of the unionists. No man, woman, or child should have special consideration because of membership of any organization or union. I hope that a measure will be introduced as speedily as possible to abolish preference to unionists. We have heard of discrimination against unionists, but the tyranny of unionists on many occasions has been discreditable to the unions.",56
368,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Of course the honourable - member can give examples of it !,57
369,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I can. A friend of mine who dared to be a political supporter refused to join a mining union at Cue, and the unionists there told the manager of the mine that, unless he was dismissed, they would strike. The manager of the mine took twenty-four hours to consider the position, and then dismissed the man.",57
370,Mr CHAHLTON,Unknown,"He was endeavouring to get the benefits of unionism without, paying for them.",57
371,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"He objected to join that union because it was using its money for political purposes, of which he did not approve.",57
372,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The honourable member's leader once said that such a man was a ""skulker.""",57
373,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"That is one of the terms that unionists are in the habit of applying to others. They speak of others as "" scabs.""",57
374,Mr HOWE,Unknown,A good word.,57
375,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I tliink that we should be justified in passing legislation uuder which a man could be put in gaol for using such terms. The man to whom I refer afterwards went timber hewing, but the unionists found him out, and he was told by the keeper of the boarding-house at which he was living that she could not continue to have him in the house any longer, because if she did she would lose her other customers.",57
376,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am afraid that he was a "" bad egg.""",57
377,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"He was a good, honest, decent working man, whose conduct was such as would reflect credit even on the honourable member. Then the carrier said that he could not continue to cart timber for him, because of his fear of losing other customers. In the same way he was hunted out of a second, and out of a third, place. This is an instance of the tyranny to which I object. Similar tyranny was exercised in Perth in connection with the tramway strike. Photographs were taken of those who worked, to be put in the "" thieves' gallery "" in the Trades H all , as they termed it . The place was well named. Let me come to a more recent case reflecting on a man who was selected as a Labour candidate for Perth. There was a horse-drivers' strike, in connection with which it was clear that the union had acted improperly, and the union was fined heavily for having so acted. The leaders told the men to go back to work, but they would not do so, and others were appointed in the place of some of them. Mr MCCallum, the secretary to the Trades and L a bour Council in Perth",57
378,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Why does not the honourable member call it the ""thieves' gallery"" again 1",57
379,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I used the expression which the unionists themselves had used. They said that they wanted the photographs to put in the "" thieves' gall e r y .""",57
380,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,The honourable member said that it was a fitting name for the Trades H all .,57
381,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I used the term used by the unionists themselves. Mr MCCallum wrote a letter, not intended for the press, though it got into the newspapers, stating that they would know how to make the life of the men who were called ""scabs"" the life that a "" s c a b "" should have. I remember, too, the Renmark strike. The strikers in that case refused a conference with the President of the Arbitratio n Court. The ex-Attorney General telegraphed asking them not to do anything which would reflect upon the Court. They said they were going to have the union log or nothing, their in tention being in the end to abolish the wages system altogether. They refused to go to arbitration.",57
382,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,They got what they wanted when they went to the Court.,57
383,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"While they were out on strike, members of the late Government contributed to help them in their illegal proceedings. I do not know if that can be looked upon as right. we have arbitration laws, they should apply to all classes of the community. A law should not be obligatory on the employer, and not on the employee. would not compel men to work, but if they refused to work they should not interfere with others who are ready to work. Personally, I am opposed to the Arbitration Court. It is absurd to suppose that any man, no matter what his capacity, can determine properly the conditions which should apply in all the in dustries of Australia. T believe in the Wages Board system, which brings together the employer and the employed, men who thoroughly understand a business from A to Z, and appreciate the difficulties on both sides. Such at r bunal is surely better able to make an award than any outside person, no matter how otherwise highly qualified. I am quite in sympathy with the desire of the Government to keep the rural workers out of the Arbitration Court; in fact, I think that in this respect we are overriding the Constitution. The control of all such matters, ought to be left to the State Arbitratio n Courts. The States alone should deal with those subsidiary in dustries, leaving to the Federal authority only matters of Inter-State and international concern. I full y agree with the defence policy of the Government. all, I think, admit that, as far as possible, defence questions should be kept out of party politics; but I must say that, in my opinion, greater consideration should be given to the rifle clubs. Those who advise the Minister of Defence are, apparently, not so much in sympathy with this movement as they ought to be, although the rifle clubs form a magnificent auxiliary to any system of defence. I therefore hope that the Minister of Defence, even if his departmental advisers do not approve, will extend more assistance to the rifle clubs than they have received in the past. I quite concur in the proposals of the Government in regard to their public works policy. Personally, I should like to see public works carried out by contract wherever possible. . Occasion may arise when it will be expedient to use day labour, but, generally speaking, the contract system is the best, and has proved to be of greater profit to the States and the Commonwealth. Further, action should betaken as speedily as possible towards the formation of a Tender Board, to exerIf cise control over tenders and purchases made by the Crown. Some most extraordinary agreements have been entered into, more especially in regard to what I is known as the powellising process, which, by the way, is known in Western Australia as the "" p a r a l y z in g "" process. As I say, some extraordinary agreementshave been made for the acceptance of offers, involving large sums of money, without calling for tenders; and I am sure that honourable members on both sides will be of the opinion that, with a Tender Board, there should be considerable improvement. Uniformity of legislation in regard to trusts and combines is also required, in addition to a good companies law; and I ask the Prime M in i - ister to consider the advisability of asking the various States to give the Commonwealth Parliament power, under paragraph 37 of section 51 of the Constitution, to that end, so that we may have one law applying to the whole of Australia. The State Parliaments would, I think, be quite willing to hand over a power of the kind, but there is great, objection to the desire of honourable members opposite to give to the central authority power to nationalize industries. I feel quite sure that the desire of honourable members opposite is not, as they endeavour to make out, to reduce the We high cost of living, because we know very well that if the huge industries contemplated were controlled by the Commonwealth, the cost of production would beincreased, and, necessarily, the cost of subsistence. The real desire of the Opposition is to force people into the unions, so that their politics may be controlled,, and the position of the Labour party made much stronger. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition seems rather amusing, and it has very aptly been described as a sort of boomerang. Undoubtedly the proposal does strike very hardly on honourable members opposite. The amendment declares that the Government have indicated nointention to take such steps as will reduce the high cost of living. What is the cause of the present high cost ? Is it not the restrictions which have been placed on trade and commerce in this country by honourable members opposite? Is it not their efforts towards Socialism ? I do not think that many people care how high the wages are if , at the same time, our production is increased; but if production is reduced the resources of the country are destroyed. There has been a great tendency to increase wages and reduce production; and the high cost of living is due entirely to honourable membera opposite. What have they done to reduce that cost?  risen all over the world.",58
384,Mr GKEGOEY,Unknown,"But what did the Labour party propose to do in order to reduce the cost of living? Although the report of the Royal Commission on the sugar industry pointed out that nationalization would increase the cost to the consumer, the Labour party adhered to their determination to nationalize. Postmaster-General announced to the publio in Western Australia that it was the intention of the Government to nationalize the industry, and, apparently, it did not matter what the nationalization would cost. It will be seen, therefore, that the Labour party themselves have increased the cost of living. The amendment also says that the Government have failed to realise the urgent necessity for an immediate revision of the Tariff. Well, the Labour party were in office for a long' time, and failed to do anything in that direction. I am pleased to see that an Inter-State Commission has been appointed, and I hope that, when a revision of the Tariff does take place, greater consideration will be given to the primary producers than has been the case in the past. I know I am now treading on dangerous ground, but I think that there might be reduced duties on many of the implements required by farmers and producers generally.",59
385,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,To the detriment of our manufacturing industries?,59
386,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"It is entirely due to the farmers that we have our manufacturing prosperity. It is interesting to note that, whenever there is a good season in the back country, everything progresses, and everybody is satisfied. Our progress and prosperity are due entirely to the primary industries which we have to protect first of all, afterwards building up the secondary industries. The whole future of Australia depends on the development of our primary industries. In conclusion, I again congratulate the Government on the policy they have brought forward. gives us a clear line of demarcationsomething on which we can go back to our people, to explain the policy we have in view. I believe the people are beginning to realise who are their friends.. Honourable members opposite are great believers in majority rule. They have a large majority in the Senate, and they know they have a minority in the country, and that the votes of the majority of the people of Australia were cast against the Socialistic party, and in favour of the Liberal party. Honourable members opposite should recognise the f u t i l it y of trying to carry on with the anomaly of a major i ty of Liberals in this House and a majority of the other party in the Senate, and surely they will see the necessity for helping us to get a double dissolution, so The ex- as to enable one party to be dominant in both Chambers. They must recognise what a loss it will be to the community if the House of Representatives alone is dissolved. It will mean a big expense, and if the l i be r a l party come back again to power, we shall be in exactly the same position-the Senate obstinately opposed to the legislation the Liberals desire to put on the statute-book. Therefore, in the interests of the country, and, probably, in the interests of the Socialists, it will be better to arrange to have a double dissolution and let the people of Australia say which party is to rule the Commonwealth. Mr HOWE .(Dalley) . [9.28] - Some considerable time ago my father supplied ine with a book called the Chatterboxlight literature of ineffective value in the way of education-and I am afraid that during this debate we have had much chattering that certainly has not been in structive, nor aided in any way the elucidation of the problems before us.

The honourable member for Dampier has said much of the ills have been undergone by men who are unionists and non-unionists. of the ills that my people undera stick, went when I was a boy. The honhe orable member talked about a man being chased out of his position. father was thrashed throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland, and black-listed from town to town, unable to live, and forced to starve, by those who had wealth and associations that enabled them to send letter after letter from to town, county to county, and district to district.

The primary industries are no more than secondary, tertiary, or quaternary industries. What is the use of the primary industry without a plough? Who makes the plough? Where is the primary industry without the harness for the horses, or without the houses built for the farmers, or without every aspect of the civilization that comes from the associated efforts of the community? All industries are primary in the same way. They are secondary in the same way. They are all connected. Each lives in relation to the other, and each does its best for the development of our civilization, and takes its reward out of the wealth that is produced. That is my answer to my honourable friend on the other side, and to any who have gone before him. I have heard the roaring of the Leader of this Parliament.",60

395,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must address the Chair.,60
396,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"The Minister of Defence has been going round the country making out that there is a scandal in connection with the Fitzroy Dock. Three weeks ago, in consultation with the Minister of Def fence, I asked for the papers, as I d id also twice in the House, and even as late as last Friday when the Minister went away to Sydney. I asked him to let me have the information to build up some utterance, and, so that I could use the little technical knowledge I have, to take out for myself the facts of the case. There has been nothing but refusal ; first, that of the Minister of Defence; and secondly, the explanation by the Honorary Minister that he would ask his leader for the information. Lastly, there was a refusal by the Prime Minister, as late as last night, to place information received from public officers on the table of the House. The honourable gentleman asked why I did not place in formation received from officers on the table. I have gone to no officers for in formation; but even if I had done so, can it be said that the private information I would receive would be on the same plane as that received by Ministers from official sources? The Ministry have in their possession reports which are the work of the mind and brain of capable engineers, whose services this country has bought. Such a report is not a secret document, and the Prime Minister has no more right to it than I have. If the honourable gentleman is prepared to let the truth be known, why does he not lay the reports on the table of the House or the Library, and so make them public property, in order that every honourable member who is interested in the safe conduct of that establishment, and in the preservation of life and limb, and of the property of the Commonwealth, may be in a position to weigh the information supplied, investigate it , assess its value, and speak upon it according to his ability? Ts my private information on the same plane as such reports? Surely it is not, and it is not correct for the Prime Minister to take up the attitude which he assumed last night. The fact that the honourable member for East Sydney, and the honourable member for South Sydney, and myself have not laid our private information on the table of the House is no justification of the Prime Minister's refusal to table papers which have been bought by public money in the interests of the country. That is my answer to the Prime Minister. I think it shows that there is nothing in this business but a piece of political dodgery and quackery. It is an attempt to depreciate the last Administration by a Government that is lacking in administrative capacity, and lacking in a policy of progressive legislation. On lines of defence, the Government are making an attack upon an Administration who did well. Ministers believe in defence, and so do we on this side. In the best interests of the country, we attempted to establish an effective system of defence; and associated with that system we took over what is known as the Fitzroy Dock, or the Cockatoo Island Dock. what advice did the last Government take over that dock ? It was under the advice of Admiral Henderson and of another gentleman, who came out from the Old Country with the reputation of a skilled dockyard man and a capable engineer. We paid for the property, and certainly have paid a large sum of money-ove r £800,000. Having paid for it , the party on this side suddenly find themselves attacked because something is supposed to be defective at the dock. It was known when the property was taken over that the boilers and plant generally were not in an effective condition; but I agree with the honourable member for South Sydney in the statement that 75 per cent, of the plant is practically new, and very high class plant it is. I have seen it , and know it , and I challenge contradiction of the statement. Then of the plant supposed to be old, there is scarcely a machine on the island that is not effective for reasonable work. I do not propose to defend the past or the present Administration in this connection. I believe that Mr Julius waa appointed to report upon the matter by the late Administration , and his report has been presented to the present Government. I do not blame any Government for appointing .an officer to report upon such a matter; but the real question is whether the officer appointed was capable and did the work he was appointed to do> effectively. I venture to say that the work in this case was done largely under the control, advice, and direction of Captain Clarkson. I ask what are the qualifications of Captain Clarkson? What is his status? What is there in him to justify his appointment to the Naval Board, and what is the position in which he stands when he ventures to report adversely upon a matter approved by Admiral Henderson?",60
397,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Did Admiral Henderson go into the question of the boilers ?,61
398,Mr RILEY,Unknown,He dealt with the question of the suitability of the Fitzroy Dock.,61
399,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"That is so. I shall come to the boilers presently, and will "" blow up "" the honourable member for Wentworth. If we may trust the Department-sinc e it is, supposedly, one of the official papers-Captai n Clarkson reported thusThe project was strongly reported against by Under Captain Clarkson, a member of the Naval Board, who urged that a ship-building establishment should be erected on some other site. A littl e later Captain Clarkson further reported as followsl a my opinion, the Cockatoo Island Dockyard has neither the staff, organization, nor facilities for building vessels for the Royal Australian Navy with either efficiency, economy, or despatch. I consider that if the proposal to build these vessels there is carried out, the result will be disastrous. Admiral Henderson not only advised the taking over of the Cockatoo Island Dock, but that, if possible, the Woolwich Dock of the Mort Engineering Company, closely associated with it , should also be taken over. The Cockatoo Island Dock was taken over, and now Captain Clarkson sets himself up against Admiral Henderson, and, at the same time, against the administration of the Cockatoo Island Dock.",61
400,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But the vernment set themselves against Admiral Henderson on that matter, as the honourable member should know.",62
401,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"No . They took over the dock, at all events.",62
402,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , but they repudiated Admiral Henderson's scheme.",62
403,Mr HOWE,Unknown,A d m i r a l Henderson recommended the taking over of the dock. Did the late Government take it over?,62
404,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes .,62
405,Mr HOWE,Unknown,That is all I am concerned about at present.,62
406,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But that is not whole of the case.,62

408,Mr RILEY,Unknown,I think the honourable member should have the protection of the Speaker.,62
409,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I do not need the protection of the.Chair. I am equal to the Prime Minister at any time. This was the first step in the process. What was in the mind of Captain Clarkson? He had a desire, if possible, to have this dock wiped out, and to establish another under his own control at Jervis Bay. That was the whole scheme from top to bottom. Captain Clarkson was to be a little God Almighty, controlling a new dock.",62
410,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Is that the reason for the Maryborough speech of the Leader of the Opposition, in which Jervis Bay was foreshadowed as a place for a dock ?",62
411,Mr HOWE,Unknown,I know nothing of that.,62
412,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The member is shooting at his own leader.,62
413,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I do not care who I am shooting at. I am here to defend the administration of Cockatoo Island Dock, and I am saying what I believe to be true. I wish to expose the action which this Government have taken in condemning the administration of the dock.",62
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member is under a misapprehension. We do not want to do anything to injure the dock. Mr . HOWE - I will tell the House what this Ministry have done. They have gone round the country, and have placed the administration of the dock in a very bad light. They have maligned it most mendaciously. Let me tell the House what has come from the lips of the Minister of Defence himself. How he could late Go- have possibly put this statement in the press is a mystery to me. It is headed, "" Cockatoo Island Dock,"" and it was published on 11th August. The M in ister of Defence stated that an independent engineer, Mr G. A . Julius, of Sydney, was appointed to inspect and report.",62
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Appointe d by whom ? By the Naval Board ?,62
416,Mr HOWE,Unknown,Doubtless .,62
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,B y the late Minister.,62
418,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"B y the Minister on the recommendation of the Board. I admit the that. Of course, Captain Clarkson was one of the Board. The others knew as much about engineering as a tom-cat knows about aeroplaning. This is the statement of the MinisterHis report was received on July 30, and here are some extracts from that document. I wish the House carefully to note this passageThe whole of the boilers, of which there are six, are practically worn out. All of them were, I believe,He did not know; he merely believedsecond-hand boilers when installed, and at the present time considerable repairs have been ef fected to keep them in running condition. This report was made by an engineer WL-J is supposed to have inspected the boilers, of which he says there are six. But then the Minister of Defence proceeded to sayOf fourteen boileis examined, five have been condemned. The ages of these are respectively 22 years, 28 years, 20 vears, 2q years, and 30 years. They were originally used for locomotive work, and others were taken from the Countess of Hofetoun and the Protector. honourable It will be noticed that in this passage the Minister speaks of fourteen boilers, whereas formerly he had spoken of six. Where does the truth lie ? Does it lie in the comment of the Minister that there were fourteen boilers which had been examined, or in the statement of the engineer who is supposed to have made the examination, and who said there were six? The fact is that Mr Julius never examined one boiler on the island. I challenge this Government to tell me when one boiler at Cockatoo Island was examined by this engineer. He went by hearsay, and made a report that, of course, was quite satisfactory to Captain Clarkson and the Naval Board, because it condemned the dock. If the Government were satisfied with Mr Julius' report, why was a re-survey instituted ? Did they doubt the efficiency of the engineer appointed on the advice of Captain Clarkson and his associates on the Board? If not, why this fresh survey? Why were 400 men turned out of employment ?",62
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Fou r hundred men ?,63
420,Mr HOWE,Unknown,About 400 were turned off.,63
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,For how long ?,63
422,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"The Government put them off on the Thursday, and paid them up to the Saturday, and many were out of work for a fortnight. Indeed, I have information to show that they are not all at work yet.",63
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There are fortydifferent four more being employed now than there were.,63
424,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I thank the Prime Minister for that interjection. He tells us that forty-four more men are being employed today than previously. Under what conditions ? If the boilers have been turned down as inefficient, and the pressure of the plant has been reduced, what are the additional forty-four men doing?",63
425,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Is the honourable member complaining because work has been found for these men ?,63
426,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I am complaining about the political dodgery and trickery of this Government. I know what it means from top to bottom, and I think I am getting the better of the argument.",63
427,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is it a fact, or is it not, that these forty-four extra men are employed ?",63
428,Mr HOWE,Unknown,I cannot tell.,63
429,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The honourable member does not know. [16],63
430,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"The Prime Minister said so, but I question the statement.",63
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member does not know, but he is sure that the statement is wrong.",63
432,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I did not say that; I merely questioned the statement. I have given my reasons for questioning it . Seeing that the boiler power of the establishment which employed about 1,281 men before it was shut down has been reduced by one-third, and that tliere are 1,325 men employed in it today, I fail to understand how the increase has been brought about. Where have the additional men been placed? In the first instance, the foundry and the blacksmith's shop would be closed down. Aa a matter of fact, I know that, at the present time, the blacksmith's shop is not is full working order, for the reason that the boiler power which is being utilized has been diminished to the extent I have indicated. Consequently, the men have to work any hours that they can. Then it would be impossible to get heat for the converters for the steel foundry. If plates were ready for plating a vessel, well and good, but if they were not, the plates could not be rolled without pressure, which means boiler power. Then there would be no power available in the carpenters' shop. Similarly there would be no power in the fitting and machine shops to operate the cranes and machines. These branches, representing a very large percentage of the working power of the establishment, were shut down, and I say unhesitatingly that today they are not in full working order. Of course, the Minister of Defence may have taken on artisans as labourers in the dock-yard where they are not needed, in order to cloak Ministerial ignorance and maladministration. I come now to another aspect of the case. The Government have been very determined in their investigations into the condition of affairs afi Cockatoo Island. Why do they not investigate the condition of affairs at the naval base at Williamstown ? What about the boilers installed there which were taken from the Countess of Hopeloun, and which are working effectively now ? How is it that the boilers placed on Cockatoo' Island are defective, whilst those placed at Williamstown are quite effective? Then as the Government are such perfect administrators, how does it happen that they have already bought second-hand boilers, which have been discarded by the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales, and installed them on Cockatoo Island. Do Ministers deny that they have done that?",63
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I cannot deny it , because I do not know.",64
434,Mr HOWE,Unknown,And the Minister of Defence cannot deny it . That is precisely what has been done. The Government have installed at Cockatoo Island two motive boilers which have run their mileage,64
435,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who has done it?,64
436,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"The Prime Minister's Administration-the Minister of Defence, I suppose, authorizing the officer in charge.",64
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who is he?,64
438,Mr HOWE,Unknown,The Prime Minister cannot trip me.,64
439,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member's argument is one long innuendo from beginning to end.,64
440,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"In that respect, the Prime Minister himself is not lacking.",64
441,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Why does honourable member make plain statements ?,64
442,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I make this plain statehim ment, that while the Government have condemned the late Administration for having installed at Cockatoo Island the condition second-hand boilers in a defective state, the present Administration, through the for officer in charge on the island, have purcondemned chased two locomotive boilers, which had been turned down by the Railways Combeen inevitable. missioners, as having run their mileage, because they were not satisfactory for locomotive purposes, though they are quite satisfactory for the purposes for which they are now being used. While these boilers may not be effective for motive work, they are quite good enough for the work on the island, and so were .the others which have been condemned.",64
443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable the member's allegation is that the boilers which have been condemned were all were applied to them. good ?,64
444,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"In the main, I say that Ithey were all good. The Government have done precisely what the Fisher Gowas vernment did, through the officer in charge on the island. They have taken testing boilers. boilers from the Countess of Hopetoun, and installed them. One of these boilers bas been placed in the Williamstowu dock-yard. Ministers have made a big row over the condition of affairs at Cockatoo Island, but they have made no investigation into the condition of affairs at Williamstown. Are life and limb of less value in the one case than in the other?",64
445,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does the honourable menir ber say that the Government have installed these second-hand boilers at Williamstown ?,64
446,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I say that the boilers are loconot bad boilers today, and it was only prejudice which prompted one person to take the action which he has taken-a n action which the present Government have not been slow to utilize to the disadvantage of the late Administration.",64
447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then the honourable member says that Captain Clarkson can make the other four members of the Naval Board do anything that he wishes ?,64
448,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I say that Captain Clarkson has played a pretty fair game for himself, and that the Government have not hesitated to take advantage of it and to play it up against our party.",64
449,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Who put him on the Board ? The honourable member's own not the Ministry, and he knows it.",64
450,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I do not care who put there. If wrong has been done, I am not going to defend it. We are toldThe examination of the thickness of plates and of the tubes of five boilers pointed to the fact that these boilers had been working years in an extremely dangerous condition. The Naval Board were of opinion that if the boilers had been working much longer under these conditions an explosion would have Last night, the Prime Minister asked for the official source of my information; but the writing which I hold in my hand does not look ""like official writing, does it? It is the writing of the practical men who locomade the examination of these boilers. But, apart from them, two gentlemen have interviewed me in Melbourne during the past fortnight, who are familiar witli condition of the boilers, and who have given me information as to the tests which I have here particulars of private tests made since those carried out at the instance of the authorities by a draftsman who, perhaps, never in a boiler in his life, and two other individuals who knew little about A boilermaker or a boilermaker's surveyor should be employed in conducting these tests. When the Navigation Bill was before us, we recognised that fact so fully that we sought to include in the Bill a provision that boilermakers should be employed as surveyors in respect of both the boilers and hulls of vessels. We recognised that difficulty was bound to arise unless such men were appointed as inspectors. boilermaker, by a mere tap of his hammer, can tell to the sixteenth of an inch the thickness of a plate.",64
451,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,In this case the man put his hammer through a plate.,65
452,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"That would not matter. Instead of endangering life, it would safeguard it . W hy is a safety-valve placed on a boiler ? Simply that it may afford a means of escape for any undue pressure of steam. You have your fires under a big iron shell filled with water, ancl the heat is going through the tubes while the water is expanding, and is being transformed into steam. If in such circumstances the safety-valve of the boiler were closed down, and an excessive pressure of steam were used, naturally one thing or the other would have to give way.  she goes.""",65
453,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Yes . In cases, inspectors seal down the safety-valve, so that a certain pressure, fixed upon, cannot be exceeded. The greed and avidity to make money exhibited by the average employer will prompt him to r un his boilers at more than a reasonable pressure, with the object of securing greater efficiency in his machinery. That spirit of greed and grab has in some cases been so strongly manifested that an inspector has had to lock down the safety-valves, so that they could not be opened without his assent. It is true, as has been said, that we have been fighting for boiler in spection ; but not in a Government dockyard where there are efficient engineers and men capable of taking charge of boilers.",65
454,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Does the honourable member suggest that these weak spots in a boiler constitute, in reality, so many extra safety-valves ?",65
455,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I say at once that, if a boiler were being worked at a dangerous pressure, the moment it developed a leak through which the hot water and steam could escape, the pressure would be relieved ; so that, instead of being a danger to life, such a weak spot would afiord relief. Nearly every boilermaker will bear out that statement. In many cases one can see the water pouring out of the [16]-* joints. It is true that those in charge close up the leakages as soon as they are discovered; and they do so because they desire to obtain greater efficiency. The opening up of a,, small hole A through which water and steam may escape does not mean in j u r y to life, but it does mean a diminution of the power of the boiler.",65
456,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Surely an sinexpected escape of steam or hot water must be very disconcerting to those who are working in the neighbourhood?,65
457,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"The Honorary Minister, if he asks the boilermakers what they think of the people who instituted this inquiry, will be told that "" they are a lot of damned fools.""",65
458,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That is rough on Senator Pearce.,65
459,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"That , at all events, is their view of the situation.",65
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,This is a scandalous attack on the late Administration.,65
461,Mr RILEY,Unknown,The Prime Minister cannot get out of it .,65
462,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Let me get back, however, to the boiler tests. The Ministerial party have made so much' df this matter that I must deal with it . As I was mentioning when interrupted, I have details of the results of private tests to which some of the boilers at Cockatoo Island were submitted. The loco-type boiler, No. 3, was tested at a pressure of 330 lbs. to the square inch, the working pressure being only 110 lbs; and the report of those who conducted that test is that the boiler is ""as tight as a bottle."" This is one of the old boilers that has been condemned. At this private test the Tlopetoun's boiler was tested at a pressure of 250 lbs., and the working pressure was only 110 lbs. to the square inch. The report is that the tubes leaked a little , but that the leakage would not cause bursting. It would simply put out the fire. The Protector's boiler in the blacksmith's shop was tested at a pressure of 180 lbs., and there was no leakage. In one of these cases the test was made at a pressure three times in excess of the ordinary working pressure, and in the main the boilers were found to be fairly effective. It is true that they are not up to date; but they are not, and have never been, worked at full pressure. Those who furnished the official report have said that these boilers must be worked at a diminished pressure; but, as a matter of fact, it has always been recognised that they must be worked at a reduced pressure. Another aspect of this matter is that the tlopetoun's boiler was tested at a pressure two and a half times in excess of the workiug pressure, and that is regarded as a destructive pressure for even a boiler in good condition. When a man builds a machine he always allows a margiu of safety.",65
463,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,What is the Board of Trade's factor of safety in respect of boilers ?,66
464,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I cannot say for the moment, but the insurance companies' test of new boilers is at a pressure only twice, aud sometimes only one and a half times, as much as the working pressure.",66
465,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And those were the tests applied here.,66
466,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I am speaking now of private tests, apart from the official tests that were made.",66
467,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"All boilers working at a pressure of 110 lbs. were tested at a pressure of 155 lbs., not 300 lbs., as the honourable meinber said.",66
468,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I have just been referring to the private, and not the official, tests. Is it not a disgrace to the present Administration that an honourable meinber who knows something about these matters-matter s affecting the safety of life, limb, and property-ha s not had an opportunity to see the official report on the subject, although the Prime Minister has it at hand ? I had to get my information as best I could, not from oflicers, from men who are doing practical work. In response to my application, they gave me such information as they could in connection with the tests which were being made by the direction of the Minister, and also privately for their own defence.",66
469,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Such information as they could give, which was not very reliable.",66
470,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I venture to say that the information they supplied to me is reliable. I will back the average boilermaker to beat the draftsman whom the Minister sent there, to state the value of a boiler.",66
471,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Do you say that all tliese officers have done wrong?,66
472,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"No ; but I think that they have acted stupidly, without knowledge of what they were doing. They were not practical men. They were the wrong men to select to make the tests; and, what is more than likely, knowing that the honourable gentleman was going round the country, they wanted to play into his hands.",66
473,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That is a pretty serious reflection on four honourable men.,66
474,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is a serious reflection on the Board, too.",66
475,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I do not mind if it is a reflection on the four men or on the Board. I am stating facts, and care not where the reflection lies. If I do an injustice to any man, I will willingly apologize to him next day. But while I feel that some dastardly work is being done, I shall fight against it as hard as possible, and give the reasons for my attitude. Again, I ask the Minister to lay the reports on the table, and to appoint an independent Commission.",66
476,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If all you say is right, it was time that Senator Pearce got out of there.",66
477,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"If what I say is right, it is time that the honourable gentleman acceded to our request for a Commission. If I cannot get justice on this side of the House, I shall be ready on Tuesday to tie up the honourable gentleman and his Administration.",66
478,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,This is the most scandalous attack that has been made on Senator Pearce.,66
479,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I do not think that there is any occasion for me to further deal with this matter, but I do invite the Adminisbut tration to grant us an inquiry.",66
480,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I have several times called for order. I shall not give another warning, but deal with the next honourable member who offends.",66
481,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Look at the other side 1,66
482,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,66
483,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I invite the Government to appoint an independent Board of I nquiry or Commission to look into the administration of Cockatoo Island Dock, and thus provide us with an independent report. I shall not be very much afraid of the outcome of such an inquiry. With these remarks, I shall leave the question of the dock. I am very pleased that the Attorney-General is in the chamber, because I had occasion, a few nights ago, to interrupt him. I am sure that you, sir, and the House, will pardon me if I quote from the Argus a report of his utterance in the HouseThere was a time in the history of modern of the funds of my union. Europe when associations connected with tries of mauy kinds were recognised by and fulfilled the duties allotted them. Those guilds regulated apprenticeship and generally performed invaluable services to the community. But did the unions of today exist for pose of encouraging apprenticeship? Did they not, instead, urge the limiting of apprentices? (Ministerial cheers.) Did the unions of today insist on full effort being put forth by members? It was no uncommon thing for a limit to be put on the output of a man's work. (Opposition dissent.) Unions, as they today, were really political organizations of an aggressive character. Apparently, the honourable member's view the is that they were not political organizatical Labour tions in the pastIn New South Wales and Western Australia unions had to furnish returns showing their income and their expenditure under certain headings. In the last New South Wales returns the are making contributions. total income of the unions was and the total expenditure ^146,599. Of the latter sum, the expenditure on claims for accident, sick benefit, & c , was ig.5 of the total. But management and other expenses represented 7.1-.13 per cent. Not alone the implication, but the statement of the honourable gentleman, was that this large sum was being spent in political organization. If the thought had occurred to the honourable gentleman, he might have made an application to the Statistician of New South Wales, from whom he would have learned that the Registrar of Friendly Societies and Trade Unions issues a special form setting out clearly and distinctly the headings under which must be stated the moneys received by a union, and the purposes to which they are devoted. I ask the honourable gentleman to obtain from the Registrar a report as to how much money has been spent in political organization for political fighting. I venture to say that, after he has obtained a report, he will retract the innuendo or the suggestion which is embodied in his statement here. take my own organization. Because I am a politician today, my fellow members will not even allow me to hold office in the organization. They say that no man who is not working at his trade has a right to hold office in the union. Why? Because he might unduly influence its operations to his own interest. I justify my fellow members in taking up that attitude. I am a member of a union over 10,000 strong in Australia, and with seventy-seven branches. 1I have been through three or four political campaigns, but 1I have never received a penny out What I did indusreceive was the support of one or two law branches with which I was closely associated-no t by striking a levy, but simply by coming together as a body of three the purindependent men and saying, "" We will pay up 3d. or 6d."" In the last campaign, two branches came to my aid, and betheir tween them they gave me the sum of £14a gift which I fully appreciated, not for the sake of the money, but because of the spirit existed of good fellowship which it represented. The same thing can be said of most of unions. A day or two ago the Prime Minister quoted the secretary to the PoliLeague of New South Wales as having said, in effect, that the unions have not contributed money, while the total Attorney-General has suggested that they Which stategiven as ,£161,448, ment is correct?",66
484,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,The big Australian Workers Union did not give me a penny for the last electoral fight.,67
485,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Our funds are not spent on political purposes. We have other things to spend them on. There are sick and accident and other benefits to provide; there are also the proceedings in the Arbitration Courts, for which the lawyers charge so much. That is where a great deal of the money has been going for a considerable time past. The Attorney-General has perhaps gained his share from the other side. We have been forced to pay through the nose for law expenses. Then, too, the cost of administration is always great when those in charge are not trained accountants cr business men. The members of unions are at their work all day, and have to conduct the union business as well as they can. Consequently there is extravagance in administration, but there are also gifts I will to charities and to associated unions, of which nothing is heard, but which eat up the funds.",67
486,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Is the honourable member's union affiliated with the Political Labour League?,67
487,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"As a union, it is not. We admit the right of every branch to affiliate if it likes; some are affiliated, others are not. Those that affiliate contribute at the rate of 2d. per member per annum. I ha\e a list here of all the branches of my union in Australia, and one can quickly ascertain the total membership. Under our rules no branch may have more than 300 members. That is considered a sufficient number for a secretary who gets only a nominal sum to look after his branch.",67
488,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Not one branch in Victoria is affiliated.,68
489,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"That is so. I had the fight of my life to get my branch to affiliate with the Trades and Labour Council. It is the most Conservative body in trades unionism, and I regret to say its members, generally, are not in touch with me in this matter. There are other questions on which I intended to speak, but I shall imitate the Attorney-General, and curtail my remarks. It is not agreeable to me to peat what others have said, nor to traverse ground that has been gone over by others, perhaps more effectively. Then, too, I have not been well of late, and my throat' is bad, so that I shall not do myself good by continuing. I feel that we are on the right road. There some works here to which I direct the attention of the Attorney-General. I direct his attention to the Conflict of Capital and Labour, Webb's History of Trade Unionism, and the Guilds and Companies of London. The honourable gentleman was not correct in saying that the modern union differed from the guilds of the middle ages in seeking to limit apprentices and using political influence. If he will look through the works I have named he will see that the guilds were always limiting apprentices and - taking political action. The unions are assailed by honourable members opposite for entering into politics, but they cannot prevent them from doing so. take political action whether honourable members opposite like it or not, and we will win. You cannot keep back the flowing tide-cal l it revolutionary if you will. It is steadily coming in, and is overflowing the bulwarks of Conservatism. The tide is one that will not recede. There is a rhythmic action in human affairs, a to and fro swing of the pendulum. The movement with which we on this side are associated is a forward motion. shall be with it to the day of my death, and I wish it success after my decease.  journed. ADJOURNMENT. COMMONWEALTH WOEK : RATES OF PAT. Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",68
490,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"Oxley) [10.33] - I wish to ask the Minister a question regarding the payment of men engaged on a Commonwealth work that is now being carried on in Brisbane. I understand that the men engaged upon the construction of a new drill-shed at Kelvin Grove are receiving only 8s. a day, and must provide their own tools, while not far away other men are receiving from the Commonwealth 9s. a day, and have not to provide their own tools. I want to know whether this distinction is being made, re- and, if so, what is the reason for it? Is the drill-shed at Kelvin Grove being carried out by the State Government? Is that why the men are not receiving the wages that are paid in another case by the Commonwealth Government?",68
491,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Brisbane) [10.34]. are - The question raised by the honourable member is a very important one. I have already called attention to it by correspondence with the Department of Home Affairs, as well as in the House. I know there has been some friction between the Department of Home Affairs and the State Department of Public Works in Queensland, because of the Federal Department insisting on certain rates of wages which happen to be higher than the usual State rates. Twelve months ago I called attention to the fact that the painters on Commonwealth work in Queensland were not being paid the 10s. rate which had been stipulated by the Department of Home Affairs. The We will State Department, which was carrying out the work, was paying 9s. to their own painters, and declined to have two rates of pay; and it was only after correspondence and very definite instructions by the Commonwealth Minister that the State Department agreed to pay the higher rate. Even then the State Department resorted to a subterfuge, because they paid their own workmen 9s. per day and 6d. for travelling expenses, I while they paid the Commonwealth men 9s. per day and ls. 6d. travelling expenses. The ex-Minister of Home Affairs had stipulated that men engaged in ordinary pick-and-shovel work should be paid the rate of 9s.; but in Brisbane, at the present time, State workmen on Commoninitialed wealth works are paid only 8B., and have to find their own tools. I do not imagine for a moment that the Department of Home Affairs has decided to reduce the pay; and if men on Commonwealth work are paid 9a. per day in some places, they ought to be paid the same rate al l over Australia. AHI ask is that the stipuleges lated wages shall be paid.",68
492,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Assistant Minister of Home Affairs) [10.38] - It appears that it was arranged on but 13th June, 1911, that this work should be carried out by day labour, and sire the State proceeded to so carry f t out on the 16th of the same month. The first I heard of the matter was by the was as follows: courtesy of the honourable member for Brisbane today, and I have not had much time to make complete in q u i r y; but I find from the file of correspondence that there is some tangible excuse for the State Government paying 8s. per day, which monwealth works. is the Wages Board rate in Queensland. The ex-Minister of Home Affairs gave a general direction that day labourers were to receive 9s. per day, and the Departbrought ments of the various States were advised of this determination. Most of the States simply accepted the position; but Brisbane Government wrote the followtion, ing letter to the ex-Minister of Home Affairs on the 19th June, 1911: Department of Public Works, Dear Sir,I am in receipt of your letter of the instant with regard to the rate of wages paid to day labourers employed on works carried out for the Commonwealth Government, and, throughout the Commonwealth. in reply, I have to inform you that the wages not require this spectacular that are being paid to labourers in the Brisbane wheel district aie 111 accordance with the determination of the Builders' Labourers Board for that district, and constituted under the Wages Act of 1008. A copy of the determination enclosed herewith for your perusal, also a copy of our special conditions with regard to rates of wages to be paid to all classes woTkers. Yours faithfully. Secretary for Public Works. That was the statement of the position cf the Queensland Government, who were acting as our agents in connection with the day-labour proposition. H a d the exall round. Minister of Home Affairs really had at heart a keen desire that the men bane should be paid 9s. per day,' what action might he have reasonably been expected to take on the receipt of that communication? We find the communication, not as disapproved, but simply as "" Seen,"" on the 3rd July, 1911, and apparently it was then put away in a pigeon-hole. Further, so far as I can gather from the file, no action was afterwards taken by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs to see that' the men in Brisbane enjoyed the same privi as were enjoyed by workmen elsewhere. As I say, before this afternoon I had not the faintest knowledge of this matter, I sent a telegram to Brisbane i m mediately. Unlike my predecessor, I deto see the men in Brisbane, get the same chances as their colleagues throughout Australia; and the telegram I sent Minister for Public Works, Brisbane. Am informed today that day labourers employed at Kelvin Grove are being paid less than nine shillings per diem. Please pay minimum nine shillings all ordinary labourers employed ComMinister f o i Home Affairs, W. H. KEliT. Had the honourable member for Brisbane this matter' up months ago when he first knew of it , those men in Brisbane would have had their fears set at rest the immediately by the present Administraand there would have been no occasion to make this a matter for discussion on the adjournment of the House.
