4,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Has the Acting Prime Minister any intimation to make with reference to the possibility of an early termination of the seamen's strike? Mr WiATT - I have had today a conversation with my honourable colleague, SenatoT Millen, who is in charge of this matter, and he informs me that the Central Council of the Seamen's Federation is in consultation in Melbourne today. He is hopeful of an early termination of the struggle; but beyond that I am not entitled to go at this stage.",21
5,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I have received today seven telegrams, one of which I may be permitted to read as indicating the character of the wholo of them. It is as follows:Ingham, Queensland, 3.20 p.m. No flour procurable here, other foodstuffs almost exhausted, general and isolation hospitals here full influenza patients; no butter procurable.

No one appreciates more than I do the situation in Queensland at the present time. The honourable member is aware of the abnormal conditions at present obtaining. We hope at any moment to be able to relieve the situation, and as the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) has already said in the House, as soon as the opportunity arises those places most acutely affected by the trouble will bo the first to he relieved.

7,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT OP ELECTORAL,"I think that the honOTahle member must mean that he desires to keep the House in my confidence. I cannot at present tell him the form of the Bill, because it is not yet finalized and drafted. NA MINISTER. ADJOURNMENT OF TH E HOUSE.",21
8,Mr WATT,RETURN OP THEPRIM E,"Las t week honourable members on both sides asked for an early intimation as to the intentions of the Government with regard to the sittings of the Parliament in view of the early retur n of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). I promised to announce at the earliest possible moment the decision of the Government. I have now to state that, in order to allow time for consultation between the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, it is proposed that Parliament shall rise for a week. Both Houses will , therefore, adjourn on Friday, 29th August, u n t i l Wednesday, 10th September. PUBLIC SERVICE ACT. NA",21
9,Mr GREGORY,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Will the Acting Prime Minister state whether the Government will give Parliament an opportunity this session to amend the Public Service Act, with a view to granting the fullest preference to sailors and soldiers who have seen active service?",22
10,Mr WATT,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am not quite convinced that such an amendment is necessary; but it is hoped by the Government that a general revision of the Public Service Act will be possible before the end of the session. If it is, that will provide the opportunity to which the honourable member refers. NA AUSTRALIA.",22
11,Mr CHARLTON,COURT MARTIAL ON,"Has Minister for the Navy yet received a reply from the British Admiralty regarding the request of the Government for the extension of clemency to' those who Avere sentenced by the court martial on Australia? '  answer than that which I gave last week, when I stated that the Admiralt y were "" awaiting the receipt of ""the papers in regard to the court martial. I am expecting at any time to receive a further reply to the appeal made by the Government. NA SUSTENANCE ALLOWANCE .",22
12,Mr MATHEWS,UNEMPLOYED RETURNED,"In vicw of the fact that a great many returned soldiers are out of work, will the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation state whether his Department' is prepared to grant all such men out of work a sustenance allowance u n t i l employment can be secured for them?  member will give notice of his question, I shall be able to place it before the Minister for Repatriation (Senator M ill e n ) , and to secure for him an official reply. We are now providing sustenance for a very large number of returned soldiers out of work. I am not aware that any of them SOLDIERS. are not provided for. MEAT EXPORT.",22
13,Mr RODGERS,UNEMPLOYED RETURNED,"In view of the rather unfavorable seasonal conditions, and the congestion of meat in the freezing chambers in most of the States, will the Government use every effort to secure in sulated space to accommodate the abnormal supplies of mutton and lamb that are likely to come forward during the next few months?",22
14,Mr WATT,UNEMPLOYED RETURNED,Every effort in that direction has been made. The Government will not relax its endeavours to get a proper outlet for the frozen meat HMAS. that is awaiting export; and we shall do what we can to get the requisite insuthe Acting lated tonnage. NA PROFITEERIN G. HMAS. Mr BURCHELL - Will the Government immediately convene a conference of State Premiers to discuss and deter-' mine whether the States will voluntarily surrender all powers necessary to enable the Commonwealth Parliament to comprehensively deal with the increased cost of living and profiteering ?,22
15,Mr WATT,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"The Government haa under consideration the question of profiteering in its relation to the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and SOLDIER S. the States, but I frankly say that I have not' much faith in a conference such as the honourable member suggests. Even when the Commonwealth has been able to persuade a number of leading State thinkers to take a certain view, it has proved a matter of considerable difficulty to secure unanimity in the counsels of the States. AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL PORCE. REMISSIO N OF PINES - RATIONALLOW ANCE-CANTEE N PROFITS-REDUCTIO N OF SENTENCES.",22
16,Mr YATES,COST OP LIVINGAN D,Will the Assistant M ister for Defence favourably consider the question of remitting the fines of members of the Australian Imperial Porce who remained with their units while they were completing their sentences?,23
17,Mr WISE,COST OP LIVINGAN D,I shall submit that matter to the Acting Minister for Defence (Senator Russell).,23
18,Mr WALLACE,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"Will the Assistant Minister for Defence order the payment of ration allowance to members of the Australian Imperial Porce Pay Corps, who have not received such pay while on recreation leave ?",23
19,Mr WISE,COST OP LIVINGAN D,I shall submit the honourable member's request to the Acting Minister.,23
20,Mr BURCHELL,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"In connection with the disposal of canteen and regimental funds of the Australian Imperial Force, will the Government consider the advisabilitv of requesting from the Imperial Government a share of the accumulated profits, amounting to approximately Â£6,000,000 in the British canteen funds, which were largely contributed to by members of the Australian Imperial Porce ?",23
21,Mr WISE,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"The matter will receive consideration. Mr WATKINS , - H as the Defence Department yet considered the desirability of reducing some of the long sentences imposed upon members of the Australian Imperial Force overseas, and which are now being served in Australian prisons ?",23
22,Mr WISE,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"The matter was considered, and a scheme was announced to Parliament. The punishment for all purely military oSences was remitted entirely, and in respect of offences of a civil character a remission of so many weeks for each year of the sentence was allowed. THE PEACE LOAN .",23
23,Mr MAXWELL,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"H as a publicity officer in connection with the projected Peace loan been appointed ? If so, were applications for the position called for - from returned soldiers?",23
24,Mr WATT,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"May I , without invidious distinction, congratulate the honourable member on having asked a question for in - the first time since he entered Parliament.. I am sorry that he has broken for the time being his exceptional and good example.",23
25,Mr BRENNAN,COST OP LIVINGAN D,He knew all the rest without being told.,23
26,Mr WATT,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"That shows what a clairvoyant mind the honourable member for Fawkner must have. I am not aware whether a publicity officer has been appointed, but I assume the same arrangements have been made in connection with the Peace loan as with former loans. I shall ascertain what steps have been taken, and in for m the honourable member. CENSORSHIP OF BOOKS.",23
27,Mr BRENNAN,COST OP LIVINGAN D,I ask the Acting Prime Minister how far the prohibition against the importation and sale of certain books during the war has been removed? A number of my friends are anxious to take out of the cellars some books which have been getting mildewed during the war.,23
28,Mr WATT,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"It would improve some of the books of which I am aware if they did get mildewed. I cannot answer the question offhand, but shall do so if the honourable member gives notice of it . GRANT TO RIFLE CLUBS.",23
29,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"Will the Government decide as early as possible their policy in regard to the grant to rifle clubs? They are with in a few weeks of the annual shooting competitions, and they desire to make their arrangements according to the funds that will he available.",23
30,Mr WATT,COST OP LIVINGAN D,I understand that the matter is receiving the close attention of the Acting Minister for Defence (Senator Russell). I shall submit the honourable member's question to him at once. IMPERI AL WOOL CONTRACT.,23
31,Mr RODGERS,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"In view of the termination of hostilities and the special condition contained in the Imperial wool contract, will not the position now he that all the unsold wool in the Old Country, amounting to 1,250,000 bales of the last clip and the forthcoming clip, be sold on the joint account of the Imperial Government and the Australian growers, thus enhancing the return to the growers?",24
32,Mr WATT,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"Speakin g offhand, I should imagine that the terms of the contract mean that as there will be less military requirements for the coming year there will be a larger civilian issue of wool. Therefore there will be more wool subject to the higher price, if any, than to the flat rate. I may go further, and, speaking in the same way, say that if the price rises, or if the price keeps up, it will be of great advantage to the wool-grower, whose wool is either in the Pool today or will be next year. But it depends entirely on what happens to the market, and I doubt whether either the honourable member or any of the wool kings can predict with certainty what will happen to the wool market in 1920. WHEAT POOL: PAYMENTS.  Acting Prime Minister promised to tell us when the instalments for the 1915-16 and the 1916-17 wheat would be paid, and we were also told that a general statement would be made as to the position of the Pool. When will that statement be forthcoming ?",24
33,Mr WATT,COST OP LIVINGAN D,"The general statement to which I referred has already been published, showing the payment position and the overdraft position. Whether the Government will be able to make a further payment on the earlier Pool depends, as I explained formerly, on when we get paid for the Â£10,000,000 or Â£11,000,000 worth of wheat recently sold. This matter is not yet cleared up in the correspondence between the Imperial Exchequer and the Commonwealth Treasury; but we .secured an advance of Â£2,500,000 at the latter end of July in anticipation of a settlement being made agreeable to both parties. When the .payment question is cleared up, the Government will be able to see ahead and determine what payments can be safely made. NA PRTJITS.",24
34,Mr WALLACE,EXPORTATIO N OP CANNED,"Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that commission agents are buying up all available canned fruit, with a view to exporting it? If this be true, will he see that sufficient supplies are available for home consumption ?",24
35,Mr WATT,EXPORTATIO N OP CANNED,"This is really a question, I should say, for the Minister for Trade ancl Customs (Mr Greene), who is now on. his way to Queensland.",24
36,Mr MCWILLIAMS,EXPORTATIO N OP CANNED,I wish you could tell us where we can sell the canned fruit.,24
37,Mr WATT,EXPORTATIO N OP CANNED,"I think the proper thing would be for the honourable member for Pranklin (Mr MCWilliams) to seek to do business with the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Wallace), and thus settle the matter. Probably the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) would 'act as broker without commission. I do not know anything of the facts of the case, and certainly I am not prepared to promise that this Government will wade into the fruit market, and buy enough supplies for the people. NA RAILWAY. INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE.",24
38,Mr YATES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is the Minister for Works and Railways aware that there is a dispute on the East-West railway, and that it has been threatened that if matters are not adjusted before the end of the month there will be a strike? Will the honourable gentleman endeavour to settle the present difficulty, so that we may not have a repetition of the circumstances of the seamen's strike?",24
39,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The matter the honourable member refers to is in the hands of the Railway Commissioner at the present time. DEFERRED PAT .,24
40,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have received several complaints from members of the Naval Forces in Western Australia about delay in the payment of deferred .pay. Will the Acting Minister for the Navy eee that the position is rectified?  complaints of the kin d it has been found that the (blame is not altogether attributable to the Department. In the case of some of the men a considerable amount of deferred pay has been for some sixty days in the bank; and unless they give the Department addresses it is difficult to know where to send it . Money has been posted to Western Australia, and, apparently, the men have not received it . If the honourable member will give me any particular case I shall have it inquired into at once. GERMAN NEWGUINEA : ROYAL COMMISSION .",25
41,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is it true that a Royal Commission, consisting of Judge Murray,. Mr Atlee H u n t , and Mr Lucas, has appointed to inquire into the administration of ex-German New Guinea ? If so, why was Parliament not consulted before the Commission was appointed?",25
42,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is true that a Royal Commission has been appointed to deal, in advance, with the system of government and other matters in connection with outlines already considered by the Cabinet. This is not a matter which at present can be submitted to Parliament, but as soon as a B i ll is ready, Parliament will be consulted by the submission of that Bill . - f TRANSPORT PORT LYTTLETON.",25
43,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"L as t Friday, on the adjournment, I called attention to the bad food supplied to the troops on the Port Lyttleton. Have any inquiries been made, or have the Government any information in refutation of my statement?",25
44,Mr WATT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Accordin g to a promise, I sent the matter for the immediate consideration of the Department concerned, NAVY. but, at this stage, I am not able to say what the result is. Unfortunately, the Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department has been seized with sudden illness, and the office - has become dislocated a little. I shall endeavour to get the information today or tomorrow. USURY BILL .",25
45,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the Government, during the recess, consider the in troduction of a Usury Bill?",25
46,Mr WATT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I cannot say whether the Government can pledge itself to that course, because I have had no opportunity of conferring with the Cabinet. I should require evidence that the functions discharged by the States in this connection are ineffective before I felt that the Commonwealth was called on to interfere. I should also have to be assured that we were constitutionally entitled to act in such a matter. TELEPHONE CONDUITS.",25
47,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has work yet been resumed in connection with the telephone been conduits for the Postal Department, or is there likely to be a resumption at an early date, so as to absorb a large number of the unemployed?",25
48,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The work has been temporarily delayed on account of the action of a few bricklayers' labourers, but a settlement has been, or is about to be, made in the dispute, and work will be resumed at an early date. FLOUR SHIPMENT .",25
49,Mr BURCHELL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon noticeReferring to the sale of a cargo of 7,500 tons of flour sent from Western Australia to Egypt at Â£27 10s. per ton1. What was the rate of freight? 2. What was paid for insurance and commission ? 3. What was the average rate per flour ton paid to millers by the Western Australian Wheat Scheme for gristing the wheat from which this flour was made? 4. Was it shipped ex store at North Fremantle, or from trucks ex mills, and what were the handling charges and cost of shipping? 5. What was the net equivalent per bushel of wheat to the grower, taking Â£27 10s. per long ton of flour, less freight, insurance, commission, handling, and shipping charges? 6. Wihat was the rate per bushel of wheat paid iby a Western Australian miller on the last cargo of flour shipped from Fremantle to Egypt by the steamer Meikai Maru on the Sth April last?",25
50,Mr WATT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The sale referred to was not made to Egypt. A sale to Denmark is probably referred' to. In the interests of wheat-growers, it is not considered advisable to make public the details asked for. The wheat-growers' representatives on the Australian Wheat Board are aware of the facts. EXPORT OF BASE METAL S.",26
51,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeWill the Government approve of the export of base metal ores from Western Australia forthwith, subject to the same being sent to approved countries?",26
52,Mr WATT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I appreciate the consideration shown by the honourable member in having held back this question on one or two occasions. The answer is a3 follows: The policy of the Government to have, as far as practicable, all ores treated within the Commonwealth, is designed for the betterment of the Australian metal industry. If evidence is furnished that the conditions imposed are unnecessarily burdensome to any producers, by reason of .their geographical situation, the Government will investigate the matter with a view to the mo'dification of the conditions in such special cases. ENEMY ALIENS.",26
53,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"for Mr MOGRATH ) asked the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon noticeWliether he can inform the House when the restrictions that were imposed upon Germans and other alien subjects are likely to be removed ?",26
54,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is impossible at this stage to reply, as the whole question of the policy of the Government with respect to aliens is under consideration. NA CHANTER.",26
55,Mr YATES,STATEMENT BY MAJOR,"the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Is it a fact that a copy of the press cutting comment by Private Friend, published immediately following Major Clianter's statement relative to the charge of inciting to mutiny on the troopship Somali, was tendered as evidence at the preliminary inquiry? 2. If the proprietors of the Adelaide Register contend that Major Chanter supplied the statement referred to, knowing it would be published, will he be dealt with according to regulation ? 3. If Major Chanter urges that his statements got into the press without his knowledge, will that exonerate him from being dealt with for giving military information to persons whereby it was published in the press? , Mr Wise - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l Acting low:1. The press cutting was not received in evidence at the taking of the summary of evidence. 2 and 3. The contents of the press cutting referred to, irrespective of the responsibility of any officer for the supply of all or portion of them to thu press, are not considered to be of such a nature as to warrant any disciplinary action under Australian Military Regulation 471 or 472. APPOINTMEN TS TO POST-WAR ARMY.",26
56,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,STATEMENT BY MAJOR,"for Mr . KELLY ) asked the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Witb reference to his assurance to the House on the 1st instant that the principal positions in our post-war army will be offered to the officers who have given the best service to Australia at the war, irrespective of whether or not they were previously members of the permanent staff, is it a fact that the Minister for Defence about the same time assured permanent officers in London thlat the Department would not employ other than present permanent officers in post-war permanent military positions, and suggested as the only alternative to joining the British or Indian armies open to non-permanent officers, however brilliant their war services, was to take up some civil occupation in Australia? 2. If the Minister for Defence has been correctly reported, will Parliament be given an early opportunity to decide whether military and administrative abilities brought out by the war are to be permanently lost to Australia in the interest of less efficient "" permanent"" officers?",26
57,Mr WISE,STATEMENT BY MAJOR,"Tihe''answer s to the honourable member's questions are as follow :- 1. According to a press report, yes. 2. The re-organization of the M i l it a r y Forces will be considered by the Government on the conclusion of demobilization, and Parliament will then Wave an opportunity of discussing the question of appointments. So far as the Defence Act allows, an endeavour will be made to secure the appointment to each office of the man most competent to f ill it , and, upon reorganization, considerable opportunities will occur of utilizing the services of those who have served abroad. It must not be forgotten, however, that the Australian Army is a Citizen one, and the few permanent offices that exist are filled by men who were induced to adopt soldiering as a profession and qualify themselves by a course of study. On their merits alone, tlile claims of these men, practically all of whom have served abroad, cannot be overlooked, and it is not the present intention to displace any permanent officer who has rendered service at the Front. COST TO AUSTRALIA .",27
58,Mr WEST,STATEMENT BY MAJOR,"for Mr MCDONALD) asked the Treasurer, upon notice What amount.of money was paid abroad to soldiers and for war materials during the war and up to 30th Juno, 1919?  the a p p r o x i m at e figures:Pay and other military expenditure (including payment by the Government of the United Kingdom for maintenance of Australian troops at the Front) . .

The four wheat-growers' representatives aro wheat-growers growing wheat in their respective States. It is not known whlether or not the Ministers are wheat-growers. 3.

61,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIAN WHEAT,This subject be considered in connection with for t h c o m in g Budget . BRITISH EMIGRATION:,28
62,Mr BURCHELL,AUSTRALIAN WHEAT,"the Acting Prinie Minister, upon notice I. Whether the Imperial Government have expressed any desire to assist emigration to the Dominions? 2. If so, what form of emigration was proposed, i.e., domestic workers, demobilized soldiers, mechanics, tradesmen, &c. ? 3. Was any financial proposal made for assisted passages, financial assistance to Dominion Governments by way of loans or public works, &c? 4. What is the policy of the Commonwealth Government on this question?",28
63,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN WHEAT,"The answers to the honlow :orable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. The proposed emigration scheme is intended to apply to ex-service men, namely, officers and men of the Royal Navy, British Army (excluding Dominion and colonial contingents), or Koyal A i r Force, who have served in the present war, and who wish to settle within the Empire overseas, provided they are going to assured employment, and are otherwise acceptable to the Government of the country to which they desire to emigrate. The scheme will also apply to ex-service women, i.e., those who enrolled for whole-time Service for not less than six months in corps under the direction of the British Government. Two lady delegates sent out by the Imperial authorities are at present on their way to Australia to inquire into the prospects of openings for women. 3. The British Government have intimated that they will provide free passages to the Dominions for emigrants of the classes referred to above. The question of further assistance to the Dominions Governments by way of loans to open up fresh lands, <fcc, was raised in a Conference of Imperial and Dominions representatives held some months ago, but apparently nothing definite has been decided yet. 4. The matter of settling on the land or otherwise assisting British, ex-service men and women is mainly one for the State Governments to deal with, but the Commonwealth Government intends to co-operate with them as far as possible. The matter was discussed in the Premiers' Conference held at the beginning of the year, but finality was not reached. A further Conference will be necessary. In the meantime, apart from the difficulty of securing shipping accommodation before next will year for ex-service men and women who may the be selected for emigration to Australia, it is generally recognised that the claims of our own - repatriated soldiers in regard to land settlement and employment should be attended to first.

73,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Y a r r a ) [3.38] - As this Bill has already passed the Senate, honourable members are, to some extent, f a m i liar - with its principal features - but I was disappointed at the speech of the Minister (Mr Groom) who moved the second reading. He gave us very few details. He did not tell U3 what the Institute of Science and Industry would be likely to cost. This is also a defect of the Bill itself. It does not mention the salaries to be paid to the directors. The M in ister has explained that other measures do not set for th the salaries payable to the officers appointed under them; but I may draw attention to the fact that in the .measure which created the High Court the salaries to be paid to the Justices were fixed, and that the Public Service Act fixes the salary of the Publio Service Commissioner. I hope that, before this Bill leaves the Chamber, honourable members will express' a strong opinion upon the point, and that provision will be made in it for the salaries to be paid to the directors of the Institute. An outcry has been raised in certain quarters against the Bill . It is said that the Government and Parliament are about to bring into existence another big spending machine. I do not worry about the creation of a big spending Department if there is a prospect of getting value for the money to be spent; but it is important that we should know whether this Institute is to be a theoretical or a practical one.",29
74,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Essentiall y practical.,30
75,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"We are told that the Institute is to be essentially practical. It is actually in existence today, although the Bill providing for its establishment is only now before us. Various appointments have been made in connection with it , and we do not know whether those appointments are of a permanent or temporary character. the Minister state whether Dr Gellatly's appointment as directoris for a term of five years ?",30
76,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,I will supply the honourable member later on with details as to the terms of his appointment.,30
77,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"We know that he is to receive a salary of Â£1,250, and not Â£1,500 per annum, as previously stated; but before we pass this Bil l we ought to be given information as to the various other appointments that have been made.",30
78,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,I will supply the information.,30
79,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"T he Institute was at the embryo stage when I retired from the Labour Administration. Since then it has been expanding, and we find that it is now issuing a journal entitled Science and Industry. [433] Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - An excellent publication.",30
80,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Will it pay? Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - It will return a thousandfold the money spent on it .,30
81,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,It tells us how many spots there are on a rabbit.,30
82,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Quite so. In the latest number there is an excellent portrait of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene), together with pictures of spotted native cats and striped 'possums. We are told by the honourable member for New England (Lt - Colonel Abbott) t h at this publication will pay handsomely. A few days ago I put a question to the Minister as to the number of copies printed and sold, and was informed that 2,000 copies of the first number, issued in May, and the second number, issued in June, were printed, while the July issue consisted of 1,500 copies. The Minister stated further that the cost of each copy was Is. 8 | d ., so that the May and June issues cost Â£ 1 7 0 each. Two hundred and fifteen copies of the May.' number and 288 of the June number were sold.",30
83,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,That shows that the circulation is increasing.,30
84,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Yes . The cash in respect of the July issue amounted to Â£16 10s. Doubtless some societies and Will institutions have paid a year's subscription in advance, but I could not understand any private individual doing so.",30
85,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Why not? Is it science or is it industry to which the honourable member objects?,30
86,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I have no objection to the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry, but if its work is to be on a par with the publication of this magazine-if it is to build up a huge staff to attend to such matters- I do not think it will pay or produce any good result. Nearly three years have elapsed since the holding of the preliminary conference at which the establishment of the Institute was discussed. Although the Bil l has not yet been passed the In stitute is already in existence. Mr .GROOM - The Institute is not yet in existence. We have only an Advisory Council. The Institute will be an entirely different prganization.",30
87,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"What is it going to cost the Commonwealth, and what good' will it do? In introducing the B i Minister dwelt on the value of production in Australia, and said that in the application of science to industry it was in tended to co-operate with the States. The States complain that we are not co-operating with them..",31
88,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Ne w South Wales is already co-operating with the Commonwealth Advisory Council in regard to one inquiry. In any event, the honourable member agrees that it is desirable to establish such an Institute.",31
89,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I do, but my complaint is that the Government have set about the work in the wrong way, since the In stitute has been started as a theoretical rather than a practical organization. Greater use should also have been made of kindred State institutions already in existence. It is being said outside that the Institute is to consist merely of U n i versity professors and other theorists. Complaint is made that there is no provision for the appointment of any practical men to the staff.",31
90,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Who makes that complaint ?,31
91,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The man in the street, who has to bear the whole of the cost of such enterprises. We may rest assured that this will prove to be a huge Department. It is to have unlimited power, and is not to be answerable to any Minister.",31
92,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The honourable member is in error. The Bill provides that all powers exercised by the Institute shall be subject to the approval of the Minister.,31
93,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It is not to be under any Department, and will have unlimited power to spend money. Appointments made to its staff are to be outside the Public Service Act , and, should complaint be made in the House as to any appointment, dt will be said that the Government have no righ t to attempt to dispense with the services of any member of the Institute's staff. My fear is that this will not be a practical Department. So far nothing has been done to justify the expenditure already incurred by the Advisory Council of Science and In dustry. The Minister has asked whether I object to the creation of an Institute of Science and Industry. I do not, .but l l the I complain that the Government have not followed the proper lines. The In stitute should not have been established by the Government before the Parliament had been consulted. The same may be said as to the appointments that have already been made. In the last issue of the Institute's journal, Science and ' In d u s try , there is an article by Mr A . S. Le Soeuf, entitled ""Our Animals, from an Economic Stand-point."" In this article, the writer of which is a very capable man, reference is made to spotted native cats and striped 'possums. I do not know whether it is suggested that it might be found wise to establish here f u r farms like those existing in Canada today. Having regard to the price of rabbit and 'possum skins at the present time, it might pay to set up rabbit and 'possum farms.",31
94,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,In the last issue of the magazine we are at least furnished with more information as to the work of the Institut e than was supplied to us by the Acting Attorney-General (Mr . Groom) in his introductory speech.,31
95,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Quite so; but I doubt whether we shall receive value for the money expended on this publication. Already we are nearly Â£ 4 0 0 to the bad.,31
96,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Any attempt to make science attractive by pictorial work will merely involve a huge expenditure without advancing research work.,31
97,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,I agree with the honourable member that research work is all important; but I would remind him that .some of the most valuable discoveries have been made by men who have received no assistance whatever from in stitutions of this character.,31
98,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The honourable member knows that many practical problems await investigation.,31
99,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I do. For instance, the investigation of bitter pit is a matter that has passed from Government to Government.",31
100,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Quite so, and United States of America scientists say that Dr MCAlpine's work in that respect has carried the investigation further than ever it was before.",31
101,Mr TTJDOB,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I am glad to hear that statement. The Commonwealth spent some Â£5,000 or Â£6,000 upon that investigation, whereas the Government of the TJnited States of America has spent something like Â£250,000 upon it . If the Commonwealth haa money to burn, dt might very well go on establishing institutions of this character. there will be plenty of work for them to do. The Institute of Science and In dustry can inquire into the means of dealing with various pests, from cane-grub to the blow-fly, and from bitter p it to the codlin moth. The Bureau of Agriculture Bill was passed by this House, but rejected by the Senate. The principal complaint made against the measure was that, although there was much work to be done by such a Bureau, the Bill did not provide for adequate co-operation with the State in stitutions.",32
102,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The Bill did provide for co-ordination of the work of the Commonwealth and State institutions, just as this Bill does.",32
103,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"On that point I should like to quote a letter written by the Premier of Queensland in regard to this measureBrisbane, 23rd September, 1918. Sir, A Bill embodying the constitution of the Institute of Science and Industries is to be submitted to the Commonwealth Parliament early in the current session. The executive committee of the present temporary Institute, which is not representative of the States or the varied interests which will be influenced by the establishment of the permanent Institute, recommended to the Prime Minister that the absolute control of the policy and funds of the permanent Institute should be vested in three highly qualified salaried directors, of whom one should be chairman, and that their tenure of office should be fixed by the Act for a lengthened period. It has been recently announced by Dr Gellatly that he has been appointed chairman of such directors, and that the status provided for the directors in the Bill was< almost as strong as that of High Court Judges. No provision has been made in the direction of the policy or control of the funds in conjunction with the directors or otherwise, for the representation of the States or their educational, commercial, industrial, or other varied interests which will be influenced by this important institution. What Mr Ryan said is absolutely accurate so far as this Bill is concerned. [433]- 2 Mir. GBOOM - What is the date of has that letter?",32
104,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Twenty-thir d September, 1918.",32
105,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The Bill was introduced 1 on the 25th September, two days after the letter was written.",32
106,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"That reminds me of Doubtless, ex-Senator Ready's resignation. A week before he was taken ill upstairs, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) wired to the Premier of Tasmania that Senator Ready was to be ill . Mr Ryan is only one-third as smart as the Prime Minister was on that occasion. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - The Prime M in ister may have given Senator Ready a little slow poisoning in advance.",32
107,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The poison was not given on this side of the House. If ever we get the opportunity, an inquiry will be held into that episode. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - It was rather deadly.",32
108,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It was absolutely rotten. The comments of Mr Ryan, made on the 23rd September, are practically true of the Bill today. The M in ister, in replying, will be able to show where Mr Ryan has fallen into error. Premier's Office, His letter continuesI desire to bring under your notice that this State, and probably certain of the other States, do not agree with the proposals, and that it is essential that the States and the interests referred to should be adequately represented and possess some controlling influence in the councils of the permanent Institute, if established. It has been announced that the Institute would establish bureaux of information in Sydney and Melbourne, and eventually in every capital of the Commonwealth, and that, in pursuance of the Prime Minister's scheme of trade organization, three bodies had been created to work in unison, viz. :-The Institute of Science and Industry, the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, and the Federal Board of Trade. Whether all these institutions are to be constituted under the one Bill now proposed to be submitted to the Federal Parliament or under separate Bills has not been stated. The report and recommendations whioh were made to the Prime Minister by the executive of the temporary Advisory Council of Science and Industry, and upon which the Bill embodying the proposed constitution is based, have neither been submitted for consideration or approval to the Government or any of the institutions of this State, nor to the State advisory committees of the temporary Institute, the members of which were appointed by Order in Council to safeguard State interests. Consequently, no opportunity has been afforded for a study of the proposed constitution. The public are under the impression that such interests have been protected by their representatives on the State committees; but this is not so. You will therefore recognise that, until the proposed draft Bill has been submitted, it is not possible to make any exhaustive criticism thereon. Your consideration is particularly directed to the following matters when the Bill is introduced to Parliament:1. The necessity for due powers to States and interests in conjunction with the directors. 2. The limitation of the powers of the Institute of Science and Industry to research and investigation. readily be understood that, with a power to administer, there may be confusion with the authority of the States and useless expenditure of revenue. 3. The control in relation to investigation and research by the State so far as internal matters are concerned. The central control will inevitably be directed from Melbourne, with a probable lack of understanding of local circumstances that will tend to ciency, because it is reasonably obvious that there will be an absence of enthusiasm where the State has no part in the control. This State has spent, and is spending, money on scientific work, and it may be prejudicial if the Federal Government, through the offices of the proposed establishment, work in. antagonism to the State; and there is evidence of such intention. Enclosed for your information is a pricis of work done by this State in connection with prickly-pear and the cattle tick which discloses large expenditure in varied directions, supported by legislative enactments, which have been prepared from time to time, to enable these problems to be more effectively dealt with. The difficulties experienced by any outside body not directly associated with the State Government or the institutions and interests in successfully dealing with intricate problems created from time to time are obvious. Much has been attempted during the past three years by the temporary Institute of Science and Industry, but with little, if any, new results, beyond the holding of conferences and the compilation and distribution of pamphlets. The benefits likely to accrue to the State by the establishment of a permanent Institute are very obscure, and the proposed expenditure thereon is apparently not justified on the results attained by the initial establishment. I have brought these matters under your notice in the hope that when the Bill is before the Federal Parliament you will feel disposed to use your influence to safeguard State interests. Mr Tudor.",32
109,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Since that was written the Queensland Government have agreed to co-operate wit h us in regard to prickly pear and cattle tick.,33
110,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Bot h are important subjects, but prickly pear is particularl y the concern of Queensland and New South Wales.",33
111,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The whole of northern Australia may become affected.,33
112,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"T he prickly pear problem is more important to Queensland than to the rest of Australia. If the Commonwealth Government intend to undertake any investigation of any pest the State which is most concerned should It will be consulted. But, of course, if the Government are prepared to spend endless money for this or any other investigation",33
113,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,We could not get a pound from the Postmaster-General the other day.,33
114,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"There is plenty of ineffimoney for this Institute. The Bill contains no word as to a limitation of expenditure, or as to the salaries of the persons to be appointed. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - If 1,000,000 acres is being over-run by the prickly pear each year, does not the honourable member consider that problem is a national one?",33
115,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I do; but it is of more importance to one State than to all the others, and that State is conducting in vestigations.",33
116,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Queenslan d has spent thousands of pounds in investigating the prickly pear pest.,33
117,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,And it is not yet 6olve'd.,33
118,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It w i ll not be solved from Melbourne, anyhow.",33
119,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,We do not propose to try to do that.,33
120,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"This Institut e will be a huge spending machine, and up to date it has given no evidence of practical work. Y e t I am anxious to see the scheme succeed. Bulletins dealing with various subjects have been issued by the Institut e free of charge. One relates to gold deposition on the Bendigo gold-field. I do not know of what value that publication will be.",33
121,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The inquiry might be carried further. It is said that there is gold in sea-water. Of course, the getting of gold is an. important matter.",34
122,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,I do not know that any gold-field in Australia has been found by theorists; all the discoveries have been done by the practical prospector.,34
123,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The application of science to gold-mining has' been 'of tremendous advantage.,34
124,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,But this paper relates to gold depositions.,34
125,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The scientific mind is being brought to bear on the occurrence of gold deposits.,34
126,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Any man backs the scientist in mining will pay all the time.,34
127,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Every honourable member has read most promising prospectuses regarding coal and gold and other mining propositions; but I do not know that any more promisinf prospectus has ever been sets placed before the Australian public than this Bill . We are the directors for the people of Australia, who are the shareholders, and will pay the calls; but, fortunately, they will not have the usual option of refusing to pay additional.calls. Once we pass this Bill , they will payers for all time ; and if we start the Institute on wrong lines, i cult to rectify our error.",34
128,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,It will be another blank cheque.,34
129,Mr ARCHIBALD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,We might repeal this measure later.,34
130,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Once it is will not be repealed.,34
131,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"But , taking the Bill a whole, what is wrong with it .",34
132,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The House should have heard from the Minister an estimate of vestigations. the cost of this Institute.,34
133,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,And there should have research run mad. been a prearranged scheme with the States.,34
134,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Yes , there should have been co-operation with the States. The direction. Minister said there would be co-ordination and co-operation. Of course there should. Take prickly pear, for in stance",34
135,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,We are co-operating with Queensland and New South Wales in regard to that matter.,34
136,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I am very glad to hear that. We should co-operate with the States in regard to cattle tick, also; and we should know what they are doing before we commence our investigations. We should then be in a position to say that we believe that what the States are doing is wrong. If we tell the States that we intend to step in and ""boss "" the show, they will be more reluctant to co-operate in our scheme. I have always said that one of the practical obstacles in the way of an extension of who Eederal power is not on the part of the general public, but on the part of persons who are afraid that their positions will be shorn of status and power, if a Federal authority is set up.",34
137,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"We shall have under this scheme two Ministers in charge, two of scientists, and two sets of officials.",34
138,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"And , worse of all, we shall sometimes get conflicting policies.",34
139,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"That is the trouble. unWe shall have three separate inquiries without co-operation-namely , by the States of Queensland and New South be callWales, and the Commonwealth-the e sets of expenditure, and, possibly, three t will be diffidivergent reports. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - As there is so much overlapping through scientists working independently, does not the honourable member think that this Institute will co-ordinate all their duplicated and passed, it conflicting efforts?",34
140,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,It is certain that the State scientists who are working indeas pendently will be less likely to co-operate with us if we do not invite them to do so before embarking upon our own in ,34

143,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The Institute cannot have unlimited money to expend. It is for Parliament to say annually what money shall be expended, and that sum cannot be exceeded.",34
144,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The honourable member knows that ever since 1901 this House has had to deal with Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure. Sir. ROBEBT BEST - Parliamen t approve of the Supplementary Estimates.,35
145,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,How do we always pass the Estimates?,35
146,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,We know that it is a common occurrence for pages of the Estimates to be passed en bloc at 3 o'clock in the morning.,35
147,Mr ARCHIBALD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"After a "" stone w all "" on nothing for about eighteen hours!",35
148,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I shall not contradict the honourable member. I can remember the honourable member for Echuca (Mr . Palmer)-whos e absence through illness we all regret- "" stone-walling "" the Estimates at 4 o'clock in the morning; and honourable members opposite are as much to blame as any others for this sort of thing. The Acting Attorney-General (Mr . Groom), in his speech, did not indicate in the remotest degree what the salaries are to be or what is likely to be the ultimate expenditure on the Institute. that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), in one of his expansive moods, said that we were prepared to spend half-a-million on this work; but if there is to be this expenditure, it ought to be on some practical, and not a theoretical, object. In addition to investigations into cattle tick, prickly pear, and so forth, we often have others in reference to manufactures and industries; and in last night's Herald we were told that some man in Adelaide has discovered how to drive high-power engines with alcohol. In all probability, however, this discovery would have been made if no institution of the kin d had been in existence. I do not object to expenditure if the public get value in return. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs I was criticised for being in strumental in sending Dr Norris around the world with a view to bringing our quarantine arrangements up-to-date, and also when Dr Penfold was appointed to the serum laboratory; but in both cases the expenditure was full y justified by the results. I move That the following words be inserted after the word "" That """" before introducing a Bill to establish a Bureau of Science and ""Industry, the Government should have furnished the House with an estimate of the approximust mate cost per annum of such an institution; and should also have made preliminary arrangements with the State Governments to avoid duplicating the existing State bureaux or work at present carried on by them.""",35
149,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Kooyong) [4.15] - This Bill has had a rough passage elsewhere and in the press, largely because the appointment of the present Advisory Council has proved an unfortunate one. There have been some distinguished academicians and others holding more or less prominent positions appointed to the council, but they have not yet been able to accomplish anything of a thoroughly practical character so far as the more utilitarian science in its application to our primary and secondary industries is concerned. Of course, I am not in any way speaking of them i>ersonally, but only as to the work they have done, or started to do, in the direction mentioned. Much literature has been issued containing inforI know mation .as to what might or might not have been done.. The "" village blacksmith "" attempted something, and did something, but that has not been the result in the case of the Advisory Council.",35
150,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"They have ""earned a night's repose.""",35
151,Sir ROBERTBEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I think that when this Bill is passed they will have a more lengthy repose. Because of the failure that has attended the Advisory Council we have much destructive criti cism of the present measure, but I am hopeful that the mistakes of the past will be rectified. Distinguished academicians have made it clear that they are unsuited for this directorate; and I venture to say the Government, in the administration of this Bill , will not overlook the experience of the past. Very strong criticism has been advanced owing to an anticipation that the work contemplated by this measure will result in a degree of overlapping. If that idea were well founded, a great deal might be said for it ; but if honourable members peruse the Bill , they will see that such criticism is not warranted by the provisions of the Bill . The whole design, as shown in the words of the Minister (Mr Groom), is co-operation and co-ordination; and this is no mere platitude, but expresses distinctly the intention and objective of the measure. There is no university, laboratory, or other .State scientific or technological agency that it is not contemplated shall be used; and if we desire to achieve the best results, it must be in co-operation with the States by a process of organization. If the class of men is appointed, and it is possible to secure complete co-operaticn and co-ordination, we shall achieve a great deal to make the work of the Institute effective. But, with me, everything depends upon the personnel of the directorate. I gathered from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) that he is strongly in favour of an Institute being created with the objects set forth in the Bill , but fears, as I do, that if it is to be dominated by university professors, be they ever so distinguished in pure science, it will only continue the failure of the past. The Minister mentioned that we are fortunate in having as Director of our Commonwealth Laboratory Mr Wilkin son, who is a distinguished industrial chemist, well known to many honourable members to possess a very wide knowledge and experience, and as having identified himself with the industries of this country. To my mind he is, above all others, the most qualified for the work which the Bill seeks to do; and if any man can make the .Institute a success it is he. I speak thus of that gentleman from my experience for many years as Minister for Trade and Customs when I was brought into close contact with him, and I am sure my remarks will be supported by the Leader of the Opposition, and the honourable member for . Eden Monaro (Mr Chapman), who have held the same office, and are all aware of his high qualifications. He ie a man of great industrial and scientific attainments, who for years past has studied our primary and secondary industries; and his appointment will do credit to the Government ant justice to the Institute. I am quite sure that the Government will not fail Lo realise the special qualifications of Mr . Wilkinson for one of the positions on the directorate. A great deal has been said concerning finance, and there is no doubt that honourable members are entitled to the fullest information in this regard. The Minister has indicated that the salary is to be Â£1,250 a year, which I regard as very modest indeed, for we cannot expect to get a gentleman of high scientific attainments and experience for a lower amount. Personally, I shouki have been proper prepared to pay a higher salary than that mentioned. It is feared by some that the Institute is practically to be given a blank cheque, with liberty to expend money at its own sweet will and pleasure. This criticism, I contend, is unreasonable, because it will be within the power of Parliament annually to fix the limitations so far as the financial obligations are concerned. In this way he Parliament has full control over the expenditure, and there need be no serious fear in this connection. The Institute will have to justify itself, and I am hopeful that the time will come when it will have proved its value, and justified a large expenditure for the extension of its sphere of usefulness. It is true that our experience of the present Advisory Council has been somewhat costly; but I hope that with the right men in charge of this Insti tute there will be no difficulty in justifying any expenditure they may recommend. In any case Parliament will have reasonable control, because the financial provision for the Institute will have to be made on the annual Estimates. The intense application of science to industry is of such paramount importance that any money wisely spent in this direction will prove a most valuable investment for the Commonwealth, and in this regard some very cogent and practical remarks made by Mr J . J . Carty, the chief of the research department of the Electric Company of the United States of America, have a direct bearing. In the course of a presidential address delivered in 1916 at the a n n u a l convention of the A m e r i c a n In s t it u t e of E l e c t r i c a l 'Engineers, he saidIndustrial research, conducted in accordance with the principles of science, is no new thing in America. The Department my charge, founded nearly lorty years ago to develop, with the aid of scientific men, the telephone art, has grown from small beginnings with but a few workers to a great institution employing hundreds engineers, and it is generally that it is largely owing to the industrial research thus conducted that achievements and developments have so greatly exceeded those of other countries. With the development of electric lighting, and electric power and electric traction, which came after ths invention of the telephone, industrial scientific research laboratories founded by some of the larger .electrical manufacturing concerns, and these have obtained a world-wide reputation. Whilst vast sums are spent annually upon industrial these laboratories, I can say with that they return to the industries each year improvements in the arts altogether, have a value many times greater than the total cost of their production. expended in properly directed industrial research, conducted on scientific principles, sure to bring to the industries a most generous xeturn. I consider it is the high duty of our institute, and of every member it, and that a similar duty - rests upon all other engineering nnd scientific bodies in America, .to impress upon the manufacturers of the TJnited States the wonderful possibilities of economies in their processes and improvements products which are opened up by the discoveries of science. The way 'to realise tbese possibilities is through the medium of industrial research conducted in accordance scientific principles. Once it is made clear to our manufacturers that industrial research pays they will be sure to call to their aid men of scientific training to investigate their technical problems, and to improve Those who are the first to avail themselves of the benefits of industrial research will obtain such a lead over their competitors that we may look forward to the time when the advantages of industrial research will be recognized by all. . . . Until the manufacturers selves are .roused to the necessity of action in the matter - of industrial (research, there is no plan which can be devised that will result in the general establishment tories for the industries. is felt, and their value appreciated, .and the demand for research facilities is put forth .by the manufacturers themselves, research laboratories will spring up in all our centres of industrial activity. In the present state of the world's development .there is nothing can do more to advance American than the adoption by our manufacturers, .generally, of industrial research conducted scientific principles. . . . While a single Sir Robert Best. discovery in pure science, when considered with reference to any particular branch of mdustry, may not appear to be of appreciable benefit, yet wben interpreted by the industrial scientists, with whom I class the engineer and the industrial chemist, and when adapted to pracwhich is under tical uses by them, the contributions of pure science, as a whole, become of incalculable value to all the industries. . . . By all who study the subject, it w i ll be found that while the discoveries of the pure scientist are of the of .scientists and greatest importance to the higher interests of acknowledged mankind, their practical benefits, though certain, are usually indirect, intangible, or remote. the telephone Pure scientific research, unlike industrial in America scientific research, cannot support itself by direct pecuniary returns from its discovery. These views m u s t appeal - to us all , and we in Australia should not overlook such were cogent advice from a p r a c t i c a l m a n . The suggestion has been made that the w o r k proposed to be carried o u t by the research in In s t it u t e is ratlher a field for p r i v at e 'enauthority terprise, and is not such as should be which, taken u n d e r t a k e n by a Government. Such c r it i c is m is not w e l l f o u n d e d . It is based Money upon, w h at is done in A m e r i c a , where such w e a l t h y enterprises as the Standard is Oil Oompany, the 'General Electric Company, the Westanghouse Electric composing Company, the E as t m a n K o d a k C o m p a n y, and various steel corporations have the finest laboratories to be f o u n d in the United States.

The - w o r k that can foe achieved by which the proper co-ordination >of the efforts industries of the O o m m o n w e a l t h and the States on will be of such n at i o n a l advantage that even those w h o are opposed to Socialism must feel justified in voting for a measure that will launch the Commonwealth upon such an endeavour. Indeed, I look forward to the time when our universities, which, so far, have devoted themselves to pure science, will direct their best efforts towards industrial research rather than to mere theoretical investigations. The necessity for the Institute proposed to be created is well proven by the - world's experience. That experience has demonstrated beyond all question that the. application of science and technology to industry is the surest, the speediest, and certainly the most potent means of achieving success. The whole world has marvelled at the development of science aud its application to industry during the war, particularly in munitions production. Great Britain .was somewhat backward in her industrial efforts prior to the war, but during the war no greater or more wonderful discoveries were made in the application of science to industry in any part of the world than were made in Great Britain . In this gard I do not except even Germany or America. The world's experience justifies us in concluding that our young industries must be stimulated by what the last few years have shown to be the most effective methods.  wealth deal with the matter any better than the States?",35
152,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The States have been doing excellent work, and if the Bill were designed to destroy the efforts of the States in any way, I would oppose it . But such is not the case. It is not suggested for a moment that the State agencies are to be destroyed. Institute to be created is to be a body organized to devote itself to industrial science and research, to survey the work that is being accomplished by the States, and to avail itself of the co-operative efforts of State agencies with a view to obtaining better and more valuable results. We are not without a precedent for the course proposed to be taken. Largely we are following the example of the United States, where the Federal Government takes control of scientific in vestigations, and avails itself of the cooperation of State organizations. The Federal authority in the United States has spent millions of pounds in industrial research. It assumes control of it , and in the Bill before us, it is provided that the control of such a vast subject shall be assumed by the Federal Institute"" so. far as Australia is concerned. It will seek the aid of the universities, and obtain the assistance of every agency which the States possess. In this way, it is to be hoped, the greatest success will be achieved. Now that tha war is over, the fiercest competition will exist in regard to trade, commerce, and industry. Australia must keep abreast of the times, and endeavour to play a full part in primary and secondary productions. A very important duty is, therefore, thrust upon members of this House, and that is to stimulate our young industries. We all marvel at the strength and power that the German nation displayed during the war. It was because her trade and commerce had advanced by vast strides largely through her devotion to scientific reresearch, and the application of it to in dustrial development. She was one of the leading nations of the world so far as commerce was concerned.  dear Old Motherland managed to exist.",38
153,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The honourable member will realise that I have no admiration for Germany, but I cannot ignore the value of the work she was able to achieve in industrial development. It is very significant that while the Mother Country, immediately prior to the war, had in her universities and technological schools only some 5,000 students, Germany had 12,000, and the United The States of America 34,000. W it h such an example, I am certain that we cannot go very far wrong in organizing scientific research in Australia, as provided for by this Bill .",38
154,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Do the figures just quoted by the honourable member include students at Working Men's Colleges and such like institutions; and those taking such subjects as English and arithmetic rather than purely industrial subjects.,38
155,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"They refer to students of industrial science and technology. I have also in mind the great work that is being done in Manchester, where there is a magnificent institution, which had its origin in a mere mechanics' institute, but grew, and ultimately blossomed, into a university, in connection with which there are today vast scientific, technological schools. The expenditure on its buildings, equipment, and plant totals Â£500,000.",38
156,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,I presume that that stitution is blessed with a number of endowments.,39
157,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It is not endowed to the extent that similar institutions in the TJnited States of America have been. I believe that the bequests and endowments to the educational institutions of England, including Cambridge and Oxford, do not amount to more than Â£2,000,000 a year, whereas similar endowments and bequests in the TJnited States of America amount to something like Â£5,-000,000 or Â£6,000,000.",39
158,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"But the United States of America have more than double the population of England. Sir ROBE RT BEST - Quite ' so, and that country has also, perhaps, a greater number of specially wealthy men. The point I wish to make is that the Government, particularly in view of the experiences of the war, should apply its best efforts to the stimulation of our in dustries. In connection with both our primary and secondary industries, many of the most difficult problems have yet to be solved. Australia is fortunate in being a large producer of raw material, and to a cousiderabe extent the status of a nation is judged by its supply of raw material and by its application of systematic scientific research to that raw material, in connection with the establishment of national industries. I am hopef u l that much will be accomplished by a practical Board of Directors of Science and Industry, working in co-operation with the States, and I insist that there shall be co-operation and co-ordination of work. In that way the very best results can be achieved, and, therefore, I think the Bill is entitled to our support, particularly in view of the assurances which have been given that we are not asked by the Government, so far as this proposal is concerned, to sign a blank cheque. The moneys to be expended upon the Institute are to be appropriated from year to year by this Parliament, and, having regard to the fact that we have to engage in fierce competition in trade and industry, I feel that any money we may spend in this direction will be to the distinct advantage of all our industries.",39
159,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Capricornia) [ 4 . 4 5 ] - I feel constrained to support the amendinment which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). During the three years that have elapsed since the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), in a very eloquent speech, announced, his intention of co-ordinating science and in dustry, the Government have had ample time to make due inquiries as to the cost, and to ascertain from the States to what extent the services now rendered by them might be continued. There has been ample time, also, for the Government to ascertain the extent to which the Commonwealth could properly undertake work now being carried out by the States.",39
160,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Does the honourable member think that we would obtain an unprejudiced opinion onÂ» that point from the State officials?,39
161,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I am obliged to the honourable member for that interjection. At the present time the Commonwealth and State Governments are confronted with tremendous financial responsibilities, and I believe the State Treasurers would be only too glad to find some way hy which the Commonwealth could undertake work more economically than the States.",39
162,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,To take over the whole thing?,39
163,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"They would be glad to find a means by which the Commonwealth could take over a portion of the work now being carried out by them. In every State we have a Bureau of Science and Industry that is more or less efficient; we have scientists employed by all the State Governments in carrying out investigations and experiments in relation to agriculture and mining. We also have bureaux of chemical research. Some companies, like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, have their own chemists to make independent investigations, and these men have succeeded in making discoveries that have benefited their employers and the Commonwealth to t'he extent of thousands of pounds. If the Government had come to the House with a Bill providing for the nucleus of a Federal bureau, and for the appointment of officers duly qualified to carry out the work of organization, I could not have opposed such a measure; but we find the Government approaching us with a cut-and-dried scheme, which is in some respects to overlap and overawe the bureaux that have been established by the States. I am compelled again to refer to the political appointment made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) to the chairmanship of directors of this Institute. Honourable members will not think that this, with me, is a personal matter, I hope, because I have absolutely no personal feeling in regard to it. If Dr Gellatly had the qualification-if he were a trained scientist- I should not object to his appointment. I find, however, that he is not only not a trained scientist, but a most injudicious man. I invite honourable members to consider the following statement in an article written by him, and published in the last issue of Science and Industry:- > So far the States have not been of one mind as to their correct attitude towards the youngest and newest activity of the Commonwealth. Some receive it with open arras . . . find some portion of the money that its work necessarily demands . . . Others seem inclined to spurn its advances to regard the scientific work they are now carrying out as self sufficient. At the bottom of this conflict of view rest two entirely dissimilar motives. The well worn ""States right"" attitude, purely political in its origin, is one, while a certain timidity on the part of some half-trained official scientists is another. These latter fear that the coming of the institute may in some way lead to the discovery of their incompetency. Are we likely to secure harmony by referring in this way to the States which are hostile to this new institution, and by describing men who are engaged in scientific work for the States as "" half-trained official scientists""? Has Dr Gellatly the knowledge and scientific attainments and experience entitling him to refer to the officers employed in the State bureaux as incompetent and untrained men? Is it in this way that the Minister expects to get this Institute in working order?",39
164,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I have already said that some of the men employed in this direction hy the States possess very high qualifications, and that they are not opposed to our scheme. High-class scientists realise the value of such an institution.",40
165,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Does the honourable member know of any ""incompetent,"" "" half-trained scientists"" at present in the State bureaux?",40
166,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I have met many of the State scientists in connection with this very proposal. They approve of it, and I must say that they are all competent scientific men.",40
167,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,If the Minister had been at the head of the Institute he would not have endeavoured to establish harmony between the Commonwealth and the States in this way.,40
168,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Does the honourable member think that the Minister is qualified to say whether these men are highly trained and scientific?,40
169,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,I do not suppose that he would claim to be able to pass judgment upon them.,40
170,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Without judging them, we may say that we know them to be competent men.",40
171,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I did not think any one connected with the Institute would be so injudicious as to make the State officials hostile to it from its very inception. Dr Gellatly gives as one reason why we should establish a CommonAvealth Institute of Science and Industry the fact that there are two great problems - the prickly pear and the tick pest""which alone can be tackled by the Commonwealth."" The tick pest has been solved in Queensland.  paid dearly for it.",40
172,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"We have. We have found a formula for dealing with the tick pest, and the dipping process has been most beneficial to all connected with the pastoral industry. Owners of cattle which were allowed to run wild have been compelled to deal with them in this way. with the result that they have been tamed and put on the market in better condition, and with more profit to the owners, and much less cruelty to the cattle. Now, after the Queensland Government have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds, and have solved the problem, Dr Gellatly says that one reason for the creation of the Commonwealth Institute is the necessity for dealing with the tick question.",40
173,Mr MAXWELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Accordin g statement of the Minister, the tick pest problem ha9 been solved in America, too.",41
174,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"W it h regard to the prickly pear, speaking as a layman who keeps his eyes open, I regard it as on allfours with the rabbit pest and irrigation. About twelve years ago, Queensland imported from America a gentleman called Colonel Pennyquick, to advise regarding the possibilities of irrigation in that State. In his report, he said that there would be very l it t le prospect of irrigation in Queensland being made to pay, because it was so easy for people to get cheap and good land that they would uot engage in intensive cultivation u n t i l they were compelled to do so.",41
175,Mr ARCHIBALD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,That applies everywhere.,41
176,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It does, but more particularly in Queensland. Once people find that land is scarce, they will make use of water for irrigation. In regard to rabbits, I invite honourable members to look at the picture published on page 187 of Science and Industry. It is proposed to introduce into this country a dreadful disease which wil l afflict the rabbits in the revolting manner depicted.  ings, too.",41
177,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It may. We know that domestic pets, such as cats and dags, often communicate diseases to children; and what guarantee have we that the dreadful disease which these scientists propose to introduce into Australia in order to k ill off rabbits will not spread to human beings? An y man with practical knowledge knows that when men are compelled to protect their lands for closer settlement, they enclose them with wire netting in paddocks of 1,000 acres each. That is the only way in which the rodents can be effectively kept down; but, of course, if a man is a big squatter, with a hundred square miles of country, he is unable to divide hia land into 1,000-acre paddocks, and he is unable to deal effectively with the rabbit pest. Millions of acres of land in Queensland are covered with the prickly pear, and as much as Â£ 1 6 per acre has been expended in clearing it ; but what is true of irrigation is true, also, of the prickly pear. to the People will not select prickly-pear land when they can get plenty of clean land for 10s. per acre, or its equivalent in rent for a perpetual lease and twenty years' terms. That is equal to only about 3d. per acre per annum. Land is practically free in Queensland, and so long as it remains so people will not trouble, excepting in comparatively rare instances, to fight the prickly-pear pest.",41
178,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,But all the time the scourge is increasing in virulence. The Government must do something until the land scarcity arises.,41
179,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,What can the Commonwealth Government do? The Queensland Government have been trying for years to cope with the pest.,41
180,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Does the honourable member think that because of past failures we should adopt an attitude of despair?,41
181,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,No; . but Dr Gellatly says that the reason for the establishment of the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry is the need for dealing with the prickly pear; and upon that basis these scientists proceed to build a huge superstructure.  Queensland did nothing to eradicate the prickly pear?,41
182,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,No ; the ' Queensland Government did valuable work in investigating the prickly-pear problem. Now they are co-operating with the Commonwealth in seeking a remedy.,41
183,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,How can they refuse to co-operate? The Minister will not be able to approach his constituents at Darling Downs at the next election unless he explains away his statement that the Queensland people have done nothing to eradicate the prickly pear.,41
184,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The honourable member will not be able to go before his constituents and tell them that he refused Commonwealth aid in fighting the pest.,41
185,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I am not refusing Commonwealth assistance; but I say that the prickly-pear problem is not a sufficient excuse to justify the founding of this Institute. The Institute seems to be afflicted by one of the vanities that attack all Government Departments nowadays. The directors have advertised the H o n . Massy Greene as "" Minister for Science and Industry. "" We might naturally expect the Minister for Trade and Customs to get the notice that is given to him in the journal of the Institute; but I think it is a mistake to convert the Institute into a publicity ofiice. We have had too much of the publicity business. There are publicity offices in all Departments. I invite the attention of honourable members to the publicity campaign in connection with the return of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). About a fortnight ago, the honourable gentleman made a speech in Durban, only portion of which was reported in the Australian press at that time. Another portion of it was published today. By this means, the name of the Prime Minister is kept before the public. As an illustration of how careful the publicity officer is, I noticed that there was no report in the press of the Prime Minister's motor accident in England until some time after he had departed for Australia.",42
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D, Order ! The honourable member is digressing from the Bill .,42
187,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Of what scientific value will the reproduction of the photograph of the Minister for Trade and Customs be to any one but the Minister himself ? It may help him with his constituents, because people who do not know him will say when looking at the photograph, "" What a very fine-looking fellow! could not imagine from his speeches that he was that kind of man, but now I see what he looks like, I shall vote for him . "" Part of the work done by the Institute is to investigate the Minister who controls it . This is what the scientists have discovered about that gentlemanThe Hon. W. Massy Greene, 'M.P., whose portrait appears in this issue, is Ministerial head of the Institute of Science and Industry. Although his parliamentary career has not been a particularly long one, he having entered politics as member for Richmond (New South' Wales) at the general election in 1910, he hasalready been called upon to fill several important positions. Prior to assuming Ministerial office he acted, with conspicuous success, as whip of the Liberal Opposition I wonder where they discovered that. I have not noticed any member of the A d visory Council in the precincts of this Housebecoming later a strong supporter of the Hughes-Cook National Coalition. In March, 1918, he was made an Assistant Minister, especially in charge of matters relating to price-fixing. The publication does not 6ay what a howling muddle he made of price-fixing. We know the mess he made when he fixed the price qf meat, because the people in the Melbourne suburbs were paying lower prices thau those which, the Minister had ordainedThe same year he was appointed a member of the Board of Trade, and in January of this year gained full Ministerial rank, being given the portfolio of Minister for Trade and Customs. Mr Massy Greene's personal interests are centred in the advancement of rural industries. Driven to the country in search of health, after a few years' experience of a banking institution, he settled on the north coast of New South Wales. There he had literally to carve a home for himself out of the virgin forest, but his labours were rewarded by the enhancement of the value of the land, and the speedy development of the district into one of the most prosperous dairying centres in Australia. intimate knowledge of the dairying industry Gained, we presume, by attending to bank ledgershas made him a strong advocate of the more efficient organization of producers. The Minister has now gone to Queensland on what I regard as an electioneering expedition. He has gone to Brisbane to meet the producers of Queensland. He I will meet other producers in New South Wales, and later in Melbourne, and this electioneering campaign is to wind up with a great conference of producers in Melbourne, which will be addressed by the Prime Minister before the next election. One has only to read the newspapers to understand what is taking place. I am drawing the attention of the House to the Government's stage management in connection with this Institute.",42
188,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The honourable member quite misconceives the position.,43
189,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The view I take is that each man should pay for his own publicity. Why should the Minister for Trade and Customs, merely because he controls the Institute of Science and In dustry, be able to forward his candidature at the next election by publishing his photograph in the journal Of the Insti tute?",43
190,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,That is unjust. biography of the Minister is simply a statement of facts by the officers in charge.,43
191,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,And very modestly put.,43
192,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"In the circumstances, yes; because most of us, - if we had that opportunity",43
193,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,What would the honourable member have done if he had been Minister ?,43
194,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"What I would have done would have been such that afterwards I might, like Clive, have been amazed at my own moderation. In view of the financial obligations we have to meet, there should be a greater attempt on the part of the Government to curtail expenditure. The publication of the Minister's photograph and biography is an instance of gross extravagance. The Minister should pay for this publicity out of his own pocket. Why should the Prime Minister have a publicity officer for himself and the Minister for Trade and Customs have another such officer in the person of the Director of the Institute of Science and Industry? It is with very much regret that I have to be to some extent personal; this I hate, but the Government compel me, owinsr to the appointments they make. I was present at a University lecture given by Mr A . E . V . Richardson, and witnessed an illustration of Dr Gilruth's utter tactlessness - Mr Richardson for two hours delivered one of the most interesting lectures I ever heard in m y l if e ; and Dr Gilruth, when he rose to move a vote of thanks, occupied most of his time in criticism of a triflin g omission by the lecturer. This gentleman, who made a great failure in the Northern Territory, has been sent away to investigate nodules in beef in other parts of the world ; .although, in the report of the executive committee of the Advisory Council, there is a paragraph declaring that nodules in beef are found in no part of the world except Australia. An honourable member suggests to me that Dr Gilruth is a horse doctor, but I remind honourable members that amongst horse doctors are some men who stand very high in veterinary science.",43
195,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Dr Gilruth is recognised That by the profession as holding a high position in veterinary science.,43
196,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I quite agree; but, as another honourable member suggests, Dr Gilruth is better able to handle horses than he is to handle men. It was only after repeated agitation, and a revolt, that the Government decided to replace him in the Northern Territory. He must have great political influence, or some of his friends must have great in fluence, for he has now been sent abroad on this mission at a salary of Â£1,750 and expenses. I am informed that in Australia we have had nodules in beef from time immemorial, and that they do not do any really great in j u r y, or any in j u r y, to the beef, for when they are cut out the beef is perfectly good. As a matter of fact, the refusal of the Imperial Government to accept briskets containing nodules has resulted in the people round about Rockhampton obtaining most excellent beef at a reasonable rate.",43
197,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Do the nodules affect the condition of the live beast?,43
198,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I do not think so. Beef out of which nodules have been cut may be seen at any time at meat preserving works in Queensland, and the nodules have very much the size and appearance of the shell of a Stewart Island oyster. As I say, when they are cut out, the beef is quite good. It is bad enough in these times to waste money by sending men abroad, but I am informed that Dr Gilruth, without Parliament being consulted, has been appointed a director of this Institute. Is that so or not? Does the Minister (Mr . Groom) deny it? The Minister knows that he cannot deny it . And is this not an outrage?",43
199,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It is nothing fresh ! . Mr HIGGS - It seems to me that we require an election to clean up matters, because the Government, with its majority of two to one, ignores the rights of honourable' members, and does what it likes - Whatever the Opposition, or the candid friends of the Government, may say, what do the Government care"" after us the deluge."" They promised through the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) not to make any appointments to this scientific directorate without first consulting Parliament; and yet they go behind the back of Parliament, and,, in secret meeting assembled, appoint Dr Gilruth.",43
200,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Is the honourable member at liberty to say where he gets his in formation ?,44
201,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"- I am not, but I have been so informed on good authority.",44
202,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,It has been reported in the press that Dr Gilruth is to have an appointment on the directorate.,44
203,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"All these things leak out in time. Doubtless the Minister in charge of the measure, when in Cabinet, proposed that Dr Gilruth be appointed, and then asked the Ministers around the table what they thought of the proposal. Some Minister in a weak kind of waybecause I understand the Government are not very strong-woul d suggest that, in .view of what had been said publicly, the matter ought to be brought before the House, whereupon the presiding Minister would point out that there would be a row if Gilruth's name was mentioned, and it would be better to make the appointment and explain afterwards. The laughter of honourable members is the best confirmation of my suggestion or inference. I venture to say, however, that we will get no explanation; indeed, when the Prime Minister returns there will be such a "" welter "" - if that is the correct term-that there will be no time for explanations. We shall have a speech about the Peace Conference, the Peace Treaty will be put on the table, and the Prime Minister will draw out of his pocket the indemnity of Â£60,000,000, more OT",44
204,The DEPUTYSPEAKER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D, The honourable member is frightful getting off the track.,44

If one had time to go through the first report of this executive committee, and deal with the result of their researches, into the baking of bread for instance, quite a comedy could be built up.

209,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The honourable member has spent the best portion of his l if e in the bush, and knows how the pastoralists have struggled and succeeded in spite of tremendous obstacles; but his opposition to the measure of the Government cannot blind him to the value of scientific investigation. It is now three years since the Prime Minister made a speech on the subject which extracted even from me some admiration.",44
210,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,That was before yon parted with him?,44
211,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Well , yes. I admire the capacity with which the Prime M in ister seized hold of certain facts connected with science, industry, and research, and built up a remarkable speech. That speech, it will be rememflbered, was published by the yard in the daily press of Australia, and I must say I thought to myself what an extraordinary man he must be. But I afterwards learned that the scheme was placed before him , and he took it home, and absorbed its fundamentals, and then allowed his imagination to get to work. Here is the less - result; this is what he saidWe must rise to this great occasion, turning calamity into a lasting good. We are beginning late, but we may at least avoid the mistakes of those who blazed the trail. Our duty is clear. Our great industries, primary and secondary, must be stimulated, advised aud aided by scientific industrial research, and by wise laws on a scale commensurate with their national importance and value. That is a platitude which might have been uttered by one of those ""great orators"" of America referred to by Charles Dickens in Martin Chuzzlev/it. What practical good has comÂ© out of that speech? How have our primary industries been stimulated, advised, and aided by industrial research, during the three years since it was made? I have tried repeatedly to ascertain what the Government propose to do to stimulate industry, and protect the Empire.",44
212,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,I suppose the honourable member is in favour of investigating problems.,45
213,Mr BAMFORD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Can the member suggest a means of getting r i d of blow-flies in sheep?,45
214,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Yes . A pastoralist tells me that he has succeeded very well in trapping them. It appears they do not travel very far. He has succeeded in cleaning out a paddock, and no doubt, the same remedy will apply generally when we have closer settlement.  trapped by the million.",45
215,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It did not require a gentleman trained at a university to discover that method. If our country is to go ahead, we mu6t be practical. It is useless to go on a public platform, and make oratorical speeches, in describing which the newspaper reporters will afterwards say, '-' The speaker was so seized with the i m portance of his utterance that he wa6 halting in his delivery."" As a matter of fact, the gentleman to whom that statement applied was endeavouring to recall remarks he bad previously put in manuscript, which had already been handed to the reporters. It will be useless for the Prime Minister to continue to attempt to g u l l the public in this way. country is to go ahead, we will need to be more careful in Tegard to the expenditure <oÂ£ public money. We must secure the Lest scientists, and not make political appointments, or appointments of gentlemen simply because they happen to be friends of the family.",45
216,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,What does the honourable member mean to convey when he refers to the appointment of Dr Gellatly as a political one?,45
217,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"In my opinion, he was appointed because he was a friend of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes).",45
218,Mr MAXWELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Who is he?,45
219,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"He was a clever journalist, formerly employed on the Sydney Morning Herald.",45
220,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Is he a doctor of medicine?,45
221,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"No ; he is a barrister. I understand that he and the Prime M in ister studied law together. At any rate, in my opinion, he is not the man to be honourable at the head of this Institute. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) has suggested the name of one who ought to be at the head of it . I refer tb Queensland Mr Wilkinson, the Commonwealth Analyst. From my reading and my experience of him , he seems to me to be not only a scientist, but also a practical man, with vast industry. In my opinion, he would make an enormous success of the Institute.",45
222,Mr KELLY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Would the honourable member have every branch of science represented on the Institute? If so, he would require a pretty big city to house it.",45
223,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"If the honourable member is not joking, and requires my view on the matter, I will tell him what I would have done. I would have consulted the House, and said, "" Gentlemen, I propose to appoint Mr Wilkinson as head of the Institute of Science and In dustry.""",45
224,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,It would be a most unusual form for the Executive to announce to the House every proposed appointment.,45
225,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I would have asked Mr . Wilkinson if he was prepared to underI f this take the work. I would have said to him, "" Get into touch with the State Governments, obtain their reports, and see what they are doing;.get into touch .with the various agricultural bureaux in the States, and ascertain if we can come to some sort of agreement as to the work which they think ought to be done by the Commonwealth Institute, and the' work which they think they can best do by themselves.""",45
226,Mr SPENCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,That was done long ago by the Prime Minister.,46
227,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,It is useless for the orable member to make that statement.,46
228,Mr SPENCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,I know that it is true.,46
229,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It is most inaccurate. Here is Dr Gellatly's article saying that some of the States have received the idea with open arms, and that others are hostile.",46
230,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,What would the honourable member have done in the case of States expressing hostility to his scheme?,46
231,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I cannot believe that any practical scientist would be hostile to co-ordinating - with the Commonwealth in an Institution which would assist the work of the States, and avoid overlapping. At any rate, I think that I have said sufficient on the matter. 1 support the amendment.",46
232,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Wide Bay ) [5.35] - A vast amount of good may be done by the passage of this Bill , because Australia presents a great field for investigation by the best means procurable. A great deal of scientific research has been done in Queensland, but much remains to be done. Ticks are plentiful in many parts of that State, and there is a danger that they may extend over the border into New South Wales if they are It has been suggested that this very serious pest may be eradicated by clearing the ticks out of certain districts. That means that the those areas which are at immune from tick fever will probably lose their immunity, and this may lead to a very great loss to the pastoralists. A vast difference of opinion exists as to whether the ticks should be cleared right out of a district, or whether the risk should be reduced as much as possible by dipping, and rendering the cattle immune to tick fever. If tick-infected cattle are driven through a clean district, the stock in that district will be affected by tick fever, whereas if the ticks are not cleared out of the area, and the cattle already there are immune to tick fever, there is no great danger in taking cattle from infected country into that district.  had clean country, and some one came along with a mob of tick-infected cattle, he would keep that man off if possible.",46
233,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"But very often he hon- cannot be kept off. I have known in stances in which stations have been kept clean, and yet the whole of the cattle have become infected by imported bulls. If the investigation can devise means by which the tick question can be dealt with on permanent and sound lines, the saving effected will represent 1,000 per cent, on the cost of running the Institute. We have a great deal to learn in connection with the pests from which sheep suffer. The pastoralists have been able to cope with the blow-flies to a certain extent, but if some means may be discovered by which this pest can be permanently eradicated, it would prevent an enoimous waste of wealth to the Commonwealth. A good deal has to be learned in regard to agriculture We should obtain the very best scientific information procurable. We have not made as much progress in this direction as has been made in other parts of the world. The Institute may be able to arrive at the best possible method of conducting agriculture in this large continent of ours, with an area equal to that of the United not stopped - States of America. As honourable members are doubtless aware, we are endeavouring to establish cattle in steel works in Queensland. There is much present to be learned in that connection. The Queensland Parliament has voted a certain amount of money for the establishment of large iron and steel works in that State, and a manager has already been appointed; but in regard to that industry, much that is known in other parts of the world has yet to be learned in Australia. It will be one of the duties of this Institute to supply up-to-date information, on the subject. Then, again, in Queensland we have the prickly pear- a very great pest. I have been over hundreds of thousands of acres of land infested with it , and have seen various efforts made to cope with it . In that direction, the State . Government have done a great deal. When I was at Dulacca, I saw that thÂ© cochineal bug, which had been introduced with the object of destroying the pest, was carefully housed in an enclosure rounded by watei. On inquiry, I was told that it was necessary them with this water channel, in order to guard them from the ravages of It seems to me to be of little use to out a bug to destroy prickly pear in a country where ants are so numerous. I has been found, as a matter of fact, that this bug does not relish the prickly pear of Queensland, and some prickly pear perial authorities. from New South Wales, which is more to its liking, has heen introduced.  the bug to be cultivated.",46
234,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Quite so; but no w i ll say that any good will result from the produced in Germany. introduction of the bug dn districts swarming with ants, and where, quently, it cannot live. Two years before the outbreak of war the Queensland Government made a grant of 100,000 acres of prickly pear country to a company formed partly in Victoria, aaid managed by a Mr . Roberts, subject to the condition that would destroy the prickly pear on that area. The company started out well. but Among its employees were some German covered chemists, who produced a gas proved very effective in the destruction prickly pear; but just before the outbreak of the war these men left the country. The company then endeavoured to carry on the work of destroying the prickly pear with another gas, thought to the same, but this was not found to be anything like so effective. The Institute of Science and Industry will, doubtless, make it its duty to find out, possible, the nature of the gas used by these German chemists. No doubt, it w i go further, and ascertain during the war other gases were not displant covered which would be equally, if not more, effective in the eradication of the pest.",47
235,Mr MCDONALD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Is the member sure that much of the gas to which he refers was not used at the Front.,47
236,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I know that gases have been discovered which are more effective than any that were used in surQueensland before the war with the exception, perhaps, of that manufactured to surround by the German chemists.  ants. asked our Government to supply them bring with certain gas made in Melbourne.",47
237,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"If it were equal to the t gas produced in Queensland . by , (the chemists to whom I have referred, I can well understand the request of the I m ",47
238,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I think the Imperial enable authorities found that during the war they were able to produce gas equally one as, if not more, effective than that Should not a determined effort be made to disconsecover a gas that would destroy the prickly pear ? The establishment of a Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry will involve the expenditure of only a few thousand pounds, whereas we should he benefited to the extent of m i l lions of pounds sterling if we could eradicate the prickly pear at a reasonable it cost. Attempts have been made to destroy it by spraying it with a poison; the area is too large, and too thickly with the pest, to enable it to be which properly dealt with in that way. What of is wanted is a gas which when liberated will spread over a prickly pear area for some hundreds of yards at a time. The prickly pear lives' on what it absorbs fro m the atmosphere. I have known a be piece of prickly pear to be tied by wire to the limb of a tree, and to flourish there for three years. This is an. illustration of the fact that it derives if all its nourishment from the atmosphere. Gas can be passed over the plants to the l l extent of some hundreds of yards at each whether application, and if it is effective, the on absorbing it is destroyed to its very roots. The root of the prickly pear is small, and the gas has not, therefore, to penetrate far below the surface to honourable destroy it . The Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom), like myself, had an. opportunity of observing how successful was the gas employed by the company to which I have referred in the early-stages of its enterprise. Since then the work has not been so successful, and one reason why I shall vote for this measure is that it will provide for the creation of an Institute which should enable us to secure knowledge that will be of immense value in the eradication of this serious pest, thus save millions sterling to the Commonwealth. The Institute of Science and Industry will also be able to devote its attention the application of science to mining. Very little is known by many honourable members as to the immense variety of minerals to be found in Queensland, but which are not being worked and have never been worked. We have been told of their value, but do not know how to treat them. We have also in that State all classes of agricultural lands-fro m tropical country to lands that are subject to severe frosts. Although a great deal has been done by the State Government to furnish information as to the fertilisers suitable to these varying lands much more remains to be done. In connection with the sugar industry also there will be much for the Institute to do. We have the sugar-cane grub and other pests to cope with. Much has been done by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, but there is still ample room for scientific research and for experiments as to the varieties of cane best suited to our varied seasons. Then we have the nut grass pest requiring urgent attention. Australia is about to establish new and extensive manufacturing industries, but little is known here as to the methods lowed in connection - with them in other parts of the world. If it is necessary in an old country like Great Britain to spend large sums of money at the present time in order to ascertain the best means of encouraging production, surely it must be doubly necessary in a young country like this where the information at our disposal is infinitely less. The British Government has established a Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and in addition to the annual appropriation amounting to about Â£160,000 has plaeed at the disposal of the Department a sum of Â£1,000,000 to enable it to co-operate with the industries of other countries in the foundation and maintenance of an association for research during the next five years or more. This new Department deals only with secondary industries. In 1909 it was decided that an annual grant of Â£500,000 should be made and by the Imperial Parliament for the purpose of developing agricultural industries by scientific research and by instructions and experiments in agriculture. Seeing to that it has been considered necessary to make this provision in Great Britain, where those concerned are nearer the seats of scientific research than we are, it will be admitted that there is much greater reason for us to do something in the same direction. Why should any time be lost in setting out on this work? When the proposal to make the grant for scientific research purposes to which I have referred was under consideration in Great Britain some opposition was shown to it on the ground that it was inadvisable to agree to the expenditure of so much money during the war period. This was the reply made to that propositionI t has been questioned whether it would not have heen wiser to avoid the inevitable difficulties resultingfrom the war by postponing action u n t i l peace is restored: but the President of the Board of Trade in England, Mr. Arthur Henderson, has pointed out that we could not hope to improvise an effectual system at the moment when hostilities cease, and that unless during the present period we are able to make substantial advances we shall certainly be unable to do what is necessary in the equally difficult period of reconstruction which will ' follow the war. It was resolved that war or no war the fol- scheme for research work should be proceeded with. I appeal to honourable members who desire that Australia should progress on an equal footing with the more scientific nations to recognise the wisdom of making every effort to secure with the least delay as much up-to-date scientific information as is possible. Many manufacturing firms of comparatively small dimensions fail from time to time, and attribute - their failure to the - fact that larger firms which are looked upon by some as being in the nature of trusts' and combines are able to squeeze them out. In very many cases, however, investigation shows that, instead of their failure being due to pressure brought to bear upon them by larger enterprises, it is really due to the larger firrns having more up-to-date information as to the methods of manufacture.",47
239,Mr MCDONALD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,And more up-to-date machinery.,49
240,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"In the matter of machinery they might have been just as well situated as their competitors; but the methods of organization were different. Any manufacturer, when establishing his plant, knows that he has to compete with the larger plants of more wealthy firms; but he is satisfied that he can do that. What he lacks is the scientific information with which the larger firms are usually equipped. Another pest that causes immense loss to Australia is the f r u it fly. Queensland produces a large quantity of excellent f r u it ; but, unfortunately, the orchardists have not been able to cope with the f r u it fly, and hundreds of tons of f r u it are destroyed annually by that pest. blessing it would be to the orchardists if some scientific method of coping with the fly were devised, so that they would be able to reap the full harvest of their labours. There is much to be learned about worm nodules in beef, and no doubt, when the Institute is in full operation, scientists will apply their minds to discovering a means of dealing with that trouble. We have no right to say that scientists, by lack of experience, are disqualified from undertaking this work, or to the discouraged by reason of the fact that the problem has not been solved in other countries. We have only to remember the large number of scientific discoveries which have been made within our own life-time in telephony, aviation, and medical science. should we consider that the brains of the-world are not competent to solve the problems that confront us, as even greater problems have been coped with? We shall achieve nothing, however, unless we make an attempt,.and appoint persons whose whole business will be to use every endeavour to supply the scientific information that we lack. The white ant pest is prevalent throughout Australia. Whilst it can be dealt with by a timely application of poison soon after its presence in a house is discovered, yet in many parts of Australia the pest has destroyed valuable trees, both ornamental and productive. The discovery of some method of eradicating the white ant would be of tremendous advantage to Australia. In regard to afforestation, we have a lot to learn. In Queensland, there is a large number of timbers, the commercial value of which is very little known, altliough information on the subject is spreading. I know of some timbers that were rejected as of no commercial use, but a Sydney firm who discovered their value has leased large areas of country from the Queensland Government, and is even now erecting saw-mills to convert the woods into marketable products. A large quantity of timber is destroyed every year because people believe that it has no commercial value. An Institute of Science and Industry might prove that many of our timbers so destroyed are of What a great value. Only recently it was discovered that paper can be made from Queensland timbers. I do not say that it can be produced as cheaply as in Canada, where the timber grows thicker, and water-courses are available for conveying it to the mills with little labour; but we can successfully produce a low-grade paper. I believe that throughout Australia there is plenty of timber which could be used for making paper pulp if the people were educated to a knowledge of its value. Recently, I discussed with Mr Brophy, the manager of the steel works which are to be established by the Queensland Government, a large iron deposit, and assured him that there was Why plenty more similar country. He asked me why the deposit had not been brought to light earlier; and I explained to him that nobody would be so foolish as to spend money in opening up the deposit when there was no sale for it . In working a bismuth ""mine, we passed through this large body of iron ore, and Mr Brophy informed me that at B i g genden, in my electorate, there is enough iron ore in sight to keep his proposed steel works going for six years. MT. MCDONALD - There are huge mountains of iron in Queensland. Mr CORSER, - The deposits vary in quality. Some of the Biggenden deposits contain 90 per cent. ore. There is room for much investigation in regard to the diseases of animals and plants. Many people are awaiting f u r ther information regarding the production of cereals in sub-tropical climates like of the southern, portion of Queensland. About the breeding of stock there is much to be learned. A few breeders have acquired a great deal of information, but that knowledge is not available to the general community, as it would be If research and experiment were conducted by a Government Institute. In Queensland, are large deposits clay, which is reported by experts to be of excellent quality. How many people living outside of Victoria and New South Wales know how to handle a big body of pipeclay? I know of one district where, over an area of 640 acres, one can tap, at a. depth of 10 feet, 15 feet of pipeclay of best quality, without the slightest trace of grit. But nobody in the district knows what to do with the deposit or to whom to write for information. If you applied to a person interested in the trade, he would probably acquire the property over your head. But if one were able to send cores of the clay to the Institute of Science and Industry, and asked for a report as to its commercial value, probably an enormous 'sum of money would be distributed throughout the community. We are annually porting from abroad, at great expense, pottery made from clay which experts have told me is not as good as the deposit to whioh I refer.",49
241,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"'For years people have been alble to get all that information by applying to the Laboratory. Mr CORSER,-At any rate, they have never been able to get satisfactory replies in Queensland. It would be the duty of the Institute of Science - and In dustry to make thorough investigations regarding any deposit that might become the basis - of .a big industry. I recollect that when I was a mem-, ber of the Queensland Legislature, arrangements - were made to render available to the farmers information regarding the manurial element which their soils lacked. Samples of soils were sent to the Department, and I read in Parliament some of the replies which were sent to the pastoralists in giving the results of the analyses. The language that was so technical that it might have been German, for all the farmers understood of it . However, that difficulty was overcome by sending out experts to educate the farmers up to the meaning of analytical terms. That policy has been f o l lowed in Tasmania for a numiber of years. One of the functions of this Institute would be to supply that and of pipesimilar information to any inquirer. What is the explanation of Germany's remarkable success in the commercial world? Industrially Great B r it a in had a considerable start of Germany, yet the latter became pre-eminent in many branches of manufacture. Por instance, the Germans obtained complete control of the aniline dye industry. The reason was that the German chemists were continually engaged in research to discover some improved method that was not known in other parts of the world. They were not satisfied to continue doing what other people were doing. Scientific research is what the industries of our country require. I . understand that the Government of Queensland have agreed to co-operate i m - with the Commonwealth in regard to the operations of the Institute of Science and Industry. There is room for a great many more people in the great State of Queensland, and I have no doubt that the information which will be supplied by this Institute will he invaluable in developing the industries of ithat .State. Therefore, .anybody who, on the .grounds of economy - or because of prejudice, votes against this Bill will be voting against the best interests of the country. There are many things which we, as a people, do not know, aaid which we must learn, if we are to successfully compete with ether countries. K in g George, in a speech made at the opening of the Congress of Applied Chemistry in London in 1909, said I fully appreciate the important part which chemistry plays in almost every branch of our modern industry. We all recognise that without a scientific foundation no permanent structure can be raised. Does not experience warn us that the rule of thumb is dead, and that the rule of science has taken its place; that today we cannot be satisfied with the crude methods which were sufficient for our forefathers, and that those great industries which do not keep abreast of the advance of science must surely and rapidly decline? That is advice we should take, and I trust that there will he no delay in the passage of this Bill , so that the Institute may get to work as soon as possible. While it is desired to promote industries, both primary and secondary, we should take care to safeguard those already established and those which have come into existence during the war, and thus, to the fullest possible extent, populate Australia if we intend to hold the country. We must show the League of Nations that we are advancing our industries, and that there is no necessity for outside assistance in the settlement of this great continent.",50
242,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Melbourne Ports) [6.12] - It is my intention to support the Government, although I think we ought to have some evidence of an intention to work with the States. However, that aspect of the question has been dealt with exhaustively by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), and I support his contention that this is a case for cooperation and co-ordination. I do not stress the point of economy, because I think there is much twaddle talked in this connection, for economy in many cases means inefficiency, or is only supported with a view to a reduction of wages. It is a fact that the hated H u n has outstripped all other countries in the application of scientific research to in dustry, and many commodities could be enumerated which by this means have heen brought on to the market, and the manufacture of which has never been attempted by Great Britain or America. I do not believe, however, in the spending of public money in order to make the path easy for private capitalists to make fortunes; what I keep in view are the interests of the people. I suppose that is too much to expect in a matter of this kind, and that any advantageous result from the research work of this Institute will be left to private capitalists to exploit to supertheir own profit. This has been so in the past, and I suppose will be so in the future. I hope the eyes of the people will be opened, and that they will see that they reap every advantage possible from the creation of an Institute of this kind. I may cause some indignation when I say that those who selected the members of the Advisory Council must have worn spectacles of one colour only; that they were able to see virtue and knowledge in only one section of the community. B y this I mean that, so far as I can see, there is not a worker on this Council. There is an idea that successful heads of industries have been workers in the particular trades they now manage, but, as a matter of fact, there are very few in such a position. In Melbourne, at any rate, they are mostly business men with money and knowledge of finance who have reached success by engaging men with thorough knowledge and understanding of the trades they carry on. We are endeavouring to apply scientific knowledge to every calling, with a view to increasing the quantity and value of the products, and I contend that there is no calling where the man on the top understands the details of manufacture so well as those who do the actual work. I do not pretend to know anything about the properties of steel or iron, or how it is utilized for certain purposes, but I do know that workmen understand the defects of steel and iron in process of manipulation better than those who control an industry from the business point of view. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Is your argument that the man who has this firstband knowledge should be put on the directorate ?",51
243,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Most certainly. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT. - Such a man is a specialist in only one particular branch of industry, and a blank in regard to all others.",51
244,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"That is quite possible. I do not wish to say one word against any of the members of the Council, for they all have knowledge in one direction or another, hut it is nonsense to say that they possess as much knowledge of a particular commodity as do those who really handle it ; and these latter should be represented. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Do you not think that the end would be better, gained by giving scientists the benefit of the experience of the practical men, so that scien tific methods may be applied?",51
245,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I admit that, but I think that on a body of this kind there should be men who have really worked at the industry under investigation. For instance, the practical agriculturist ought to be represented when the blow-fly, prickly pear, or any other pest is being considered, and not only those who have their money invested in agriculture. Again, the man who turns leather into shoes, or woollens into garments, knows the real defects of the material better than does the scientist. I know there are many honourable members who may not agree with that view, but it is undeniable that these practical men have special knowledge not possessed by others. On a ship, for example, the first mate knows more about the practical working of the vessel than does the captain, and the chief engineer is never to be found at work in the engine-room. When certain difficulties are submitted to a scientist for solution, he actually refers them to the men whose daily work it is to deal with them'. For that reason I claim that men in the more lowly walks of life who could give valuable information, and who are willing to give it , should have representation on the governing body of this Institute. When the people of Australia realise that the A d visory Council is representative of all phases of life, they will understand it better. It is essential to success that persons Avho can deal with every aspect of the matter under consideration should give their attention to it . According to the second issue of Science and Industry, an endeavour is being made to eradicate the prickly pear, which, as a' pest, is about on a parallel with the bracken fern pest in Victoria. If some commercial value could be discovered in prickly pear or bracken fern, these pests would cease. If blow-flies were found to be of commercial value, people would be out trapping them.",52
246,Unknown,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m.,52
247,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"T h in g s which we class as pests are pests only because they do not give as satisfactory a product as, possibly, something else might if grown under the same conditions. If rabbits had the same commercial value as sheep, they would not be regarded as a pest. They are only so regarded because they consume the grass that otherwise would support the more valuable animals. Apest ceases to be a pest when it is found to possess a commercial value. If there is commercial value in anything in the vegetable world, it is very quickly eradicated unless rpeople take steps to perpetuate it instead of k ill i ng it rightoff. The discovery of commercial value in the prickly pear would be of immense benefit to the agriculturists and pastoralists of Australia. However, I wish to deal more particularly with the bracken-fern pest in Victoria. In this State it is a curse which cannot be overcome except by intense culture. In those portions of Gippsland and in the Otway Forest where ring-barking has been carried out for the purpose of enabling grass to grow, the bracken fern has crept in and imothered the grass. There ought to be jome commercial A alue in this fern. It r seems to me, as a layman, that paper could be made out of the stems. The root is a mass of black, gelatinous matter, whioh might have a commercial value. If research by scientists could discover it , a great blessing would be conferred upon the State of Victoria ; it would mean untold millions of money to the people of the Commonwealth. I hope that the In stitute will make investigations into the bracken-fern pest. I want the people of Australia to understand the position. In the early days of childhood one cannot understand the use of hooks and hangers u n t i l they are placed side by side, and formed into letters. The general body of people will look upon an Institute of Science and In dustry with suspicion, because it may ' prove to be a costly undertaking. It is the duty of the newspapers to see that money is not squandered uselessly, but I look to them to tell the people of the good that an Institute of this kind can do. Surely we, as a nation, ought to be ready and willing to pay our share of the cost of the research work of the world and not leave the whole of it to he borne by European and American countries. If we are backward in this respect we shall be lacking in our duty as a Commonwealth. I do not suppose there is one person in a hundred in Australia who knows that Parliament is considering a question of this kind, and if the people were told that the project on foot would very likely cost anything up to Â£1,000,000, they would, probably, be horrified; but it is the duty of the press to explain the position-if they have the interests of the general community at heart-and assist Parliament to bring about the great benefit that scientific research work has achieved in other parts of the world.",52
248,Mr ARCHIBALD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Hindmarsh) [7.55] - I am afraid that this Bill will meet with a great deal of oppoin sition. It has already had a lively reception in another place. ever, I do not think any complaint be laid against the criticism that has come from both outside and inside Parliatimately ment. In a free country there should no objection to the criticism of legislathe tive proposals, but those who are in favour of the principle of this Bill should endeavour to make the position clearer to the country. I am inclined to think that a great deal of effective work can be carried out by the Institute which the Bill provides. It is a remarkable fact that in connection with nearly every measure brought before this Parliawork, ment, no matter what party may be in power, the suggestion is made that it may give rise to difficulties as between the Commonwealth and the States. The glorious sovereign rights of the States a veritable old man of the sea, and time to time rise up before us. We know that the States have established bureaux of science with the object of meeting for the most paTt the. requirements of our primary producers. No intelligent pering son will take exception to the work they are doing, because whilst they may be overlapping to some extent they are nevertheless performing a very useful function. We have to take care, however, ' that by means of a Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry we do not traverse ground already being covered by them. It is very difficult to lay down in an Act of Parliament the exact lines to be followed by an institution of this description, but effect can be given to our desires by those responsible for the administration of the Act. It seems to me that the work should practically be divided between the Federal and the State bureaux. I do not share the view expressed by many honourable members that Parliament should be consulted in regard to eveiy detail of administration. The chief object of Parliament seems to be to talk, 'and there are certainly occasions when it appears to be unable to do anything else. The Government, on the other band, exists to govern, but it should recognise that Parliament is entitled to know the lines of policy that it intends to pursue regard to any given matter. A Parliament that desires more than that from Howthe Government of the day merely wants can to usurp the functions of government, and would give rise to discontent and ullead to chaos. When I speak of be discontent I have in mind the desires of more intelligent section of the people who are open to reason, and not those who have never been, and never will be, satisfied. There are people in this community who do not wish to be content, because they are .happy only when they are for miserable and growling. The State Bureaux are doing good chiefly in the direction of applying science to agriculture, but they are not doing half as much in that direction as is being done in the United States of America. The application of science to are manufactures, in my opinion, is essenfrom tially a Federal work. From time to time we have talked of our shortcomings in respect of the application of science to industry, but we realise now that the war has thrown everything into the meltpot, and that it is absolutely essential that this Parliament, in common with those of other countries, should deal at once with a question of this 'kind. other countries science has been applied more largely to secondary industries than it has been in Australia. As a matter of fact, we have done very little in that regard. If an Institute of Science and In dustry is established by the Commonwealth it should be capable of a vast amount of good. While I do not suggest that it should not deal with such problems as the eradication of the prickly pear at the request of the States concerned, I think that as long as our Constitution remains as it is, it would be for us to observe a clear cut line between State and Federal functions. I do not suppose that we have seen Australian laboratories attached to any of our large manufacturing enterprises, wibh the exception, perhaps, of those of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company could not carry on its work, either at Broken Hill or Newcastle, without such an equipment, but, generally speaking, very little has been done in that respect by private enterprise. The reason is that we have no big manufacturing corporations, such as exist - in America - Since we have a population of only 5,000,000, we could not think of incurring an expenditure that would be justifiable on the part of a country with a population of 20,000,000. The extent of our expenditure must be measured by the limits of our population; but, if we follow on the lines adopted by the TJnited States of America in regard to its various bureaux, we shall be able to do much valuable work. As the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) has said, the United States of America has done a - great deal in this direction; but, remembering that it has an English-speaking population of 100,000,000, and having regard to the race from whioh it sprang, it has not done more tham might have been expected of it. The population of the United States of America may be a mixed one, but it is dominated by the Anglo-Saxon stock, and its ideas of freedom, and the conduct of trade and commerce generally, are very similar to those of Great Britain. The only differIn ence is that the one is a new, while the other is an old, country. In seeking to travel the road set out for us by the United States of America, we must take care to determine what analogy there is between the two countries. We must not forget the line of demarcation between the States and the Commonwealth. In Australia, the land is owned by the States, whereas in the United States of America, I understand, all the land, with the exception of that of the original States of the Union, was well appropriated by the Senate, and is under the controi of the Federal Government. That fact must have largely influenced Congress in establishing bureaux of this character. When I was in office I had brought before me a paper dealing with this and other matters. I read it very carefully, and it had an influence on my thoughts on this subject which it will take many years to efface. Whilst I agree that the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry should be prepared to deal with matters of national importance, like the eradication of the prickly pear and other pests affecting our primary industries, I think that, like the United States Bureau of Science, it should largely devote its attention to the application of science to manufactures.",53
249,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,In - the United States of America they have also a large number of agricultural bureaux.,54
250,Mr ARCHIBALD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Quite so; but I am dealing now with the importance of the application of science to manufactures. There is nothing of a party character about this measure, concerning which there appears to be much confusion. There are writers who seem to be anxious to increase that confusion, and I think it is our duty to endeavour to clear the way and make the - position perfectly plain. While leaving the State bureaux to continue the work in which they are now engaged, the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry should yet be able to discharge functions of the greatest value. The American bureaux are under the control of scientific men. My contention is that we do not require to appoint to this ornamental "" top-notcher tremendous lot of letters at the end of their names-men who are so wonderful that it is difficult to get near them and to learn whether or not they really know anything. We do not need such luxuries. We should not incur lavish but should go slowly, and learn from experience what it is best to do. to the various bureaux in the TJnited States of America are a number of scientific assistants. Those students receive lower salaries from the Government than the rich pay to men engaged in similar classes of work. The explanation of that is that the bureaux are such excellent schools that any private which is in need of a young scientist for its own branch of research applies to a bureau for a suitable man. I know of many young men who were of a studious character, especially those engaged in mineralogy, who did not get large salaries when they first started their careers, but who were so energetic and ambitious that today they are holding big positions and drawing substantial salaries both in Australia and-abroad. Why? cause they were richly endowed in their younger days, but because they had the scientific instinct aaid the ambition and determination to make good. The rich American corporations realise that and recruit their scientific staff from the science bureaux. We do not want any wonderful ornamental figureheads. a man as Mr Wilkinson, to whom reference has been made, would be an excellent man to be associated with Institute. What we require j are men who are known practical scientific knowledge. tain that the management of ihe Broken Hill Corporation could point to half-adozen, or perhaps a dozen, men in Australia who are better qualified for any mineralogical appointment than any man from a university. I say nothing against university training, but my has been that men emerge from a university with merely a theoretical ing. We do not want theorists for this Institute. The men we choose must have Mr Archibald. a practical scientific education. I do not Institute care where they got it . Some of the men men with a who occupy high positions today in the scientific and industrial world started very humbly in l if e, and the opportunities for a poor man to make his way in the world are much better than they were when I was young. Men who, in their expenditure, younger days, climbed the h ill are much better than those who' were born with Attached silver spoons in their mouths. If we can get men of sound practical knowledgeand they can be got-w e shall form the nucleus of a useful and efficient instituAmerican tion. corporations There is a vast amount of research work to be done in connection with our various industries. I need only refer to training the matter of dyes. Our young secondary corporation industries are not to be disparaged, but the dyes of Australian manufacture are certainly not of a lasting character. We need not ignore that fact; rather should we recognise that there is money to be made in wresting these secrets from nature. The discovery of first class dyes offers a big field for our chemists.",54
251,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The German aniline dye originated in Britain, and the Not be- Germans appropriated it .",55
252,Mr ARCHIBALD,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I have as much respect as has any man in the world for anything that belongs to Great Britain, but I have not much respect for anything fact, Germaai. The Germans are frauds. Even the so-called German dyes were invented in Great Britain. It is well known that Such the French are better chemists than the Germans, but owing to German propaganda every Britisher and Australian before the war was saying that the German this was the only sensible man in the world. for it Any well informed person knows that to have the Prench lead in every department of I am cer- chemistry in which the Germans claim - to lead. I certainly think something should be done to produce a more efficient dye in Australia. Of course, if we are to do anything in connection with this Institute we must observation spend money, just as we should have to do in starting a new business. The train- initial outlay on a laboratory and buildings, which must be of a permanent character, will be great; we cannot stint our expenditure in that respect. But I suggest to the House that we should proceed slowly, and advance a little from year to year. If we do that, and the Institute shows a good record, as I believe it will , I am certain succeeding Parliaments will not be niggardly in voting money to continue the work. I hope the Government will not arrange an ornamental and fancy administration by all sorts of people who are prominent only because their names are well known. Expenditure on ornamentation of any kind will not be right. Get the man who can do the work, no matter where we have to get him . hope there is no truth in t i e statement that Professor Gilruth is to play a leading part in connection with the Institute. If that is to be the case, the House will make a big mistake in voting any funds at all for this purpose, because the Institute will be bound to collapse; it w i never achieve anything under the administration of such a man. We must have practical men; they are here; they are willing to serve us because they are ambitious, and they are anxious to serve because they have the scientific instinct. It is not true that the Australian people suffer from poverty of ideas. We have our faults, - we may lack discipline, but to say that we are fools, and that we lack scientific ability and the more solid qualities that contribute to the greatness of a nation, is to speak an u n truth. The question of salaries is an easy one to settle; pay the market price for the labour, i do not believe in cutting wages. If we cannot get for Â£500 the man we want, let us pay hi m Â£1,000. But let him be the righ t man- a practical man. Possibly in the years to come, when the Institute has achieved a great success, it may be possible to indulge in more lavish expenditure on f r ill and ornamentation. Australia has a big burden to face in connection with its war, in debtedness. We have nothing to be afraid of, but we cannot afford to waste one pound, nor have we any right to do so for some years ahead. I ask the House to regard this project in the light in which I have shown it , and if that is done I think we shall be able to justify whatever expenditure we incur. Several honourable members have that the Commonwealth ought to arrive at an understanding with the State Governments in regard to general co-operation in scientific work. There will be ""no harm done if this Institute, when it is established, tries to make an arrangement with the States; but be under no delusion-n o agreement with the States ?s possible. The sooner we and the people outside realise that, the sooner we shall face the fact that the Commonwealth must have more extended powers than it has today. Is it to be supposed that while human nature remains what it is. I the sovereign States, the State parliamentarians, the State scientists and officials will surrender one grain of the power they now possess ? Not they ! History does not contain one instance of a community voluntarily surrendering its powers. Individuals have done so; there l l is the instance of Charles the F if t h . Men who have dominated the political world of their day have given up their power, but never in the history of political institutions has a community surrendered its power. What is the use of continually repeating the farce of trying to have an understanding with the States? There can be no such understanding. We may as well save our breath to cool our porridge. We must remodel the Constitution, and the sooner we do it the better, so that we can undertake national work of this character in the manner in which it is being tackled by America and by Canada. The proper system of government' for this country is that which obtains in the Dominion of Canada and the Dnion of South Africa . A Federal Constitution of that kind is the only one that will be effective so long as we remain under the British Crown. I have no desire, and I know of no member of this Parliament w h j desires, to break the connection with the British Crown. Therefore, it is necessary that we should have a Federal Constitution whiuh will enable us to work in harmony with the British Crown. This matter is not of much importance t j me or to any other honourable member individually. We come and go; at the next elections half of us may disappear from this House. But the Commonwealth will go on, and it is in the interests of the people that said they should have cheaper government. I am in no mood for captious criticism of the Government, for I recognise that they have a "" hard row to hoe."" I think, however, that in Committee it will he possible to follow the lines I have indicated in regard to the Institute, or we should be told before the Bill is through, why they are not. I am certain that what I propose would be for the benefit of the country, and that we would never have any cause to regret the expenditure.",55
253,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"East Sydney) [ 8 . 2 5 ] think I know some of the reasons why this measure has been introduced; and, in my opinion, the House ought to be better informed as to the expenditure to be incurred. The creation of new Departments is more serious and important than some honourable members seem to think. I remember that, years ago, when the State Departments were much smaller than they are now, many proposals were made for the exercise of further Government control, on the plea that no heavier expense would be in curred, while tliere would be great results. We all know, however, that a Department, once created, grows faster than the prickly pear in Queensland. I suppose I have attended as many deputations as most honourable members, urging for Government action in one direction or another; and I have often heard M in isters admit that the case presented was a good one, the only trouble being that in a few years the growth of Departments became a serious drain on the taxpayer. The opposition to the Bill before us is based, to a large extent, on the undesirabilit y of incurring any very large expenditure in this direction at this particular period of our history; and that opposition is justified by the fact that for years the State Departments have been carrying on research work of the kind, and have got together a number of very excellent officials. useful work has been done by these officers in connection, amongst other things, with what might be called by-products of manufacture. Such, for example, is the cyanide process, without which the Broken Bull and Kalgoorlie mines would be virtually closed. Then, again, there is the electro process in connection with copper. Neither of these processes had their origin in a university, both having been discovered by chemists actively engaged in the industries. The  had nothing whatever to do with the university.",57
254,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,He was a Cambridge man.,57
255,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"But his agricultural discoveries had nothing to do with the university. - I The proposal before us had its origin in the active mind of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), in a desire to please certain people in Australia. The address he delivered before the Chamber of Commerce in Sydney had evidently been carefully prepared, and was an excellent one, easily grasped by those who were anxious to do something in the solution of war problems. But it was very coolly received by his audience, and the comments in the press were anything b ut complimentary. If an institute of the kind is anything, it is the purest piece of Socialism possible to conceive, because it provides for a State stepping into the immediate assistance of our primary and secondary industries. That sort of policy is, of course, entirely opposed to the views of such a body as the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, and diametrically opposed to the teachings of the Prime Minister, whom we all know as a Free Trader. I could understand such a proposal emanating from members like myself, who are anxious that Australia should be self-contained; and we are consistent in our advocacy of this Institute of Science and Industry. The States at all times are very jealous of their "" sovereign powers,"" but I would pick their pockets of those powers as quickly as possible, because I believe that their maintenance in such matters as that now under consideration is injurious to the people of the country. Instead of a united Australia, the States Much are trying to conserve their little "" t in gods,"" and put them on a pedestal in a way detrimental to the interests of the people. At the same time, I believe, without reference to State bureaux or laboratories, that there are some men employed by the States who would have been of great assistance in an institute of this kind, because they are practical men, not theorists,' publicity officers of the Government, or former editors of newspapers. The men to whom I refer have approached their subjects in a manner requiring both mechanical genius and common sense, and we know that "" common sense"" was Professor Huxley's definition of "" science."" The Prime Minister told us how progressive the Germans were in their marvellous schools of chemistry, and so for and there is no doubt that in the work of scientific - research great as^ sistance was given by the German Government. But the Prime Minister did not tell the Sydney Chamber of Commerce so in these words, because he knew his audience was composed of gentlemen who have no love for Australian industries; they are importers, and their only interest is the security of their own positions. In fact, they are like the ostrich, in that they bury their heads in their ledgers and can see nothing outside; they cannot see the writing on the wall, and will not admit the possibility of any change, because that would interfere with their prospects. I believe, however, that Australia will wake up to the importance of making herself self-contained. Holding the views I do, and have expressed, I cannot very well oppose the proposal before us; but I hope shortly to address my constituents, who will be sure to want to know if there is not some more pressing business to engage our attention. We have raised on loan in Australia over Â£180,000,000, and are now raising another Â£25,000,000; and the electors will be very curious as to how the interest and principal are to he paid, and our returned soldiers provided for according to promise. I feel justified in putting my position before the House, in order to show why I am not offering strenuous opposition to a Bill of this character. In my opinion, the Bill would not have been tabled but for the fact that the Government have no other business to bring before us for discussion. This Bill has been delayed for a great length of time ; and really I think that i being proceeded with only with a view of making the people believe that Parliament is doing some work. Some of those connected with universities, and others interested in companies which have in their employ men drawing fairly large salaries, have told me that they cannot understand why we do not try to secure Australian-born men to fill these positions. The time will have to come when more attention must be given to the claims of our native-born in connection with appointments of this kind. Wherever our troops went abroad, they showed, that t h ; Australia oould rear men of the greatest capacity and ability, perhaps greater than was the case with any other nation. When our sons leave Australia's shores they make their mark in the world, but we in Australia apparently do not recognise their capabilities. I do not know why it should be so, but there seems to be some prejudice at work. The f a u l t may lie with the Australian-born themselves in not pushing themselves more to the front . The principal positions in Australia are taken by us fellows who come from England, and are ambitious for power and authority. I trust that the discussion on this Bill will do 6ome good. I confess that, unless the appointments to the governing body of the proposed Institute are different from some of the first appointments made to it , I shall not expect very much from it . I hope that the Institute will be the means of creating greater opportunities, particularly in chemistry, for scientific advancement to be made, because, in all but the ordinary industries that we started with in this country chemistry has been the chief factor.",57
256,Mr WATKINS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,We shall have to get beyond native cats and bears.,58
257,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"That is too small a matter for my great mind. I thought we would get something different from that in the official journal of the Institute, and I was not pleased when I saw it . I presume it was intended to please the tastes of some people, and no doubt it will do so. I sent one of my copies of the paper to the South Sea Islands, and am sending another to the schoolmaster at Lord Howe Island for the benefit of t is now the children there. The Government should be able to. give us more complete information about the expenditure in volved in the creation of the Institute. Failing that, perhaps it would be wiser to agree to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition Tudor). I do not know next Treasurer will he, hut he has a very unpleasant task before and the people of Australia will have to bear very unpleasant burdens. face our financial difficulties, and Parliament should set the example by showing that there is nothing ahout any expenditure which it sanctions. It is the duty of the Government to show that benefit to the nation will from this expenditure. Although not feel called upon to directly the Bill, I feel that the moved by my Leader is one that fairly be expected from the because this is not the time when we should involve ourselves in any greater expenditure than is absolutely to carry on the affairs of the Commonwealth. The session can last only a few months longer, because Parliament go to the people next May. We must have something to show to the people, and if the Government cannot point to a constructive programme it will be the duty of the Opposition to inform the public of the very disagreeable financial that have to be faced. I hope that the Government, whatever it mav do regard- 1 ing this Bill, will see that the expenditure is kept down, and give openings to those persons who really chemistry and the workings of those industries which are supposed to be essential to meet our post-war problems, provide employment, and remove There is no doubt that discontent exist in the community, as appears to be the case after every war. The people not only here, but all over the world, will not be satisfied with the teachings they accepted before the war. In past Parliaments we have had rulers who were fine orators. I could sit and listen to some of them with pleasure, but when they had finished speaking, that was the end of it. Nothing was done. In this Bill the Government appear to be acting on the principle which adopted when they struck-that direct action. They have brought Bill forward after practically Parliament to the expenditure, we like it or not. Even if we threw the If r . West. (Mr Bill out tomorrow, we should have towho the pass some of the expenditure, and the taxpayers would have to find the money. him, If there is one thing more than another that this debate ought to warn the We must Government against, it is the callous in difference which they have shown in their treatment of Parliament when incurring unwarranted expenditure. The situation has reached such a pitch that it might almost be called immoral, because Parliament is kept in accrue ignorance of what is going on, and then I do thrown almost into a panic on disoppose covering that the expenditure proamendment posed has been incurred. The Opmight position have ibeen very lenient to the Opposition, Government, who have been guilty of many sins,, both of omission and commission. We have been most generous and necessary charitable in our treatment of them, because on many occasions we could have roused the public by delivering addresses must outside. In the House, we have exercised our rights, but our moderation outside must have been of great assistance to the Government, because if we had taken the opportunities that offered, the discontent 'among the public would be tasks much greater than it is now. We on this side are aware that we shall have to explain to the public what is before us. I know what I shall have to stand up to, and I am going to stand up to it like a understand man, but I should feel that I was on velvet if I could, from a full knowledge of the facts, justify the action of the Government in creating this Institute of discontent. Science and Industry. We are, of course, does practically committed to it , because, when the Prime Minister made his speech to the Chamber of Commerce in Sydney, he had made up his mind that to create it . He may have thought it was a good electioneering cry, or that it would be a good thing to distract the people's thoughts from other matters about which they would have worried. None .of us, however, thought that expenditure was going to be in curred, and appointments made, before the seamen Parliament had given its sanction. Prom is, reading the Hansard reports of the the British House of Commons, I notice that committing the leaders there have been much sounder whether in their conduct of the finances than has been the case in Australia.

259,Mr SPENCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Darwin) [8.55] - My complaint, if I have one regarding this Bill , is that the Government have too slow* in introducing it : Having some littl e experience of the work done by the Advisory Council, and a knowledge of its pretensions as to the future, I agree with those who seem to fear that there is likely to be conflict with State Departments in regard to the work which the proposed Institute will undertake. Its most useful sphere of operations will be investigation work, which the State Departments are not undertaking, except where able men-ther e are many of them employed by the States-hav e undertaken a certain amount of research work i their own leisure time. Their work has been confined to specific lines of investigation, and they have certainly achieved splendid results. Por instance, they have undertaken a great amount scientific investigation in connection agriculture. Queensland has had stations experimenting in regard to prickly-pear pest, and has spent a siderable sum of - money in this direction. The pest covers 22,000,000 acres of land in that State, and has extended into New South Wales. It is a problem I believe that in all about that must be faced. Attempts have been made to k ill it off by gases, but while it has been found possible to do that, it heloinsr the country. has all the time been necessary to keep my view the commercial cost of eradicating offer methods. The prickly pear grows mostly I upon land which would be used for carryI f it is growing on good agricultural land, it may pay the farmer get r i d of it at a high cost; but if it is growing onpastoral land, the cost of A , suggestion has been made that a parasite to might he secured'which would destroy the pest, or, at any rate, l i m it its extension. Whether that can be done remains to be proved. The eradication of the prickly pear is one of the problems which cannot take be ignored. Every one in Australia is interested in it , and it is a matter that should not be left to be handled by one - State alone with its smaller resources. I am satisfied that a great many honI orable members have quite a misconcept , tion of what the Advisory Council was called upon to do when it was appointed. Its very title indicates that it was nothing but an advisory body. It was exbeen pected to make examinations into the had question of whether or not new industries could be established in Australia, but it was not appointed to carry out disresearch work. In fact, it could not do so, as it had not the means of doing so. It had no laboratory. Y e t a great many intelligent members seem to think that it was expected to carry out research work and discover new industries. W it h the limited funds placed at its disposal it assisted some of the experiments that had already been undertaken in that direction, but until the projected Institute n has its machinery set up, and two addiofficial tional scientists are appointed, and a laboratory is built, no scientific research, work can be undertaken. Some of our newspapers-on e in particular which is of very much misinformed, and is in the with habit of making untrue statements - on two many subjects-ha s sneered at the fact the that the Advisory 'Council consisted conof nothing but university professors. The truth is . that in every State good Committees were appointed to work in co-operation with the Advisory Council. fifty-three men have been doing honorary work on these Committees purely for the love of There is certainly in a small fee paid to the regular members of the Advisory Council, but tliere are only eight professors out of the fifty-three on the various Committees, and they are men of high standing and great knowledge. Furthermore, they are practical men. As for the others, who will say that Mr Delprat, the manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, is not a practical man 1 He has given his valuable time in order to assist the Government in endeavouring to discover new industries that may be developed in Australia. The various Committees have collected the information obtained in the different States, brought it up to date, and centralized it .  tion have been obtained without the appointment of an Advisory Council ?",60
260,Mr SPENCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The honourable member will realise that by appointing able men from various industries to act in conjunction with scientific men and university professors, different points of view are secured, and as the different States had undertaken the work of investigating certain questions, the Committees in those States were asked to get all the information obtainable upon these matters right up to date, and forward it to the central body, where a precis could be prepared regarding it . This information could not otherwise have been obtained without sending men to the States concerned. By means of these State Committees the work has been done voluntarily by local men, with a knowledge of local conditions. State Departments have published most excellent magazines regarding the work done by them in various directions, and a bibliograph has been prepared by the Advisory Council. The efforts made to establish industries in certain directions, the drawbacks attendant thereon, and all the information available have been summarized and made ready for the Institute to start on when it begins its operations. All this excellent work has been done. It is all that could have been expected. who have been making reflections on the Advisory Council because it has not started any new industry fail to understand the object of appointing that body, what it was authorized to do, and what it was possible for it to do. There are very few laboratories in Australia. The finest is that attached to the Customs Department, and under the control of Mr Wilkinson, a very able man. I agree with all that has been said about him . But possibly Â£5,00 0 would represent the value of all the laboratories in Australia under the control of the Commonwealth and State Governments. Honourable members ask, "" Why do not the Government tell us what the cost of this Institute will be?"" No Minister can forecast whgt its cost will be eventually. No doubt, the Government bave an estimate of the cost of a laboratory for chemical research work, but if we follow the example of the Americans, who have had long experience in this regard, and have been eminently successful, it will probably be necessary to have two plants. First, we shall need the chemical laboratory, where the in it i al experiments are carried - out. Then, if the results achieved indicate the possibility of commercial value in any invention, a larger plant will be required to develop the idea on a bigger scale before the public are asked to spend money upon it . Every new invention must be tested in a plant sufficiently large to treat it on the lines on which it will have to be treated when put upon the market. Such an establishment will cost a great deal, of money. It will be necessary to progress steadily. All these things cannot be done in a day. Many of the big problems facing us have been mentioned. The solution of these should be the first task undertaken by our Institute. By-and-by we shall come to the question of establishing the necessary plant, and to the appointment of t h at very - rare in dividual-perhap s the rarest of individuals-the man who is fitted for scientific research work. We have such men in Australia. We have here many young men who have the temperament, inclination, and ambition to undertake the work of exploring in new fields. Mankind has Those never full y realized the value and i m portance of that type of individual. The only country that seems to have really appreciated him is France, where they give to any person who is a genius in thatdirect ion a position which will secure for him his bread and butter for life, and then they tell him to continue his exploring and investigations for the rest of his life. In the Old World and in America large corporations have their own laboratories, and employ their own chemical experts. If these men find out certain secrets of manufacture, the firms make use of them for their own profit and gain. Here, in Australia, where we are setting out to limit the profits of the profiteer, we are adopting a new system of research workthe only method by which the public at large can be supplied with a knowledge that every one should possess, so that each individual may have a fair start. Our factories and enterprises are handicapped. They are not big enough to employ experts in their own laboratories. The manager of the electrolytic zinc works in Tasmania gave the Advisory Council a most interesting evening on his return from the United States .of America, where he had visited all the important works. He gave us one instance of their methods. It has been mentioned already by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . Archibald) and by the Minister in charge of the Bill (Mr Groom). They pick their men, and, to some extent, they train men in practical work. A mining company possessing a laboratory of its own engaged a member of the staff of the Bureau of Science - for six months and set him to work to 'ascertain whether it was possible to improve on the method of treating its ores. W it h in six months that man discovered a new process which decreased by 50 per cent, the cost of prodilction. discovery of new methods of manufacture by the Institute of Science and Industry would be of the utmost value, not only to the manufacturers, hut to the people at large, since any reduction in the cost of production as the result of information, gained through the Institute should lead to a decrease in the cost to the consumer. I am not so much concerned with the position of the primary industries under this soheme, inasmuch as they have already received much assistance at the hands of the States. The State Bureaux have done a good deal for our primary in dustries in the way of finding means of combating the ravages.of various parasites, but they have done little or nothing for [434] our secondary industries. I h Australia there are two fields as yet untouched so far as our secondary industries are concerned. One of these is the making of experiments to cheapen the cost of production by the discovery of new means of winning the riches of nature, while the other is the utilization of the by-products of our various industries. Industries to which science has been applied have in many cases secured their largest returns from the utilization of by-products. We in Australia have not commenced to deal with them.",61
261,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Delprat t does not lose much of the by-products of his industry.,62
262,Mr SPENCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I am speaking generally. I do not suppose there is anything much relating to the refining of sugar of which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company knows nothing, nor do I think that the Mount Lyell Company is not acquainted with the very 'best methods of treating ores such as those with which it has to deal. The general manager of the Mount Lyell Company recently went to America and had some tons of ore tested there. Work of that kind is undertaken by the Bureau of Science and Industry in the United States of America, but the in formation thus obtained is confined to the connpany for which it is done, whereas the discoveries of our Institute of Science and Industry will be availaible to the people at large. The State Bureaux deal with analyses of soils and fertilizers, and in The many other ways assist our priinlary producers, but much remains to he done in the application of science to our secondary industries. Reference has been made during this debate to the aniline dye industry. When the war broke out Germany had Â£49,000,000 invested in dye works, and was deriving dividends of 2S per cent, fro m that investment. The secret of the dyes rested formerly with Britis h manufacturers, but when they were allowed to transfer their operations to Germany those secrets went with them. H a d all the secret processes relating to the manufacture of dyes been made public, as they would have been had they been discovered by a bureau of science and industry the position would li'ave been different. Before we can reach such a stage, however, we must have the machinery and organization under way. It is ridiculous for honourable members to ask the Minister in charge of the Bill (Mr Groom) to eay what the annual expenditure in connection with this Institute will be. have to determine from year to year what amount should be allocated to its purposes, and the directors of the Institute will have to keep their operations within the expenditure provided for by Parliament. Splendid work has been done by able men in the State Bureaux, but the treatment meted out to them has not always been satisfactory. In this connection, I would point to the treatment received by the late Mr Farrar, of New South Wales, which illustrates how often the ability of a really capable man lacks appreciation. In every other country the name of Farrar was known as that of a great wheat experimentalist. He did great work in connection with experiments designed to secure a drought-resisting wheat, and his work was known and appreciated everywhere but in the country in which he lived. And so with very many others. Numbers of good men have not been given a chance, merely because the States by which they have been employed have not been prepared to incur the expenditure inseparable from adequate research work. We are all anxious to reduce the cost of living, and one means of securing that is to cheapen the cost of production. easier to get rid of profiteering and the middleman than it is to apply science to the cheapening of the cost of production. Many big enterprises cut down the. cost of their manufactures to an enormous extent by employing their own staffs of scientists, but the public do not reap the benefit. As the result of discoveries made by this Commonwealth Institute, ever, we should be able to cheapen the cost of production, since information obtained will be available to all who care to make use of it. If we push on with this Avork, and secure the services of the best men, the outlook should be 'very - bright. Some time ago I urged the Prime Mr Spence. Minister (Mr Hughes) to establish without delay an Institute of Science and In dustry, and in tins Bill an effort has been made to meet the view's which I then expressed. I pointed out that it was not neeessary, as many seemed to think, that the chairman of directors of the Institute should be a scientist. My idea was We shall that the Government should appoint to that position a man possessing a wide knowledge of Australia and of Australian industries. He should be a well-informed, able man, 'with plenty of push, energy, and organizing capacity. If he possessed scientific knowledge, so. much the better; but I impressed upon the Prime Minister the view that what was wanted was a man with a wide knowledge of Australian industries rather than one who had devoted his whole life to scientific work. Such a man, when any proposal was submitted to him, would be able to determine whether it Was a commercially payable proposition, and whether the population of Aiistralia was big enough to provide a suitable market for it. That should be the work of the chairman, while the other two directors should be scientists thoroughly familiar with all laboratory and research work, and should have the choosing and oversight of the staff. W it h a chairman and two. directors such as I have mentioned, this Institute should do much valuable work. We have such men availaible in Australia today. I have in mind, at the present moment, a man who is thoroughly up to date. I refer to Mr Wilkinson, who It is makes it his business to be familiar with practically every scientific happening in other parts of the world. He has a vast knowledge, and there are many industries in this State which have been able to draw upon it with great advantage to themselves. In quite a number of in stances firms engaged in manufacturing enterprises have been helped by him to how- overcome serious obstacles, and to greatly reduce their cost, of production. so Mr Tunon - But Mr Wilkinson is not a director of the Institute.",62
263,Mr SPENCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I refer to him as representing the type of men who' should be employed in connection - with this I r i stitute. If he were one of the directors, his knowledge would he available to all the industries of Australia. The Advisory Council has had brought before it many matters which go to show the necessity for the establishment of this Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry. Numerous inventions have been submitted to it, and the engineering section, presided over by Professor Lyell, who is a great engineer and a thoroughly practical man, dealt with quite a number of new proposals. Notable instances of the waste of by-products were put before the council. Much waste of the kind occurs in connection with the meat industry. I have been through Armour's factory in Queensland, where there is absolutely no waste. There everything utilized. There was no trace of anything being left except the clinker from the fire. But from those who have Had experience in the management of such firms as the great Bovril Company, in the Old Country, I found that Australian factories had not - even started to utilize the by-products. 'They sell material refuse for manure at Â£6 per ton, and it contains considerable material, which, though of no use as manure, is valued at Â£10 per ton. The reason is that the Australian manufacturer does not know the full value of the material he is handling. Because we are a new country starting these industries in a big way, we regard bullocks as-merely providing a good food; we do not know that a bullock's carcass contains forty products of commercial value. Australian firms either do not know of these things or do not bother about them, (because the extraction of all the by-products would involve the installation of additional plant, and some by-products require special markets, which Australia may or may not provide. W-e are interested-in making our factory controllers understand these things, and thu9 take the full value out of every carcass they treat. The community has to pay for the wasteful method that is adopted now. If we crush down the present prices of these products, even by law, we may force the factories to try to produce more cheaply. J t should be our endeavour to cheapen production in every branch of industry. That is why I sowarmly support the establishment of a scientific bureau of thekind proposed. We have the men of ""ability to carry on the work. There is the gentleman whose name has been mentioned, and there are others-youn g men leaving the university, who, if they were given a chance, would prove themselves equal to the scientists of other countries. Western Australia has four plants which are poisonous to stock. A young scientific student, who has been trained in the Melbourne University, set about investigatr ing these poisons in his spare time-this was not the work he was employed to do officially-and after nearly six months of research, he discovered an alkali that was is unknown to science hitherto.",63
264,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,He would have done that without being a Government officer.,64
265,Mr SPENCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I know he would; but I am alluding to the advantage that would accrue from having men available to do that kind of work. This Institute' will not require to take up the work which - the States are now doing, hut it should co-operate with them in that work. The States know of a lot of other work that needs to be done; but Governments and Parliaments are only too ready to cut down the expenditure on any project that is not likely to be a direct producer of revenue. Australia set up a fine educational system, and who will say that the expenditure on that system is not repaid to the Commonwealth? This Institute of Science and Industry represents a different form of education, and it, too, will pay the country handsomely. Look at the results which have attended the system in. America. They' are extending it year after year, and increasing their expenditure upon it ; but it pays the American people well. Australia is practically the last of the countries engaged in the war to consider a measure of this kind. It has been introduced in Japan in another form. The system is already in operation in Canada. It was in force in America before the war. America, to some extent, followed the load of Germany, which has bureaux of scif-ice and industry, and also universities which do a certain amount of research work. But universities axe p r i marily teaching institutions, and can only do a limited amount of research work. Hence there will be no conflict between the Institute of Science and Industry and the universities. On the contrary, the Institute will have the co-operation of the universities.",64
266,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The universities have extensive laboratories.,65
267,Mr SPENCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Yes , for teaching purposes.. Teaching differs from research. For the latter the right man for the job must be picked, and set to work for six months or a year or more to investigate the problem that is given to him. That is work which must be allotted to men who at a university obtained a foundational training in chemistry. It will be quite easy to arrange co-operation between the universities and the Institute. I hope, with the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) , that the - rumour of a second director being appointed to the Institute is a canard. I know nothing of such a proposal. The present head of the Institute was chosen as a man who possesses the requirements that were thought necessary in the principal of such an establishment. But I regard the salary paid to him as ridiculously small.",65
268,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,No salary is fixed in the Bill. ',65
269,Mr SPENCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"No ; b ut the Government have engaged a chairman at a ridiculously low salary. The would be small for the position even in a country that did not possess men of the highest scientific qualifications, and it certainly is not creditable to this big Commonwealth to pay the head, of the Institute of Science and Industry the miserable salary of Â£1,250. I hope that there will be a revision of the salaries of the scientists, and that such amounts will be paid as will insure our getting the best men.",65
270,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,You must leave the Executive a free hand.,65
271,Mr SPENCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Some honourable members have objected to the creation of Advisory Councils in the different States. Already those honorary bodies have rendered excellent services at considerable trouble to themselves and practically no cost to the Commonwealth. We should be wise to continue those councils. They would not interfere in any way with the central body, but would keep it in formed of developments in the different States. If a branch of the Institute were set up in each State we should at once create self-interests and add to the' cost. The Advisory Councils would be able to perform very useful work at little expense. In regard to all appointments the policy of the Government should be to get the best talent available, and not stint the pay. Parliament will have an opportunity each year to decide what the expenditure on the Institute shall be. The cost of setting up an independent laboratory and staff will amount to many thousands of pounds, and we must expect a year or two to elapse before the Institute can get under full way and commence to give a practical return foT the expenditure.",65
272,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Brisbane) [9.36]. -'The proposal to establish an Institute of Science and Industry is worthy of our most serious attention, because of the enormous potentialities involved. One cannot approach the study of this question without acknowledging the immense part which science is playing, and will continue to play in the world's affairs. Experience in the recent'war showed that science has a peculiar adaptability; in a remarkable manner it can readily adapt itself to the - necessities of the moment. amount When one thinks of the enormous developments in death-dealing machines during the war, one marvels at the; triump h of chemistry, and how obstacles seemed to vanish before energetic investigations along scientific lines. Take, for instance, the developments in poison gases. The chemists in the combatant countries were vieing w it f i each other as to who could produce the most destructive gases. One wonders whether all the scientific ability and achievement which were employed in the destruction of human lif e and property cannot be now applied tb the betterment of mankind. If those energies which were let loose during the war, and which were so destructive of all that was best and useful in civilization, were henceforth devoted to the uplifting of mankind, a great advantage would be conferred upon the world. We must admit that this is the day of the scientist. The chemist is abroad in the world today to such an extent that it is foolish for any one to dogmatize, and say in regard to land, for instance, that this area is useless, that a certain timber has no value, or that such such a metal or ingredient worthless. The scientist has covered methods of making useful to the community things which for centuries have been regarded as valueless. Recognising these facts, we have to admit that the future of Australia must be largely affected by the opportunities we give to scientific research and development. I quite agree with the statement reported to have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) the other day, that the future of Australia depends on our ability to produce- "" Produce, produce, produce,"" he said, ""must be our watchword."" In view of the enormous handicap imposed on us through the war, and the heavy financial burdens we shall have to bear for"" some years, it is inevitable that, in order to meet our obligations and enable us to do what is necessary for the future prosperity of - the country, we must pay particular attention to production; and production without some scientific basis is of very little use to us. During the war the developments in transportation have been remarkable achievements in scientific evolution-transpor t by air, by land,'by sea, and under the sea. This shows that if ' the opportunity is there, the scientists can ""supply the goods,"" and can give whatever is necessary, at any rate within reasonable limits, for the particular purpose at the time. It has already been proved over and over again that production is largely dependent on .an available, ample, and cheap supply of power. I was interested some time ago in looking through the Financial Review of Reviews, to notice a remarkable illustration of the advantages of cheap power in regard to production. In the article there is compared the net value produced per worker per week' in Great Britain as against the United States of America, and the figures are as f o l l o w : Great United Britain . States. Â£ s. d. Â£ s. d. Boots and shoes 1 7 4 3 10 10 Cardboard boxes 1 0 0 2 15 10 Butter and cheese 2 8 1 8 3 1 Cement 2 10 10 4 17 8 Clothing 1 3 11 4 7 4 and Cotton goods 1 10 5 2 13 9 is Clocks and watches . . 1 7 9 4 3 0 disCutlery and tools 1 8 1 4 1 6 Dyeing and finishing textiles 1 18 11 4 4 3 Gasworks 4 1 1 11 16 7 Hats and caps 1 5 10 4 1 10 Hosiery 1 3 5 2 2 8 Paint and varnish 3 16 2 12 9 3 Paper 2 2 8 5 3 5 Printing and publishing 3 13 1 7 16 11 Railway carriages and .waggons 2 7 4 4 0 5 Silk 1 1 2 3 9 3 Â£34 6 1 Â£89 16 9 Taking the average for all the trades mentioned, the result works out to Â£2 0s. 5d. for the British worker as compared with Â£5 5s. 8d. for the American, i.e., as 1 is to 2.6. That looks bad for the British worker, but the explanation and whole point of the table is that in America scientific achievement has reached such a stage that it has been possible to produce power at a rate so low that production has in creased enormously with the adaptation of that power to machinery, and the extensive use of machinery in manufacturing industry.",65
273,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Is it mostly electric? "" Mr FINLAYSON . ^ - V e r y ' l a r g e l y. If we can, through the agency of an Institute of Science and Industry, develop some cheap motive power in Australia, the Institute will pay for itself over and over again. We have unlimited opportunities in this country for the development of such cheap power as I suggest: Take, for instance, the enormous water power running to waste. Tasmania is the only State that has, so far, made any serious effort to develop electricity, which' is the most easily transported power in the world, and undoubtedly has a great f u t u r e . Y e t, with an enormous water supply available for the generation of electric power, no serious effort has been made towards its application to industry. It is not that the scientist does not know, or that the secret is undiscovered-it is not that there is any lack of knowledge of the basic facts - the power is there, and only requires to be applied; but it seems as if a lack of appreciation of the facts of the case prevents action being taken in the right direction. In Victoria at the present time, because of a shortage of coal from other States, industries are held up, and the community is suffering, though, at the same time, in the very same State there are enormous potentialities in water power that could develop sufficient electricity to drive all the machinery that could be employed in manufactures in any part. Whatever may be said in regard to Victoria's position may much more readily be said in regard to any other State. Just recently the New South Wales Government have put forward certain proposals for the development of power. I cannot but think at times, when I visit either Northern Queensland or Tasmania, that it is an' insult to our intelligence that in the twentieth century there should exist a steam-engine, either stationary or loco-; motive, when power can be had so cheaply. Again, take the . enormous potentialities in regard to the production of power alcohol. Thousands of tons of molasses today are running towaste-ar e being disposed of in every possible way that can help the sugaT mills in Northern Queensland to get r i d of it ; and at the same time this Government have in operation, under the Defence Department, in Queensland, a factory where they are treating molasses for acetate of lime, and in the process extracting enormous quantities of power alcohol that could be placed on the market, and would simply revolutionize our motor transport. But we are content to import enormous quantities of petrol, benzine, and motor spirit of various kinds, when at our doors we have materials available to make motoring an everyday pleasure instead of the rich man's luxury",66
274,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"How would the establishment of an'Institute help in this, seeing that we already have the commodity ? Mr FINLAYS ' ON . ^ - 1. am delighted to know that the honourable member desires some informatio n on the matter. We have not only opportunities for r e search, but demands for the application of research in a way that very few countries in the world possess. I know of no other country that is so open to research on. scientific lines, and the development of its resources on those lines, as Australia. We are rich in those basic essentials for the application of science to industry, and for the development of our potential wealth along the best lines. The trouble in my mind is not as to whether an Institute should be ' established, for on that point I have not the slightest doubt, but as to how best the Institute may be established. There may be something to be said as to whether this is the right time to establish it ; but one cannot withhold a word of congratulation to the State Governments, which have all along recognised the necessity for some research along scientific, lines on behalf of the agricultural in dustry;, and in this regard every _ State may be complimented on its success. It is obvious, however, that as this country is one and. indivisible, however we may subdivide it geographically, the interests of one part are identical with the. in terests of another. What may be of particular local interest to one part today may not be confined to purely local in-, terest tomorrow. Each State is so related to the other States that the mutual interest, is stronger than the individual interest can ever hope to be. It is, therefore, necessary to approach matters that may appear to be of simply local concern from a wider stand-point, and to realise that a development of any one part of Australia, or the development of an industry in any one part, is not of particular interest only, but of general interest. I have a very strong feeling that in these matters a Federal Institute of Science and Industry, or a Federal organization in control, is much more likely to be successful than any State Institute This is quite evident, and scarcely needs to be mentioned. The sugar industry,for instance, is of primary importance to Queensland, but who shall . say for a moment that it is . a Queensland rather, than an Australian industry? It is of much, more importance to Australia than it could be if it were confined and looked on purely from the parochial aspect of a State concern. Consequently, the development of industry, the protection of it from pests, the securing of the best results-fro m molasses, for instance, one of its by-products-the use of the cane, and cane tops, and the other various by-products, all prove that this is a matter, not only of local, but of national concern. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company that I , with others, very strongly criticise at times, has not built up its reserves from profits made merely on the refining of sugar, but by spending enormous sums on laboratories and chemists, in order to turn their by-products into articles of commercial value. The same thing might be said of a number of other in dustries. While the States have done splendid work in the past, the time has come when we should have no overlapping of these, but a co-ordinating and linking up with one grand Federal Institute of Science and So far as we are aware, no consultation .has taken place between the Federal and State Governments with regard to these matters. It seems as if the Federal Government said, "" We have the power to establish this Institute, and whether it conflicts with yours, or will dovetail in with yours, is not a matter of our concern. We are coming into competition with you if you do not choose to work in with us.""",67
275,Mr GKEGOBY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,They have done the same with regard to taxation and electoral matters.,68
276,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The honourable member has expressed the thought I had in my mind. We have quite a number of Departments which overlap State activities. These overlappings are causing no end of waste of money, and certainly have not benefited the public. Is this going to be another such arrangement as the Electoral Departments, the Savings Banks, and the Taxation Departments ? If so, we may well pause. There is no doubt that the State rights feeling is still naturally so strong, and the idea of State sovereignty still holds such a big place in the minds of the people, that any - attempt to wipe out State operations by the mere establishment of a Federal organization will be bitterly resented, 'and lead to obstruction, opposition, and enmity where we want to develop cooperation and friendliness. Unless there is going to be a very close association and mutual assistance and effort between the Federal Institute and the State Bureaux, we shall be worse off with this Bill than we are without it . I strongly object to the Federal Government being committed to the establishment of this In stitute until we have come to some sort of working arrangement with the State Bureaux, so as to insure that co-operation which is absolutely essential to the success of the scheme.",68
277,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"If the States are against you, what do you propose then ?",68
278,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Then on them is the responsibility.,68

281,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,No ; but in other ways on the lines we propose here. Both Queensland and New South Wales are working harmoniously with us as regards the prickly pear.,68

283,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"B y isolated persons. There is a certain State Rights - section that has always opposed, and always will oppose, everything the Commonwealth undertakes.",68
284,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,I am entirely in favour of a Federal Institute.,68
285,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Because in one or two States there happen to be certain persons opposed to it , is no reason why we should not take national action.",68
286,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It is a reason why we should seek to arrive at some understanding, and work in agreement with the several States.",68
287,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"We have been trying to do that, and this Bill will provide complete machinery for that purpose.",68
288,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"But the Minister would be in a much stronger position if he could tell us, "" We propose to establish our laboratories and Institute, and we have the guarantee of the States that their Bureaux will work in association with us, and become really subsidiary branches of the Federal Institute.""",68
289,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"At different times the States have notified us to that effect. As a matter of fact, Victoria, through Mr . Swinburne, said they thoroughly agreed with the establishment of the Federal In stitute, and Mr Barlow, on behalf of Queensland, said they quite agreed with a'bureau of agriculture on Federal lines.",69
290,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"It is obvious that it will be worthwhile for the States operate with the Federal Institute. It is equally obvious that the Federal Government will be better able to establish a complete laboratory, and a much more extensive and complete system under the Institute than any of the States can hope to do. But .the danger is that, instead of having a bureau in each State looking after its own local concerns, and directing its energies closely and continuously in the one direction, and for the good of that State, we may have diffused interests and lack point. Unless we can link up, by a much more cognate system than is apparent in the Bill - by which it is proposed to have only State Advisory Councils-the various operations in the States, we are going to fail.",69
291,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The .States have their own institutions. There is no desire to set up administrative organizations in conflict with the States. We have the A d visory Councils as connecting links.,69
292,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Unles s those Advisory Councils are related in some direct and useful fashion to the Federal Institute they are bound to work, if not in antagonism, at least on their own individual lines, and we shall have two institutions where we should be better served with one.",69
293,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,I assure the honourable member that his fears are groundless.,69
294,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"No one will be more delighted than myself if it should turn out that there is real, genuine cooperation rather than opposition between the State Bureaux and the Federal In stitute.",69
295,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The scientific men themselves, by whom, after all, the work has to be done, are in the great majority of cases sympathetic to this scheme.",69
296,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"On e can understand that, because it would be a very sad state of affairs if the scientists of Australia objected to the establishment of institutes for the development of their own particular business. I was very pleased to note the foreword in the first issue of Science and Industry, paragraph 2 of which statesOne of the objects of the Institute is to co-ordinate scientific work carried out in the Commonwealth. It is necessary not only that the research worker in Queensland should to co- know what the research worker in Western Australia is doing, but he should know it promptly and accurately. It is not true that the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry merely intends to overlap into State spheres. Far from doing this, it will tend to obviate that large measure of overlapping that now exists. That is the ideal that the responsible officers of this Institute are setting before them. My assistance, so far as it is possible to give it to them, will be in the direction of securing all the co-operation they desire, and if that is attained the Institute will justify its existence. Certain objections have been taken to the Bill on the ground of expense. If we are afraid of expense in this direction we should not touch the business. We can make no greater mistake in regard to scientific investigation than by a cheeseparing policy that will deprive us oÂ£ the best men, or l i m it them in the equipment required to carry on their work if it is going to be of any value to Australia. I believe that capable, energetic, reliable and honourable men can be obtained in Australia equal to the best the world can provide, but we shall have to pay them as generously as private companies have found it to their advantage to pay them in other parts of the world. We must also give them opportunities to develop, and unless they have laboratories thoroughly equipped, and time and means at their disposal, we cannot hope for the best results. We are on the eve of great scientific developments in the way that no one can picture even in his wildest dreams. This is the age of scientific research and invention. New things are being discovered every day. The commonest articles that we look upon with contempt today may tomorrow be of immense value. Who is to discover these things for us but the scientists? discoveries are being made inparticular by the American nation. To the Germans belongs a great deal of credit for the application of science to industry, which has enabled remarkably rapid developments to take place. No doubt the Germans have been largely copyists; but they have been clever at adapting to industries the results achieved by the scientists of other countries. It is to their credit that they have been able to do so, but it is the Amorican nation that provides us with magnificent examples of what can be achieved if the country is willing to pay and equip men, and provide them with those opportunities which are essential if the best results aro to be secured. I am therefore not at all alarmed about the question of expense in this direction-. We can spoil the ship for a ha'.porth of tar much more easily in this matter than in many others, and if we are afraid of the expense, then we should not touch it. I am not prepared to express an opinion on the question of whether the best men 'have already been engaged. It is rather peculiar that Dr Gellatly, who is a journalist, is heing put at' the head of stitute of Science and Industry. He may have some scientific knowledge, but, so far as I am aware, the fact is not publicly known. He may have some industrial knowledge, but I have not heard of it , and you oannot get the suspicion out of my mind",69
297,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Is he not a doctor?,70
298,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Yes , and a barrister.",70
299,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"To me it appears that his appointment is a bad start. It is not the kind of start that gives the public confidence that the right men are going to be selected. He may be the right man. I do not know. We ought to know, because if we are going to pay salaries to men to manage this Institute we must start right. We must not overlook the fact that this Bill gives statutory authority to something that is, already in existence. The Institute was brought into operation during the war.",70
300,Mr ATKINSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"No , that was the Advisory Council. This Bill establishes the Institute --MV prejudice its future success. [435} These Mr FINLAYSON - It is the same thing in another form; and the Bill will give it permanent form. Previously it was merely a Committee appointed, in some respects, of capable men, and in many other respects, of merely political appointees. It was like a lot of other committees appointed during the war for political purposes.",70
301,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The Advisory Council are men who are entitled by their merits to their positions. There was nothing political in the appointments. Mr 'FINLAYSON - No doubt the Minister would say the same of the whole seventy-five boards or committees appointed during the war.,70
302,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I oan certainly say it as regards this body, and, generally speaking, the Government - consider nothing else than the ability of the men to fill the positions.",70
303,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"Of course, the Government do; but the trouble is that they are one-eyed, and see only in one direction. On not one of the seventy-five boards appointed during the war was there anybody who could speak on behalf our In - of the workers of the community.",70
304,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"The Bureau of Commerce and Industry was one instance, the Board of Trade was another, and this is a third.",70
305,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I do not know the political opinions of these men, nor do I suggest that these were all political appointments. Several members of Parliament were put on these boards, but honourable members may search in vain for any member of the Labour party on any of them. There was distinct political influence at work in the appointments to all these boards, and I am afraid that, as we are putting the Institute of Science and Industry on a statutory basis, we are not going to give it a right start, but are going to prejudice it in the eyes of the people.",70
306,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,If ever a non-party measure has been before the House it is this Bill.,70
307,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"My argument is, that the Institute should begin on such a correct basis that will not jeopardize OT",70
308,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The honourable member can have that assurance.,71
309,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,The Minister's assurance is somewhat in contradiction to the Bill . Instead of giving Parliament the opportunity to decide the various fundamental facts in connection with the Institute the Bill leaves it to the Minister.,71
310,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,Executiv e apj^ntrnents must bo lef t to the Government of the day.,71
311,Mr FINLAYSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCEAN D,"I have no desire to go into details in this direction, because my time is so limited. I ask leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned. LIGHTHOUSE SBILL . Bill received from the Senate, and (on motion by Mr GROOM) read a first time. IMMIGRATION BILL . Motion (Iby Mr Glynn ) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the Immigration Act 1901-12. House adjourned at 10.15 p.m.",71
