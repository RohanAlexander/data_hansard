1,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"A constituent of mine has written to complain that he has been asked to pay duty on tissue paper used for the making of paper patterns. Is it a fact that, in spite of the determination of this Parliament that tissue paper for paper patterns should be admitted free, attempts are being made by officials of the Customs Department to impose duties on paper for patterns on the flimsy pretext that such papers contain an infinitesimal amount of grease, which competent authorities state it is absolutely impossible to eliminate in its manufacture?- Will the Minister see that bond fide importers of paper for patterns are not harassed by vexatious interference and compelled to pay duty on' articles which Parliament has declared are to be admitted free of duty?",11
2,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I shall be obliged if the honourable member will let me have the letter, to which he has referred. .Paper is one of the most difficult commodities with which the Customs Department is concerned. The Department is dealing with a similar matter at the present time. MONO-RAIL SYSTEM.",11
3,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"A day or two ago I asked a question in regard to the experiments which are being conducted to determine the value of Mr Brennan's monorail system, and was informed that the Minister would be in a position to give me an answer in a few days. Can he do so now?",11
4,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The late Government, before replying to Mr Brennan's offer, desired the examination of his patent, and a report upon it by Sir A. H. Rendel, the consulting engineer to the Indian State railways, and Mr Brereton, the Government director of the Indian railways. According to a cablegram recently received from Captain CollinsDemonstration insufficient f o i positive opinion as to theultimate success of system, but tests warrant completion car and continuance of experiments. Further financial assistance from India office not advised, as all money available required for pressing needs Indian railway. Brennan anxious about decision Commonwealth on offer by the end of year, when present money exhausted. Whether Parliament should be asked to authorize expenditure in this connection is a question still under the consideration of Ministers. DEFENCE STORES BRANCH .",11
5,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"On behalf of the honourable member for Brisbane, I wish to know from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence if he is yet in possession of the information promised as to alleged maladministration in connection with the Ordnance Stores Branch of the Department ?",12
6,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"F u l l inquiry has been made, and it has been found that the statements are to a certain extent correct. The work was, however, carried out a considerable period ago, and the practice has been discontinued for some time; in fact, the time sheets from ist January to 7th July, 1908, only show a total of eleven hours so occupied, and there has been no work of the kind done since the latter date. Instructions have been issued to the Department concerned that the regulations are to be strictly adhered to in every respect, and that no work of a private nature is to be undertaken under any pretext whatever. Colonel Stanley further states- 1. It may be mentioned that on some few occasions the effects of officers in transfer to this State have been temporarily stored in sheds under Ordnance control, but I do not regard this accommodation as private work performed by the Department. 2. Orders have been issued that no private work of any kind is to be done for officers in the future without direct approval from the Military Board. I will lay the rest of the information in my possession on the table of the Library, where it can be perused by honourable members. "" SELEC T COMMITTEE ON NA AND DRILLS.",12
7,Mr MCDONALD,STRIPPER HARVESTERS,"As Mr Lennon, by twice refusing to give evidence asked for by the Harvester Committee, has treated that body and the Parliament with contempt, will the Prime Minister immediately take steps to convert the Committee into a Royal Commission, so'that it may be [99]- 2 armed with the power to compel witnesses to give the information for which it seeks? The matter is one which might well be treated as a question of urgency and privilege ; but I do not propose to deal with it in that way.",12
8,Mr FISHER,STRIPPER HARVESTERS,"The Government has given attention to the matter, and the powers necessary to enable the Committee to obtain the evidence which Parliament has instructed it to obtain will be furnished, either by enlarging its privileges, or by converting it into a Royal Commission. BUNBURYRIFLERANG E.",12
9,Sir JOHN FORREST,STRIPPER HARVESTERS,"Can the Minister of Home Affairs expedite the work, on the rifle range at Bunbury, for which Â£ 3 5 0 was voted in the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Act recently passed. Both the late Minister of Defence and the late Minister of Home Affairs promised that this should be done; but I have been informed by a telegram, which I sent on to the present Minister, that no action has yet been taken.",12
10,Mr MAHON,STRIPPER HARVESTERS,"I have not seen the telegram; but shall make inquiries, to ascertain the cause of the delay.",12
11,Sir JOHN FORREST,STRIPPER HARVESTERS,I sent the telegram some days ago. IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION.,12
12,Dr MALONEY,STRIPPER HARVESTERS,"Tw o or three weeks ago I read a letter which I had received from a Britisher whose father and grandfather were Britishers, and whose mother was born in Jamaica, complaining that he was being kept on board the German mail steamer Bremen. According to Truth, this man is a good unionist, a competent workman, an engineer, and a Freemason. As this man has British blood through his father and grandfather, I desire to ask the Minister that he may be permitted to stay in the Commonwealth.",12
13,Mr BATCHELOR,STRIPPER HARVESTERS,The application has already been granted. QUEENSLAND - SOU TH NA CONNEXIO N.,12
14,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN TELEGRAPH,"I understand that, prior to Federation, there were negotiations between the Governments of South Australia and Queensland with a view to connecting Hergott Springs with Boulia, vid Birdsville, by telegraph. As the Sydney ;to Brisbane telegraph line is very much - congested, and a line such as I have mentioned would relieve the pressure of work - on it considerably, will the Postmaster General have inquiry made as to the possibility of connecting those two townships?",12
15,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN TELEGRAPH,"I shall be glad to have .a report made on the question. AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, AND PACIFIC ISLANDS : TELEGRAPH CONNEXION.",13
16,Mr MCDOUGALL,AUSTRALIAN TELEGRAPH,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been called to the following published statement:An important scheme for linking Australia , and New Zealand with many of the Pacific Islands has received the preliminary approval of the Commonwealth Prime Minister. . . . The scheme is the child of an English Syndicate, the Pacific Islands Radio Telegraph Company, whose representative, Mr Hamilton, had several interviews with Mr Deakin when he was in Melbourne. The plan's of the Syndicate are comprehensive. . . . are the promoters of success, that they propose to have the installations made early in January, rgog. Is the Commonwealth backing up schemes promoted by (British syndicates with funds; and, if so, to what extent? Further, will the Prime Minister lay the papers in connection with the matter upon the table of the House?",13
17,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN TELEGRAPH,"No such papers have - come before me, nor do I know of anysuch official promise. What the honourable member states may be correct, and I shall be glad to look at the papers in order to ascertain the facts. I do' not think the Commonwealth will support cate scheme when there are so many opportunities of entering into national or internumber national undertakings. NA FISHERIES.",13
18,Mr BAMFORD,PEAR L AN D BECHE DE MER,"the Minister of External Affairs, upon notice I. Whether the Government has arrived at anv decision concerning the granting of permits for the introduction of divers and tenders for the pearl fishing industry. If so, will the Minister inform the House as to what action is being taken? 2. Can the Minister say whether or not it was contemplated, when permits have been granted for the indenting of divers and tenders as aforesaid, to allow the men thus introduced to engage in the beche de mer fishery, which is an industry quite distinct from the pearl fishing? 3. If it was not so intended, what, if any, action will be taken to prevent men indented as divers and tenders drifting into the beche de mer fishing business?",13
19,Mr BATCHELOR,PEAR L AN D BECHE DE MER,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :r. On the receipt of the report of the Queensland Royal Commission which inquired into the pearling industry, the States interested, Queensland, Western Australia, and South Australia, were communicated with in order to learn what steps they proposed taking to carry out the recommendations of the Commission which had for their object the substitution of white for coloured divers, and which depended ""on State rather than Commonwealth action. No replies have been received, but in the meantime the existing practice has received my attention, ancl rules have been laid down which, while permitting the continuance of the industry on existing lines, impose additional safeguards against any increase of the number of aliens engaged, and against any diversion of indented aliens to other industries than pearling. 2. It was not contemplated that indented aliens should be allowed to engage in the beche de mer industry, and the bond given by So sanguine the employers refers only to vessels engaged in pearl-fishing. 3. Inquiries will at once be made to ascertain how far the aliens allowed to be introduced for pearling have drifted into the beche de mer industry with a view to putting a stop to the practice.

28,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the amount of business - transacted at the Post Office, Wollongong, entitles that office to be graded higher than at present ? 2. If so, will he take the necessary steps to have it put on the proper grade?",14
29,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Public Service Commissioner furnishes the following answers to the honourable member's questions :1.

33,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Nepean) [2.39] - I the think the whole Chamber is convinced of the necessity for more population in Australia. My idea is that the Defence problem will be solved rather by a proper migration and the filling up of the vacant areas of our great country than by any other scheme that can be proposed.,15
34,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I have repeatedly called honourable members to order for versing in a loud tone. It is not sible for me to hear the honourable member who is addressing the Chair.,15
35,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I rose to call attention to the proposed vote of Â£ 7 5 0 in respect the New Hebrides, and to express the hope that the item will not again appear on the Estimates. I do so not because of anv want of sympathy with British settlers the New Hebrides, but because when the Tariff was under consideration we had a expenditure ? distinct promise that the House would be invited to deal with a preferential Tariff in respect of their products.",15
36,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,And the draft Tariff is now among the departmental papers.,15
37,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It has not been put before the House, and we have not had opportunity to express an opinion upon I hope that before next year's Estimates are submitted, British settlers in the Hebrides will have received better treatour ment, and that, as promised, this House will have had an opportunity to pass a preferential Tariff in respect of their produce. It is absolutely impossible for them up our lands. at present to compete on equal terms with the French settlers. The latter, have what is practically an open market. Their ducts are received into New Caledonia other French possessions free of any duty or charge, and they are also carried at prerespect, ferential rates on French steamers. British settlers in the New Hebrides are greatly handicapped by the fact that they have pay full freights, and that we impose 'their products the same duties as are levied in respect of imports from foreign countries. As to the proposed vote of Â£ 6 5 0 in respect of the collection of tralian historical records. I should like to know what action is being taken by Government. Last year we voted a similar amount, but only Â£ 1 4 4 was expended. There can be no doubt that the historical records of the Commonwealth ought to be collected and codified. The Government of New South Wales has spent some thousands of pounds in collecting, codifying and publishing, for the public benefit, early records of that State; but as the early history of New South Wales is really the early history of Australia, there is a feeling that the work should be undertaken system of imby the Commonwealth.",15
38,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We are co-operating with New South Wales. That is why this amount appears on the Estimates.,15
39,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am glad to have that conassurance, and hope that the collection posof these historical documents will be continued. I should like to have some information as to the proposed vote of Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 towards the expenses of press representaof tives to the Congress of Chambers of Commerce. How is the money to be disbursed, and amongst whom it is to be distributed? It is apparently a new and a non-recurring in item, and I should certainly like to know what object is to be served by the proposed",15
40,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wimmera) [2.55] Last year a sum of Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 was voted for the purpose of advertising the resources of Australia, but only Â£ 3 ,'946 was expended. I understand that this year Â£ 4 , 0 0 0 has already been expended under this headan ing; but that, to my mind, is altogether it . inadequate. We could not be called upon 1 to discuss a question of greater importance New to Australia than is that of advertising resources in the Old Country with a view of attracting to our shores a class of people who will help to still further develop them..",15
41,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Excep t that of opening,",15
42,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No question has been paltered with to a greater extent since the proinauguration of the Commonwealth. If and the Commonwealth Parliament is to have a proper conception of its duties in this it must agree to an expenditure, not merely of Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, but of aconsiderably larger sum in this direction, to and steps must also be taken to offer other upon inducements to the people at Home to emigrate to Australia. We cannot hope to properly advertise our resources in Great Britain* until a High Commissioner is appointed. AusUrfortunately that appointment has been delayed, but the discussion which took place the on the item relating to the retention of Captain Collins in London must have deemonstrated to the Government the fact that - honourable members generally recognise, that the High Commissioner Bill should be passed without delay. We have from time to time discussed the question of advertising in the Old World, and a great deal of information on the subject has been collected, so that it cannot be said that the delay in taking proper steps to make known our resources there has been due to a failure on the part of the House to recognise the - urgent necessity of attracting suitable immigrants. When last year's Estimates were under consideration the honourable member for Parramatta pointed out that the population of Australia was increasing by - only about 2 per cent, per annum, ancl that if the population of Asia 'continued to increase by about 1 per - cent, we should soon have not less than 1,800,000,000 Asiatics within a few davs' - sail of the Commonwealth. At present - about two-thirds of the world's population is in Asia, within a few clays of the Australian coast, and the honourable member for Parramatta pointed out that at its present - rate of increase that population would - double itself in something like sixty years. I agree with the honourable member for Scuth Sydney, that the question of immigration is inextricably interwoven with that ""-of land settlement. We cannot afford to ignore that fact; and if the Commonwealth Parliament is really anxious to people the great empty spaces of Australia it can do a' great deal not only by advertising our resources abroad, but by making some provision for those who come here. ithe northern States of Australia are, I understand, already making land available for immigrants; and, in this connection, I - see no reason why the Commonwealth should not have taken over the Northern 'Territory before now. I was in that part of Australia about eighteen months ago; and I am satisfied that there is room for millions of people, if proper public works are undertaken.",15
43,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What would the people do there?,16
44,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,They would - enter into different classes of agriculture.,16
45,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I should be sorry for them !,16
46,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is extraordinary that India, with something like one-third - of the area of Australia, carries a population of 300,000,000, although the rainf all for the most part is very scanty.",16
47,Dr LIDDELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is the honourable member in favour of introducing an Indian population into Australia?,16
48,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I am not.,16
49,Dr LIDDELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Indian s can live where white men cannot.,16
50,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There has been no proof, so far, that, under proper sanitary and other safeguards, the white man is not able to live in any part of the world where a coloured man can live. In India, at the present time, there are something like 53,000,000 acres of irrigated land, which carry about two-thirds of the population.",16
51,Dr WILSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Would it not pay better to have the irrigated lands on the Murray ?,16
52,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I admit that that is where irrigation should be. tried first; but, while the Commonwealth has control over the rivers, so far as navigation is concerned, it has no control over the lands.",16
53,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We have not the Himalayas.,16
54,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Quite so; but, at the same time, we are not making proper use of the lands we have along the Murray. I submit that an opportunity is now presented of making a start in the way of bringing people from the Old Country, and settling them in the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth has control over the navigation of the Murray and other large rivers in the eastern States; and, according to one engineering authority, there are about 50,000,000 acres,; which, with sufficient Some of water supply, could be successfully settled and irrigated. It is the duty of this Parliament to see whether, under the powers of sections 98 and 100 of the Constitution, a report cannot be procured as to the expediency and practicability of making these waters available for irrigation.",16
55,Dr WILSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There is already in existence an excellent report in regard to the Murray, and also as to the locking of the Darling.",16
56,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But Ave require something more comprehensive and up to date from an irrigation stand-point. There is at present an official in Victoria who, if he were assigned the duty, along with, perhaps, engineers from New South Wales and South Australia, could submit a comprehensive report on the whole question of our taking over the large inland rivers for navigation purposes. I admit that the fees from the navigation control would not recompense the Government for the expenditure, but the utilization of the waters for irrigation would bring wealth to Australia. If we have to wait until such time as this question can be tackled as one of national policy we shall have to wait for a long period. There have been attempts by the States to arrive at some kind of agreement, but they have failed during the last few years.",16
57,Dr WILSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member not think that South Australia is asking too much?,17
58,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is a State matter, which I do not care to discuss. I am satisfied that if we, as a Parliament, have the rights-and I believe we have-to cope with this great national question, we ought to take some steps to prevent this waste of water, representing millions and tens of millions of wealth. ""  ber does not wish the Commonwealth to take this matter in hand? If the States cannot agree amongst themselves, how can we step in ?",17
59,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"W can step in under sections 98 and 100 of the Constitution, which, after full and exhaustive gave the Commonwealth full powers over the navigation of the rivers.",17
60,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That would have been done, but for the jealousy of the honourable member's own State.",17
61,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am not talking in the interests of any particular State, but in the interests of Australia; and I think we ought to have some scheme for the locking of the rivers. To return to the question of immigration, I find that, as far back as September, 1905, Mr Coghlan, the eminent statistician, who is now, I understand. Agent-General for New South Wales, issued an able and comprehensive report, in which he showed that the disadvantageous position of Australia was partly due to distance from the Old World, and partly to ignorance of our resources, and misrepresentation by the London press.. ignorance and misrepresentation, Mr. Coghlan said, it was impossible to combat under existing conditions, and he contrasted the loyalty of the Canadian representatives in London with the disloyalty of some of those from Australia, who ought to have had more to say for the country that had served them so well. The pre-eminent position of Canada, Mr Coghlan pointed out, was largely due to the fact that there is one great central power in the person of the High Commissioner as regards the matter of advertising the Dominion. Under the Canadian system, the High Commissioner is the directing force. He has received the hearty support of the provinces, which have contributed large sums for the advertising of their resources, and the co-operation of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. Being looked upon as the representative of the Dominion, he has not aroused provincial jealousies, and, as the result, hundreds of thousands of valuable immigrants have gone to Canada.",17
62,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is a pity that that immigration was overdone.,17
63,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That has been sufficiently explained by Lord Strathcona, whosays that those unable to find work have been mostly persons sent out by charitable institutions, unfitted to cope with theconditions which prevail. Mr Coghlan also pointed out that the Canadian exhibits always make a respectable show at fairs and exhibitions in London and large provincial centres, because they are classed together as Canadian exhibits, and not as the separate exhibits of the various e discussion, Canadian provinces.",17
64,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"At the Franco-British Exhibition, this year, Canada had one set of exhibits, while Australia was represented by the separate exhibits of the various States.",17
65,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Mr Coghlan has stated, as the result of his observation at Home, and his knowledge of our resources,, that if Australian exhibits were shown under one authority, they would make a finer display than those of any other part of the world. It has been said that the success of our immigration movement will depend upon the action that the States take in providing land for settlers. There is a great deal in that contention. We should be in a position to make known the fact that work and land will befound for those who come here. Land That occupation is a matter which is controlled by the Governments of the States; but we might have made more effort to induce them to f all into line with us, and could have done a good deal by appointing n Royal Commissioner, and providing alt machinery necessary for the proper advertisement of Australian resources.",17
66,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The late Government undertook to advertise, free of cost to the States, whatever land they would place at our disposal, and to ask Parliament to consider means for bringing immigrants here.",17
67,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,But the States would not do anything.,18
68,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No .,18
69,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We must put our own House into order before blaming the States.,18
70,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Queenslan d alone has done more than the Commonwealth to bring immigrants to Australia.,18
71,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Accordin g to Mr. Coghlan, those who went to Canada in the year in which immigration was the largest were chiefly farm labourers. The free land which is offered as an inducement for immigration is from 40 to 50 miles from a railway. He points out that, whereas in Canada the wages paid to a farm labourer vary from 14s. to 16s. a week, here they vary from 15s. to Â£ 1 a week.",18
72,Dr WILSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,They are higher than that.,18
73,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"What a farm labourer earns in Australia depends largely on his qualifications. Mr Coghlan was writing in 1905. To show the result of systematic advertising, he points out that the immigrants to Canada, in 1897, numbered 21,000; in 1898, 31,000; in 1899, 4.4,000; in 1900, 48,000; in 1901, 49,000 ; in 1902, 67,000; in 1903, 128,000; in 1904, 130,000; and in 1905, 200,000. He says that if Australia opened up her lands, she could offer much larger inducements to immigration than Canada can give.",18
74,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In Queensland 10,000,000 or 11,000,000 acres are awaiting selection.",18
75,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,But no reasonable effort is being made to put men on the land.,18
76,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Nonsense .,18
77,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"To show the value of immigration, Mr Coghlan points out that it has been estimated that every immigrant to the Dominion brings on the average Â£ 1 0 0 in cash, and thus in 1905 the wealth of the country was directly augmented by Â£20,000,000. Moreover, economists say that every able-bodied man is worth at least Â£20 0 to a community before he commences to work. Thus immigration not only increases the population available for the consumption of local products and for defence, but also the number of workers, while it adds directly to the wealth of the nation by the money actuallv brought by the immigrants. In the light of these figures, what risk would we incur if we at once took over the Northern Territory, and liberally spent money on public works there? We have an opportunity thus to show our earnestness about making land available for immigration.",18

79,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No . It is chiefly gravel and desert.,18
80,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It would be much more suitable. In Canada, settlement has extended to districts where the ground, for three or four months in the year, is covered with snow; but during my visit to the Northern Territory, I found that those who had been there longest had most to sav in favour of the country. The late Prime Minister, commenting on Mr Coghlan's report, spoke of it as interesting, and likely to be practically useful; but we are still awaiting the exemplification of the fact. He also spoke of the way in which Canada advertises its resources by the circulation of illustrated books and other means of information in the United States and Great Britain. He said that he was filled with admiration of the resource displayed by the Canadians in advertising a country which is not more worthy of advertisement than is Australia. Last year, Â£20,000 was voted to advertise our resources, and only Â£3,900 was spent, and this year, although another Â£20,000 is asked for, the Minister of External Affairs says that not more than Â£10,000 will be spent.",18

83,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The insular, conservative policy of the Labour Party in respect to immigration will, if followed for a few years more, cause that party to disappear. The late Prime Minister, speaking in this Chamber in March last, said that the advertisement of Australia at Home was a great and ambitious enterprise, which, though costly, must be undertaken, unless we as a nation were to cease to be. He also said that next year he would lay a scheme before Parliament, and hinted that if the Premiers of the States failed to come to an agreement with him, it might be necessary to appeal to the people for an amendment of the Constitution to enable us to give effect to a comprehensive immigration policy. What has been done? Our population between 1901 and 1905 increased by only 278,000 persons. As our progress is only at a snail's pace, we must not be surprised if some day the nations who occupy territory close to our borders claim lands which we have proved ourselves incapable of developing. I hope that the Government will take notice of what is said on the subject, that a scheme will be. inaugurated for future development, and that the question of taking over the Northern Territory will be brought before the House for discussion at an early date. I hope the Minister will also take into consideration the question of placing before Parliament a full and comprehensive report as to the practicability of locking our great inland streams, as we are entitled to do by the Constitution, as an evidence that we desire to do our best to bring the land there under cultivation if the States themselves are paltering with the problem and failing to carry out their duty in that respect. I trust the Minister will give us information regarding the contribution towards the funds of the Antarctic expedition under Lieutenant Shackleton.",18
84,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That money has been spent. There is no such item this year.,19

If any item should be wiped out, this is it. Last year Â£20,000 was voted for the purpose and onlya small portion was spent. We are assured that this year the Government will not be able to expend much more. The reason is that the 'Commonwealth Government is not really able to offer to the people of the Old World any share in the resources of the Commonwealth. This Parliament doesi not control a single acre on which to place one immigrant. It has to depend on the States to carry any liberal land policy into effect and to place people upon the land. The evidence shows that it is useless to bring people out here not only in the numbers that we want, but even in the numbers that are offering. The ex-Prime Minister made strong efforts to induce the Premiers of the States to come toÂ» some arrangement by which the Commonwealth Government could assist the States Governments to bring desirable people toAustralia, and not to land people here vetorder still further to stagnate the labour markets in the cities. The honourable gentleman endeavoured to induce the States Governments to open up 'the land so that suitable immigrants could be settled on it. I admit that some of the States have tried 1 to a certain extent to do so, but Victoria, if it made any attempt at all, did it to sosmall a degree that the effort was a lamentable failure. I believe Queensland has been fairly successful in that direction, but there are more people in England anc? Scotland offering to come to Australia thaw Queensland could take.",19

88,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No one has been stoppedfrom coming. The "" stinking fish "" partu is lying about Australia all the time.",19
89,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The emigrationagencies in the Old Country are delusions and snares to the unfortunate people who listen to them. That is so, even in regard to the agencies for the State of Queensland. I do not say that we have not the country to place the people upon, because we have it, if it were available. It is the fact that it is not available that I am grumbling at. It is a waste of money for the Commonwealth to take action in the direction of advertising the resources of Australia when it has not the land to offer and cannot get the co-operation of the States. The States are willing to allow the Commonwealth to spend money in advertising our resources if those resourcesare advertised in the particular way that the States want. But if the true state of affairs were placed before the people at Home, every State would raise the cry that. the Commonwealth was interfering in something with which it had no concern. Up to the present, practically every State hastold us that it does not want our interference. As matters stand, it is a piece of impudence on our part to tell the people of the Old Country that there are opportunities for them here when we have no opportunities to offer to them. If the Stateswould co-operate with the Commonwealth Government in placing the true state of affairs before the people of the Old Country, instead of lying statements being circulated, the Commonwealth Government, having the supervision of the matter, and being able to speak on behalf of Australia, would insist on the advertisements conforming to the truth. But that is exactly what the immigration agents in the Old Country do not want. I desire to quote an extract from - a well-written article from the special correspondent of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, published on Tuesday last. That is not a Labour paper, but a well-known Tory journal, which endeavours to rule the political destinies of New South Wales. The article, which is dated from London on 30th October Last, is as followsBriefly the position is that thousands of grants of the very best types are offering themselves to Australia, and Australia, by its State agencies in London, does not want them. This year between 6,000 and 7,000 emigrants will be assisted by the various State Governments to proceed to the Commonwealth. This number could have been increased to 20,000 without any more expense in advertising, and without any ""falling off in the quality of the people sent. For every assisted passage there are dozens of applicants. When these are sorted out there are from three to six eligibles for every assisted passage. Yet the Commonwealth Parliament is being asked to spend Â£20,000 for this purpose when thousands of desirable immigrants are already clamouring to come to Australia, and large numbers are being deluded to come here under State supervision. That statement can be proved, as I have had to bring before the House three cases of men who were lied to, and who came here thinking that they could obtain land. Two of them were mechanics, and the otiier an agriculturist. The article continues The Agent-General's office says to them in effect, "" If you are a good, steady man, you will get permanent work at a good wage. If you prove a loafer, you will promptly get the Â«ack, and we will not be responsible for what becomes of you. Everything depends upon yourself."" That is a base calumny upon the men who .are now out of work in Australia. In every State there are hundreds and thousands clamouring for work and unable to get it.",19
90,Mr HANS IRVINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is their own fault. .,20
91,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am not surprised .at the statement of the honourable member, in view of the district that he represents; but I can assure him that I know hundreds of honest working men in Melbourne and suburbs who are willing to take work and cannot get it.",20

93,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Is it of any use to take a bricklayer, a carpenter, ironmoulder, tailor, butcher, or shoemaker from Melbourne, and place him on land at Â£ 4 2 an acre? Where is he to get the money to pay for it ? Or would the honourable member send him to the grass-tree lands of Victoria, at 10s. an acre, from which he could not get any return for some years? Yet' we are told that these men are loafers, and that that is why they get the sack. Such a statement is unfair. I know that honourable members opposite do not believe it, even when they say it. They are only making the statement for party purposes. The writer addsScotland is proving the best hunting ground, emiand the four agents across the border are making as represented good money. Those are the agents who are deluding people to come here under false pretences.",20

95,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The agents of the States, who are deluding people to come to Australia to still further swell the ranks of the unemployed. Those people are told that they can get work as domestic servants or agricultural labourers or may go upon the land, and we are asked to vote another Â£20,000 to still further encourage this delusion and snare. I believe the late Government meant well when they placed this vote upon the Estimates, feeling that it was demanded of them to attempt to do something; but they found they) were working on sterile ground, and I am surprised at the present Government perpetuating the thing. We are told, as a sort of sop in order that we may let the item pass, that the money will not be spent. Last year it was found impossible to spend more than one-seventh of it, and this year possibly not one-half of it will be used. What is the use of passing the item when we know that the money will not be expended.",20

97,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am not. I am decrying the system which exists in Australia, and decrying the leaders of the States Governments who have charge of the country's affairs. Some of them are, perhaps, trying to do their best, but we know what the States Governments generally are. It is only in view of the relationship between the States and Federal Governments in this matter that I object to the placing of this money upon the Estimates. I believe there is no better country in the world lhan Australia. Almost every known agricultural product can be cultivated here with success, and we have almost every mineral in the world.",20

100,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Would the honourable member put them all on the land?,21
101,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is evident that at present too large a proportion of our population is living in our cities. If the at Home. agricultural districts of Victoria were worked as they ought to be, there would be ample room for thousands more than are at present to be found there. only recently that many of the men spirit in the honourable member's own electorate' have had an opportunity to get on the land. The point that I wish to make, however, is that it is idle to endeavour attract to Australia men who have no money to spend. Agricultural labourers from Old Country need money to enable them to settle here. The Commonwealth has no land to offer them, and honourable members know what steps I would take to make of large areas available for settlement. Sydney Daily Telegraph, which publishes an article in favour of immigration, conto clusively proves, by the publication of letter from its own correspondent, that there are in Great Britain thousands clamouring to come to Australia, and we are asked to spend Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 per annum there in advertising our resources. A clays since, a recent arrival from the Country endeavoured in his own clumsy way to demand from the State Government the work which he said he was promised when he left England for Australia. was only laughed at for his pains; but he succeeded in ventilating his grievance in the press. His case is only one of many. Honourable members know that statements in the letter in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, o i the ist instant, to which have referred, are correct; and I ask them whether they think that the Commonwealth, which has no land to offer immigrants, should expend Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 in this way. have endeavoured to find more work for the people already here by means of the new Tariff, but we still have a large numsome ber of unemployed. It is'foolish to tinue to pass votes for advertising our revote sources in the Old Land' when we know that the Commonwealth itself cannot find! avenues of employment for any who may be attracted in this way to our shores. The Minister of External Affairs has admitted that the whole of this proposed vote be expended this year; and since the States themselves do not wish us to expend it, in order to assist them, he might it well withdraw the item until the Commonwealth Parliament has some better means of developing the resources of Australia in this way. By advertising in the O l d Country, the Commonwealth is simply assisting the States, and deluding the people",21
102,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Angas) [3.45] - I am glad that the honourable member for MelbournePorts, towards the close of his remarks,, It is seemed to exhibit once more that confident which he displayed throughout thediscussion of the Tariff.

I agree with' conthe honourable member that the proposed of Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 will do very little at present to encourage immigration. It is not the advertising of her resources that has caused so many immigrants to go to Canada during the last six or seven years, nor do I think that the Commonwealth is likely to gain much lrom the somewhat showmanlike methods of advertising which Canada has adopted in England.",21

It must be backed up by expressions of confidence in Australia, which have become rather rare in this House; and it must also be backed up by a judicial reticence jegarding the alleged designs of other nations to settle Australia, because it is not settled as it ought to be.",22
107,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member mean that we should repeal the Immigration Restriction Act?,22
108,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No ; but I have heard attempts made in this House to justify an alleged design on the part of Japan- a design which probably does not exist-to consider the possibility of settling Australia for us. The honourable member for Wimmera referred to that point this afternoon, and urged that, owing to the lack of expedition displayed by us in developing our own resources, other nations might feel justified in turning their attention to settlement on our shores, and to forcibly finding an outlet for their population here. I would remind honourable members that fifty years ago, England was not very thicklv populated, and that going back another 100 years we find that it was then by comparison but sparsely populated. When Froude wrote one of his chapters extolling the prosperity of the English beef-fed labourer, the population of the agricultural districts of England comprised only a few millions. no one would sav that the measure of agricultural - development in England had then been reached. I therefore think that we ought not to be pessimistic or depressed by the fact that in what is practically the first fifty years of our real development our population has not exceeded 4,000,000. We have marvellous powers of recuperation. Between 1902 and 1904 we had practically drought years, and although our exports and imports then fell away to a value of something like Â£90,000,000 per annum, they have practically increased 50 per cent, within the last two or three years. I think that our imports and' exports last year represented a value of Â£130,000,000- a volume of business indicative of a prosperity which had not been previously reached, and which has not been exceeded by Canada.",22
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No r by any other country with a like population.,22
110,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The prosperity of Canada has been vaunted to the disadvantage of Australia, but it is not the theatrical advertising to which Canada has resorted that has caused a stream of immigration to turn towards her shores. Immigration to Canada has really been due to the fact that the western portion of that country has during the last five years been thrown open for settlement. Mr. Coghlan, in the report to which the honourable member for Wimmera has referred, points out that during the three vears ending, I think, in 1907, no less than 13,000,000 acres in Canada were taken up by over 80,000 settlers or actually more than the whole settlement of a similar class in Australia at that date. It is the opening up of these lands that has turned the tide of immigration towards Canada. That emigration has !not necessarily been from the Old Country. Many thousands have gone there from the United States, finding that the conditions of settlement are far more tempting than are those in the adjoining States of the great Union. There is another reason why immigrants are perhaps not coming to our shores as freely as we would desire. A good deal has been said about our isolated position. It is said that we are practically on the outskirts of that portion of the world in which the prowess of the western nations would give us immunity from attack, and if such statements are repeated again and again, they may affect emigration to Australia. Then, again, the class of men who would provide emiStill, grants to Australia does not exist in England as it did thirty or forty years ago. The last census returns show that out of a total population of 42,000,000, only about 9,000,000 were residing outside the cities of England. That population of 9,000,000 provides the men of the class that we desire as immigrants, and fifty or sixty years ago it was, proportionately, nearly double that number. The parents of children who will now emigrate to Australia are to be found in the cities of the Old Country. They constitute a class that is gradually becoming effete; a class that we do not want here. The encouragement of their emigration to Australia is condemned, if I remember rightly, by Mr Coghlan in his report for 1905-6. Reports as to New South Wales published a few years ago in the Times also pointed out that the class that the colonies desire does not exist to anything like the extent that it is believed to exist. In view of these facts, we can well understand why our population is not being augmented by a stream of immigrants. At the same time, I do not say that immigration carni do much for any country. We could not induce many immigrants to come here even if we could at once settle them on the land. No matter what our untouched resources mav be, we cannot hope to obtain them except at very great cost. We have now four States with policies of assisted immigration.",22
111,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable memshores ber includes Victoria?,23
112,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do. In various ways these four States have assisted immigrants to Australia. Western Australia, for i stance, pays a portion of their passage money, and when they land, takes charge empty-whether of them, and advances them sums ranging worker. from Â£ 2 5 to Â£ 5 0 0 in individual In that way, it has incurred an outlay in connection with its Agricultural Settlement Acts which, up to the middle of last year, both. amounted to about Â£ 7 9 1 , 0 0 0 .

We must not get an exaggerated tion notion of the stimulus to prosperity which and of outside markets. might arise from an exorbitant outlay on immigration.

All I say is that assisted immigration can never be the great success that some people say; though it - may aid development, it cannot completely transform the country in a year or two. If 50,000 people were landed on our tomorrow, rio matter what their capacity, we could not immediately absorb them in productive lines. There is a lot of talk about the value of each man who n - is landed on our shores, apparently without regard to whether his head is full or he be a politician or a I ought, perhaps, to have put cases. that the other way about.",23

120,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No matter what a man's in capacity may be, he is not worth much to the country unless he is in a position to his labour productively. If the mere so? totting up of heads indicated prosperity, then China, who has been asleep for 2,000 years, ought to be one of the richest countries, and England, with a population of only 42,000,000, but with a trade running into 1,100 millions of pounds, ought to be have one of the poorest. As a matter of fact, we know that England has applied intellithe gence, capital, and, of course, labour as condition, with excellent results. I do not like to take a depressing view of effect of immigration - I merely urge we should not rely too much on that and pass such a vote as might lead us to adopt the theatrical methods of Canada. At the same time, we are somewhat behind the Old Country in the instrumentalities of industrial development. I occasionally read the report of what is done in Great Britain and Ireland; and I find that even Ireland, which has been somewhat backward of recent years, is far in adof Australia in voluntary co-operain the development of local production There is State aid in Ireland in these directions, and that country is, as I indicate, far before us in the way of agricultural colleges, lectureships, and the teaching of the people, not Only through the Government, but through voluntary associations. I hope that the new Ministry, with the opportunity they will have during the recess-if they reach it-wil l look into this question, and see whether this Â£20,000 cannot be applied with better results than have obtained in the past. A great deal could be done by placing the real position of Australia before the British public, and imbuing them with the confidence that inspires us as public men. Our political institutions ought to be dwelt on, because they are in comparatively excellent working as contrasted with similar institutions in other countries. Attention might also be directed to the peculiarities of our climate, our marvellous powers of recuperation, and the virility which inspires our youth, who look rather to the future than to the past. Even through an exalted dignitary like the High Commissioner, these facts could be with advantage placed before the British public, and would have much more force than if communicated by the somewhat mercenary mouths of theatrical paid agents.",23

While I agree with the honoram able member for Angas as to the possibilithe ties of Australia, I disagree with him his view of immigration. We can sorb millions quite as rapidly as Canada has done; but, in so far as this ill-advised and ill-regulated immigration has been conducted in the various States, sulted simply in the flooding of the labour market. It has come under my own perber sonal notice that immigrants have been encaught with chaff? couraged to come here for whom no openings are presented when they arrive. At the present time, I am endeavouring to secure for an able and fairly well educated man, who was induced to come to New this South Wales by an irresponsible immigrathe tion agent, a position on the tramways South Australia. He is a skilled tramway driver, and is not qualified to immediately go on the land; and yet such men are brought out indiscriminately without regard for the occupations for which are fitted. Then in a town in my own electorate an immigrant labourer sued his employer for six weeks' wages at ios. a week; and it appeared that the immigrant, who had tramped up country looking for work, had been engaged at 2s. a week. The magistrate gave a verdict in favour of the employer, although the plaintiff was an able-bodied English farm labourer. Such a case is an outrage on the decency of this community, and I am strongly opposed to the continuance of indiscriminate immigration. I cannot understand the attitude of the late Government, seeing that the control of immigration rests entirely with the Commonwealth. The power seems to have been relegated to the States, which, apparently, are dominated by no desire but to furnish a certain class of the community with cheap labour. Recently, I saw a large printed placard from England, headed, ""Wanted, 4,000 farm hands for Australia."" Such an announcement is a reflection on the Central Government, because, if such a number of farm hands were to come, they would starve before the crops were ready, even if then there was a demand for them. Unless the Government will show that, by the imposition of a heavy progressive land tax they propose to open up the lands-o r else stipulate that no one who has not Â£500 shall be acceptable, or if they do not, out of Government funds, finance immigrants come, I must oppose any further exunless the penditure on immigration.

My electorate is part of the great wheat belt in the centre of New South Wales, but, according to the Sydney Homing Herald of 13th June last, when 20,000 acres were made available in the Barmedman district, in twenty-two blocks, of which fourteen were offered as conditional purchase leased areas, and six as - homestead selections, there were 195 applicants.",26

143,Mr THOMASBROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In New South-Wales, thousands of young men have vainly striven to make homes for themselves, and numbers are going to New Zealand, Queensland, and elsewhere, in the hope of getting land. Then, in Victoria, according to the Age of this morningFor years our farmers' sons, unable to obtain land here at a reasonable price, have been pouring out of the State in an unceasing stream. The exodus has not only diminished, but seriously vitiated our population. Five years ago we possessed more men than women, we had only a reasonable proportion of aged people, and we had more wage earners and fewer dependents than any other State. Our population is vitiated and stagnant, immigration has ceased, the farming exodus proceeds unchecked, land stands at a prohibitive price, much of the most fertile portion of the State is an unpeopled wilderness, industrial enterprise of every sort is decadent, and unemployment is rife in our midst. Yet we are asked to spend large sums of money in bringing out immigrants who will repeat the experiences so graphically described. We should be honest in the matter. I had the privilege of listening to one of the latest addresses delivered by Lord Northcote in the Commonwealth. He dealt with this question at Young, pointing out that if the people of Australia wanted immigration they must make the conditions suitable for the immigrants that came here. He referred to the large areas of valuable land locked up in big holdings, to which access could not be obtained under A reasonable conditions, and said that if immigration were desired, something should be done to make the land available. He told the people-and this impressed itself very strongly on my mind-that the best advertisement the Commonwealth could have would be for the immigrants who came here to be satisfied, and themselves to become, as it were, immigration agents by writing to their friends in the Old World and recommending that they also should come to Australia. He added that the worse thing the Commonwealth could do was to dump immigrants down to starve. The honourable member for Macquarie gives an instance of how immigrants are treated in his electorate, where a man was expected to work for 2s. a week', and that is not an isolated instance. Whilst the opportunities of getting upon the land are so restricted, and whilst we have disgraceful sweating conditions in our factories and shops, we are not in a position to invite desirable immigrants to come here. We should see to our internal affairs, and make the conber ditions such that we can retain our nativegoing to New Zealand. born. Then we can hope to secure immiMarch gration. Under present conditions, I fail to see that we shall get the right class immigrants; although we might get a of scum and riff-raff to come out by paying their way for them; but that is not the of people that we want. While I desire to see Australia; advertised, and the kind of people coming here, I will not lend Dominion of about 220. myself to presenting our conditions in glowing language which the pro-immigrants often put before the British public. I want to serve the Commonwealth well, our duty is to put down sweating, and open out our great estates. When we have done that, we shall have no cause for complaint on the score of immigration or the necessity for increased population.",26
144,Mr ARCHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Capricornia) [4.28] The idea appears to prevail in the Comceedingly mittee that the item of Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 for tising the resources of the Commonwealth is which I have just quoted. intended only for the purpose of inducing working people to come to Australia. There should be a great deal more in it than We do want certain classes of workmen, but I agree with those honourable members who object to bringing them here without reasonable prospect of their being absorbed in the labour market. There is, however, big work to be done in quite a different of advertisement. We should advertise the resources of Australia with a view encouraging capital to come here. An apcated peal could be made'to quite another class out under contract could not be employed of the British population by advertising the trade returns of Australia, its producand tiveness, and so on. Those figures would shearing sheds. show people with capital what can be done here, and how much better returns and freer openings for their capital are possible in Australia than elsewhere. To look at the matter simply from the point of view of inducing the poorer section of the community to emigrate to Australia, is to take altogether too narrow a view. From what I have heard of the cost of the adverfrom tisement in the Standard, advertising pears to be fairly expensive. At that rate, we could spend Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 without much trouble, and from that point of view i does not seem to be an unduly large amount. If we can only bring more capital to the country, to be spent in opening up our resources, it will make work for the men whom we desire to see here for defence and other purposes. The honourable mem20s. for Calare referred to our young men On the 25th last, I quoted some figures on that subject, handed to me while I was speakof ing by the honourable member for North lot Sydney. They showed that in 1906 when we were just beginning to get over our kind terrible drought, 22^98 people came from New Zealand, and 22,426 left for New right Zealand, a balance in favour of the In 1907, howthe ever, the arrivals from New Zealand were 27,425. and the departures for New f we Zealand 24,292, showing a balance In favour of the Commonwealth of over 3,000. I think the honourable member for Calare quoted the years from the beginning of Federation, but the years, from 1900 to about 1904 were, a time of the greatest depression in Australia, and a number of people left the country to seek openings elsewhere. Since then we have had an exgood time, and the turn of the advertide is shown by the figures for 1907, You, Mr. Chairman, yesterday asked a question in regard to some men who were being brought that. out by Mr Kidston, the Premier of Queensland, under contract. I take no exception to the form of the question. The a Minister of External Affairs, in his answer, was evidently f u l ly seized of the a facts relating to the matter of wages, as sort he showed that the special award secured by the shearers did not affect the general to wages of ordinary station hands. He indithat the men who were being brought 1 at the wages mentioned-20s . per week keep-at any work connected with the",27
145,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is so.,27
146,Mr ARCHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"As to the general question of whether the wages offered are sufficient or not, while 20s. per week may be stated to be the average wage on the coast, it is not the average in the inland centres. I believe that there the average wage is 24s. to 25s. per week, while at timesapit goes up to 30s., according to the work which the men have to do. But that work is more or less casual. The men are liable t to be dismissed at any time. In any case, they are experts, such as stockriders, and' well acquainted with the country. If the honourable member for Maranoa, for instance, .had come out in the earlv dayswith an assured job for twelve months at a week and tucker, he would have felt more happy than he did when he had to take the chance of any employment that .he could find. ",27
147,Mr ARCHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Therefore , putting on one side the question of whether there is or is not room in Australia for more men, I contend that it is a fair thing for raw hands from the Old Country to be brought here with a steady job at 20s. a week and all found ahead of them. Those are men who as agricultural labourers in the Old Country are accustomed to work for from 12s. to 15s. a week and nothing found. I know that in the Old Country the wages for agricultural labourers used to be as low as 12s. a week, sometimes with a cottage and sometimes without. On that wage a man had to keep a family, and the poor wretches often did not get meat twice a week. If there is room for these men ih Australia, and we can bring them out with an assured job at 20s. a week and tucker, so that at the end of twelve months they will be efficient workers, acclimatized, and on a sound footing, that is the very best way that we can start our immigration policy. I quite agree that to bring out raw hands from all sorts of trades with the idea of dumping them on the land to make a living is sheer cruelty. They will simply starve. I am certain that there is room to absorb workers in Queensland. In the Parliament of that State recently the returns of the Government Labour Bureaux were quoted. They showed that every class of labour applying to the bureaux for work was being absorbed. Certain honourable members stated that a great number of men would not go near the bureaux, and that therefore the figures were not to be relied upon; but if people will not go to the bureaux the inference is that they can do better without them-.",28
148,Mr SPENCE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is the case everywhere that they will not go to the bureaux, because they get no results from them.",28
149,Mr ARCHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Tb e actual figures, which appear in the Queensland Hansard, - show that in everv class of work the men who applied found employment. As to the question of the land not 'being available, even if it were available, as I understand it is in certain parts of the Commonwealth, the workers that we are bringing out could not go on to it straight away. It is undoubtedly a fact that plenty of land can be secured in Queensland. I can only speak of the State that I know. It is' a very noticeable feature of this Parliament that each member speaks only of the country with which he is acquainted. The great complaint of the Victorian members, for instance, is that land is not available. We know that Victoria is to a certain extent congested, owing to the large areas held under freehold, but statements made in this House, based on the state of affairs in Victoria, should not be published to the world as applying to the whole of Australia. In Queensland there is any amount of land readily available, and the quantity will be continually increased. Right up the coast, where the greatest opportunities for settlement exist, there is any amount of land that only wants opening up by means of roads and railways, and that is entirely suitable for closer settlement. It is certainly held at present under some form of tenure. In many cases it is held only under occupation licences pending the making of railways, but in others, the coastal leases have anything from a few years up to twelve' or fifteen years to run The Queensland Government are meeting the situation as rapidly as possible. They are undoubtedly entering upon a very big policy of railway construction. The last two Parliaments have agreed to the construction of something like 500' miles of railway, and that policy is being continued. It is because of the enormous work which confronts them in the development of the State- a work which they are eager to tackle-that the people of Queensland show some anxiety as to the outcome of the negotiations in regard to the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States.  satisfied if he got the lot.",28
150,Mr ARCHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I hope that an amicable settlement will be arrived ac. That, however, is not a matter with which I now. desire to deal. To show that land is available in Queensland, and is being taken up, I should like to requote some figures which I recently put before the House as to the area taken up in that State during the week ended 24th October last. The return shows that during that week there were takeni up two grazing selections comprising 20,000 acres, fortyeight agricultural selections, embracing i6,r38 acres, and thirtyrthree prickly pear selections containing 52,720 acres, or a total of 88,858 acres. With the exception of the two grazing areas the land so taken up consistedof small blocks. The grazing areas were probably sheep selections in the western part of the State.",28
151,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,How people were settled on the land as the result of that selection?,29
152,Mr ARCHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is not shown by the return. Altogether eighty-three blocks were taken up.,29
153,Mr WEBSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Did they carry residence?,29
154,Mr ARCHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The grazing selections would not necessarily do so; but  up land as residential selections are given Ihe preference.,29
155,Mr ARCHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is so. The man who applies for land under the homestea'd provision of the Act receives a preference over the man who desires it as a grazing selection. The honourable member for Maranoa is more conversant than I am with the western selections, but I think he will confirm my statement that in the vast majority of cases those who take up gracing areas live on them. ",29
156,Mr ARCHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I sincerely trust that the Commonwealth Government will throw no obstacle in the way of the introduction of men under a system of secured employment, so long as the wages to be paid are fair and reasonable. I have no more desire than you have, Mr Chairman, to see men brought here under engagement to work for low wages. The average wage in the western part of Queensland is from 14s. to 30s. per week, with rations, according to the efficiency of the worker. That rate does not necessarily apply to permanent employment, and in the circumstances I do not think that young men who are brought out from the Old Country, and secure steady work at 20s. a week and tucker, can complain that they are unfairly treated. I sincerely hope that the Government will do nothing to stop so desirable a form of settlement. We shall, of course, always have men out of work. When, for instance, industrial metals were of very high value, it was almost impossible in Queensland to obtain men willing to enter into contracts for fencing, damsinking, and other station work. Many men found tiiat they could make a verygood livin.gr out of their wolfram and other metal shows, but as soon as the metal market fell they were "" frozen out,"" so to speak, and naturally came on the labour market. It is impossible to avoid such occurrences, and to point to the fact that there are many unemployed is not toadvance an unanswerable argument against many immigration. If it could be shown that we had all over Australia a vast body of men seeking employment, and that, notwithstanding that proper steps were being, taken to bring employers and employestogether, work could not be found for these men, that would certainly be an unanswerable argument against the policy. But such a state of affairs does not exist in Queensland. As to the Commonwealthco-operating with the States, with a view to encourage immigration, it seems to me that it would be undesirable to vest in the Commonwealth Parliament alone the control of immigration. After listening to this debate, honourable members must recognise that there are many reasons why that should not be done. Every honourable member's view of this question is undoubtedly coloured by his immediate surroundings; and it is almost impossible for him to take a view embracing the whole of Australia. The Commonwealth can certainly do a great deal in the way of advertising our resources, but it seems to me that to the States themselves might well be left the work of bringing out immigrants. The States Governments know what scope they have for them, and what they have to offer. That being so, I think it would be well to allow them to deal with that part of the work, the Commonwealth undertaking the duty of advertising in a big way the resources of Australia. The Commonwealth should endeavour to attract men with capita] to our shores, by showing that there are here ample opportunities for the profitable investment of their money. In that way we may forward this movement, and so assist the development of Australia as 10 enable it to find employment for all the labour we ran obtain. That is an object that the Commonwealth might very well do its best te achieve.",29
157,Mr FOWLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Perth) [4.47] - I intend to support the Government proposals, but I trust that they will see that the money we are voting for advertising the resources of Australia is spent in a more practical and sensible way than it has been in some cases. I entirely object, for one thing, to the advertising contract entered into with a London newspaper, which is almost unknown in the provinces of the Old Landa newspaper that circulates,. I may say, exclusively amongst that class of peoplethat we do not desire in Australia. Then, again, I do' not think it is advantageous to Australia ,to have the money spent a gorgeous office in London, with flaring electric lights and exhibiting views of the ^ J ^ ^ Blue Mountains, Sydney Harbor, and other Australian scenery. That may attract the for casual immigrant. It may even have some fascination for that unfortunate class of immigrant of whom we get too many in ? â . .

I think that while there is room Australia even for men without capital but with plenty of energy and ability, the w ' I introduction of these seriously deteriorates our population. We need only to look round the streets of our tion large cities to find evidence of their demoralizing effect. My idea in regard to the expenditure of this money is that should be devoted largely to advertising in the provinces-of Great Britain, and that a minimum of it should be expended in the great centre of London. .The honortial able member for Angas argued this aftereither noon that the-rather theatrical advertising of Canada had had very little to tha considerable influx of population to that part of the Empire. I hold an entirely different opinion.

165,Mr FOWLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall not discuss that matter, because I am not fortified with statistics. There are practically only Queensland and Western Australia which offer opportunities to people with limited capital to go on the land and make homes for themselves. Of course, there is plenty of land for settlers in the other States, if that land were made available on sonable terms. Merely referring to Vicand toria, we know perfectly well that State could carry millions of lation in the rural districts, and yet we travel for a day in the railway train and see very scant evidence of human beings. It struck roewith astonishment, when . first came, to Australia, and travelled from Melbourne into a remote part of the Western. District of Victoria to see magnificent country with so few evidences of occupation, tion j and I regret to say that, in all intervening years, there has been very little improvement in this direction. As a matter of fact, the tendency has been rather for the' population in rural parts to be reduced by emigration to other States. There some young friends of mv own, born, and brought up in the magnificent Western trict, who have had to leave for other parts of Australia and New Zealand in order to find land on which they might make homes for themselves and become useful citizens. Western Australia, I lieve, offers better advantages to the immiconsider grant than do any of the other States; and - there is a considerable influx of the right sort of people into that State. was struck with the fact when in State England that people who had emigrated from there to Canada, had returned diswhole satisfied with the conditions, and were meditating a change to Australia. Even in the ship in which 1 came back to tralia, there were two men who, after havleading, ing been in Canada for a number of years, were returning with the intention of cities? - settling in the western State. There are in the Old Land, I believe, many who, born and brought up in the farming business, and having limited capital, would be only too glad to settle in the Australian States, tain. where land is available on easy terms, if they were conversant with all the condiimmigrants ' tions. When staying in a country district districts. in Scotland during my recent v^Slt I was. by several farmers, who asked me for information regarding Australia, and particularly as to Western Australia. large They pointed out that, necessarily, they had a certainamount of capital, without which they could not work their farms, but the that they were simply slaving, year in and! year out in order to pay rent to the landlord. I very soon satisfied them that they would be able to better their condition very materially in Australia, and I believe that it only requires a certain amount of judicious-advertising in the rural districts of reathe Old Land, utilizing the newspapers, able lecturers, td bring to our shores that men with both ability and capital to enable poputhemr to take up land and. become good may citizens. I hope that the Government will proceed, somewhat on the lines I . have suggested, to spend this money; and if they I do, it will be spent with good results to Australia.  voteis one which appeals to our imaginaespecially when we regard it from, the the point of view of the density of population. We make' it our boast that we arepart of the greatest Empire the world has ever seen; and, therefore, we have an identity of interest with the other portions of are that Empire. In our own official Year Book we are told that, while the populaDistion in England and Wales is 586 personsto the square mile, the population in. Australia is 1.38. I notice a disposition on the part of some Victorian representatives to view this question simply from be the Victorian point of view;. but, when wethat, while the population in Australia is only i . ^ i to the square mile, it is fourteen to the square mile in Victoria, we I can see that to use the poshron of this ' as the basis of an argument for a scheme of immigration forAustralia as a mustlead to erroneous conclusions.",31

The Governments of New South Wales and Victoria have fostered schemes which will give opportunities for the maintenance within their borders of much larger populations than they possess today. In Victoria, large irrigation schemes have beer* carried out, and larger ones are promised, while New South Wales has already done something, and is about to do more, ""in this direction. The result will be to bring toAustralia a new class of agriculturists. The men who have been accustomed to dear with large areas will, many of them, be disinclined to follow the methods necessaryfor the intense culture associated with i r r i gation, and must therefore go where they can get what they desire. This will leaveroom for those who are prepared to work the land under conditions similar to those which obtain in thickly populated parts of the world. I deprecate the "" stinkingfish "" cry of honourable gentlemen oppositeThere is a great future for Australia.",32
172,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The ""stinking-fish"" cry has come from the corner where the honourable member sits.  Tillett said about Australia? When a man. who has enjoyed our hospitality, and knows our position, misrepresents us as he has done, he should, if he ever returns, booted out of the country. Australia is gradually being made more attractive to those who. are accustomed to the more settled conditions of the older parts of the world, and we are gradually increasing the means for maintaining a large rural population. I would be the last to advocate immigration of persons whose presence here would glut the labour market. I do not think that we should be wise in dumping a number of working people here, leaving them to do the best they could for themselves. Reference has been made to a case in which a man was given work at 2s. a week. One swallow does not make a summer, and the possibility is that the man in question asked for employment from some one who had little or nothing for him to do, but was willing to give him food and accommodation, and ss. a week, so long as it suited him to stay.",32
173,Mr CARR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In my district, men absolutely cannot get work.  say that Australia is one of the worse tries on the face of the earth is that it is one of the best, and, could my voice reach the people of Great Britain, I would seek to impress upon them the fact that we have great possibilities. What we need is a population which will make us, to a large extent, independent. Many of the speeches made this afternoon will be used on the other side of die world to dissuade peisons from emigrating. As an Australian native, I desire the progress and development of the Commonwealth. Therefore, I shall vote for the proposal to spend ^Â£20,000 a year on advertising, and I hope that when next the Estimates come before us, they will be accompanied with a able scheme for giving effect to the desire of the great majority of the people that our resources shall be proclaimed abroad.",33
174,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Moreton) [5.18] - I resuming was pleased to hear the Minister declare that he would spend part of the recess formulating a practical scheme for the vertisement of Australia. The intention good, and I am sure that he will endeavour to get value for any money that he may expend. The late Government cannot be accused of extravagance in this direction, and I am pleased that the new Minister is determined that the vote shall not reduced, ancl that profitable means shall found for expending the money. I have this been sorry to hear the remarks of some the supporters of the Government. There be is any amount of room here for immi- . grants, if we get men of the right class. Australia is progressing by leaps and bounds, and any man who has grit enough to go into the country districts can obtain fair remuneration, with, what is better, the prospect of an independence later in life. the There are plenty of openings for the man < who has brains, health, and the determination to press forward. In Queensland, the number of persons employed in the secondary industries, in 1902, was 20,008, and, in 1907, 28,856; a large increase in five years. But the progress of the State has not been confined to the cities. The primary industries have also progressed, as is shown by the increase in their output. For instance, in 1902, the number of sheep frozen was 117,729, and, in 1907, 242,384. The quantity of leather tanned, in 1902, was 23,782 cwts., and, in 1906, 27,166 cwts - the information for 1907 gives the number of sides, and not the number of hundredweights, tanned, so that it is useless for purposes of comparison. counThe output of skins, in 1902, was 132,221, and, in 1907, 279,877; of bacon, in 1902, 6,512,952 lbs., and, in 1907, 10,015,008 lbs.; of butter, in 1902, 4,845,866 lbs., and, in 1907, 22,789,158 lbs.; of cheese, in 1902, 952,013 lbs., and, in 1907, 2,684,558 lbs.; and of wheat, in 1902, 1,338,346 bushels,' and, in 1907, 1,406,583 bushels. The increase in the production of sugar cane and molasses is also very marked. These figures show that the closer-settlement policy of the Queensland Government has attracted persons from other States of the Commonwealth, and from other parts of the world. We should hail with delightthe immigration of reason- persons who come here to add to our population of good and reputable citizens. There is room for a great number of people of that kind. Before my seat, I have one or two questions to ask the Minister regardin ing the items now before the Committee. adI must congratulate the Minister on his is judicious reprimand of the honourable member for Nepean the other night when he asked for information. It struck me then that a very good place for a man to finish his education was the Treasury bench. The Minister now resents questions which at one be time he used to ask. However, I am not be asking for information regarding items in division with the object of tangling the of Minister up in any way. There is an item Â°f Â£ Â° f Â° the annual payment to the 2 0 r International Agricultural Institute at Rome. The House and the country have a right to know the objects of that institute, and the benefits obtained by the Commonwealth from it.",33
175,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I have all the information here; but it is not a new item.,34
176,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I voted for it on the last Estimates; but I do not think the country knows much about the advantages that are being derived from the vote. If there are any benefits which private individuals can derive from the institute, I hope the Minister will make them public. With regard to the item of .Â£500 for an investigation as to the shearing-of wet sheep, I read in the press an interview which the honourable member for Grey had on the subject with the late. Prime Minister, who promised to place a sum on the Estimates to investigate the question. Perhaps the Minister of External Affairs can state whether the investigation is to be undertaken from a health point of view?",34
177,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is from a health point of view, and also to ascertain the dangers of combustion when wet wool is pressed in a pack. This is a joint request from the Pastoralists' Association and the Shearers' Union.",34
178,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is satisfactory. The vote of .Â£20,000 for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth has now been fully debated, and as there is only a small minority against it, the Government should see that the money is judiciously spent.",34
179,Mr ATKINSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wilmot) [5.29] - I am glad that the Government have retained on the Estimates the item of ,Â£20,000 for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. I am sorry that they have not even increased it, because, if they undertake a general scheme of advertising, that sum will not go very far. At any rate, they are to be congratulated on uetaining the item, as it helps to remove from them the possibly undeserved stigma that rests on the Labour Party generally of being opposed to immigration. I am satisfied that the Minister will do his best to see that we get full value for the money. If he takes the advice of the honourable member for Perth, I have no doubt that, with the exercise of a little judgment, we shall make a satisfactory start with our immigration policy. At present the question is not too satisfactorily treated. We need one central Office in London, working for the Commonwealth and for all the States. If we had such an office under a High Commissioner, at which all the States were also properly represented, the intending emigrant would get a much better idea of the state of affairs in Australia than he does now, with five or six separate States having offices in different parts of London, and acting like so many competitors for immigration. With one office in London, we should get harmjony between the States and the Federation, and this would gradually lead to a settled policy of immigration, that must eventually benefit the whole of the Commonwealth. If people are of the right sort, it does not matter .what State they come to, for they are an asset to the Commonwealth, and it is to their mutual interests that the States and Commonwealth should do their best to devise a harmonious scheme for furthering so great a project. Every young country requires a steady stream of immigrants of the right sort. It practically means a supply of life-blood, which it should be our aim to secure. Immigration is essential if only from the point of view of defence. We cannot allow great tracts of country to remain always empty. In that condition they constitute a big excuse for foreign nations to try to effect settlement there. The more immigrants of the right sort, British people for preference, that we can get, the less room we shall leave for the occupation of any of our territory by possibly undesirable immigrants. If we are going to hold Australia we should do our best to fill it with the right sort of occupants. No one can doiibt that there is plenty of room here for millions of people, but our population was practically stationary for a considerable number of years. I am glad to say that during the last year or two there has been an increase, and things seem to be tending the right way once more. At the same time the increase is very slight, and at the present rate something like a century or more would elapse before we had a population of 20,000,000 people. That is - altogether too slow a rate of growth. If we set to work in earnest we can accelerate that speed very much, and many of _ us now living may see a fair population within our borders. We have to feel our way in this matter, and undoubtedly we must make a start. One of the first steps taken to advertise Canada was the offering of medals to the State school children of England for the best essay on the Dominion. It was a great surprise to the initiators of the project to find how many children competed. Canada, of course, advertises very largely, not only in a theatrical fashion, but in a systematic way throughout the provincial press of Great Britain. I have no doubt that by that means a great many desirable people are induced to go to Canada. has plenty of room for immigrants. If it cannot carry a greater population than it possesses at present, the sooner those of us who want to improve our positions in life leave this country for another the better. But its resources are practically unlimited, and very varied, and we have not only room, but also plenty of occupation, for a very large population. For twenty-seven years, or thereabouts, prior to 1903, no fewer than 114,000 people emigrated yearly from Great Britain. About 65 per cent, of them went to foreign countries, and 35 per cent, to different parts of the Empire. About the year 1903 Canada came vigorously into the field with an immigration policy, and chiefly owing to that fact the proportion of emigrants from Great Britain who went to other parts of the Empire was greatly increased. Unfortunately, the number who emigrate to Australia is still very much smaller than it ought to be. The honourable member for Calare said he was in favour of immigration, so long as we got the right sort of immigrants, but I waited in vain to hear him state what he considered the right sort. To my mind, any one is acceptable to us who has health and strength and his faculties, with a. fair education, and who comes out intent on making his way, seeing better opportunities here than offer in the congested ventres of the Old World. If a man of that stamp comes here with very little, it will not be long before he has a good deal. I have no doubt that he will find land if he wants it , or make his way in whatever walk of life he chooses. An immigrant of that sort is good enough for me, although I prefer men who wish to look out for land. ",34
180,Mr ATKINSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If they have a little - capital so much the better. It is necessary that the Commonwealth and the States should work in harmony, because the control of the land s t ill . remains with the 'States. If the States have plenty of land available there is no reason why that fact should not be well advertised in England, and an office established in London where information as to the areas open for selection, and the character of the soil, mav be obtained. If that course were adopted, I have no doubt that in a few years we should have a steady stream of immigration. Those who came here, and found that the land was as good as we had re Australia presented it to be would lose no time in communicating with their friends at Home, and in that way our population would be still further augmented. Another reason why the Commonwealth and the States should work in harmony is that we have in Australia many large tracts of country on which there must be a considerable expenditure to render them fit for continuous occupation. The States will have to engage in extensive systems of irrigation. In this connection, immigration and irrigation are inseparable. There are vast areas of Crown lands that might by irrigation be made available for settlement. I had intended to quote some statistics showing how idle is the cry that we have no room for immigrants, but I think that it must be so evident that we have ample room that I need not do so A reference to one or two figures, however, may point my argument. The area of England, Wales, and Scotland is about that of Victoria, but whereas Victoria has something like 12,000,000 sheep, those countries have 25,000,000, and an annual wheat production of 58,900,000 bushels, as against an average production in Victoria of say 23,000.000 bushels. The difference between the oat crop of this State and that of England, Scotland, and Wales is still greater. Denmark, which comprises something like 10,000,000 acres, annually produces butter of the value of ,Â£8,000,000, whereas Victoria, with an area of 56,000,000 acres, has a production of wool, wheat, butter, and cheese valued at only about ,Â£6,000,000 per annum.",35
181,Mr BAMFORD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Denmar k has a genuine system of closer settlement.,35
182,Mr ATKINSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I quote these figures only to show that we have plenty of room for immigrants, and that production here is capable of enormous expansion. If we could induce people to settle in the interior, there is no doubt that our large cities-ou r manufacturing centres-woul d be still more prosperous. One form of occupation would give employment in others. The honourable member for Herbert has referred to the excellent system of closer settlement in operation in Denmark. I am not conversant with the details of that system, but I believe that the honourable member is right. I would remind him that we are doing something in the way of closer settlement, although we do not seem to be able to induce people to come here in such numbers as we should like.",35
183,Mr FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There is not enough land available.,36
184,Mr ATKINSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is not so much the area of land available as the price charged for it that is the obstacle. The States should improve the Crown lands by irrigation, ahd in other ways, and so make them available for settlement at a reasonable rate. It not be denied that the question of immigration is one of the most important with which we have to deal. We must be prepared to expend far more than .Â£20,000 per annum on an immigration policy, and should recognise that such an expenditure may be reproductive. The question whether considered from the stand-point of defence or from any other view-point, is of the utmost importance to Australia, and this Parliament must sooner or later deal with it effectively. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [5.47] I am not aware to what extent honourable members will avail themselves of the opportunity which the amendment I have moved will give them to support by their votes the opinions that they have already expressed with regard to the undesirableness of spending money on advertising the resources of Australia, but I wish to make perfectly clear the vote that I shall give. I have not submitted the amendment because I do not believe in advertising Australia in the Old Country. On the contrary, I consider that we should spend a great deal more than we are, and I am certain that the Minister charged with this work will be able to devise a means by which next year the advertising of Australia can be carried out, possibly at much greater expense, but with excellent effect. I should not have moved the amendment but that the honourable gentleman himself has said that he cannot spend this year the ,Â£10,000 which would remain at his disposal. It will certainly give those who have a dislike to such a vote in any shape or form an opportunity to record their decision. I do not propose to make a long speech, although this is a matter on which I feel strongly. My views may be summed up in a few words. I hold that Australia should throw open her doors to any white man of European extraction who can show that he is not a pauper, that he is not afflicted with any communicable disease likelv to prejudice the population here, and that he is not likely to become a charge upon the Commonwealth or any State. We should be glad to welcome such men to our shores. My views on this subject, perhaps, are too broad for many honourable members.",36
185,Mr CARR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,They are very profitable-to those who want cheap labour.,36
186,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is a very narrow view to take. I would remind the honourable member, as I reminded the honourable member for Calare, that at no time .canhas the labour market of Queensland been. more favourable to the labourer, both in the matter of wages and the emplovment available, than when that State was spending huge sums in assisting immigrants, who were then coming in at the rate of from i,000 to 1,200 a month.",36
187,Mr CARR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is the honourable member alluding to Kanakas ?,36
188,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No ; I am referring to European immigrants. So much for cur actual experience, which is in perfect accord with the deductions to be drawn from the statistics prepared by Mr Coghlan, and quoted this afternoon.",36
189,Mr CARR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"What were the wages paid"" at that time?",36
190,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not ""know now what they were.",36
191,Mr CARR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is the point of difference between us. We object to cheap labour.,36
192,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There was nocheap labour; every one was well and profitably employed. Mr Coghlan reported: that it was estimated that every one of those who were recorded as having gone to Canada took with him on theaverage .Â£100. When that statement was made this afternoon the Minister interjected that that was probably a very liberal estimate. I remember reading a couple of yearsago that, on an average, the estimated sum which each immigrant rothe Argentine had taken with him was double that amount. We may rest assured that on the average-takin g the capitalist who goes out as the result of the development that is going on, and the man who goes to give his labour only.Â£100 is a very moderate estimate. That does not take into account the valueof the man himself, which is estimated by various financiers and statesmen as being from .Â£100 to .Â£300* The late Mr Seddon estimated that every immigrant in New Zealand, even without any money in his pocket, was worth ,Â£300 to the country. The argument that there is no land available for immigrants in Australia is absurd; and, on this point, I should like to read a few figures from the last report of the Under-Secretary for Lands of Queensland. At the beginning of 1907 there was open for selection land, for the most part actually surveyed and eminently fitted for the purpose, 13,600,000 acres in round figures, and during the year -6,000,000 more acres were added. Against that, however, we have to consider .3,000,000 acres which were withdrawn from selection.",36
193,Mr WATKINS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Probably the best part.,37
194,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Not at all. As : i matter of fact, it is usually the worse ot the land that is withdrawn and proclaimed open on another occasion under other conditions or at a lower rental. In any case this left a balance of 3,000,000 acres in addition to the 13,600,000 acres. The area selected was 4,700,000 acres, leaving a balance at the end of the year of 11,902,000 acres. It will be seen that Oueensland is doing her best in a practical way to bring people on the land.",37
195,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not think that any - exception was taken to the action of - Queensland, but rather to the inaction in the southern - States.",37
196,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But members talk of Australia, while in their - narrowness they seem to have regard only to the southern States.",37
197,Mr FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What about the climate?,37
198,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is the best in the world, ancl that of Darling Downs is practically the same as that of New England.",37
199,Mr WATKINS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is the land spoken of on Darling Downs?,37
200,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Muc h of it is, or in districts having a similar elevation. Do the honourable member for Capricornia and the honourable member for Moreton suggest in their physique men who cannot live in rsuch a climate?",37
201,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"And yet the agencies in the Old Country will not bring, all the applicants out to Queensland.",37
202,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Queensland - Government, under a penalty of Â£ 4 per head for any shortage, have to insure to the British-India Company, to which they P y Â£37>Â°Â°Â° a year as a subsidy, 200 ima migrants for every ship. The number nf selectors for the land, of which I have just spoken, was 3,181, which represents something like 1,500 acres per selector. Of these no fewer than 589 came from the other States, and these latter selected 580,000 acres. These young fellows are no new chums, but know what they are about-; and yet there are 12,000,000 acres, approximately similar to those selected, yet remaining, and other areas are constantly being opened up as the pastoral leases fall in. Whatever may be the condition of affairs in the south, where, possibly, the population is more congested, there is ample room for every immigrant who chooses to come to Queensland.",37
203,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Why ""stone-wall"" this item?",37
204,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I intend to say just as much as I choose in regard to this item; and I do not think that the figures I have quoted are altogether useless. Honourable members, as u whole, may not quite realise that such figures are possible; but I may add that some 66,000 acres wf Queensland territory were actually selected in London last year.",37
205,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,How many million acres have the Government repurchased ?,37
206,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Government have purchased a good many acres, but not millions.",37

208,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I am now dealing with Crown lands.,37
209,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Every acre was taken up as rapidly as repurchased.,37
210,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is nonsense to talk of there being no land for selectors.,37
211,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Thos e remarks were not made of Queensland.,37
212,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But we are a Federation, and Queensland is part of Australia; and it is time we heard the last of the cry that there ought to be no immigration, because there is no land. It is only a small proportion of the emigrants to Canada who go on the land; but their presence gives an additional value to it, and causes the opening up of the country and increased employment and prosperity ah round. I am not one who believes that the farm labourer is the only person who should be subjected to competition by immigration. We hear from various sources, both inside and outside this House, that there should be no competition with ""the artisan in this connection; but with that idea I have no sympathy.",37

240,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Las t year, 4,700,000 acres were selected.",39

252,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Why do the owners of big estates oppose propositions for taxation?,39
253,Mr TOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is possible to do injury to the holders of large estates without benefiting the community. Merely meddlesome legislation is injurious to the owners of both large and small estates.,39

255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member regret it?,39
256,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member for Parramatta seems to regret it.,39
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I do not; though I regret that the measure was not. more scientific.,39
258,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The tax has now practically disappeared.,39
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It s control has been handed over to the shire and municipal councils. I regard the measure referred to as a useful piece of legislation y but my honourable friends who assisted to pass it seem to have forgotten the man who risked everything for that great reform.,39
260,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We recognise the good work which he did. He has fallen away since.,39
261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not think New so. I desire to prevent the aggregation of large estates, and wish to see the country teeming with a busy and prosperous population, cultivating reasonably small areas. The establishment of such settlement would foe the best security for the safety of the StateBut legislative reforms cannot be - expedited^ by any such forcing process as is applied fo the growing of mushrooms. It will be many years before all the evils of - our land system disappear. Most of us will be under the soil before then. Are we, in the meantime, to do nothing for the progress of Australia? To my mind, we should do everything possible to advance its interests, at the same time struggling, - as best we may, against the evils which face us. There is one matter upon which I have spoken annually for many years past. My honourable friends always seem to forget, or ignore, the fact that the most progressive countries of the world, those that pay the highest wages and give the best conditions, are countries into which immigrants are teeming by the hundred thousand every year.",39
262,Mr FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is because the conditions are there. That is New Zealand's case.,40
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The New South Wales statistics for last year showed that iG.ooo immigrants came to that State from New Zealand alone.,40
264,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is not the cause; it is only the effect.,40
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I say nothing Granted about the cause. I simply state that New Zealand is getting her immigrants because she is encouraging them, to come, advertisdirection. ing for them, helping them by assisted sages, and inducing them to set up f o themselves. But honourable members opthe posite say that unless there is a job - and dried for a man, he must not be brought to Australia at all. A good many - of us in this House did not come here in that way. I came with the firm intention - ov going for anything that might turn in the way of an honest living, and I ture to say that other honourable members - came here in the same spirit, and with same motive. The countries which at this nioment are furnishing the most striking - examples of industrial comfort and decency are those which are absorbing the populamy tions of the older countries of the worldAmerica, Canada, New Zealand, and Ausnearer tralia now more and more every year. I my own State things are quite as good day as they have been for many years past, and yet last year six or seven thousand families were settled in the interior of country, many of them assisted immigrants. I have yet to learn that with a country like ours, with our virgin soil and magnificent opportunities, we must discourage immigration, except on such conditions as prevent the possibility of carrying any scheme into effect. My honourable friends ought to admit that, if all that they suggest must be done as precedent things, it simply means that they do not propose to make any serious attempt at immigration for years to come. It would be far more honest for the Minister to tell the Committee so, as his friends behind him have done today, instead of piloting this vote through, and telling the Committee that he has not the slightest intention of spending ali this money.",40
266,Unknown,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m.,40
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"On e can readily admit that there are many troubles perplexing Australia-trouble s of settlement, of fixing the people on the soil of the country-and yet one can see by an elementary survey of the situation that something needs doing with regard to the peopling of Australia. If we are going to wait until every obstacle to absolutely consistent action is removed, it is evident that no good will ever be done in the direction of inducing good citizens from other parts of the world to make their homes here. that there are difficulties, the major fact stands out that there is a crying need for something more to be done in this Reference has been made to the paslegislation enacted from time to time in r this Parliament with a view to safeguarding workers of Australia from unfair concut ditions imposed through the medium of immigration. I believe that legislation of a prudent kind is absolutely necessary. I have never taken any other attitude. It would be a calamity to Australia if any body up of men could be dumped down here from venanywhere, and in any circumstances, it might be at critical times in our industrial the history, to wrench from the workers of Australia the fruits of victories which they had won on many a hard-fought field. But it makes me annoyed when I see honourable friends opposite taking a course which does not bring them one whit their goal, and which interposes n obstacles of quite another kind. Take the toImmigration Restriction Act. I am with them that certain restrictions and conditions ought to be imposed upon the wholethat sale bringing here of labour of any kind from abroad. I am with them to the full in their contention that some kind of safeguard must be imposed to prevent what I should regard as an industrial calamity to Australia. With them, I want to maintain Labour ideals at their highest point in Australia, but their legislation to do that in the most cumbersome way. When there is a ready and simple method of achieving the same result, it is absurd, for purely theatrical and political effect, to take a course which is cumbrous, and not one whit more effective. It is a fact that some of our immigration restriction legislation has had a deterrent effect. The honourable member for Brisbane did not mean today that people are actually turned back from Australia. His point was that men are sometimes deterred by our laws from coming to Australia.",40
268,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,B y infamous and lying misstatements made by interested parties as to the condition of things in Australia.,41
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Admittin g even that for the sake of argument, it does not touch the point I am putting. The risk that a contract immigrant runs in coming to Australia may very well be such as to prevent him from making the attempt. Whilst differing from them as to the methods to be employed, and deploring the results of some that have been employed, I am with honourable members opposite to the full in every effort to keep our good industrial conditions intact. But, having admitted lhat, there is still need to look about to see if we cannot induce good citizens from other parts of the world to fill up our empty spaces. The Attorney-General admitted as much in his eloquent speech on defence recently. What are we to do about the matter? The honourable member suggests that the only thing to do is to begin to burst up large estates.",41
270,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I said that was one thing. I did not say it was the only thing.,41
271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It would be easy to quote from the speeches of nearly every honourable member on that side of the House passages showing that the only thing to do in regard to the question of immigration, is to tackle the precedent question of bursting up the big estates.",41
272,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is the first thing to do.,41
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Without controverting even that, and assuming for the moment that it is one of the things to be desired, I still say that immigration ought not to wait upon it. With a thorough systematization and organization of the Labour opportunities of Australia, such as I have already foreshadowed time seeks and again in this chamber, very much could be done to curtail the unemployed problem, if not completely to overcome it, and still leave abundance of space open to whoever cares to come, bringing with him the best of all assets - a clear brain, stout muscle, and a good heart. That is the kind of immigration we wish to encourage. I could well wish to see this vote greatly enlarged. We could spend ,Â£20,000 a year, and more, in advertising the unbounded resources of Australia, without paying a single shilling of it towards assisted passages. The current history of the world shows that the highest wages and best conditions obtain in those countries to which constant and steady streams of immigration are proceeding. It is no answer to that fact to say that the problem of land settlement has been tackled in those countries. It has not. l t has not been tackled in the greatest country of them all-the United States of America-whithe r go more immigrants in the year than to all other parts of the world. Artisans and labourers go there by the milliora per annum,, finding the opportunities that prevail there, and are absorbed in that great republic. So far from America being the worse for it , what has made that country has been the admixture of the virility of the Continent, and of the ability, skill, and genius which is to be found in every part of the world.  from Australia to that grand El Dorado. If it is such a paradise as the honourable member suggests, we ought all to go to it at once.",41
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I am not suggesting that it is a paradise. I hope that we shall be able to keep all our people. I think the conditions here are as good as the honourable member thinks they are. ,41
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think so. We are at one in regard to this paradise. The honourable member has reason to be proud of Australia, and so have I . I hope that we shall remain here, and see it develop steadily along industrial lines because that, after all, is the true test of any country's stability. Where the workers are prospering --wher e those who do the hard work are most comfortable - the best conditions must prevail. I do not wish to even lift a finger against any legislation that would prevent the realization of these ideals to the full ; but I do think that my honourable friends opposite are not always wise in their methods. I hope that we may agree to disagree with their methods without being accused of desiring to fill Australia with immigrants with the object nf exploiting labour, and for purposes which it is inhuman to even think of. The suggestion has been made today by an honourable member opposite that all we seek to do is to bring a surfeit of human labour to Australia so that it may be exploited by heartless capitalists here. I should sorry to think that such a scheme was in contemplation. I do not believe that any lionorable member thinks that anything like that is possible in Australia, or would help to bring it about. Here is the practical question with which we are faced: Can we d<j anvthing in a legitimate and reasonable wav to bring people to Australia, ancl so fill up - our empty spaces with a view to making the Commonwealth safe in the times of stress that - are unquestionably ahead. I think that we can, and should have liked to hear from the Government of a more diligent searching of this problem in order to put before the Parliament definite proposals by which this money may be wisely expended in other parts of the world. If the Government did that, I should most heartily support them. I do not think that we should adopt indiscriminate methods. I do not want to .see people clumped here with the certainty that they will become a burden to us. There is a method of procedure which, while avoiding those evils, will enable us to make substantial progress in the direction we all so much desire. I shall vote for this item of .Â£20,000, and would vote for another .Â£20,000 for the same purpose if it were on the Estimates. I have only to say in conclusion that I hope we shall deal with this question-and there is no more important one connected with these Estimates-fre e of party feeling. We have got into the habit of bringing everything into the arena of party strife, and one is tempted, when one hears certain statements coming from the other side of the House",41
276,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The v are as nothing commore pared with what we have heard from the Opposition. I have heard some most rethe prehensible statements from the Opposition side of the House. [100],42
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member has heard nothing that could not be matched and overmatched by statements from his own side. I am not going, however, to follow in that strain. Some one has been good enough to hand me a copy of statements made b<- the Prime Minister only a year ago, but I think that it would be profitless to quote them.  promised that he would not hold a post mortem.",42
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not intend to do so. I hope that if the Government are going to remain in office they will be formulate a strenuous policy, doing something to clear away the misapprehensions that they allege to exist, and using this money to the fullest advantage in advertising the resources of Australia, and inducing people of the right class-if they have a little capital all the better-to come to this Continent and help to fill it up.",42
279,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"South Sydney) [8.1] I do not suppose that among those who view the circumstances of Australia with serious eyes there can be two opinions as to the necessity of our straining every effort to fill up the vacant spaces to which the honourable member for Parramatta has just alluded. From the stand-point of defence alone, it is necessary, if we are to have not merely a training of our adult population,but also a sufficient male-population to adequately defend Australia should the need arise. There is no doubt that it is with other cognate matters, the most important problem confronting the politicians of Australia to-d'ay. I am not among those who say that even under present conditions there is no room for a vast addition to our population. In many parts of Australia there is still Crown land available, although I admit that it is not to be found in settled districts, or largely in districts in which settlement has proved successful. I am hot too sure that it - would be wise to settle immigrants ignorant of Australian conditions in new districts where they would be without the advice of men of local experience. In opening up new land, it is preferable to have young men who have been trained in our more densely-populated areas, and who, knowing something of Australian conditions, are likely to be successful. However, I do not sympathize with those who say that conditions prevailing here today are such that we could not welcome people here. I believe that there is room, particularly in country areas, for a large number, but while I object to the pessimistic attitude of some men - including some of the members of my own party--as to the policy of immigration, I must even more emphatically object to statements like those made this afternoon by the honourable member for Brisbane. The honourable member said that our laws were preventing people from coming to Australia. I presume that when he spoke of "" people,"" he had in mind desirable immigrants-that he was not referring to coloured aliens. As a matter of fact, we have no law which prevents any person who is not a native of Asia coming to Australia as a free immigrant.",42
280,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We have neither law nor regulation of the kind.,43
281,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"And no method of administration calculated to restrict the entrance of such people into Australia has been attempted. There is certainly a restriction on the introduction of people under contract, but so far as it applies to British subjects it is of small importance.",43
282,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I question that.,43
283,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"My own opinion is that it is only in special circumstances that the contract system Is justifiable. It is intrinsically objectionable, but the conditions imposed by the law in regard to British subjects coming here under contract are very easy. In the first place, the wages to be received by them must be the wages current in the district where they are to work, and, secondly, contract immigrants are not to be brought here for the purpose of breaking a strike.",43
284,Dr LIDDELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is not a strike contrary to law?,43
285,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"As a matter of fact, the Act refers not to a strike, but to an industrial dispute. Those are the only two conditions attaching to the introduction of British immigrants under contract. If they are not under contract there is no restriction to their introduction.",43
286,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What about Sir Horace Tozer's servant?,43
287,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That was only a "" Tozerism,"" which, as the honourable member ought to readily understand, does not count for anything. Colonel FOXTON. -- I do not think that that is fair.",43
288,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Sir Horace Tozer had sufficient intelligence to know that the certificate that he gave his maid was unnecessary. It was contrary to the distinct instructions he had received as a temporary agent of the . Commonwealth. He knew from his instructions that it was not necessary. The girl came out with the certificate in question, but was not asked to produce it, and it was not necessary for her to have it. I suppose that Sir Horace Tozer was not in sympathy with the idea that there should be any restriction, and it struck him that it would be a good thing, from an advertising stand-point, to give his maid the certificate. It was one of those clever movements for which, I understand, he was famous in Queensland politics, but it did not achieve its object. Assoon as the Minister explained that the girl was not asked to produce any certificate, and need not have produced it, the whole story was exploded. The honourable member for Brisbane, if he was speaking without knowledge, has only to turn to the Statute.",43
289,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I know what the law is.,43
290,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That makes the hon- . orable member's statement this afternoon still less justifiable.,43
291,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No .,43
292,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is of a piece with those deliberate misrepresentations to the detriment of Australia that have been spread broadcast, in the most infamous way, by the British press. A citizen who will spread such foundationless reports against his own country in Canada would be .sent to gaol. There is in force in Canada now a law which deals with people who make unfounded statements to the detriment of the country.",43
293,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,My statement is not unfounded.,43
294,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is. No person has been denied admission to Australia unless he was a coloured man; the honourable member ought to know that.,43
295,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I question that statement.,43
296,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I repeat it. If the honourable member questions it, there is a ready means of testing the accuracy of his impression.",43
297,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I know a clergyman who was stopped because he was under contract.,43
298,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member may think he knows that, but he ought to know that it is not a fact.",43
299,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The clergyman himself told me that it was.,44
300,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That does not prove anything.,44
301,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It disproves the orable member's statement.,44
302,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Her e is the law.,44
303,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I know it as well as the honourable member does.,44
304,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member is supposed to be a lawyer. If the plain facts are before him, and he cannot read them for himself, is he able to point to an instance where the Minister has gone beman. yond the law ? The statement made to the honourable member for Moreton counts for nothing. The clergyman was not under diseases, contract to perform manual labour in tralia, and there is no prohibition in respect of any other kind of contract.",44
305,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,He was objected to as an undesirable immigrant.,44
306,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then he must have been a coloured man.,44
307,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,He was a Scotchman.,44
308,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I defy the honourable member to prove that his admission was objected to. Many people have been making statements of the kind which have no foundation in fact. The ex-Prime Minister, who has been in office practically since the passing of our Immigration Restriction Acts, has assured us-and we also have the definite assurance of the officers - that in not one instance has a white man been stopped in such circumstances.",44
309,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Attempte d to be stopped.,44
310,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No r attempted to be stopped. I am sure that the honourable member for Brisbane will not back up the statement of the honourable member for Moreton's informant. A minister could not possibly be stopped under the law, seeing that the Act defines a contract immigrant to be one under agreement to perform manual labour. If the labour is other than manual, the person is held not to be a contract immigrant within the meaning of the Act. For instance, a shop assistant may come in tinder contract, because his is held not to be manual labour.",44
311,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"-In my opinion, a marine engineer would not be held to come within the meaning of the section.",44
312,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"At any rate, manual labour has a very clear and very narrow significance in law. [100]- 2",44
313,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I question whether a domestic servant comes within the Act.,44
314,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"At an rate, it is perv fectly clear that a clergyman would not be honbrought here to perform manual labour, and, therefore, the statement of the honourable member's informant falls to the ground.",44
315,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Unles s there was maladministration.,44
316,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We have not heard of any maladministration; and, as a fact, I do not believe that our officers would make such asses of themselves as to stop a clergyOf course, there are general immigration laws against the admission of persons suffering from contagious or infectious but I take it that these laws did Ausnot apply in the case referred to.",44
317,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"At best, what a wretched lot of cases are trotted out!",44
318,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There are practically no cases-in justification of statements of the kind that have been made. Every Government has welcomed every person who desired to come as an immigrant, so long as he was of our own colour.",44
319,Dr LIDDELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There was a case of a native-born Australian, who unfortunately became insane.",44
320,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is another matter, which comes under a general immigration law, now in force in every part of the world. I admit there may have been mistakes in that connection; but it is not the point we are now discussing. There is, I think, room in Australia for a great many more people than are here now; but, as a necessary prelude to any large expenditure on immigration, or to the inception of any general scheme, we should have some large measure of land taxation. To-day, in New South Wales and Victoria, Crown lands suitable for close settlement are practically non-existent. The circumstances are altogether different from those of Canada in this regard, because in the Dominion there are large areas of Crown land which are suitable for settlement, and which may be had on easy conditions.",44
321,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,H as not Queensland such lands?,44
322,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Queenslan d has some, certainly.",44
323,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Enormou s areas.,44
324,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member for Brisbane assented to a general proposition that it was not wise to send immigrants into new districts, and the clearest proof that Queensland has not land in the vicinity of districts already settled is that for some vears land has been resumed for the purpose.",44
325,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is quite a-different matter.,45
326,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But it is an indication ihat land in districts where the methods of settlement are understood, and where the local conditions 'are appreciated by the existing settlers, is at a premium, an3 has to be bought back by the State.",45
327,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"All that ""that indicates is that it is desirable to resume land in a particular place.",45
328,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I hold the contrary view-tl\at the land in eligible districts has' reached a minimum, if it has not disappeared altogether.",45
329,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member does not quite realise that there is constantly falling into the hands of the Crown land within settled districts on the expira-' : :ion of leases.,45
330,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There -(.,000,000 acres last year in Queensland alone.",45
331,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We talk of millions of acres in New South Wales, but, so far as Crown lands are concerned, we generally find them to be broken hill-tops or other unsuitable country. I admit that Queensland and Western Australia are in a different position from that of Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales. Within a comparatively short time, I believe that ihere will be a very large agricultural population on the coastal strip of Western Australia.",45
332,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Wester n Australia is half Australia.,45
333,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But the suitable land is not half Australia by a great deal. It must be borne in mind that the greater part of the country available for settlement in Western Australia ought not to be peopled by immigrants ignorant of Australian conditions. What I saw of it a short time ago convinces me that the settlers required are those used to the conditions of the eastern coast, and more especially the north-eastern coast.",45
334,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,They will not go.,45
335,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Some of them are going, and I am glad of the fact, because I am convinced that as pioneers, they will make a success, even though it may take a littletime for them to find out the most suitable methods for the different conditions. However, the main point is that facilities for land settlement should precede any large expenditure by the Commonwealth or the States on immigration. In the meantime we can welcome all who come of their own free will, and who, by that very fact, demonstrate their enterprise, ancl strength of character. But what will be the result if we spend such sums as honourable members have occasionally mentioned on immigration, under present conditions? If we were to spend ,Â£250,000 annually, as some say we ought, it would be simply putting a subsidy to that extent into the pockets of private landlords at the expense of poor taxpayers. Every pound we spend on immigration will send up the value of private land proportionately; and what we are asked to do now, in the absence of any provision for land taxation, or for preventing the aggregation of estates, is to subsidize at the expense of the community those who are already well off. I am not prepared to agree to that method of distributing largesse at the expense of those who cannot afford it. Speaking generally, landwere lords are sufficiently well off without any doles of charity from the State.",45
336,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,They do not want charity.,45
337,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,But they would take advantage of anything in the way of increased values.,45
338,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The same may be said of manufacturers.,45
339,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In the case of manufacturers there is the possibility of. competition, which does not exist in the case of land monopoly. We cannot make land as we can other commodities; and, therefore, the conditions are different. There seems to be on the part, not only of honourable members, but of people outside, a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the attitude of the Labour Party in regard to immigration. Colonel ""FOXTON - Then it is not a question of what is the law, but a question of what is the view of the Labour leagues which dominate the Labour Party.",45
340,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member is begging the question. His statement was that men were being prevented from coming into Australia; and I say that that statement is absolutely incorrect. The honourable member then goes off at a tangent, and asks what is the opinion of the Labour leagues outside.",45
341,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,My contention has been the same all through.,45
342,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But that has nothing to do with the point we are discussing. The Labour leagues have nothing to do with the administration of the Act ; and, as a matter of fact, the leagues are not against immigration.",46
343,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I do not agree with the honourable member.,46
344,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That does not alter the fact that at the last conference the Labour leagues carried a resolution in favour of spending money on immigration, so long as steps were first taken to open up the land. The Labour Party are taking a common-sense, business-like attitude in insisting that we must have the ground work secure before we spend a large amount of public money. What some of our friends would have us do is to distribute a million or two for the benefit of the landlord.",46
345,Dr WILSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Who says so?,46
346,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The actions of the honourable member and his friends say so; what is desired is that we should spend money like water on immigration, and thus put up tKe value of land.",46

He said-and this was a proper position to take up- "" I will spend the money to secure population, and to give Australia the necessary advertisement, so long as the States will give me the land.""

I believe that the Minister' of External Affairs will see that the amount is expended, and I hope he will judiciously employ the full sum in comprehensive advertisements throughout Great Britain and other desirable countries. We should not restrict our advertisements entirely to' Great Britain. There are men of other nationalities whose resourcefulness and capitalmight advantageously be attracted to our shores. We should give an opportunity to all desirable white races to come to Australia.

405,Mr FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"New England) [8.47] When we have the lie hurled at us day after day that the Labour Party are posed to immigration and to the increase of population in Australia, it is our to refute it at every opportunity. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Kooyong admit that one of the greatest obstacles to immigration to this country to be found in the lies told with regard to one or two little cases where men were blocked from coming in under contract. The stories circulated at that time by those who were opposed to progress in Australia had a damaging effect which it will take us years to live down. The leader of the Opposition referred to-the glorious fact Canada and the United States were receivwell, ing immigrants by the tens of thousands; but he did not tell us that the main reason was that those were two great manufactax turing countries with splendid systems protection. He also failed to tell the mittee that the United States of America were so particular that they turn back thousands of men every year on acyears, count of defective eyesight and other physiaccount cal shortcomings. The United a very severe Immigration Restriction Act, and refuse to'accept the flotsam and jetsam of the slums of Europe. even turned back people from Australia and New Zealand. So stringent is their restriction of immigration that the ping companies which carry immigrants to America are particular to have them examined before they start, because are obliged to take them back if rejected. Another half truth told to us by the orable member for Brisbane, was that there are millions of acres of Crown lands ready for settlement ih Australia. There are several millions of acres that could be ready for settlement. Some are Crown lands which are locked up under long leases to large land owners. It is time that they were made available.",49

408,Mr FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Exactly , and I should like to show how immigration is being helped in my own State by closer settlement. The State Government are moving along slowly and tardily, throwing open opa small estate here, and a small estate there, keeping the land hunger so keen' duty that the land-owners are getting double the price that they ought to get for the estates that are cut up. The result is that the unfortunate men who are taking up was homes have to pay anything from Â£ 4 up to even Â£ 8 an acre for grazing land. The honourable member for Calare, than whom there is no better authority on land in the House, dealt exhaustively with that phase of the question. Those who advocate indiscriminate immigration are anxious to have, not only several hundred Australians, that but three or four hundred immigrants as applying for one block of land, so that their dear friends-the men who are trying to get out before the progressive land is imposed-ma y secure high prices, utof terly careless of how the unfortunate mart Comwho takes up that land fares afterwards.

410,Mr FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Sh e had good seasons all the time that the Vogel policy was shipbeing carried out, but she did not have good laws until the advent of the Seddorr Administration. Then came the encouragethey ment of the small men who went there to make their homes. The advertisement that honNew Zealand went in for was, first, the imposition of a progressive land tax. This made more land available, and has caused also improvements, amounting in value to made nearly ^50,000,000, that otherwise might not have been made, .to be effected. When men have to pay a fair tax 011 their land high they see that it is put to better use. The ideal of land administration is to get the land into the hands of the men who will make the best use of it. The squatter who runs one sheep to the acre must, if he has to pay a big land tax, get a bigger income from his land, in order to preserve the balance between his income and expenditure. That causes him to employ more labour, or sell his land to men who will put it to better use in smaller holdings. It is sheer hypocrisy for honourable members to stand on the floor of this House and"" let it go forth to British immigrants that there is land in abundance available in Australia, when they know that those Crown lands are so difficult to work at first that only the man - with capita! can do anything with them. Our whole trouble in regard to closer settlement is that we demand for the purrx>se land which is adjacent to a railway line, nnd which mav be reached by good roads. Our desire is that large areas so situated shall be subdivided into blocks on which - men mav make a fair living. Those who - speak of land being available for settlesnent forget to mention the number of applicants for it, and the inability of many .of our own people to secure blocks on which :to settle. When I referred by way of interjection to the climate of Queensland, I - did not wish in any way to disparage that State. I recognise that Queensland has probably more land available for settlement than has any other State, but having lived there for two years, I must say that I do - not like the climate north of Brisbane. It is very hot, and people from Great Britain - would not be quickly acclimatized.",49

414,Mr FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No one will admit that if a man desires to settle in a certain district, he will not be deterred from doing so because of considerations as to the climate. We constantly hear honourable members grumbling in this House of the heat during the summer months, and we have also heard complaints of the cold climate of Tasmania. If honourable members were advocating immigration from, say, India, then I should say at once that some thousands of white people from that country could readily be settled with success in Queensland. There are certainly thousands of square miles in Queensland where the climate is all that could be desired.  men I have ever seen are working on plantations in Queensland.",50
415,Mr FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is only men of the finest type that can stand the climate of ""Northern Queensland, and I have some feeling for the weaklings to whom it would be unendurable.

416,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,How are we to people the Northern Territory?,50
417,Mr FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It will be peopled by those who, like the honourable member, can stand the heat. I repeat that I have no desire to disparage Queensland. It is a great State, and is attracting population from the other States of the ""Union because of its liberal land policy, and the effort that it is making to promote settlement. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same of some of the southern States.",50
418,Mr ATKINSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Would a progressive land tax provide immigrants with cheaper land than is available in Queensland under the land system now in force there?,50
419,Mr FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The imposition of a"" progressive land tax would probably make more land available, proportionately, in the other States than in Queensland. I do not think that, in so far as some parts of that State are concerned, the need of such a tax is so great as it is in regard to other parts of the Commonwealth. But a progressive land tax is urgently necessary to make more land available in New South Wales, Victoria, and the southern parts of South Australia and Queensland. It is all very well for honourable members to talk of the beautiful Darling Downs, but the land there, with the exception, perhaps, of a few prickly pear areas, is all privately owned Something more than a progressive land tax is necessary to promote settlement. We may make large areas of land available, but we cannot expect men to work it successfully if they have no money. Next to the provision of the land itself is the necessity for providing cheap money. That is why New Zealand, in advertising abroad for farmers, took care to state that she had ir. operation not only a progressive land tax, but a system under which a man who went on the land could obtain a loan at the lowest rate of interest, the repayments extending over seventy years. Under that system, a loan can be obtained at 4J per cent., and per cent, of the principal is repayable annually. If this* Government remains in power, it will be its duty not only to pass a progressive land tax, in order to provide cheap land, but also to introduce legislation providing for a national bank which will enable cheaper money to he obtained. Such a system has worked admirably in New Zealand, where thousands of mechanics have also been attracted by the action of the Government in passing legislation raising wages as far as possible to a living rate. .When that fact became known, mechanics from all parts of the world expressed a desire to settle there. No better advertisement could have been secured. The farmers there also found that, as the result of the good wages that prevailed they were able to obtain better prices for their products. Although his Government was described as that of the "" Seven demons of Socialism."" the late Richard Seddon enabled the farmers of New Zealand to reach the markets of the world with their produce. He took care that their products, When exported, should bear a Government brand, and they were of such excellent quality that people abroad were led to inquire what sort of country they came from. That is the kincl of advertising that I should like to see adopted by Australia. I.have no desire to delay the passing of these Estimates, and I have only to sav, in conclusion-, that I have the fullest confidence in the Government. I shall vote for the item of ,Â£20,000, feeling confident that the money will not be spent extravagantly. It will not be the first time that money has been voted, and not spent, and I absolutely trust the Minister who is charged with the distribution of this amount.",50
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Trus t him not to spend it.,51
421,Mr FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No ; I trust him to spend it judiciously. I wish once more to enter an emphatic protest against Australia being advertised in a way that is calculated to create a false impression. I object to people in foreign countries being led to believe that they have only to come here to find a fortune ready to f all into their hands.,51
422,Mr HANS IRVINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Grampians) [9.5]. - I would remind those who have been protesting against the proposed vote of ,Â£20^000 to advertise the resources of Australia .that we have to consider the primary producer. We must do so apart altogether from any question as to the imposition of ihe progressive land tax which we are told the Ministry intend to propose next session. Those who have decried this movement need to be reminded that if , as the result of advertising, our people are able to obtain better prices for their products in the markets of the world, they will be able to pay better wages. The more attention we draw to our produce the more likely are we to attract people to our shores. Many honourable members who have spoken to-night have sought to depreciate die usesof capital, but they have had to admit that we cannot do without it. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat hassaid that a man who has ,Â£1,000 at hiscommand can buy a suitable area and work out his own salvation. Every man who desires to become a primary producer must be prepared to do that. As one associated with the primary producers, I do not hesitate to say that it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government, as senior partner in the firmto which the Australian States belong, to do their level best to draw attention to our resources. That, I think, is sound common sense. We have been told to-night that weneed first of all to impose a land tax.

The honourable member for New England has pointed' out that Australia comprises an area of 3,000,000 square miles, and yet we are told : that we have no land available for settlement. Our population is little more than4,000,000, so that we have about 750,00csquare miles to every million people in Australia. The honourable member for New England must be aware that there is land 1 available in all parts of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Wannon could tell the House that in his electorate, where settlement has rapidly increased of recent years, the farmers will' average about five bags to the acre, or say 18 bushels, and that every man win netsomething like ,Â£2 per acre off his land. That land was bought at an average price, not exceeding Â£ f i an acre, representing athree-years' purchase; and I should like to know what country could show better results. There are tens of thousands of acres of similar quality to be obtained on the same terms and conditions all over Australia; and yet we are told it is urgent and necessary, in the interests of labour, that there should be a land tax imposed. In my opinion, there is another object inview, namely, to keep out immigrants, and' make Australia a "" close borough "" for the Labour Party and their adherents: I ' told 1 the honourable member for South Sydney that all through the country districts, there is at present employment for thousands men at fair wages harvesting, but that they prefer to remain in the large towns and Capitals. The policy of the Labour Party immigration on that account. apparently is to build up the cities, and to take much notice of the country; but should have our labour in the country, which produces the wealth on which the artisans exist, and the burden should made as light as possible for the man the land. I intend to support the vote, and would have done so if it had proposed an expenditure of .Â£50,000, because it will be well spent in advertising, and causing a keener demand and higher prices for what we produce.",51

That exemption is an absolute departure from the a first tenets of the Labour Party in regard to to land taxation. At one time, the Labour Party were in favour of no exemption. An exemption, however small, they regarded as at the basic principle of the policy.",52

438,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"At any rate, the Labour Party objected to an exemption of estates under Â£^40. whereas now they propose an exemption of ,Â£5,000. The* effect of such a tax would certainly not be what is anticipated. first place, if it did dispossess holders of land, it would only operate in the case of land of the least value, because those with good land would be able to pay the land tax and retain it. It will, therefore, be seen that the land which would be thrown open by taxation would be that on which it was most difficult to make a living. The figures in regard to the New Zealand land tax support the contention that the land tax there has not had the effect claimed. According to my reading, the results do not agree with the statements made by honourable members opposite. We are told that the progressive land tax in New Zealand has been highly successf u l ; and I may admit that though it is not quite the tax favoured by the Labour Party here,' it is a progressive land tax. In addition to the tax, the New Zealand Government have been for years purchasing estates and cutting them up. is the combined result? In 1902-3, the holders of 5,000 acres and upwards numbered 862, whereas in 1906-7, although there had been cutting up of estates in the interval, they numbered 918. The total area held by those who owned 5,000 acres and upwards in 1902-3 was 20,892,000 aces, and in 1906-7 the area was 20,154,000 acres.

The honourable member for New England pointed out that, in consequence of such legislation, the population of New Zealand had grown by leaps and bounds; and the honourable member fon Calare told us that the young men of Australia are leaving for the Dominion.. But figures previously quoted show that Australia, by the interchange of population with New Zealand, is gaining about 3,000 a year. Doubtless, some of our young men went to Canada, but most of them have returned or are trying to return; and we had to vote a considerable sum In the of money in order to pay the passage of several hundred back from South Africa .

456,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall support a policy which will assist the immigration of sturdy men of various occupations. In dealing with land taxation the honourable member for South Sydney overlooked the fact that the buyer of large blocks of land, subject to a. tax, would discount his liability for taxation in the price he would pay. I am assuming that it is proposed to impose an honest tax, not a confiscatory one. Consequently the second holder would not feel the taxation, which would have no tendency to force him to cut up his estate.",54

But the results of the New Zealand legislation do not bear out the contentions of the hon The member for Calare spoke of the number of applicants for Crown land in one New South Wales, and said that in the Moree district there were 1,200 for eight blocks. I saw it stated in the newspaper that the number was 800, and a member of party said that that was so. It must be is. remembered that an applicant can apply We for each of the blocks available withouf in the making more than one deposit.",54

The honourable member for Maranoa knowr immithat when people have an opportunity tc take part in what is virtually a lottery, they often Hssociate to improve their That multiplies the number of We applications, but not of genuine applimen cants. Probably the applicants for these as blocks did not number mare than fifty or",54

462,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I presume that each application is examined, but there e is nothing to prevent applicants from applvinrr personally on one deposit far each of the blocks, or from also making applications through others with whom they would work in partnership. A man who lives in the district told me that the immediate .money value of these blocks, if they could be transferred, would be from ^ 8 0 0 to ,Â£1,000. Thus we have a Government lottery, in which big prizes are obtainable. There are restrictions on transfer, but they are often evaded. Ill-health is a ground for permitting a transfer, and a man who knows a good deal about land operations tells me that the taking up of Crown land seems to be one of the most sickly businesses possible, judging by the number of those who f all ill after securing land by ballot, and consequently ask for permission t3 transfer. ",54
463,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In this case, the number of applicants was not more than fifty or sixty, and each prize in the lottery was worth .Â£800 or ,Â£1,000.  there were T30 applicants, and only five ' '",54

If more people knew the worth of these properties, there would probably be a great manv more applicants. Many who are not associated with the land do not understand the value offered in these lotteries. It is the fact that the Government are giving something at less than its market value that causes people to take part in them. 1I have already stated that there should be assisted immigration with careful selection of immigrants. If honourable members refer back to the assisted immigration periods in Australia, they will find that the most prosperous times were those when there was the largest amount of assisted immigration. I do not say that there may not be some confusion of cause and consequence there. It does not absolutely prove that the whole of that prosperity was due to that immigration. It may have been that a certain amount of prosperity induced the expenditure on that object, bul the fact remains that, in spite, if not in consequence of the assisted immigration, those and the immediately succeeding periods were the most prosperous in certain States. We should consider the expenditure that a number of immigrants cause in Australia. In connection with i,ooo men, there will probably be from ,Â£50,000 to ,Â£100,000 expended in a year, even the workers here have a great deal to 5ain from that immigration. Every honourable member admits that we require more population. The only difference is that some honourable members say, "" We will not assist immigration,"" fearing that it will interfere with those already here. I have no such fear. I do not say that we should bring in an immense number of one particular trade. They should be judiciously selected, and then I have every confidence that immigration would improve matters, while giving us the population which we want for future developments, and which will be of advantage if we ever have to defend ourselves against other nations. In saying that, I would point out that I am not affected by the panic that is often raised about an attack on Australia. I support a reasonable immigration policy. Tf the Government wish to show that they are in earnest, it will not do for them to sav- "" Immigration? Oh, yes, but not now ; some other time."" They will have to come forward with a policy that will support immigration, not at some far distant date, if the Government live rill then, but at the earliest possible moment. They cannot justify the claim that they are in favour of immigration by the remote support which they profess to give.",55
465,Mr JOHN THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Cowper) [9.45J - We were given to understand when the Government submitted the Estimates that a considerable amount of energy would be put into their passage. Being anxious for them to be disposed of, in order that we might be able to get on with other business, and ultimately go into recess, I had not intended to occupy much time in their discussion, but, as the Government and their supporters have been very arduous in prolonging the debatethe Minister made a statement last night which was responsible for a considerable amount of discussion- I hope I mav be permitted to say a few words. I ' was struck last night with the remarks of the ex-Treasurer. They showed the great necessity that exists for advertising Australia. His statement, which is borne out by a number of other gentlemen who have visited the Old Country, that it is very difficult ' to get information there regarding what is being done in Australia, shows the necessity for supplying the demand for such news. One of the best ways to achieve that end is to adopt the honourable member's suggestion to keep up constant cable communication with the Mother Country, supplying by^lhat means, from a reliable source, the best information on Australian public matters. As the representative of a primary producing district, I would point out that the producers are anxious that advertising should be done in such a way as will bring the productions of Australia more prominently before our consumers, who at present are unfortunately located in countries across the sea. I am confident that the Government will spend this amount judiciously. I am not anxious for the Minister to keep the promise that he made last night that only a moderate amount would be spent. I shall not find fault with him if it is all spent, because if used wisely, it will be a good investment, from which the people of Australia, including the producers, in whose interests it is voted, will derive considerable benefit. We should also let the people of the Old Country know the openings for settlement in Australia. Some time ago we passed a Tariff which will have the effect for a little while, until industries are established, of making a good many of the articles consumed by the people somewhat dearer. We admit that that is so from a consumer's point of view, but people in a primary producing district such as ours also expect that, as the result of the protection extended to the manufacturing industries, a large number of people will be employed in them, and that those people, if not available in Australia, will be brought here. We want this money spent on bringing them here, to make a market for our produce on the spot. We want the people to come from other parts of the world and consume our products' here, because we should then, have the first claim on the Australian'markets, and not be in such fear of competition as we are when we have to send our produce abroad. will hardly be keeping faith with the producers if we do not follow a policy of ad%'ertising and bringing more population to Australia, as we were led to believe would be done. Some of the statements made in this debate have somewhat surprised me. The honourable member for New England professed, with a good deal of lung power, to be strongly in favour of immigration, but added that only certain parts p f Australia were suitable for white people to live in. I always understood that the honourable member and the party to which he belongs were in favour of a White Australia. If white people cannot live in the Northern Territory and the north of Queensland, does he now advocate the introduction of coloured immigrants ?  knows very well that white people can live there.",55
466,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I was in Port Darwin, and saw that the second and third generation of white people born in the place were quite as healthy as is the honourable member for Maranoa. There is no reason why white people there should not be healthy. We have decided that Australia shall be peopled with white races. The honourable member for New England is inconsistent in advertising himself as an advocate of White Australia and of immigration, and then asserting that white people cannot live in certain parts of the continent. It has been stated that if immigrants are brought here there will be nothing for them to do unless we can settle them upon the land. We all know the value of having people upon the land, and recognise that in some respects it is difficult to obtain land suitable for settlement, but honourable members on the Ministerial benches advocate aÂ« a cure-all the imposition of a land tax. They say, "" We cannot have immigration unless the land is made available, and the land cannot be made available without a land tax."" While I favour immigration, I am opposed'to a land tax. I fail to see how it will bring about the effects which honourable members opposite predict. Whatever the merits of land taxation may be, we are not without it already in several of the States. We have heard a. good deal in this House about interfering with States rights and activities, and that proposal involves a serious interference with the States.. In most of the States a land tax is the only means available for raising revenue to proIt vide roads, bridges, and other local requirements.  increased taxation from ?",56
467,Mr JOHN THOMSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We have not yet found any necessity for increased taxation. In any case it is not my duty, but is the duty of whatever Government is in power, to consider that question, and be prepared to submit their proposals to the House at the proper time. Even if the imposition of a Federal land tax were desirable, we have no right at this juncture to take away from the States one of the sources of their revenue, which is now being used by their Governments to the best of their ability for the benefit of the people. I fail to see that the imposition of a land tax, with the object of causing the subdivision of large estates, would bring about the result anticipated. I had intended to speak at some length with regard to that phase of the question, but I think that the honourable member for North Sydney has shown conclusively that the large landowner could easily rid himself of the tax which it is expected would be borne by him. It is certainly the duty of this Parliamentand I think that every honourable member is pledged to it-to carry out a system of immigration. We were also pledged to pass a protective Tariff. Such a Tariff has been enacted, and we wish now, by bringing more people to our shores, to create a wider local market for our producers, who do not benefit so directly by protection. If we do not adopt a sound policy of immigration, we shall break faith with them. T trust that this proposed vote of ,Â£20,000 will be spent, and that the Government will avail themselves of every opportunity to induce a desirable class of immigrants to come to Australia. We have had the experience of what suitable men may do. Our fathers and grandfathers were induced to come here, although they had not much money at their command, and Australia is in their debt to the extent to which they have developed it. We have had the services of the very best class of people in developing the Commonwealth, and if , by advertising in the way proposed, we induce more of the same type to come here, the money will have been well spent. Amendment negatived.  like to have some information from the Minister as to the proposed vote of .Â£200 as a contribution to the Imperial fund for the investigation of tropical diseases, and also as to the item of .Â£550 for the advancement of the study of diseases in tropical Australia.

Brown ancl E. Goulding, D.Sc. (Lond.), F.C.S. There are also, as special assistants, H . H . Robinson, M . A . (Oxon.), F.C.S.. and J. W. Evans, D.Sc. (Lond.), F.G.S. In addition there - are eight other assistants. The superintendent of colonial collections ' is W. G. Freeman, B.Sc. (Lond.), F . L . S . , and he has three assistants. The superintendent of the Indian section, appointed by the India Office, is C. E. Janes, B.Sc. ""(Lond.), F . L . S . ; and the special curators appointed by the Governments of Canada and Cape Colony, are Messrs. Harrison Watson and Lewis Atkinson. Their business is to make a scientific analysis of all sorts of products sent 10 them from various parts of the Empire. In this bulletin there are reports of recent investigations of some forty different products, not of some political club in Great Britain-no t specimens of Toryism-bu t products from portions of the Empire which need only to be brought before the commercial people of Great Britain to find there a ready market. When an honourable member talks about a vote of Â£ 5 0 0 to such an institute as a gif t to a Tory club, he is stating something which is not in strict accordance with fact. The Im- * perial Institute has a number of rooms which are hired by various people for dinners and meetings, but those gatherings have nothing to do with the Institute itself. If the honourable member were a trustee of an A . N . A . hall in-Kalgoorlie, he would not like to be held responsible for every meeting held within its walls. He would object to take upon his shoulders the responsibility for all the utterances of an Employers' Federation meeting held there, readv as he is on all occasions to adapt himself to any circumstances that may arise. Honourable members have acted wiselv on previous occasions in refusing to omit the item, and will, I am sure, refuse to allow it to be reduced for the reasons advanced by the honourable member. I hope we shall not get into such a condition in this Chamber that a proposition has only to be labelled Imperial to be immediately jumped upon by those who seem to regard all our Imperial relations as anathema. Mr KING OMALLEY .(Darwin) [10.43] - I hope the Committee will help us to save the Australian people from being thrown to the dogs. We desire, in our humble capacities as the representatives of the people, to try not to be hucksters of politics, who have two prominent maxims"" Love your party better than your country,"" and "" Love yourself better than your party.""",60
513,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member intend to connect this with the question ?,60
514,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to show that we must recognise that politics are national morals-the morals of John William and Tom multiplied by the four millions of the people of Australia. We are the in that the people have selected to come to this Parliament, to see that the lambs of this country may not have the fleeces taken off them by the foreign wolves. Yet here we are asked to pass a vote of .Â£500 per annum for all time and eternity, because once we agree to give this away, the wolf that gets his teeth in from the other side will never let go. It is a well known fact that no man ever surrenders a salary once he grabs it. He surrenders it only when he loses the power to hold it. It makes me sad to think that honourable members are frightened, and of what? Because the late Ministry made mistakes, are we to perpetuate them? This Ministry of ours came into power as the financial Administration to straighten everything. It is not right for this Committee to vote away the money of the Australian people in this fashion, when we cannot gei post-offices built in our districts. At Wynyard, in a big farming community, the late Postmaster-General agreed to give us a post-office. Yet I get a letter saying, "" We cannot do anything until the vote for next year is passed.""",60
515,Mr THOMAS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member is delaying it now. I want to get on to the Postal Estimates.,61
516,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The , Postmaster-General is helpless for want of money, and yet this sum is being expended, not to build post-offices in the remote corners of Australia, not to construct telephones to enable the people that are toiling and moiling in the forests and mines of the Commonwealth to have a little information, but in order to glorify and exalt the fatted ox in foreign countries. That is wrong, and .the sad part to me is that it is. the Labour Ministry that propose to do it.",61
517,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,And the honourable member is not in it .,61
518,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am not troubled about that. I would not change places with any Minister. The country has lost more than I have-it has lost my knowledge, which I have still got. I am here, not as a huckster, but to preserve the rights of the people of Australia, to watch their property, and to see that their money is not voted away carelessly any more than Parliament would carelessly"" vote the private money of its members away. honourable member ought to be in this House that will vote one dollar of the money of the taxpayers of Australia in a direction in which he would not give his own money. Any honourable member who does that is dishonest to the country. It is unfortunate that in this and every other country we have so many politicians sitting on the fence, between dishonest stagnation on the one side ' The CHAIRMAN - - Will the honourable member confine himself to the question?",61

520,The CHAIRMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member would be quite in order in doing so.,61
521,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I thought I had a right to speak on that subject. I was under the impression that I was sent here to represent the sovereign electors of Darwin, the most intelligent constituency in; the Southern Hemisphere, the blue riband electorate of the Commonwealth. We have no right to vote this money away, .and I shall vote to reduce the item by one-half.",61
522,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bass) [ 1 0 . 5 0 ] - ! should not have spoken but for the remark of the honourable member for Darwin that no man is honourable who votes for this item. The honourable member was not so anxious about the poor people of Australia, or about post-offices in outlying districts, when he voted for an increase in his own salary. Mr KING 0'MALLEY - The honourable member has drawh the increased salarv ever since.",61
523,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am worth quite as much as the honourable member is, but whereas he draws the allowance of Â£ 6 0 0 per annum and regards it as insufficient, I think that it is too much.",61
524,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is too muchfor the honourable member, but not for me. He knows his own value.",61
525,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member may think that he is very clever and that he is entitled to say what he pleases with regard to my honour and that of other honourable members.,61
526,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I said nothing reflecting on the honourable member's honour.,61
527,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member said that those who agreed to a certain vote acted dishonorably. As I "" was one of those who supported that vote, according No to the honourable member I am not an honourable man. He has a more flippant tongue than I have, and certainly makes remarks which do not add to the dignity of the Chamber. I shall not allow him to dictate to me the course of conduct I should follow, and I object to his describing me as dishonourable because I voted for what I believed to be a fair and reasonable proposal. If I were sitting behind a Government I should support every measure brought forward by it that I considered reasonable and proper, and certainlv I do not think that I should be justified invoting for an increased grant for myself, whilst at the same time. I objected to a proposed vote towards the maintenance of a profitable and useful institution.",61
528,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is it a profitable institution ?,61
529,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The members of the late Government have said that it is. . Mr Frazer - They have said nothing about it.,62
530,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"They placed the item on the Estimates, and they would not have done so had they thought it unreasonable. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie accused the Minister of External Affairs of knowing little about this item. Could he be expected to be familiar with every detail of the Estimates when he has been in office for"" only about a. fortnight?",62
531,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Did I not say that the Minister might justifiably plead that he was not acquainted with the details of all the items?,62
532,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Accordin g to the honourable member's contention, the Ministry ought not to submit any business to the House at the present stage. Ministers have brought forward these Estimates on the good faith of their predecessors and the officers of their respective Departments. It is unfair to denounce them for doing so and to say that they know nothing about them.",62
533,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I did not say so.,62
534,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Robertson) r . ] . _ I have before me a report to I 0 s 5 Board of Trade as to the work of the ^250. Imperial Institute, from which it would appear that it carries out an exhaustive work in regard to tropical agriculture the examination of plants. There is paragraph in the report which is of great importance to Australia. We all know that large quantities of fodder are imported from South Africa, and therefore the folcontinued lowing statement appearing in. the report should be of interest: It has been alleged that the oats grown Cape Colony are unsuitable for use as and that they produce a peculiar bone disease in animals fed with them. Four typical of oats produced in Cape Colony were sent to the Imperial Institute by the Agricultural partment, and were carefully examined. was found that the oats were deficient tain mineral constituents which are important as bone-forming materials, and it is probably to this deficiency that the ill effects horses fed with these oats are due. Suggestions have been made to the Government of Cape Colony that the investigation should be extended, in order, if possible, to find a method of improving the quality of the oats.",62
535,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That item alone is worth more than the ^ 5 Â° Â° proposed to be voted to the Institute.,62
536,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is certainly of the greatest importance to Australia. South African oats are imported by us, and I know that the bone disease referred to in this report has made its appearance in cer-tain parts of New South Wales. A neighbour of mine told me recently that it had broken out upon his holding, and I know that it exists in other parts of the State. There is in Melbourne a firm manufacturing a "" lick "" for this form of disease. It was thought that the outbreak was due to a deficiency of lime in the soil where the cattle were depastured; but the investigations of the Imperial Institute show that it is also caused by stock being fed on oats imported from Cape Colony.",62
537,Mr CHANTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It was upon that information that the various States Governments prohibited the introduction of certain products from South Africa.,62
538,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is certainly interesting news. I do not think that the proposed vote will be lost to us, and I hope that it will be agreed to.",62
539,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Corio) [10.57] - I regret that I was not present at the outset of the debate on this item, but I trust that as the result of it, the Minister of Externat Affairs will hesitate to place a similar item on the Estimates next year. I am glad the that it is proposed to reduce the item by I know a little of the history of the Institute. In 1887, it was determined to commemorate the Jubilee of the late Queen and Victoria, and subscriptions were invited one from all parts of the Empire. A resident of Victoria contributed ,Â£1,000, and was subsequently knighted. The Government of Victoria also subscribed ,Â£1,000, and that contribution for two or three years. Eventually a member of the State Parliament inquired what whs the nature in of the work being carried out by the Inforage, stitute, and the Agent-General was instructed to ascertain whaf had become of samples the exhibits forwarded by the Government Deto this great scientific institution, which It was supposed to display products from all in cerparts of the Empre. He found that the Victorian exhibits were crushed into a smalL observed in case that could scarcely be seen.",62
540,Dr CARTY SALMON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,When was this?,62
541,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"About 1898 or 1899. The people became so disgusted with theInstitute that it ceased to exist as an independent organization. If we agree to the proposed vote, the money will be paid' really to the British Board of Trade, which now conducts the Institute. We are asked to grant a subsidy to an Imperial office.. The Imperial Institute was a ""white elephant,"" and was used largely for the creation of billets. It was at first regarded as a rival to the Royal Colonial Institute, which does good work, but the latter has enormous properties and revenues, and could not be fought successfully. The Board of Trade has a scientific Department, and it was thought well to house it in the Imperial Institute. We read in the Bulletin of the Imperial In stitute for 1904In igoo, the building became the property of Her Majesty's Government, by whom the - western portion and galleries were leased to the Governing Body of the Imperial Institute, ithe greater part of the eastern and central portions being assigned to the use of the University of London. In July, 1902, an Act of Parliament was passed transferring the management of the Imperial Institute to the Board of Trade, assisted by an Advisory Committee, including representatives of India and - Colonies, as well as of the India and Colonial Offices, the Board of Agriculture, and the Board of trade. This Act took effect on January ist, 1903. The Imperial Institute, as a separate - organization, ceased to exist in 1903; and I am sorry that the honourable member - originally responsible as Minister for this item, is not here to give some explanation to honourable members. I do ,not blame the present Minister, who cannot be expected to have an intimate knowledge of all these items ; but, in any case, we ought .not to be called upon to contribute to a dead institution.",62
542,Dr SALMON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Every penny money will be spent in scientific investigation.,63
543,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No doubt, but the Board of Trade carried on this work previously without any contribution from Australia, and would doubtless continue to do so. It is just as though the Exhibition Pudding in Melbourne had been utilized t>\ the Commonwealth Government for a particular Department, and the States were asked to contribute towards the expense. MT. JOHNSON - The question is whether we shall participate in the advantages of the researches of the Board of Trade.",63
544,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That may be one phase of the question; and no doubt we should obtain some advantage, but the logical conclusion would be that we ought to contribute to every Government Department in England which, in any way, furthered our interests. Doubtless, if the British Government had to pay us for any advantages derived from Australian research, we ought to adopt an item of this k in d ; but, as a matter of ' f a c t , the work carried on by the Board of Trade at the Imperial Institute is more particularly for the benefit of English trade and commerce as represented by, say, Manchester and Birmingham.",63
545,Mr WEBSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is the Institute not more effective now than it was before being transferred to the Board of Trade?,63
546,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not know, but I should imagine that it was, because departments must become more effective as time goes on.

It was my intention to have moved to out the increase proposed to be granted the Secretary for the Department of ternal Affairs, but owing to the sudden collapse of the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill, that item slipped through rather lying district. hurriedly. At a later stage, however, I shall move in the direction-that I have dicated. I think it is a pity that the heads of Departments are not under the control Departments. of the Public Service Commissioner, who would then be responsible for the incretion ments which they receive. They would not then be able to obtain increases by reason of their Close attendance upon Ministers. Whilst on general principles I am not posed to the payment of a reasonable salary of External Affairs. to an officer who is rendering good service to the Commonwealth, I hold that there no justification for granting these increases to departmental heads, especially of our present financial position. Honourable members cannot but recognise that similar increases are not being granted officers who are in receipt of only ,Â£126 ,Â£150 per annum.",64
553,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What interest have Ministers in them?,64
554,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not unduly blame Ministers for their action in this connection. I admit that they are saddled with a tain amount of responsibility. But that responsibility has now been transferred to Parliament. I do not agree increasing the salary of the Secretary sioner. for the Department of External Affairs in view of the fact that he [11.15] - I in receipt of .Â£800 per annum. I know that the Minister can point to an officer emrecords, ployed in a similar capacity in one of the States, who is in receipt of an even larger salary. But I would point out that such salaries are not paid by any of the other States. I object to granting an in crease of ; Â£ i o o a year to an officer who is the top of the tree, whilst ignoring the claims of officers who are at the bottom. I do not say that the Commonwealth will not be able, to meet any liabilities that we may incur, even carelessly., in this Chamber. But the finances of the Commonwealth at the present time are not in a buoyant condition such as would justify us in rushing into rash expenditure. When applications are made for works for the good of the I country, and for the convenience ofthose who are battling in the interior, the replies received are that there is no money to improve services. Only a few days ago strike an honourable member saw a man in Melto bourne pay over .

555,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [11.24] - I should like to to offer some reasons why the amendment or should not be carried. ' The Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department ""and Parliamentary Draftsman occupies a very responsible position. He is generally recognised as an extremely capable man. I finite agree with what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has said about the decersirableness of increasing the salaries of officers of lower grade. But I remind the honourable member that those officers are with subject to the Public Service CommisMoreover, they have received increases to which they were entitled under is already the Public Service Act.",64
556,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Onl y up to the maximum of their class.,65
557,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is so under the Public Service Act, which this Parliament passed. It is only fair that I should state the conditions upon which the Secretary and Parliamentary Draftsman undertook the duties of his office. When he accepted office at the inauguration of the Commonwealth, he asked for a minimum salary of ^800 per annum. That was granted.  happened when I have an opportunity.",65
558,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The salary that I have stated has been paid ever since. But in 1901-2, the salary appeared on the Estimates as Â£ 7 5 0 for the Secretary, and Â£ 5 0 for the Parliamentary Draftsman, the extra money, being paid on account of the extra duties and the night work thrown upon the officer. When the honourable member for Ballarat was Attorney-General, he set forth clearly that in the following year the amount set down would be Â£Soo. That - amount was then paid, and has been paid every year since. The officer has been in receipt of this salary for seven years. He has never had a penny of increase, whilst officers receiving lower salaries have had them increased considerably.",65

In 1901-2, the Secretary for External Affairs was paid ^800, the Secretary for Home Affairs Â£750 ; and the Secretary to the Treasury ,Â£750. time of the inauguration of the Attorney General's Department, the officers in it numbered only four apart from the Secretary and Draftsman. Now there are thirty-three officers in the Department. At the commencement of the Commonwealth, the Secretary had comparatively little to do. At the present time, as honourable members are well aware, he has very much to do. The work done by him is of an extremely technicail and important character. In the Public Service of every one of the States the Parliamentary Draftsman is an officer who does no other work. At anv rate, that is so in Victoria and New South Wales. In New South Wales, the Rarliamentary Draftsman receives a salary of .Â£855, though he is not Secretary to the Department. In Victoria, the work of the officer holding the position is confined to parliamentary drafting, an3 he receives Â£1,300. The Commonwealth officer, in addition to drafting Bills and superintending the office, acts as adviser to the Government, as well as performing those duties which devolve upon the head of an important public Department. His work embraces the drafting cA all Government Bills for Parliament, the drafting and revising of regulations under Acts of Parliament, the advising of the Public Departments upon matters of law, and he is also responsible in the. case of difficuljt constitutional questions which are continually arising. Then there is, of course, the usual work of a Crown law office, including the supervision and conduct of Commonwealth 'litigation, and the prosecution of offences against the Commonwealth"" law, and administrative work generally in connection with the whole Department. The work of drafting and advising in connection with litigation necessarily involves the consideration of questions of considerable technical difficulty and complexity, and the questions raised, as honourable members are aware, are frequently quite without precedent, and so call for a very wide and sound knowledge of constitutional law, as well as of affairs.",65
561,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What does the Crown He Solicitor or the Attorney-General do?,65
562,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The interests involved in the questions raised are of very considerable magnitude, and necessarily affect the Commonwealth.

564,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member asked me for information, but apparently all he desires is a meek assent to his assertion. He has declared that .Â£100 a year too much is being asked for this officer, and he wishes me to say: ""Quite so; I agree with the honourable gentleman."" I regret that I cannot do so. I am supplying him, and, incidentally, other honourable members, with information. If they do not want it, or if it is not the kind of information they want, and they will tell me what kind they do want, I shall get it for them.  gentleman will adapt himself to any position.

565,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,- I do not know what the honourable member means.  enough to the honourable gentleman any way.,66
566,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I suppose the honourable member for Maranoa will say what he pleases, but I think that it is ' a perfectly proper thing for me to supply the information which has been asked for, while it is most improper to suggest that this information has been supplied for any other purpose. It is only fair in the circumstances to ask that this officer's salary should be increased by ,Â£100 a year. He has been serving the Commonwealth in this responsible and honourable position for eight years, and is entitled to an increase in salary. Will honourable members contend that his salary should remain at .Â£800 a year all his life? If not, I think the increase is justified, and ought to be granted. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [11.35]. ' - I have not much to say upon the amendment, but, in view of the fact that such an amendment has been moved, there is an aspect of the matter which I think Is worthy of consideration. On one or two occasions, ' I have had to go to the Parliamentary Draftsman to get certain parliamentary work done. On the first occasion, I was told by the gentleman himself that the amendment, or whatever it was that I wished to have drafted, should be submitted, first of all, to the Attorney General.",66
567,Mr HANS IRVINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No ?,66
568,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I was. There may have been some misapprehension, and I hope there is. My idea of a parliamentary draftsman is that he should be open to instructions, for the purpose of drafting parliamentary documents, Bills, and amendments, from any private member of this Parliament, and that the work done for honourable members in this way should be regarded as confidential work, until it appears in print. After it is printed and circulated, of course, it becomes public property. Of course, in the most pleasant way possible, I told Mr Garran, when the statement. I refer to was made to me, that that was not in accordance with my idea of the work of a parliamentary draftsman.",66
569,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There must have been some misunderstanding.,66
570,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That may be so, but an unfortunate thing happened, as the late Attorney-General will probably remember': I drafted an amendment",66
571,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,In connection with the Quarantine Bill ?,66
572,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Perhaps so; I think it was. I wish honourable members to understand that I do not impute anything unfair, and that I full y accepted the explanation which was given at that time; but, in view of the fact that I had been told by Mr Garran that he would have to go to the Attorney General first, it was a somewhat extraordinary coincidence that the late Treasurer should have come down'with an amendment before mine, which completely took the wind out of my sails.",66
573,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But which, as a matter of fact, had been drafted before the honourable member came to the Attorney General's office.",66
574,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"So I understand. But honourable members will see that my mental attitude towards the Department, until I received certain assurances from the late Attorney-General, was - of a very peculiar character. Unless it is clearly understood that the Secretary is a parliamentary officer, and, so far as that position is concerned, the servant of the House and its members, and not the exclusive servant of the Government, I shall object to any increase of his salary, and advocate the appointment of a separate individual as Parliamentary Draftsman.",66
575,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Unfortunately , the Parliamentary Draftsman in Queensland or Victoria does not care about drafting a Bill for a private member.",66
576,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is the duty of the Parliamentary Draftsman. He is called upon constantly to hold confidential communications with honourable _ members, who, perhaps, do not desire that their amendments or Bills should be made public or a matter of comment by the Government before they are ready for submission to the House. I felt the matter very keenly at the time. I have no complaint to make against the Parliamentary Draftsman. He has been most obliging to me, and, so far as I can judge, has done his work admirably. I believe that his drafting in connection with Bills generally has been excellent.",66
577,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Darling Downs) [11.40]. - As regards the last remark of the honourable member for Brisbane, I think that there must be some misunderstanding. I was in the Department for two years, and my experience is that the Minister never interferes with, and does not even know what the Secretary is doing in. relation to Bills drafted for honourable members.",67
578,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It has just occurred to me that in that particular case the remark was made to me that the Secretary would have to refer the matter to the Attorney General, because he was aware that a similar amendment was being prepared at the instance of the Government. That may be the explanation, of what 'occurred, as T hope it is.",67
579,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is quite true. I can give another illustration in the honor, able member's own case.. I understood that he had given notice of a Bill in connection with the Representation Act. I do not even know whether it has been circulated.",67
580,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It has been.,67
581,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I did not see the Bill when I was Attorney-General.,67
582,Colonel FCJXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It has been introduced and set down for second reading. Mr GROOM,- I have not gone through the Bill. I can assure the Committee that any honourable member has had the right of access to the Parliamentary Draftsman. Sometimes, when he was doing important work for the Minister, he would naturally go to him and say that'he had been asked by an honourable member to prepare a Bill, and' he would be instructed to do that particular work. Beyond that, the Minister, so far as I know, knew absolutely nothing of what he was doing for private members.",67
583,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Not even as to the subject-matter of the Bill?,67
584,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Minister does not even inquire as regards the subject-matter of the Bill. But in the particular case which the honourable member mentioned, it happened that the Quarantine Bill was being debated in the House. The Minister of Trade and Customs, who was in charge of it, had arranged to go to Tasmania on, I think, speaking from memory, a Friday afternoon, and before he left he gave to me orally an instruction which I communicated to the Secretary to prepare a clause on certain lines. Later on the honourable member came with his amendment, and consulted the Secretary, who informed me of the fact. I think that the hpnorable member sa w me on the subject at the time,",67
585,Colonel FOXTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Afterwards .,67
586,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But as regards the form of the amendment for the Minister, although it had been drafted and settled by the Department, it had not been approved by. the Customs authorities. In the circumstances we were not in a position, to communicate to the honourable member what action the Minister intended to take. I think that the explanation was made at the time, and accepted by the honourable member. I hope that the Committee is perfectly satisfied on that point. It is clear that the Parliamentary Draftsman is available to a, private member, and no Minister, so far as I know, has yet interfered with any work he was doing in that way. That is as it should be, because there should exist a. confidential relationship between the Parliamentary Draftsman and an honourable member. My opinion is that this salary should be granted. The officer is entitled to be paid for the work which he does. He is called upon to do highly technical and skilled work, of the greatest importance to the Commonwealth. If we had not a competent officer in charge of the Department it might cost the Commonwealth thousands and thousands of pounds.  has.",67

Take, for instance, the experience of the United States, and refer to any recent volume of decisions given there, and honourable members will find case after case in which Federal powers have been questioned. These cases must constantly arise when we are working under a written Constitution in which our powers are put in general language, and could not be specifically defined. Our Constitution was intended to be adapted to changing conditions of life year after year, and of necessity questions must arise which could not hare been contemplated by the Convention. From the very nature of our Constitution we shall be faced from time to time with imporfant questions as to what are the respective powers of the Commonwealth and the States. The High Court was constituted for the peaceful determination of claims made by the States on the one hand, and by the Commonwealth on the other. above all things necessary that the head of this Department should be a man who is thoroughly versed in the principles of constitutional government, and acquainted with the working of similar Constitutions, and also a highly skilled constitutional lawyer. I do not wish to appear to be speaking with undue praise of the Parliamentary Draftsman, but I will say that during the first years of Federation we could not have had a better officer. He has been of invaluable assistance to the Commonwealth on every occasion which has arisen. Recently, when the South African Governments desired to form' a Federation, they applied to us for information, and subsequently sent their thanks for the help rendered by this officer in connection with their constitutional difficulties. The Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department is responsible for the administration of the Department; assists in the preparation of cases submitted for the opinion of the Attorney-General, which involves a great deal of research work; and supervises the drafting of Bills, which is a much more complicated and difficult business than was the drafting of Bills for a State Parliament under the old conditions, or even under the present.

He said it would bring that position into line with those of several other officers, and he thought the officer concerned would be well satisfied at that time.

The honourable member for Kennedy on that occasionMay 27, 1902-remarked Some explanation is required of the "" allow'ance for extra duties, Â£sÂ°>"" to be paid to the secretary. The honourable member for Ballarat defended the proposed increase of Â£ 5 0 , and then the honourable member for Angas said I do not say that the allowance is not deserved in this case; but the payment of allowances introduces a bad principle. Our present Parliamentary Draftsman is, I think,' a good man, but we have to judge of these officers in the abstract; and it is better to have a fixed salary to cover all duties. I would prefer to see a salary of Â£800 rather than a salary of ,Â£750 with an allowance of ^50. The Attorney-General interjectedThe salary of heads of Departments has been fixed at /750, and in future it will be necessary to have a secretary with that salary. The honourable member for Robertson observed thatThe sum of ^750 should be the entire salary of this officer.

604,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member for Ballarat did not say that Mr Garran was never to have an increase of salary.  He said Â£ 8 0 0 was to be the maximum. The late Attorney-General has referred to the good work which this officer has done as a draftsman. He is a servant of the Commonwealth, and if he were not capable of discharging the duties of his office he would not be employed. . The honourable member for Darwin made a very pertinent interjection, when he said that the only measures passed by us that had gone wrong were those relating to industrial matters. We know that the union label provisions of the Trade Marks Act, the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Implement) Act, and part of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act have been declared invalid.",70
605,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Parliamentary Draftsman had nothing to do with the extension of the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to State servants. That amendment was made in Committee, and was not prepared by him.",70

I am not questioning Mr Garran's ability as a draftsman; I am simply objecting to the proposed increase of his salary. Some time ago thirty constituents of mine, living at some distance from a main road, and doing pioneering work in the western part offi- of Queensland, desired a mail service that would cost something like .Â£27 per annum. The late Postmaster-General said that the money could not be found, but the Government of which, he was a member prepared these Estimates, providing for an increase of ^ i o o in the salary of this officer, and the Attorney-General now comes forward, and says, '' Yes, Mr. Mauger.""

I have no objection to lawyers, and I must say that I have never seen a body of men stand more firmly together than do the lawyers in this House. One lawyer begs to "" differ from the honourable and learned member "" on a legal question, but when a vote is taken upon it we find the honourable and learned members coming together like oil.",71

620,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"And the in-crease now proposed, after years of hard work, is equivalent to no more than about 12^ per cent. These salaries were fixed low at first, as compared with, the salaries paid for similar services in some of the States. I believe that the under-secretaries in New South Wales are paid .Â£1,000 per annum, and, in my opinion, the status of Lhe Commonwealth officers ought to be equal to that of similar officers in the most important of the States. There has been some movement in the matter of wages during the last six or seven vears owing to the wonderful seasons we have experi- enced.  the price of commodities owing to protection ?",72
621,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I suppose that increase is felt by public servants.  men having a living wage, and not in ""greasing the fat pig.""",72
622,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The increase proposed for this officer is relatively not more than that given to lower paid officers, whose increments are automatic up to a certain point. Under all the circumstances, we must come to the conclusion that these Secretaries of Departments are not overpaid. I am not in favour of undue salaries, but we ought to see that reasonable pay is given for high service. Testing this case by the elementary principles of justice, it seems to me that this officer is entitled the increase proposed. Throughout the service there have been increases during the last six or seven years, and the higher officers ought now to have some consideration.",72
623,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Calare) [12.28 a.m.] - I have nothing to say against this particular officer; and I have no reason suppose that he has not discharged his duties with the maximum amount of satisfaction to the Commonwealth. But it seems to me that there ought to be some system adopted in regard to increments. I understand that certain Secretaries and other leading officials are exempt from the operation of the Public Service Act so far as the Public Service Commissioner is concerned, and, in my opinion, that is entirely wrong. If the Public Service Commissioner is capable of controlling the rank and file, and fixing the basis for salaries and increments, surely he is equally capable of dealing with the higher paid public servants. In fact, I should think that he is more capable than are Ministers themselves, seeing that Ministers come and go. For example, we know that one Ministry is responsible for the framing of these Estimates, and that another Ministry is endeavouring to pass them. ""Under existing circumstances, even-handed justice cannot be meted out to our public servants as it wculd be if these Departmental heads were under the control of the Public Service Commissioner. At present, we do not know to what extent their increments represent the special favour of Ministers, neither do we know the extent to which an officer who, in the fearless performance of his duty, has occasion to "" cross '' a Minister, may be penalized. If increments were being granted to officers throughout the service, or even to the whole of the officers under the immediate control of the Executive, the position would be different. But as a mat2 ter of fact, it is proposed to increase the salary of the Secretary of the Attorney General's Department from ,Â£800 to ,Â£900, whilst the Chief Clerk and the Assistant Parliamentary Draftsman, who has to bear upon his shoulders a great deal of responsibility, and who receives only ^560 ^ r annum is to be granted an increase of a paltry ,Â£20. The Secretary to the representative of the .Government in the Senate is to have his salaryincreased by ,Â£20, whilst the salary of the Clerk immediately below him is to suffer a reduction of ^79. Take the increases which are proposed into respect of other Departments. The Secretary of the Department of External Affairs is to receive an increase of .Â£100.",72

625,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I desire to to refer to it only in an incidental way. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN - officers The honourable member will have an opportunity of discussing the items which he wishes-to discuss when they are under consideration.,72
626,Mr THOMASBROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If , sir, the debate is to be limited in the way that you suggest, I shall be debarred from pointing to the grave inequalities which exist. For example, the Comptroller-General of Customs, who has very important duties to discharge, is to receive no increase whatever. Surely his duties are as responsible as are those of the Parliamentary Draftsman ? Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - I should think so; seeing that he receives about ^ 5 0 0 more for his services.",73

628,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Again , it is extending not proposed to increase the salaries of the Deputy Postmasters-General throughout the Commonwealth. Mv complaint is that no plan has been followed in the granting tliese increases. If individual Ministers desire to press up the salaries of their mediate advisers, they are pressed up acnum cordingly. That sort of thing is bound create dissatisfaction in the service. Everycreases thing points to the fact that the sooner these officers are subjected to the control of the Public Service Commissioner, the better will it be for all concerned",73
629,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable Wannon member has jusF mentioned one of the worse instances to be found in the of the service. The Deputy Postmastersters General are all sweated.,73

But some speciallythe favoured public servants, who have the of their Ministers, have received sympabattles. thetic consideration.

Why should we divide the under discussion.

I alsopoint out that some of the heads of Departments have been accorded increases,, whilst others have not. The cases where increases have not been provided for on the Estimates are just as much enititled to favour as are those in which increases have been made.

The Government have not shown discrimination or discernment in failing to distinguish between an officer who performs important and technical services, and others who are not so fully entitled to our consideration. What would be our position if we voted for this increase? Here are honourable members all around the Chamber, who have frequently made application for the improvement of services, and have been refused. What would our constituents think if , when they read their newspapers tomorrow, they found that we had increased the salaries of officers already highly paid? Most of us are sending letters to our constituents day by day, telling them that there is no money available for various little services for which they have applied. I say again that there are'other men in the Public Service who have not been given a fair deal. There are men in the lower ranks who have frequently had to work late at night, ancl have not been paid over-, time, much less had their salaries increased for the extra services that they have per- formed. Until the Government can afford to redeem their liability to these officers, who have stood by the service during a time of great trial,"" they have no right to increase the salaries of heads of Departments. It has been said that the officer under discussion has not yet received an increase in his salary.

634,Mr WEBSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No . For some time after the establishment of Federation, the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales received a salary of Â£ f ) c o per year. To-day he receives a salary of only ,Â£800 a year.",74
635,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Pi e is not the same man. ,Â£800 a year is the salary now attached to the office.",74
636,Mr WEBSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If Mr Garran reared, and another man were appointed to lis office tomorrow, he would get the salary proposed for Mr Garran. It is the >ffice that carries the salary. If there is a responsible position in the Federal Service, it is that held by the men who are called upon to guide the destinies of the great Post and Telegraph Department in [101] the different States. When the salary of the office t c which I have referred has been reduced from .Â£900 to .Â£800 a year, some very substantial reasons must be given for the proposed increase in the salary of the Parliamentary Diaftsman from .Â£800 to ,Â£900 a year. J am not arguing that Mr. Garran is not entitled to an increase of salary; but, because the Government have not discriminated in arranging the increases' of salary. I . with others, must enter a protest in this case, in order that we mav be able to take effective action in dealing with other votes in the Estimates. I have nothing further to say on this question, and, though I shall probably be dumb while most of the Estimates are being considered, later on I expect to have something to say which will be of benefit to the country.",74
637,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Cook) [12.53 a.m.]. - I do not intend to speak at length, but I feel that I ought to enter my protest, in common with other honourable members, against this proposed increase of salary; and against every increase proposed to the heads of Departments. I regret that the Estimates were brought on unexpectedly, and that we had not an opportunity to deal with a similar increase in a previous Department. But I hope that the protest which is being made in this instance will be a sufficient indication to the Government of the feeling of honourable membeÂ»s, and - that' we shall be able to take advantage of some other opportunity to deal with similar increases to the heads of other DepartWhat is ments. I have the greatest respect for Mr. Garran, and if I vote against the increase proposed in his salary, it is not because I do not appreciate his ability, courtesy, arid the diligence with which he performs his duties. The Attorney-General has said that this officer has not had an increase of salary for ' a certain length of time. Is it to be laid down as a general rule that, say, every three years each officer must receive an increase.of .Â£100, no matter what salary is being paid to him ? If that is the course to be followed, we may be asked to go on increasing this officer's salary until we are paying him ^Â£2,000 or ,Â£3,000 a year.",74
638,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Public Service Act recognises the principle of regular increments, and this officer, having commenced his duties at a certain salary, has a right to an increase.",74
639,Mr JH CATTS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Not necessarily. The Public Service Act lays down .a maximum salary, which is to be reached by regular increments. The heads* of Departments were given salaries that were considered sufficient for the work they were called upon to perform. Parliament has not dealt with them as it has dealt with other officers. I am prepared to do what I can to have these officers brought under the Public Service Commissioner, and deprived of their present opportunities to bring influence to bear.",74

Do they parade, with their associates and tipstaffs, from the railway stations to their hotels? Are we going to say to them, ""Spend what you please""? The Attorney-General in the Reid-MCLean Administration had something to say on this question, and it seems to me that a Labour Ministry, believing in economy of administration, should look into it. flo not wish to abridge any right or power that the Justices of the High Court may possess, nor do I desire to strip them - of any of their glory; but I hold that the time has come when we should fix a limit to their travelling expenses. The Justices of Australia ought to set an example of economy, as do the Justices of the United States Supreme Court. For instance, Justice Fuller travels from his house at Rosepark to the Court on a tramcar for - five cents, and his salary is only .Â£2,100 NOES. a year, although he presides over a Court which controls the destinies of 90,000,000 people.

If there is any expenditure at which we should not cavil it is that of the High Court. No doubt if this expenditure is. deemed excessive, attention has only to be drawn to the fact in ordei to iiwure that, if possible, it will be curtailed.

692,Mr GROOM,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Darling Downs) [1.51 a.m.] - I appeal to the honourable member for Darwin not to press his proposal. The reason underlying the payment of travelling expenses to the Justices of the High Court is that when that triBunal was established it was felt that its members should visit the different States in order to obviate the necessitv for suitors requiring to come to the Seat of Government to obtain justice. A close examination of these expenses will reveal the fact that they are not excessive. They include not merely the personal expenses of their Honours, but also their fares by railway and sea. The amount was subjected to careful consideration, and after a great deal of controversy, reduced to a minimum. The honourable member for Dar- win can rest assured that no expenses are paid in the absence of a certificate that they have actually been incurred. It is highly desirable that the privacy of the Justices of the High Court should not be invaded, ancl I am sure that the total amount of their travelling expenses is not excessive. In the early days of the United States Federation the Justices of that country were in the habit of visiting the different States, and we are merely following the example which they set. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [1.53 a.m.] - In view of the plea of the Prime Minister and of the honourable member for Darling Downs, I shall not press my proposal, in the hope that the criticism to which the item has been subjected will induce their Honours to adopt a Jeffersonian simplicity in the matter of their travelling arrangements.

Let me just relate a 'story in connection with a proposed expenditure of Â£ 8 on behalf of the Defence Department. That amount was required for the painting and re-canvassing of some targets in Queensland. Application was made to the Defence Department, which agreed to the repairs being undertaken. The matter was then referred to the Department of Home Affairs, and Colonel Owen sent it on to the State Deoartment in Queensland for a report. Later on an officer was sent from Toowoomba to inspect the target. He forwarded a report to the Works Department in Queensland, recom- . mending that the work should be undertaken. That report was again forwarded to the Department af Home Affairs in Melbourne, its transit occupying no less a period than four months. It was then found that there was a discrepancy in the recommendation of the officer who reported upon the work. Accordingly, the report was returned to Queensland where it remained pigeon-holed in the office at Brisbane for six weeks. At the end of that time a fresh officer was sent to report upon the condition of the targets, but by this time the vote for the purpose of repairing them had lapsed, so that the work has not yet been carried out. In the face of facts like these, we are asked to increase the salary of the head of this red-tape Department by .Â£100. Personally, I should like to see the Department wiped out of existence. God knows what useful purpose it serves. It has simply resulted in the creation of positions for public servants and in the appointment of an extra Minister. Who knows better the requirements of the Defence Department than that Department itself?

The honourable member stated that it is purely a circumlocution Department. He forgets the various branches of which it consists. There is the Meteorological Branch, the Electoral Branch, the Public Service Commissioner's Office, the Census and Statistics Branch, and a number of other sub-departments, all performing functions of importance to the Commonwealth.

700,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am speaking of the general rule. I agree with the honourable member that there is a great deal of circumlocutioni, but, unfortunately, no Government has ever yet been able to devise a perfect system of direct control and management of the whole of its affairs. Probably the matters which have given rise to the honourable member's complaint are due to the fact that the Home Affairs Department has no Public Works Department of its own. We are dependent upon the favour of the Public Works officers ot the States. They have their work to do, be re- for which they are directly paid by their own Governments. Naturally they attend to that work first. It is only natural that the}' should. Consequently they leave Commonwealth work to be done last. It is not fair to condemn! the Home Affairs Department for the situation in which it is left in consequence of the action of this Parliament; because we have repeatedly refused-and I think rightly, under the present financial circumstances-to create a separate Public Works Department. This country is too large to allow of the whole of the public works of the Commonwealth being at present supervised by Commonwealth officers. The cost of travelling expenses alone would be enormous. Therefore, we have to work through the officers of the States. In nine cases out of ten that is the explanation of the delay that occurs in carrying out public works. I do not think that the honourable member for Maranoa intended to cast any reflection upon the Secretary of the Department. I may tell him-it is by no means a matter of secrecy - that no one was more surprised than the Secretary for Home Affairs was when the Estimates were published, and he found that he was down for an increase of salary. The Secretary never asked for that increase, never suggested it, never even desired it.",80
701,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Perhaps he will not be disappointed, then, if we knock it off.",81
702,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"He would have a right to be surprised if the Committee agreed to do so, bearing in mind what has been done with the salaries of the heads of other partments. This gentleman has rendered mates. valuable public service.

703,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is a rather faruse fetched inference. The honourable member will admit that the valuation was a very onerous undertaking. I doubt whether greater expedition would be found amongst any other class of men, or even members of Parliament, in relation to the discharge of public work than has been displayed in reference to the valuation transferred properties. At all events, gentleman has carried out his duties in that respect creditably to himself and with great Melbourne General Post Office. advantage to the public. There has been no increased charge to the Commonwealth on account of the work excepting a slight advance to the assistant secretary. When the result comes out, I am satisfied that the honourable member for Maranoa will mit that the work of the Secretary for Home Affairs has been very creditably clone. There is nothing debatable in these Estimates.",81
704,Mr WEBSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is the Secretary entitled to an increase of Â£ 1 0 0 in his salary?,81
705,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think that he is well entitled to it . When the Home Affairs tendering for these fans? Department was established, the Public Service Commissioner graded the office at Â£ 8 5 0 . Parliament, in its wisdom, and according to its right, reduced the amount to ,Â£800. This officer was transferred from the service of one of the States, and he di d not make much out of the transfer. As I previously said, he did not expect this increase.  sacrificing themselves for the Commonwealth in this way !",81
706,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We all sacrifice a little. I am sure that the ex-Minister of Home Affairs will substantiate everything I have said as to the officer's capacity. Mr COON ^(Batman) [2.9 a.m.] - I wish to draw attention to a very important fact Dein connection with these Home Affairs estiLast Friday evening' the Prime Minister, speaking at a banquet, stated that the policy of protection had been beneficial Australia, ancl that it was in consequenceof the policy carried out by the honourable for Ballarat that the country wasable to congratulate itself on having a good' caryear. One would have thought such a declaration would have been followed up by a continuation of the same policy. But one of the first Ministerial acts of the present Minister of Home Affairs was to call' for tenders for supplying certain fans for in the General Post Office, which, it was stipulated, were to come from the country of the honourable gentleman's birth.",81
707,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,-My birthplace? I never amongst saw the advertisement.,81
708,Mr COON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Then the honourable gentleman should look after his Department. of The advertisement calling for the tendersthis appeared over his name. Tenders are invited for fans and other articles for theFanssuitable for the purpose are being manufactured in Australia; Parliament has imposed a duty of 25 per cent, upon the imported article, and the party to which the Minister of Home Affairs belongs, declared adat the Brisbane Conference that all goods required iii Australia should, if possible, be made in Australia. The specification is for a Sirocco fan, and the motive powernecessary to work it is stated. Surely theCommittee will not permit the Minister to call for tenders in such a way as to prevent any Australian manufacturer fromUnder the specifications provided for in this case, no Australian manufacturer can put in a tender, notwithstanding the fact that fans made in Australia are in use, and can be purchased for Â£SOL less than the imported article. The specification to which I refer reads as followsNo. 7 Sirocco Fan with capacity of not less than 17,000 cubic feet per minute, with iÂ£ inch water gauge, suction and free delivery requiring motor of it horse power, giving 450 revolutions per minute. I venture to say that a better fan can be produced-in Australia, which would not require half that power to get the same work out of it. I ask the Minister whether he is prepared to extend the time within which tendprs are to he sent in, and to have the specification altered in such a way that an Australian manufacturer can tender for these fans.",81
709,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Nepean) [2.15 a.m.] I think the Minister should consent to an adjournment. It is now 2.30 a.m., and the House will meet again at 10.30 this morning. There are manv matters involved in these Estimates which require careful consideration. I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that there is a good deal of circumlocution in the Home Affairs office which requires to be done away with. The method at present followed in carrying out public works seems to have been devised merely to waste time. The simplestworks are not carried out for six or twelve months, arid little jobs, involving an expenditure of ^ 2 5 or Â£ 3 0 which ought to be carried out by the Departments concerned, are handed over to the Home Affairs Department. Plans are sent from the Home Affairs Department to the Works Department of the State, and back to the Department concerned, with a delay of some months in each case. When at last tenders are sent in, they have to go through the same circumlocutory course, and it may take any time from ten months to two years to get the simplest job done. seems to me that the States Works Departments give precedence to works required to be done for the States Government. Within the last week, I have had five or six letters from the Postal Department, to say that certain plans are being prepared, and that they will be sent to the Home Affairs Department, and that Department will then have to be written to. I have had the same kind of information given to me amendments. before. [IOZ]",82
710,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There is another Minister in charge now.,82
711,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I hope the new Minister will be able to do better, but I think it is the system, rather than the administration, which is at fault. If works are delayed until after the 30th June in any year, they have then to stand over until the Estimates for the following financial year are dealt with. A new post office is urgently needed in one portion of my electorate, and it is now nearly two years since instructions were given for the preparation of the plan. I believe that a rough sketch plan was drawn up by the Public Works Department in Sydney, in the first instance. It was sent on to the Home Affairs Department, where some alteration' was suggested in order that it should be brought into harmony with a style of post office buildings adopted by the Department. It went back then to the State Works Department, where it was altered in the way suggested, and it was then sent through the Home Affairs Department to the Postal Department. This'Department suggested that sufficient accommodation for the postmaster had not been provided for, and the plan had then to go through the same channels again to be altered to provide for increased accommodation suggested. After it again reached the Department it was proposed that a post office only should be built, and not a residence, as the land was not very extensive and was very valuable, and it was accordingly decided to erect a post office without a residence upon the site for which they paid Â£ 1 0 or Â£ 2 0 a foot, and take a cheaper site in another part of the town for the erection of a residence. Accordingly, new plans were prepared for a. post office without a residence, and, so far as I know, they are somewhere between the State Public Works Department and the Department of Home Affairs, and the Post and Telegraph Department. That sort of thing It takes place in connection with almost every, public work. Progress reported. NA ENCOURAGEMEN TBILL . Bill returned from the Senate with House adjourned at 2.25 a.m. (Friday).",82
