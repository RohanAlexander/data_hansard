I propose to formally move the second reading, and give reasons for submitting the measure, and tben, if the House sbould desire to adjourn the debate, I sball be quite willin g to agree to an adjournment.

29,Mr GROOM,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"Darling Downs-Min ister of Trade and Customs) [10.42] I move That this Bill be now read a second time. By virtue of a recent decision given by the Privy Council, doubts have been cast* upon the constitutionality of the machinery provisions of the Royal Commissions Acts which were enacted by this Parliament from 1902 to 1912, but it is open to question whether the Privy Council did not exceed the certificate of leave which was given to it by the High Court to decide the particular point at issue.",13
30,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,We cannot hear a word at this end.,13
31,Mr SPEAKER,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,Order ! I ask honourable members to converse in lower tones.,13
32,Mr GROOM,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"Inasmuc h as doubts have arisen, and our desire is to endow Mr Justice Street, who has been commissioned by us to institute an inquiry on the terms indicated, with full power to make the most searching investigation so as to ascertain, the facts of the case, I am proceeding with the Bill at this stage. We desire the Commissioner to take up his work at the earliest possible moment. We do not want to have any doubts in the matter. We wish to feel that he has wide legal authority to make the most complete investigation. Honourable members have not had an opportunity of seeing the Bill , but it is now being circulated. The preamble recites the fact that a commissioner has been appointedto inquire into and report as to tlio operations of any person, combination, or trust tending to create any restraint of trade or monopoly in connection with the export of meat from Australia. Clause 2 of the Bill revives the whole of the law which has been called in question by the Privy Council. It enacts that the Commissioner appointed by the Governor General to institute this inquiry - shall have all the powers, rights, and privileges which are contained in the lloyal Commissions Act 1902-1912, and that Act shall have effect in relation to the said Commission as if it were herein re-enacted^, and in terms made applicable to the said' Commission. It is a short clause which practically revives, under our constitutional power, the complete powers, privileges, and rights conferred by that Act.",13

36,Mr GROOM,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"The Privy Council said that this Parliament had special power to authorize a Commission on the lines on which we are proceeding now. "" Mr HIOGS - In your opinion, will it be necessary to pass a fresh Bill each time the Government appoint a Commission to inquire into a matter?",13
37,Mr GROOM,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"We are dealing with only one problem at a time. This Bill has been drafted to comply with the decision of the Privy Council, and if it is accepted by the House it will give the powers, rights, and privileges conferred on a Royal Commission by previous legislation, and enable Mr Justice Street to proceed with his inquiry at once. I ask the House to proceed with the Bill , as we are eager to pass it as quickly as possible, and allow the inquiry to be begun.",13

Question resolved in the affirmative. COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL. SECOND READING .",14
44,Sir JOHNEORRE ST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"Swan-Trea surer) [10.47] - I move That this BiH be now read a second time. It will uot be necessary for me to very many observations. The object of measure is clear enough on its face. A few words in regard to the position affairs, however, will be advisable, think. The establishment of Commonbeen wealth Savings Banks throughout the Commonwealth was not contemplated, i my opinion, when the Constitution was framed. I think that there is a quesof tion, though I cannot speak with legal authority, as to whether the establishment of such banks comes within the intention of the Constitution.",14
45,Mr THOMAS,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"Did you not say at Brisbane Conference that it ought to done, and advocate it ?",14
46,Sir JOHNFORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,I did not say so.,14
47,Mr THOMAS,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,What !,14
48,Sir JOHNFORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,I did not say so.,14
49,Mr THOMAS,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"Well , I will get it .",14
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"Ge t it . I am dealing with this measure, and if the honourable member will say what he has to say after I have done, he will oblige me very much. Paragraph XIII . of clause 51 of the Constitution empowers the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate in regard toBanking, other than State banking; also State banking extending beyond the limits of the State concernedI was a member of the Federal Convention, and I have been looking up what was then said on this subject, but I have not been able to find much. I am quite sure, however, that it was not thought by any member of the Convention that the Commonwealth would establish Savings Banks throughout the States, or otherwise I do not suppose there was"" one member who would not have taken means to prevent that being done. We framed Constitution, and we had a righ t to do so in the way we thought best made for Australia; and my own opinion is that the people generally regard it as this a very good Constitution. I make the statement without any reservation that it was never intended by the framers of that Constitution that the State Savings Banks should be interfered with in the way they have been by the competition of the Commonwealth; and the establishment of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, which came as a great surprise, was very much make objected to by honourable members reprethe senting this side of politics. However, there is now power, by legislation passed of by the last Labour Government-thoug h II am not sure whether it has ever yet tested-for the Commonwealth to establish Savings Banks throughout the n States. B y that Act the Governor of the Bank has power, altogether independent any one, and subject to no control, to establish those banks where he chooses.",14
51,Mr FISHEE,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,The Governor is restricted in some respects.,14
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"In my the opinion, the Governor of the Bank may be establish Savings Banks where he likes.",14
53,Mr FISHEK,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,Not overseas.,14
54,Sir JOHNFORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,I mean that he can do so anywhere in the Commonwealth.,14
55,Mr FISHER,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,The right honourable member said there were no restrictions at all.,14
56,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,The Governor of the Bank is restricted overseas.,14
57,Mr FISHER,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,B y the Government.,14
58,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"Yes , by the Government.",14
59,Mr FISHER,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,I only wish to assist the right honourable gentleman.,14
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"That I know. In Tasmania the Governor of the Bank has made an arrangement with the State Government to take over the Savings Bank, and the necessary legislation to that end has been passed by the State Legislature. When the present Government took office negotiations were going on, at any rate, in Western Australia, and, perliaps, in other States-thoug h they had gone further in Western Australia than elsewhere-wit h the object of the State ceasing to conduct Savings Bank business under an arrangement with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank; but the present Government did not approve of that idea, and those negotiations were not proceeded with . In the opinion of the Government a great deal of harm has been done to the people of Australia by the duplication of work and expense in regard to the savings of the people.",14
61,Mr MCDONALD,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,Owing to the stupidity of some of the States!,15
62,Sir JOHNPORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"I cannot follow the honourable member, who is usually so clear in what he desires to say. Where is there any stupidity on the part of the States?",15
63,Mr MCDONALD,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,The offered certain conditions.,15
64,Sir JOHNPORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"But the Commonwealth came in and invaded the States' sphere of business. Apparently, the honourable member's argument is that if I , for instance, am carrying on business, and he sets up in opposition, I must rush into his arms, and give up my business. At the present time, wherever we go in Australia-at any rate, I can speak with authority with regard to my own State-w e see a Commonwealth Savings Bank in the Post Office and a State Savings Bank in another independent building, or carried on by the agency of some bank.",15
65,Mr MCDONALD,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,That is the f a u l the States. ,15
66,Sir JOHNFORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"I really cannot understand honourable members opposite, who seem to have a vendetta against their own States.",15
67,Mr TUDOR,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,We are Australians!,15
68,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"Yes , and great Australians! At any rate, in opinion, there was neither reason nor necessity for the Commonwealth to enter into competition with the State Savings Banks, which were going concerns, doing good work, and economically managed.",15
69,Mr THOMAS,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"The right honourable gentleman' said quite differently at Brisand bane, but that does not matter.",15
70,Sir JOHNFORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"If I spoke differently at Brisbane the honourable member will have an opportunity to quote my words directly. The honourable member may hold up that paper in his hand fifty times if he chooses; I do not say it now. The Bill itself is the result of a conference between the representatives of the Commonwealth and the States. The policy of the Government at the last election and since has been made very clear; and, in introducing this Bill , we are acting in accordance with our pledges to the people of Australia, and in accordance w i l h a promise I made to the House in m y Budget speech on 2nd October, 1913. I then saidThere was, in the opinion of the Government, no necessity for the Commonwealth to enter into competition with the Savings Banks of the States, which were beneficent and goint; concerns, whose operations greatly assisted the agricultural development of the Commonwealth. States were I then added the following promise to honourable members. It is proposed to consult the State Governments with a view to placing the Savings Banks on a basis which will prevent duplication, and at the same time meet the requirements of the people. The Bill is the result of that promise. The schedule has been agreed to by only four States, Western Australia and Tasmania not having yet signified their in tention of joining in the proposal contained in the agreement. The representative of Tasmania, however, at the recent Conference, while he did not participate in the agreement, because the competition which is so much complained of and so t of injurious and expensive, is not in existence in his State, intimated that if the Bill should pass we might fairl y expect Tasmania to join in the agreement.",15
71,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,G i v e them back their Savings Bank and they will .,15
72,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"If this Bill passes, the Commonwealth Bank will be precluded from taking any more savings m y in Tasmania or Western Australia, when a proclamation issues to that effect. The reason why that exception is made is that it would not do to prevent some institution doing Savings Bank business in those two States. Therefore, u n t i l an arrangement is made with Western Australia Tasmania, the duplication of expense which we object to and oppose, will have to go on there. I hope, however, that it will not go on very long.",15
73,Mr FISHER,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"In a word, you want a political power to hang over the heads of those two States.",16
74,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"Nothin g of the sort. We are acting in their interests. Will any one tell me that it is not in the interests of Western Australia to have her own Savings Bank, manage it in her own way, and have the receipts used in accordance with the wishes of her own Parliament ?  all the receipts she has, and 75 per cent, of the Commonwealth receipts.",16
75,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"Sh e does not want your 75 per cent.; she wants the whole of it . The honourable member reminds me of what Gladstone once said in regard to the people of Ireland"" We gave them good laws, but they said, ' We do not want your good laws, we want our own laws.' "" So Western Australia says, "" We do not want your 75 per cent., we want what belongs to us, the whole of it , and the right to manage it in our own way-no t to have it managed by the Federal Parliament."" I wish to refer to the advantage which we think will accrue from the agreement to the Commonwealth Bank itself. We do not think we are doing anything injurious to the Bank by prohibiting it from having its Savings Bank branches all over Australia and confining its operations to more legitimate banking. The Commonwealth Bank was begun without any capital of its own. It had the power to raise a capital of £1,000,000 by the sale of debentures, but up to the present the Bank has been able to carry on satisfactorily without any capital of the kind. the arrangement which the States have made, so soon as the Commonwealth Bank ceases to receive further Savings Bank deposits, the amount of £4,000,000 now held by the Commonwealth Bank as Savings Bank deposits may be retained by the Commonwealth Bank, and need not be repaid to the States for ten years. The States undertake to deal with and pay the depositors in the Commonwealth Savings Bank from their own funds, as they apply for them. The Commonwealth Bank need not pay over any of the £4,000,000 to the States for ten years, but the States expect it to pay them interest on it .",16
76,Mr FISHEK,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"Has any State, as a State, deposits in the Commonwealth Bank?",16
77,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"A few days ago Tasmania transferred the State business to the Commonwealth Bank, - and in South Australia the Bank gets a share of State business. The State Savings Banks will continue their business, and each will be liable for the amount of the deposits in the Commonwealth Savings Bank in its own State.",16
78,Mr FISHER,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,Why should people who have deposited in the Commonwealth Savings Bank be compelled to transfer their accounts to the State Sayings Bank if they do not want to?,16
79,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"They can demand and draw the money they have in the Commonwealth Savings Bank, from the States if they like. As part of the £4,000,000 which the Commonwealth Bank will retain for ten years, there is some cash in hand at its bankers at the present time, amounting to £653,845. Under this Bill the bank would not be required for ten years at least to hand out any cash in re-payment of its Savings Bank deposits, and thus it would secure immediate control of a capital of £4,000,000, and be certain of this sum for ten years. It would have to pay interest on the amount, but would not be called upon to pay any of it out.",16
80,Mr RILEY,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,They have that money now.,16
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"But it is liable to be called out at any moment by the depositors. It is true that a large proportion of the money received by the Commonwealth Bank from depositors has By been invested, and, though the investments may not be immediately realizable, they cannot fail to be a source of strength.",16
82,Mr WEBSTER,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,What interest is the bank going to pay?,16
83,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"For the period of ten years the Commonwealth Bank is not to be called on to repay any of its deposits, which amounted to £4,072,490 on the 31st March last, but it must pay to the States interest and expenses based on the average rate of interest and expenses paid by the ""Savings Banks of those States. The Commonwealth Bank must pay to the States what the States have to pay. Honourable members will see in the agreement what we have to pay.",16
84,Mr FISHEK,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"It is a "" wibbly-wobbly"" agreement.",17
85,Sir JOHN FORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"It is just as it came to us, and it is what we agreed to ; we think we have made a good bargain. Certainly we have strengthened the position of the Commonwealth Bank to an enormous extent.",17
86,Mr THOMAS,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,What does the Governor of the bank think of it?,17
87,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,Is the Governor the bank running this Parliament?,17
88,Mr FISHEK,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,No ; but like every man who does a good thing for the Commonwealth he is hated by members opposite.,17
89,Mr SPEAKER,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"Order ! occasional interjection is overlooked, and sometimes may be helpful, experience shows, unfortunately, that one interjection leads to another, and then to a volley which is kept more or less continuously going during an honourable member's speech. I ask honourable members not to interject.",17
90,Sir JOHNFORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition sliould use such strong language as to say that we hate any one. I do not think there is anything of that sort on our part. It seems to the Government that the provisions of the Bill should be acceptable to the people, because the expensive competition will disappear, and the Commonwealth Bank will not only have a fixed capital, but will also have the very strong support of the States. We are to get all the business of the States into the Commonwealth Bank. It will be far better for the latter to have all the business of the States to manage and control than to pursue its opposition to the Savings Banks of the States, thus doing in j u r y to the people, and making the people as a whole pay twice. This competition, in my opinion, does no good to the people, and is not doing much good to the bank it self. Honourable members will recollect that an offer was made to hand over to the States 75 per cent, of the money the Commonwealth Bank received. would mean going to an immense amount of trouble to operate only 25 per cent, of the deposits, and it would not be as lucrative a business as the Commonwealth Bank will have when the State Governments use it as their bank.",17
91,Mr SAMPSON,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,What business will that represent ?,17
92,Sir JOHNFORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"I cannot say exactly, but there w i ll be current accounts, loan transactions, the management of loans when raised",17
93,Mr WEST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,And overdrafts?,17
94,Sir JOHNFORREST,MEA T EXPORT TRADE,"I suppose so. At any rate, the Commonwealth Bank will be-on a very much stronger basis than now with its interference with the savings of the people in the States. What I said of before I say again most deliberately-the system was never contemplated by any representative at the Federal Convention. The Bill will enable the Commonwealth Bank to carry on legitimate banking business in a far While an better way than at present. The agreement contained in the schedule to the Bill has been approved .of by the Commonwealth Government. We undertook to ""have the preliminary legislation passed and brought into operation by proclamation, and in pursuance of that undertaking we now ask Parliament to r at if y the agreement. I have no need to say more. I cannot understand why those who are representative of Australia should wish to interfere with beneficent and going concerns like the State Savings Banks, which have grown upfrom small beginnings to great institutions, which are managing their affairs with prudence and safety, and which have been a great help to agricultural and horticultural development. But all this development is to be interfered with by the invasion by the Commonwealth of an arena in which it has no right to be operating. This invasion is only mischievous. I cannot understand how any one could agree to it . I cannot understand how the Leader of - the Opposition could have thought that he was acting in the interests of Australia in attempting to destroy the Savings Banks of the States and gather in everything for the Commonwealth, taking away from the control of the States the millions of pounds deposited by the people in the State institutions, and which the people of the States had the satisfaction of knowing were being That used by the States for the development of their own industries, and for working out their own destinies in their own way. There are about £80,000,000 on deposit in the State Savings Banks, and I suppose that if the righ t honourable gentleman had his way all those millions would be diverted into one pool and used for investment as the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank thought proper without any Ministerial or even Parliamentary control unless the Act is amended. seems to me that the existing legislation is nothing more than mischievous. It is doing no good. On the other hand, it is doing a great deal of harm, and it has been very much resented by the people in the States. If honourable members wished to steer a course which would really be injurious to the States interests, and bring about a unified form of government, they 'could not have made a better move with that object. I hope the Bill before us will - become law; I hope that the Commonwealth in its own interests will relinquish the Savings Bank business, because the provisions of this measure will give the bank a great advantage which it does not now enjoy, and will abolish dual control and double expenditure for no corresponding gain. I think that every honourable member who has regard for the people of his State must agree that the measure is a step in the right direction. The present position has no advantage to any one, and I trust that we shall do our best to endeavour to get back to the position of restoring to the States the Savings Banks in their entirety. Debate (on motion by Mr FISHER) adjourned. NA BLLL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 3rd June, (vide page 1806), on motion by Mr. JOSEPH COOKThat this Bill be now read a second time-.",17
95,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Boothby) [11.20] When the honourable member for Werriwa was yesterday displaying his histrionic abilities in addressing himself to this question he said, amongst other things, that if honourable members on this side were not blinded by party spirit they could not but vote for this Bill. I should be only too pleased to support a sane system of postal voting, but if every honourable member on this side voted for the restoration of the system of postal voting in force in Australia previous to the 1913 Federal elections, I should still refuse to vote If some honourable members on the other [70] side were not blinded by ""party spirit and bound hand and foot tp the Government policy, they would condemn the system of postal voting which this Bill seeks to restore. The Prime Minister It told us yesterday that under the old system no actual case of fraud was proved. The reason for that is that it was impossible to detect fraud under that system. There was moral fraud, but not legal fraud. We are told that this Bill will broaden the franchise, but the fact is that it will open the door wide to legal fraud. We have been told that the absentee vote under the existing law opens the door wide to fraud, since under it a man may vote at more than one polling booth in any electoral division. But the difference between the existing system and the postal-voting system previously in operation is that the man who votes at more than one polling booth is, under the existing law, guilty of an illegal act and lays himself open to punishment under that law, whilst under the old system of postal voting a man might do much worse than vote more than once at an election and still act within the law. I think I can claim to have had as large an experience of electioneering in its various phases as has any other member of this House. Since the Labour movement started in Australia. I have taken an interest in it, and at the various elections I have been engaged as a scrutineer, a Deputy Returning Oflicer, or a Returning Officer. I have had experience also outside the polling booths as a canvasser. I have canvassed for many persons on many occasions, and always free of charge to those for whom I worked. I would not dream of receiving a penny for such work. I canvassed electorates for three gentlemen who occupied seats in this chamber and whom death has removed from amongst us, and also for many men holding positions today in the State Parliament of South Australia, or who have done so in years gone by. I have had special opportunities to ascertain the possibilities of the postal-voting system used at elections prior to 1913. Under that system any authorized witness, including a justice of the peace, might go about from house to house and practically collect votes for the side he represented, and he might do that without the slightest fear of the law, because although he would be commitfor it. ting a moral fraud he would not be guilty of au illegal act. The Age this morning says that the members of the Labour party desire the adoption of strict regulations to prevent abuse of the postal-voting provisions because they think that they may be abused. I do not think it at all. I am positive that these provisions have been abused in the past, and I know that they may be abused with impunity. A man who under the existing law votes at an election more than once lays himself open to conviction and punishment, and such cases can easily be found out.",18
96,Mr AGAK WYNNE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,How can they be found out?,19
97,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,They can be easily discovered by going through the rolls again and seeing whether a man voted more than once.,19
98,Mr AGAK WYNNE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,That would secure a conviction. The ballot-papers are not numbered.,19
99,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"It would secure a conviction, and under the existing law people are careful not to lay themselves open to_a conviction for an offence of kind. We know that most laws that are made are broken. We make laws against stealing, but some people still continue to be thieves. Whilst in commercial life and in other ways people will be found to break the law in order to enrich themselves, or that they - may benefit personally, they will not lay themselves open to conviction under the law for the sake of benefiting a political party. We know that it takes us all our time to induce electors to vote once, let alone more than once. The postal vote is on a different footing. What does the justice of the peace do? If he is a well-paid and unscrupulous individual, he can go from house to house, and all he requires to do is to get the signature of the electors on the ballot-papers. He call then take the papers to his own office, or the office of the Liberal League, or the Trades Hall, fill in the names of the candidates, and post the votes, and he is within the law. On the other hand, if the elector himself has marked the vote, the justice of the peace, if he is unscrupulous, need not post the ballot-papers. In my opinion, that is the reason why so many postalvoting papers, which were issued on the last occasion, were never found. They never reached the Returning Officer, because the votes which they contained did not suit certain persons. Intimidation is easy under the postal-voting systems. A canvasser from the anti-Labour party may go to help a large number of female servants to record their votes, and how easily it is for him to persuade those girls to vote in the direction he indicates. We know, unfortunately, that even in these days, people have such little knowledge of political subjects, that within a few weeks of an election for the Senate, for which there are, say, twelve candidates, six to be elected, not 10 per cent, of the electors would know the names of all the candidates off-hand. Many people would be guided by any persuasive individual who was interviewing them at the time. The Prime* Minister said that no actual fraud has been detected, but fraud could not not be detected under this system, because, though the canvasser may be committing an immoral action, he is well within the law all the time and does not lay himself open to conviction in a Court. The Leader of the Government expressed that anxiety to broaden the franchise and to give the sick aud infirm an opportunity of recording their votes. This new-born zeal on the part of the Liberal party makes one smile. Throughout our political history, what have the politicians of that party done, and what are they trying to do today? To take votes away from the people, rather than to broaden the franchise. We need only look at the Legislative Councils of the various States, all of whom are elected on a property qualification of some kind, and the endeavour in every instance is to withhold the franchise from as many people as possible. Honourable members talk about the motherhood of Australia wanting the vote, but what about the 80,000 female voters in South Australia who are debarred from participating in the elections of the Legislative Council? We need not go outside this Parliament for an illustration of the attitude of the Government on this matter. In the Bill introduced by them last session we found a proposition that the election should be held on any day of the week which the Government might choose. We know that if any other than a Labour Government were in power, Saturday would not be the day for voting, because that is a recognised half-holiday throughout Australia. As such, it suits the great masses of the people as a polling day, but it would not suit the politicians on the Government side. Another clause in that Bill actually proposed that in future the electors should sign the butt of the ballot-paper. Does that show that the Government are very anxious to broaden the franchise and make it more easy to vote? Every honourable member knows that that would be one of the greatest obstacles to many people going to the poll at all. We know that female electors particularly would shrink from going to the poll if they knew that they would be required to sign their names on the butts in the presence of the Returning Officer. Besides, that provision would take away the secrecy of the ballot, because every vote recorded could be traced. Of course the Government dropped that clause like the proverbial hot potato.",19
100,Mr SPEAKER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The honourable member is not discussing this Bill, but another Bill.",20
101,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,I am showing the insincerity of the Prime Minister's statement and the mockery of the whole measure.,20
102,Mr SPEAKER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The honourable member is not in order in applying those terms to the action of the Government.,20
103,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"That proposition is such as one might expect to be brought forward in the Duma of Russia, but not in the House of Representatives of Australia. As I stated before, I am only too anxious to extend the franchise and make it possible for every person who has reached the age of twenty-one years, and is outside a lunatic asylum or gaol, to vote. But we can have effective voting without this system of authorized witnesses travelling from house to house. Why not adopt the postal-voting system which is in existence in some of the States, and why not agree to the amendments which were proposed by me last session in all seriousness and good faith? If this were not a test Bill, aud if it were not for the fact that the Government do not want the measure to be passed, I feel certain that the amendments I proposed last session would appeal to many honourable members on the Government side. I went to the trouble of having amendr?o]-= ments prepared by the draftsman, but I did not move them. However, what I had in mind then, I shall have the greatest possible pleasure in indicating now, and I feel certain that my proposals will appeal to the common sense of honourable members on the Government side. I propose, amongst other things, to submit an amendment declaring that an elector who has reason to believe that he will not, at any time during the hours of polling on polling day, be within 5 miles of any polling place, shall be able to record his vote by post. We have been told that people in the back-blocks have not an opportunity of exercising the franchise, because they are frequently required to travel 50 or 60 miles to a polling place. That is a very valid objection. These persons should not be under the necessity of travelling such distances in order to record their votes. They should be given as many facilities for voting as can be conferred upon them. They have to submit to quite enough hardships as the result of living in the interior of this country without being subjected to artificially created disabilities. My proposal would remedy the existing state of things. It would make it possible for nearly every elector to vote. We know perfectly well that it is impossible for every person to attend a polling booth on polling day. Por example, a publican is compelled to keep his establishment open all day long. It is manifestly very difficult for him and all the adult members of his family to attend a polling booth in order to record their votes. I also intend to submit an amendment affirming thatAn elector who has reason to believe(&) That he will, on polling day, be in quarantine within the Commonwealth; or (c) That, being a woman, she will not, by reason of ill-health or infirmity, be able to attend a polling place at any time during the hours of polling on polling day to vote, may vote before the postmaster before polling day upon complying with the provisions of this section and the regulations. That will meet the case of the mothers of Australia. Those women who are expecting to be laid aside by illness on polling day should not be prevented from exercising the franchise. Under my proposal they would have an opportunity of going beforo any postmaster or postmistress prior to polling day to record their votes. The regulations read(2) For the purpose of voting jn accordance with this section any such elector may apply to the Returning Officer of the division for which he is enrolled for the issue to him of the prescribed form of declaration and ballot-paper. (3) Upon receipt of the forms of declaration and ballot-paper the elector shall attend before a postmaster at a post-office, and shall complete the declaration in the presence of the postmaster, who shall witness it and affix the date stamp of the post-office. Of course, the vote itself would not be seen by the postmaster or postmistress. A somewhat similar system is in vogue in South Australia today, and gives general satisfaction, although the postal vote there is said to be always cast against the Labour party. I owe my election to this Parliament as the representative of Boothby to the postal vote. When the ordinary votes had been counted at the last State election, when I was defeated for the State district of Torrens, I had a majority of only one, but after the postal votes had been dealt with I was in a minority of 122. defeat enabled me to become a candidate for the Federal Parliament. I am strongly in favour of the Commonwealth adopting even a broader postal vote than is in vogue in South Australia.",20
104,Mr LIVINGSTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The honourable member is in favour of the postal vote. W it h him it is only a question of the for m which that vote shall take.,21
105,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Yes . I deplore the fact that the postal vote for the Commonwealth was abolished. But I am absolutely opposed to the idea of having authorized witnesses canvassing from house to house. The constituencies of Kooyong and Yarra have been referred to again and again as constituting proof positive of the way in which the postal vote can be manipulated.,21
106,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Does the honourable member allege manipulation?,21
107,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Absolutely .,21
108,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Will the honourable member give one scintilla of justification for his charge ?,21
109,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"If the honourable member had been present in the earlier stages of my remarks he would have heard me say that, under the system of postal voting which formerly existed in the Commonwealth, it was impossible to sheet home f r a u d .",21
110,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Then it should be impossible for the honourable member to slander the electors of Kooyong, as he is doing.",21
111,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The postal vote was not abused in the Yarra electorate. Why? Because it would not pay any political party to collect postal votes in that division, as no anti-Labour candidate had a chance of being elected there. But in Kooyong there was a chance that a Labour candidate might be returned, and consequently it paid to manipulate these postal votes.",21
112,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The honourable member was returned by manipulation of postal votes. That is what he has told us.,21
113,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The honourable member was not present when I began to speak upon this question. It is idle for him to tear a few of my words from their context, and to put a wrong construction upon them. What I said was that there had been, not an illegal manipulation, but an immoral manipulation of the This postal vote. I am positive of that. Some honourable members would never have been in this House had it not been for the postal vote. Take the electorate which I represent. Until I was elected, victory used to rest either with one political party or the other by perhaps a hundred votes. When the late Mr Batchelor occupied the seat, he defeated the Liberal candidate on one occasion by 5,000 votes, but he aid so only because nobody regarded his opponent's candidature seriously. On his first election for that division, however, he secured a majority of only about 500 votes. In the elections for that particular division for the State Parliament, sometimes one political party would be victorious, and sometimes the other. I am prepared to say that if a party possessed of money chose to employ the service of unscrupulous justices of the peace, it could turn the result of an election in that district as easily as a man can f all off a log. If a sufficient number of justices were employed, it could easily be done. If all the electors understood as much about politi.es and elections as they ought to do, and as they will do in the course of time, then the occupation of the unscrupulous canvasser would be a thing of the past; but, under - existing conditions, the practice to which I have referred is easily carried on, and it would therefore be wrong to restore such a system. In my proposed amendment, I go on to provide thatThe elector Bhall thereupon, in the presence - of the postmaster, record his vote, place it in the envelope bearing the declaration, and addressed to the Divisional Returning Oflicer, and post it. I propose that he shall post it there and then, instead of handing it over to an authorized witness, who, finding that the vote had been recorded for the other side, might throw it into the gutter.  knows that that would not be done.",21
114,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,It has been done.  member has been behind the scenes.,22
115,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I have been. I propose further to provide that(5) The regulations relating to voting before a postmaster before polling day may prescribe all matters (not inconsistent with this Act) necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying this seution into effect and in particular may provido for(a) the form of declarations and ballot papers for the purpose of voting before a postmaster before polling day; (b) the manner in which the votes are to be marked on such ballot-papers; (c) the metiiod of dealing with and the counting of such ballot-papers; and (d) the grounds upon which such ballot papers are to bu rejected as informal. These, of course, are matters of detail which could be arranged by regulation. I thinlc my proposal is a very liberal compromise, and am sure that many honourable members opposite would be pleased :to accept it , and to f all in with the ideas to which I have given utterance, if it were not that the whole Bill-as has been said, more than once-is a sham.",22
116,Mr SPEAKER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The honourable member must not use that word in relation to the Bill .,22
117,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The Bill is merely designed to secure a double dissolution. I shall vote for the second reading, and when we go into Committee, I shall endeavour to insert the amendments I have read. Unfortunately, owing to the party lines which are being followed, I have not the slightest hope of carrying them. But in submitting them, I shall at least show my bona fides. Even if they be rejected, the people outside will recognise the jusjtice of my proposals, and will see, as they cannot help seeing, that they would achieve all that the Bill proposes to do without introducing the particularly obnoxious feature in relation to authorized witnesses, who tramp from house to house, and try to cajole the people into voting on their particular side of the political fence. , Sir ROBE RT BEST (Kooyong) [11.54]. - - I should not have risen, but for the persistence with which some of my honourable friends opposite insist upon selecting Kooyong as an electorate in which corr u pt practices have been indulged in with respect to the postal vote.",22
118,Mr WEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,No . We only say that there were an enormous number of sick people in the electorate on polling day. We cannot understand it .,22
119,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I find it very dimcult to understand the honourable member, and I am not alone in that regard. The Opposition, politically, are absolutely wanton and reckless in the statements they make. They make all sorts of wicked suggestions as to what is done under the postal system, bnt when they ar© challenged to furnish a scintilla of proof, we find they are utterly unable to do so. As soon as they are challenged, they slink away from the original suggestion made by them. That is their invariable practice. Nothing is easier than to make wicked and vicious suggestions, and nothing is more cowardly than to slink away when proof of such suggestions is demanded.",22
120,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Can the honourable member account for the number of postal votes cast in his electorate?,22
121,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"If the honourable member wil l permit me, I shall show how wrong it is even to suggest that there has been any improper use of the system. The history of the postal vote throughout the Commonwealth is one of success from beginning to end. There have been fewer prosecutions in connection with it than in relation to any other important provision of the Electoral Act. It is all very well for the Opposition to say that proof of the abuse of the system cannot be obtained. Obviously, the necessary evidence cannot be obtained in every case to insure a successful prosecution. That applies to every offence. It cannot be suggested that, in respect of every crime that is committed and discovered, a successful prosecution follows.",22
122,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The conduct to which I have been referring would be not illegal, but immoral.",22
123,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The Labour party have never failed to suggest criminal conduct on the part of those who have utilized the postal vote system.  year recognised the necessity for introducing more safeguards, and actually provided for them in the Electoral Bill which they brought down.",23
124,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I agree with my honourable friend that the system should be properly safeguarded. It is ridiculous of my honourable friends opposite to suggest that a system should be swept away because it is capable of being abused. In Victoria, and, indeed, throughout the Commonwealth- I refer to this State only because I am more familiar with the working of the system here-the postal vote has been most successfully exercised, and exercised practically without complaint by either party. There has been a fair exercise of this means of extending the franchise. It is idle therefore to say that, cause a few abuses have crept in the. system should be abolished. If abuses do occur, then, instead of proposing to sweep away the whole system, we should rather, as the honourable member for Grey has suggested, increase the safeguards.",23
125,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Why not accept the amendment ?,23
126,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"If the Opposition can show that some additional safeguard is necessary to ensure the honest exercise of the system, we shall be called upon to provide that safeguard. But until a few days ago, honourable members opposite were denouncing, and using most unfair language in denouncing, the whole postal vote system. Their objection to it now, however, is of a more qualified character. I do not blame my honourable friends, but their present attitude is totally different from their original attitude, which was ono of opposition to postal voting, root and branch. Some of them have emphasized the fact that in Victoria the postal vote was exercised more than in any other State. That happened because Victoria was accustomed to that means of exercising the franchise, and had found it a good way to extend the voting.",23
127,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Posta l voting was first introduced into South Australia, and then applied to Commonwealth elections.",23
128,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Posta l voting, I believe, was in force in Victoria long before it was applied to Commonwealth elections, and has been popular in this State. What is essentially wrong in the exercise of the postal vote should the law permit electors to vote by post? The fact that 1,200 postal votes were cast in Kooyong during the referendum of 1911 has been referred to as an improper exercise of the postal vote. It is forgotten that in Kooyong resides possibly a larger number of business men than in any other electorate.  valid at the timo of the referendum?",23
129,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Kooyon g has its sick ancl invalid, but the proportion, I am glad to say, is small. Honourable members forget that section 109 of the Act of 1909 permits the elector who has reason to believe that he will not, during the hours of polling on polling day, be within 5 miles of any polling place for the division for which he is enrolled, to make"" application for a postal vote cerbe- tificate and postal ballot papers.",23
130,Mr JENSEN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"That , provision was abused. Thousands who were in perfect health voted by post.",23
131,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"How lightly and airily my honourable friend talks of abuse in this connection. The section permitted voting by post, not only by women who might bo in ill-health, or by others who might bo prevented by seriou3 illness or infirmity from going to the poll, but by any persons, sick or well, who had reason to believe that they would not be within 5 miles of a polling place ou polling day. The Prime Minister has shown that in ten years there have been only ten or twelve prosecutions for breaches of the law respecting postal voting. The abuses in regard to enrolment have been much more numerous. The admissions of honourable members opposite show that.",23
132,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Althoug h about 2,000,000 persons have been enrolled, the postal voto has never beeu exercised by more than 30,000 persons.",23
133,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"When those on this side spoke of abuses under the absent vote, we were charged with slandering the people of Australia,, but honourable members opposite consider themselves at liberty to charge the peopio at large with fraudulent and criminal practices in connection with the exercise of the postal vote. What is slander on our part is commendable patriotism on tlieirs. From every platf o r m they have abused us for our of the postal vote. When we have spoken of the possibility of f r a u d in connection with the exercise of the absent vote, we have been charged with slandering the people; but the real slanderers are honhonorable orable members opposite, who, without a shadow of evidence, impute all sorts of certain Labour constituencies. crimes and frauds to the community i connection with the exercise of the postal quite as radical as vote.

The people of Kooyong legitimately took advantage of the facilistituency, ties for voting that the law gave them.",24

171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Stand ing order 268 is as followsNo member shall read extracts papers or other documents referring to debates in the House during the same session. - The honourable member for Oxley is, therefore, out of order.",26
172,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I am pleased to know that the Government ""Whip is so well acquainted with the leading article that I desire to quote.",26
173,Mr GREENE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,I have not read the article.,26
174,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I think the honourable member is acquainted with its contents, and I only hope that many people throughout the Gommonwealth have the same knowledge of it.",26
175,Mr GREENE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,I hope the honourable member will accept my assurance that I have not seen a newspaper this morning.,26
176,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I accept the honourable member's assurance. The Government a month or two ago appointed permanent Divisional Returning Oflicers, and now introduce a Bill which they say is to further safeguard the interests of the electors; and yet, at the same time, there is in existence a Royal Commission which is inquiring into the question of electoral reform. If the Government have any confidence in that Commission why have they not waited for its report and suggestions, which would probably have been of a practical character, and of some use to the country? We can only conclude that the Government have - not that confidence which they ought to have in a body of their own creation.  was introduced before the Royal Oommission was appointed.",26
177,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"All the same, I think it was the duty of the Government to wait until the report of the Royal Commission had been presented. This would have only been treating the Commission with some sort of decency and respect; but the whole position shows that the newspaper, to which I have already referred, is quite right in its strictures on the Government. We are told by members of the Government and their supporters that there have been no electoral frauds where the postal vote has been exercised, but we have ample evidence that at Charters Towers, for instance, immediately the writs were issued, the managers of the mines in the neighbourhood made a personal canvass, and, under threat of dismissing the husbands, induced many women to vote for candifrom newsdates of whom they disapproved.  member know that of his own knowledge?",26
178,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The facts are on evidence, and the honourable member, as one of the Electoral Commission, ought to be aware of them.",26
179,Mr STUMM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Where were these facts proved?,26
180,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"They were proved before an electoral tribunal under the State law in Queensland. The honourable member for Kooyong. has told us that no prosecutions have taken place in connection with postal voting; but Mr. Kidston, in 1908, when speaking on an amendment of the State Act, which had for its object the repeal of the postal voting provisions, said that although much corruption had taken place, and many frauds had been committed, if was very difficult to obtain proof. Por that reason, rather than go tb the trouble and expense of trying to prove the cases, he preferred to delete the section from the Act altogether. Later I shall quote his opinion on the postal vote. We have the experience of Queensland and the Commonwealth with regard to the vote, and statistics show that a greater percentage of votes has been polled in both cases since the abolition of the postal vote than before. If the Government persist in its reintroduction, after taking those figures into consideration, they must have some ulterior motive than wanting to benefit the people of the Commonwealth. The postal voting provisions are open to malpractice and corruption of every description, .and these have been practised extensively throughout the States, and during Commonwealth elections as well.  statement. It does not refer to New South Wales. Confine yourself to Queensland, and you will be on safe ground.",26
181,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Ne w South Wales has no postal vote. ,27
182,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"They found the evil of it, and that is why it has been abolished, just as happened in Queensland.",27
183,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,To o many people voted for our side under it.,27
184,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"It is the power of money that compels people to vote on the right honourable member's side under the . postal voting provisions. To re-introduce the postal vote is to bring in something pregnant with corruption and malpractice of every description. If a referendum of the people were taken on the question, I am sure they would not agree to it. People are worried and harassed enough now for three or four weeks previous to an election, and the absent voting provisions are all that are necessary. Experience shows that the people prefer the absent vote to the postal vote. I 1910 Commonwealth election only 62 per cent, of the people voted, with the postal vote in existence. At the last election 72 per cent, voted, and there was no postal vote to assist them.  been larger if they had had the postal vote.",27
185,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"There is nothing in the whole history of the postal vote to justify that assertion. Since its abolition, both in State and Commonwealth politics, the percentage of votes recorded has been greater. In 1907 the percentage of votes recorded in the Queensland State elections was 71.61. In 1908 it was 68.39. That was the last year in which the postal vote was in existence in that State, although it has lately been re-introduced, and will be used at the next election. In 1909, without the postal vote, the percentage of votes recorded was 72.39, and in 1912 it was 75.52. Where is the evidence that the postal vote was of any value to the people of Queensland? Has it assisted them in any way in recording their votes, or has its abolition taken away from them the opportunity of voting?  centage increase in the town populations during those years?",27
186,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I can tell the honourable member, for his own information, that in 1908, when the postal vote was in existence, fifteen town electorates in Queensland polled 13,000 odd postal votes, and fifty-seven country electorates polled only 7,000 postal votes, showing how extensively the people of the towns used the system as compared with the country people. If the country people can do without it , surely the people in the towns do not need it to the extent which the Government allege?",27
187,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Where is the harm in tlieir using it?,27
188,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,There is great harm in any elector using it if he can go to the ballot-box. It was not introduced for that purpose.,27
189,Mr BURNS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,More than one-tenth of the postal votes were used in one town alone-Charter s Towers.,27
190,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"And at Warwick, in 1908, Mr Barnes polled 1,299 votes, of which 570 were postal votes. His majority was only ninety. There is also a n the property vote in Queensland, which for bad qualities is practically on all-fours with the postal vote. During the last State election a Mr Corser was elected, and Mr Mitchell lodged a petition against his return. The matter was contested in the Law Courts for about a week, and then it was agreed to fight the election again. Whilst the case was being heard, I think Mr Corser had some sort of idea that the election might be fought over again, and forty-four electors in the Wide Bay electorate transferred their votes to the Maryborough electorate. On the night of the second election the result was announced as a tie, but after a recount Mr Corser won by two votes. It will, therefore, be seen that the people who were enabled to transfer their property votes from Wide Bay to Maryborough gave the Government candidate an unfair advantage over the Labour candidate, and helped him to win the election.  porters in Queensland any property I",27
191,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"They have some, but they do not go in for that kind of practice. In 1907 the proportion of women who recorded their votes in Queensland was 68.64 per cent., and in 1908 it was 69.5 per cent. In 1909, after the abolition of the postal vote, it was 69.36, and in 1912, 75.2, so that there is no evidence that the women folk want the postal vote, or that it was in any way helpful to them in recording their votes. Without the aid of the postal vote the percentage of women voting was more than with the aid of it ; proving that the postal vote is of no use to the majority of women who are desirous of recording their votes in the proper manner. We, on this side, admit that there is a small percentage of women who require the aid of the postal vote at different periods, and we are prepared to see provision made to enable these women to record their votes by post; also to enable old folk who cannot travel to polling booths to vote, so that they may not be deprived of a privilege they had previously enjoyed. Every honourable member on this side would agree to amendments giving these people the right to vote by post, whilst safeguarding the privilege to such an extent that it could not be abused as it has been in the past; and, if the Government would reintroduce the postal vote to that extent, with proper safeguards, I think tliey would find that that is all that is desired by a majority of the people of Australia. Unless Ministers show some desire to meet the wishes of the people in this way, we may conclude that they have some ulterior motive in introducing this Bill .  was your party that disfranchised those old people.",28
192,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Our party has not done so. More old and sick people were able to use, and must have used, our system of voting at the last election, because tliere was a 10 per cent, higher vote than at any previous Federal election. I am in a position to prove that malpractice and corruption of a very extensive nature took place in Queensland under the postal voting system. I refer, first of all, to the Warwick election, held on 5th February, 1908, and I propose to submit the names of canvassers who assisted Mr Barnes in his campaign. I have in my possession the Queensland Parliamentary Papers which include the evidence taken before the tribunal which dealt with the Warwick election, the case that was responsible for the Queensland Government amending the Act by deleting the postal voting provisions. Honourable members can see these statements if they wish to do so. The names that I shall use are only some of the canvassers who worked for Mr Barnes. They are Messrs. Selke, Fern, Smith, Collins, Robinson, MCDougall, Thompson, Pugh, Rose, Morgan, Suter, and Whitman. It was proved during the hearing of the case that each of these canvassers was instrumental in offering bribes or money to different electors at different periods for the purpose of securing postal votes in the favour of Mr Barnes.  cuted 1",28
193,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"No . It is my object to connect these different persons with the securing of postal votes and the offering of money for them. Mr. Alfred John Wilson, of Canning-street, Warwick, swore, during the hearing of the case, that he was induced to go to a certain hotel, where he was made drunk, and induced to sign a postal vote, and that he received 30s. for himself, his wife, and for his sons for votes for Mr Barnes. This evidence can be found on page 37 of the Queensland Parliamentary Papers. This Mr Wilson had to be taken out of the electorate on the day of the election, otherwise his vote would have been challenged, and, in all probability, not allowed. It was stated in evidence that a day or two before the election, he was taken out of the electorate with the object of keeping him out on polling day. On page 70 of the same papers is the evidence of John Self, of Glenroad, Warwick. He swore that he was offered and refused £ 5 for his postal vote by Collins and Smith, whom he recognised as canvassers for Mr Barnes. These are some of the abuses that occurred under the postal voting system in Queensland, and which will be repeated under the Commonwealth system if this Bill is passed. On page 67 of the Queensland Parliamentary Papers is the evidence of Charles Bishop, of Morgan Park, Warwick, who admitted having received £1 for his postal vote for Barnes. On page 72 is the evidence Andrew Hackett, of Palmerin-street, Warwick, who swore to having been paid 2s. by Selke for his postal vote for Barnes. He was not very well paid. Here is something else which took place in connection with the Warwick election, in Queensland, in December, 1908. This will be found on page 52 of ber the Queensland Parliamentary William Kyling, cab-driver, swore that he went to Mr Barnes' committee rooms at 6.30 ou the morning of the election, and was there directed by Selke and to go to the School of Arts Hotel and get case of beer and spirits, and then go Comino's restaurant and get a case of victuals. He was then to go to the mercial Hotel and get four persons who had recorded their postal votes, and ib was necessary to get out of the electorate on election day for the purpose of making their postal votes valid. The following are the names of the whp had to be takqn out of the electorate on the day of the election in order to validate tiieir postal votes:-Bas Stevens, Frank Craig, James Craig, William Chandler, and Perrin. They were taken out to Mr MCDougalFs farm at Sladealthough ville, 6 or 7 miles from Warwick, and to remain there until the election was over. Geo. Hocking, a cab-diiver, gave evidence to show that he had to do the same kind of thing in connection with many persons who voted by post at that election. When we are told by our orable friends opposite that the postal vote is not subject to abuse, the evidence of its operation in Queensland should quite sumcient to controvert that stateway. ment. Edward John Page, a cab-driver, whose evidence appears on page 54 of Queensland Parliamentary Papers, swore that he was sent out to Sladeville on evening of the day of election, and after the poll was closed, in order to postal voters back to the town. This evidence shows the way in which Mr. Barnes' committee used the postal vote tactics. on the occasion referred to. James Fern and Selke did thp major portion of canvassing work at the election, and Fern admitted in his evidence before elections tribunal that he had received $5 Pffrweek for canvassing. Several other persons received the same wages and £2 10s. per week. Mr Sliarpe. for canvassing. Fern admitted giving Mr the cabmen their instructions to go to of the hotels and other places to pick uppostal voters, and take them out of the electorate, and also giving the instruction to the cabman to go to Sladevillein the evening in order to bring those voters back to the town. It was admitted that the election cost £535. The total votes polled were 2,512, and of this numBarnes polled 1,299 votes, so that hisPapers. votes cost him 8s. 4d. each.",28
194,Mr RILEY,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,That was cheap.,29
195,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"It was cheap for Fern Barnes. The Prime Minister asked why, a We are afraid of the postal vote, and it to is not unreasonable to say that we are, afraid of it fqr the same reason that the ComLabour party in Queensland had to be afraid of it in the 1908 State elections. whom When a Liberal candidate could spend £500 or £600 in contesting a State election, how much would he spend in con-r testing a Federal electorate five or six men times as large? We could not expect to compete against Liberal candidates with £3,000 or £4,000 at their disposal, if they were allowed to manipulate the postal vote in the manner I have described, We 1 must oppose the Bil l in its present form,, we have explained that we are had prepared to assist the Government to provide for postal voting under proper conditions, which will prevent the abuse of the system. When we find that it is the intention of the Government to restore the old postal voting provisions of hon the Commonwealth Act, and adopt practically the system which led to so muchabuse in Queensland, it is our duty to be oppose such a proposal in every possible Mr Selke admitted, in connection with the Warwick election in 1908, that the on the day of election he had drawn a cheque for £50, which he said was for the distribution amongst the canvassers, to enable them to cope with the expense of bring the conducting the election.",29
196,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Thos e are Liberal;,29
197,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"They are; but it. is still the hard to imagine why the canvassers should want so much on the day of electhe tion, when, it was admitted before the elections tribunal that some of them had been receiving for some time 30,s., £2,",29
198,Mr BAMEOED,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The honourable memhas ber forgets that they bave 6d. drinks .Warwick.,30
199,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Evidenc e was given of the great quantity of beer and spirits that was consumed at the election, though Mr Barnes is recognised as a staunch teetotaller, and probably he did not drink much of it. As money was spent freely on the day of election, and lavishly some time previous to that day, it must recorded. be concluded that a great deal of it was not expended for refreshments. We cannot agree to accept the postal vote in form proposed by the Government, but they are prepared to accept the amend the poll. ments of the Bill suggested by the Opposition, they will have little trouble carrying the measure. We have been told that it is reasonable to assume in districts or States in which the highest postal vote is recorded the birth rate should be the highest. I have collected a few figures which show the fallacy that assumption. In 1908, the percentage of electors who recorded their votes in Victoria was 53.4, and in 1911 63.61, out the birth-rate in Victoria during 1910 was, I find, only 24.51. Soutli Australia, i'n 1910, the percentage of electors who recorded their votes 64.3; in 1912, it was 68.93; and birth rate in that State was 26.28. mania supplies the best figures connection, and no doubt the honourable member for Wilmot will have something to say on the subject. In 1909, the percentage of electors who recorded their votes in Tasmania was only 46.67, and in 1912 it was 69.73; whilst the birth rate was the highest of any of the States, namely, 39.25. I have not the centages for Western Australia, as received a wire giving the number of votes recorded only a few hours ago. 1908, in Western Australia, 75,823 votes were recorded, and in 1911 91,635. The percentage of postal votes on occasion was very small, as I find 1908 only 6,216 were recorded, and 1911 only 7,576. Sitting suspended from. 1 to 2.30 p.m.",30
200,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Before lunch I was quoting the percentage of figures during the last two elections in the monwealth and State elections, showing the percentage of votes polled, and percentage of the birth rate. The figures show plainly that when the postal not been in existence we have polled in a very much heavier vote for the State and the Commonwealth. Under those conditions, I do not think our opponents can have any argument for the restoration of the postal vote on those grounds. It has been proved, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the postal vote was of no use during an election for the purfor pose of increasing the number of votes",30
201,Mr SAMPSON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The honourable memthe ber must admit that there were a number if of sick people who were unable to go to,30
202,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"We are prepared to in give those people an opportunity of recording their votes, but not under the. that conditions which the Government desire to re-establish. We are not prepared to revert to the old system, by which those who had the most money could get the of most votes. We want all candidates and all parties to have an equal opportunity of getting votes; but when the postal vote system was in existence only the people with money were in the position to colI n lect those votes, because immediately the writs were issued every house in the was State where there was a postal vote be the came a polling booth, and from those Tashouses many votes were collected. That in this is the reason why our opponents are anxious to re-introduce that old system of postal voting. They know that it is not a particular candidate or policy that is likely to be successful at an election, but that the party with the greatest amount of money to spend will persucceed. For that reason we are not goI ing to permit the Government to carry this BilL If they are anxious to bring In forward a measure to give the sick and invalid people an opportunity of recording their votes, let them agree to the each amendments suggested by honourable that in members of the Opposition. We wiB in then give them an opportunity of placing this Bill on the statute-book in a reasonable and decent form, but not under the conditions which we were accustomed to in the past, or under the polled conditions which the Queensland GoComvernment propose to re-introduce in that State today. During the Federal the election of 1907 21,904 postal vote certificates were issued,, and of that number vote 20,624 were polled, and 1,280 were not returned. During the 1910 election, 36,820 postal vote certificates were issued, and 29,249 were polled; 2,166 were returned too late to be counted, and 5,445 were not returned at all. quote the figures for the different States in order to show that the State of Victoria is a "" w h a l e "" on the postal voting system;' they are New South Wales, 6,219; Queensland, 4,020; Western Australia, 1,977; South Australia, 1,751; Tasmania, 1,233; and Victoria, 14,049.",30
203,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,What year are quoting?,31
204,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The general elections of 1910, the last occasion when the postal vote was in operation. In 1910 the number of votes recorded in the Commonwealth was 62.80 per cent, of the enrolment, and in 1913, without the aid of the postal vote, but with the assistance of the absent vote, the percentage was 73.42. The latter election took place on a wet day. In face of those figures, where is the argument in favour of postal voting? Can my honourable friends _on the Government side produce an argument which will show that the postal vote was of any use to the Commonwealth? We on this side will not deny a vote to our sick and invalid friends, but they shall have it only with safeguards, and under conditions which will prevent the malpractices and corruption which prevailed in the past in connection with the postal vote.  auspices.",31
205,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"No , under Federal auspices. The absent vote is much more popular with the people of the Commonwealth, having regard to the fact that, during the election of 1913, the number of absent votes applied for was over 193,000. From those figures it will be seen that the absent vote is much more acceptable to the people than the postal-voting system that previously existed. Those figures cannot be denied, and are suflicient evidence to prove that the postal vote is not necessary in any form, and certainly not under the conditions which the Government propose in this Bill . We'have been told that the Queensland Government are re-introducing the postal vote, and I should like to quote to honourable members what took place in the Queensland Assembly immediately after the election which preceded the repeal of the postal vote. This is a clause from the Governor's Speech at the opening of the first I will session after the 1908 election, and, of course, that clause had the sanction of the GovernmentThe last two elections have demonstrated that, in some respects, our electoral law is defective. In particular, the postal vote has been found to be a serious invasion of the secrecy of the ballot, and to afford facilities for practices which interfere with the expression of the opinion of the electors. It is thereyou fore the intention of my Advisers to re-submit for your consideration the Bill introduced last year for removing these defects. The Home Secretary in that MinistryI think it was Mr Hawthorne at the time, and he is not a Labour man, as honourable members are aware",31
206,Mr FENTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,It was a Liberal Government that repealed the postal-voting provisions in Queensland.,31
207,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"But they had the assistance of the Labour party on that occasion. This is the opinion expressed by Mr HawthorneI t has been found in practice that the provisions for the postal vote are of such a nature that fraud is made easy. It is known that there was considerable abuse of the provisions during the last election, and it is, therefore, suggested that the best way to deal with the postal vote is to wipe it out altogether. Personally, I know the system was abused, and that it was open to great abuse. We are told that Mr Kidston, who was then Premier, was not opposed to the postal vote, but he took the same view, as will be seen from these remarksEvery one of us knows quite well that the way in which the postal vote was carried out in many cases made it, to all intents and purposes, open voting. To all intents and purposes, if we continue our Electoral Act, with this blemish in it, we abolish the protection of the ballot, as far as women are concerned, and certainly as far as the majority of the women are concerned. I consider it is the duty of the House to wipe out the postal vote root and branch, aud wipe it out at once. I have given honourable members the opinions of two members of the Queensland Cabinet at the time. I have also the opinion of Mr Grant, who was Minister of Education in the present Queensland Government until a few months agoNo one who had had the least experience of the postal vote at the last election would desire to retain it. . . . It destroyed the secrecy of the ballot. . . . Tbere had been so much bribery and corruption that he thought it better to wipe the postal vote out altogether. Then Mr Roberts, the member for East Toowoomba, saidThe secrecy of the ballot was only possible by the abolition of the postal vote. Nothing else would make it secret. . . . He was satisfied that if the postal vote was retained at the next election it would just be one system of canvassing and taking the postal vote at the same time. For that reason he would oppose the postal vote. The honourable member for Carnarvon saidAt the last election the provisions of the postal vote were greatly abused, and sooner than see that abuse continue it would be better to wipe it out altogether. Those are the opinions of members of the Queensland Liberal party today. in face of their view that the postal vote should be wiped out, the present Government in Queensland, finding they are losing their power, and knowing that the postal vote will give them greater voting strength, have agreed to re-introduce it . They find that the present system of recording votes is not as favourable to the Liberal party as when the postal vote was in existence. They are not prepared, however, to go back to the old system of allowing justices of the peace to witness postal votes, and they have agreed to in troduce an amendment debarring justices from witnessing the signature of a voter under the present Act. I desire to read for the information of honourable members the list of persons whom the Queensland Government have agreed shall witness the postal voter's signature during the coming electionA postmaster not being in charge of a receiving office only, a police magistrate or a head teacher of a State or provisional school, a railway stationmaster, a night officer in charge of a railway station, a warden or mining registrar, an officer in charge of a lighthouse, a police officer in charge of a police station or above the rank of acting sergeant, or also, in case of a sick or infirm voter in addition to any of the foregoing persons, the duly qualified medical practitioner or qualified nurse in attendance on the voter. Justices of the peace are no longer allowed to act as witnesses, but the Act is quite bad enough. The Federal Government are trying to imitate it . They know that Labour candidates will not have the assistance of financial institutions in collecting postal votes, and, for that reason, they favour the system. abuse to which the system has been sub-' jected should be sufficient to deter honourable members from restoring it . Having regard to the evidence of abuse which has been submitted, the Government should recognise that they are making a mistake in submitting this Bill in. i|ts present form. The Opposition are prepared to accept a fair and reasonable amendment of the Act, to enable the sick and infirm to record their votes. Further than that we are not prepared to go. We are not prepared to give the Government an opportunity to declare every house in the Commonwealth a polling booth as soon as the writs are issued. That, however, is what the Government and their supporters desire. That is the practice to which they have been accustomed, and from which, on different occasions, they Yet, have gained power.",31
208,Mr RODGERS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Why did not the Labour Government, when in office, proride opportunities for the sick and infirm to vote?",32
209,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"If the honourable member wishes to enlighten the House, we shall gladly give him an opportunity to do so. The silence maintained by honourable members opposite is evidence of their insincerity.",32
210,Mr SPEAKER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Order 1 The honourable member is not in order in reflecting on the sincerity of honourable members.,32
211,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Then I shall conclude with the statement that we shall be glad to hear the views of honourable members opposite, and to learn whether they have any evidence calculated to justify the actiou of the Government in seeking to restore the postal vote.",32
212,Mr STUMM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Lilley) T2.49] - If the honourable member for Oxley and his party, as they now affirm, are in favour of affording the sick and infirm an opportunity to vote, they should explain why in 1911 they failed to amend the Act in that direction. Why was it that they swept away the whole system of voting by post? That is a fair question to put to them. Before they can go to the country and claim to be in favour of facilitating the exercise of the franchise by the sick and the infirm, they must explain the action which they took in 1911. I should not have spoken to this question but for the references that have been made to Queensland's experience of the postalvote system. An y one listening to this The debate, would come to the conclusion that the Bill is identical with the State Act which gave rise to the abuses that were brought to light in 1908. As a matter of fact, it is not.",32
213,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,And honourable members opposite know that.,33
214,Mr STUMM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I believe that they do; but for the information of those who are not conversant with the facts, it is desirable that the actual position should be stated and recorded in Hansard. Queensland Act of 1904 gave the right to all women, irrespective of what their condition might be, to vote by post. There was no limitation as to health or infirmity. Then . again, an application for a postal-vote certificate under that Act could be witnessed only by a Returning Officer, or a justice of the peace, while the ballot-paper itself could be witnessed only by a postmaster or a justice of the peace. In order to make the Act of any value, it was necessary, in view of this limitation of witnesses, that a large number of justices of the peace should be appointed. That is the simple explanation in regard to the appointment of so many justices. An immense addition was undoubtedly made to the commission of the peace.",33
215,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,But no Labour supporters were appointed as justices of the peace.,33
216,Mr SPEAKER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Order ! The honourable member for Oxley has just concluded his speech.,33
217,Mr STUMM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"As a rule, I listen attentively to the honourable member for Oxley, and I think that he should extend to me the same courtesy. He has had a full opportunity to state his case to the House.",33
218,Mr SAMPSON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,And this is a matter that we desire to have cleared up.,33
219,Mr STUMM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Quite so. We all admit that abuses occurred under the Queensland Act of 1904. There was a very fierce election-on e of the keenest we had ever had in Queensland-at the end of 1907, and the Ministry of the day was so badly defeated that it resigned without waiting to meet Parliament. As soon as the Parliament met in 1908, it did exactly what the Commonwealth Parliament did in 1911-it swept away the postal-vote system. Mr Kidston was then Premier of the State, and his first act was to take advantage of his commanding majority just as the Labour party did in this House, in 1911, to abolish the postal-vote system. He had the whole of the Labour party behind him. As a matter of fact, he had been a member of that party, and to this day the belief is entertained in Queensland that one of the conditions under which the Labour party of that time agreed to support him was that he should sweep away the postal vote. He did so. He made no attempt to improve The the Act by introducing necessary safeguards. He and his party thought it better that the sick and the infirm, as well as people in the back-blocks, should be deprived, practically, of the right to vote rather than that the postal-vote system should continue.",33

221,Mr STUMM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Corruptio n has occurred in connection with every system that has been devised. There has been corruption under the absent vote system, and it will occur again unless effective safeguards are employed. Mr Kidston was a colleague of the present Leader of the Opposition in this House, in what honourable members opposite grandiloquently term "" the first Labour Ministry the world had ever known."" In Queensland, however, that Ministry was regarded as one of the greatest political fiascos in the history of the State. The political fiasco which occurred in Victoria a few months ago, when a Labour Government was formed, only to go out of office in a few days, was as nothing compared with it. This Queensland Ministry remained in office only six days, and I do not believe that the members of it occupied the Treasury bench for more than six hours.",33

225,Mr STUMM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Precisely . They gained office by assuring the Governor that they could carry on the government of the country when they must have known they could not do so. In these circumstances they were deprived of their political lives. The head of the Ministry was cut off, so to speak, just as occurred recently in Victoria. Since then, the postal-vote system has been re-established in Queensland, but on lines very different from those which prevailed under the Act of 1904.",33

Both political parties there fought shy of the postal vote system in the beginning, and it little used at the first election after adoption, but both parties recognised possibilities when the second election came, and I am sorry to have to admit disfranchisement. that both of them made an unscrupulous use of it.

But if all that has been said about the Queensland postal vote were true, what It would not prove the Commonwealth system to be wrong.

The talk that we have heard about the invasion of the secrecy of the ballot is moonshine. Postal voting takes place in Queensland in connection with shire council elections, some of the shires being larger than the average Commonwealth electoral division in no Victoria, and it works well. There has been no outcry about the invasion of the Indeed, I that the shire council system would down without postal voting.

251,Mr HOWE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Dalley) [3.15] - I heard only the latter part of the utterances of the honourable member who has just sat down, but I associate him with the honourable member for Calare, and suggest that both of them have ""let the cat out of the bag."" A few moments ago the honourable member for Lilley referred to women who had to leave their families at home in order to vote, and yesterday the honourable member for Calare dwelt on the great handicap imposed on the people in the back-blocks, who, in many instances, had to travel for days in order to perform this public duty. It was on these grounds that the two honourable members urged the adoption of the postal vote, and they thereby show that it is not desired to accommodate the invalid and the aged, but to save people the trouble of attending at the polling booths, thus, of course, frustrating the purpose of our electoral law. The Bill ostensibly gives to invalids and others the opportunity to record their votes, and we, as a Labour party, I say at once, are quite prepared to make the necessary provision, provided there be such safeguards as will, and must, prevent the prostitution of the Electoral Act itself and the violation of the principle that underlies our electoral system. In a democratic community the desire and purpose must be to give to every individual the opportunity to record his vote, and that we on this side are ready to do. But no legislation, whether here, in Great Britain, or any other country where democratic rule obtains, can make full provision for all situations and contingencies that may arrive. No less an authority than Thomas Henry Buckle, who wrote the History of Civilization, has pointed out that all successful legislation is based on expediency and compromise. If the Government and their supporters are really sincere in their desire to extend the postal-voting system to invalids and the aged, they should be prepared to accept such amendments of the Bill as will insure the safeguards to which have referred. When a similar Bill was before the Senate last session amendments of the kind were proposed, but they were bitterly fought by the Government, who, consistently with their purpose, now absolutely refuse to provide any safeguards. Is it not evident that the Government are desirous, not so much of passing this Bill, as of using it as a means to attain some political end of their own-of making it a stalking horse to enable them to obtain the object they have in view? Personally, I am favourable to the invalids being afforded every facility to record their votes. In my own electorate I have seen such scenes of what I might term brutality in the taking of invalids to the poll as to excite my very loathing. On one occasion, in my own electorate, a poor paralytic, while being carried into the booth, fell head forward into the roadway, and had to be picked up and conveyed inside. Further, I saw a poor old dame with one leg, who had to be assisted, partly by myself, into the polling place; and there was a poor soul, crippled with rheumatics, who fell to the ground owing to her affliction. Their votes having been recorded, the poor people were left in the gutter, to get home as best they might. I do not blame one party more than I do another. On the day of election, when the fighting forces are out, we are prone to forget ourselves, and do injustice to those on whom we rely for assistance. In another case, I found a poor old soul, who, having been to the booth and voted, had been left crying in the street. She told me that she had not wanted to vote, but that she had been brought from her home, and had been left where I found her. I had with me a conveyance with other voters in it , but I sent these away, saying I did not require their votes, and had the old woman carried home. It may be urged that these cases represent good grounds for postal voting, and I admit that I would sooner have postal voting than such horrors in any electorate. The question arises, however, whether invalids really desire to vote. When men are seriously ill , or women are on the verge of child-birth, they are not much concerned with politics or parties; and where there is indifference there is not I the proper knowledge, so that such votes are not of any value to the country. The voters we require are not those who are weak in physique or in intellect, but a fighting force of the manhood and womanhood, fitted in every way to understand and appreciate the issues, and willing to work day by day for the confirmation of their social ideals. Yet we hear from honourable members opposite all this piffle about votes for invalids. I  party give the vote to inmates of hospitals ?Mr HOWE' - I am not going to say anything as to what my party did, but, speaking for myself, I regret that that vote, was ever given, and I say this with due respect to the inmates of the hospitals. I cannot conceive that such people are. so immersed in politics as to desire to leave their beds, or to record their votes by post,, in relation to questions of which it is quite possible they know nothing. This system of voting leaves it open to political agents on either side to torture the poor souls; not to put the facts before them, but to urge that their candidates represent the living truth, and that they must be voted for if success and prosperity is to be the lot of Australia. Such procedure as this is a shame and a sham, and I ask this House not to accept the Bill. If I could be assured that invalids whodesired to vote would be safe from thehands of political organizers and undue pressure, chicanery, and cunning, I should be ready to afford them the means of voting. I am afraid, however, that that is not the object of the Government, but rather that they are actuated by the knowledge that the postal vote goes their way rather than ours. I see in this proposal some danger to the proper administration of our Electoral Act, and I strongly oppose the Bill unless it beamended to containproper safeguards. The Bill is introduced as a mere cloak to shroud the ultimate and hideous purpose of the Government. They are seeking to bring this House and the country into a state of disruption in order to obtain a double dissolution,, which may or may not give them some advantage. Had some great constitutional question arisen, I could have understood the attitude of the Government; but we have placed before us two petty measures,, with the idea, that we on. this side are afraid of an appeal to the country. There is,, however, no fear on this side -. we are prepared to meet the Government and their supporters at any time. I should prefer, however, that they came into the open, and declared their purpose,, declining to shelter themselves behind the crippled and the sick. It is not manly, fair, or honourable; it is a dirty piece of tactics-a . dirty political job.",36

254,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"G o on 1  If I refrain from addressing myself to a Bill I am charged with being "" gagged,"" and if I rise to address a few remarks to. it I am charged with ""stone-walling"" the measure. I do not know what game my honourable friends opposite are attempting to play. In any case, they are not playing the. game fairly. I rise to support the Bill from the broadpoint of view that I wish to see the electoral law so framed that every elector may have an equal opportunity of expressing his opinions at the ballot-box, which equal opportunity is not given under the present Act. We have listened to a great many harrowing, expressions of the evils perpetrated in the past, evidently largely due to the ineffectiveness of some State electoral law; but I have listened very carefully in order to find some concrete case whereby it can be shown that the Federal law,, in which alone we are interested, has broken down. The only illustration we have had came from the mouth of the. Prime Minister, who pointed out in his second-reading speech that during ten years there were only ten prosecutions for offences under the Federal postal voting provisions. I have no wish to touch on the harrowing scenes of which the honourable member for Dalley has just given, instances of a. most deplorable nature; I do not wish to traverse the arguments of my friend the honourable member for Oxley, which were largely based on the State law, and do not apply to the Federal law ; but I do wish to say that I , have noticed that most of the objections raised during this debate to the rein traduction of the postal voting provisions have come from representatives of city constituencies that can be measured by acres, and not by square miles, and which in some instances conld be covered by good-sized counterpanes. From the point of view of these small constituencies, probably there may be something in the arguments advanced.",37
255,Mr YATES,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"It is in those constituencies that the postal vote is mostly used.  reintroduce is comprised in three sections. Let us first turn to the Act of 1909, which was repealed in 1911. There were tliree classes of electors who were permitted to vote by post. First, any elector who had reason to believe that he would not, during the hours of polling on polling day, be within 5 miles of any polling place for the division for which he was enrolled, was permitted to vote by post. If that method was carried out under proper supervision-ther e were ample safeguards, and it was the f a u l t of the public if they were not brought into effect-ther e would be very few people in city electorates who would be affected except those who were absolutely away from their homes; and I claim that they are justly entitled to vote when they are away. We may argue as much as we like, and say exactly what we like with regard to our Federal law; but I say, without fear of contradiction, that it is a monstrous thing to have compulsory enrolment' without giving to those who are compelled to be eurolled under a 2?enalty of £ 2 , the opportunity of recording their votes.",38
256,Mr FENTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"A r e you in favour compulsory voting? It is a good thing.  member can show me how it could be enforced, I should be prepared to support it, but we are not dealing with that matter now. The law now provides, for compulsory enrolment, and every person compelled to enroll should have reasonable opportunity to record a vote. figures that the Prime Minister gave are simply unanswerable. not his own. He quoted Mr Knibbs, who. points out the daily average of sick and infirm in Australia. It is a difficult matter to overcome the law of average. Eyery day, qn an average, in Australia there are 22,000 women sick, 3,Q,000 other people sick, and 25,009 people infirm, making a total of 77,000 people who, under our electoral law, are physically unable to go to a polling booth and are thus disfranchised. Y e t the whole of them have been compelled toenroll under a penalty of £ 2 . Notwithstanding this, there is no method by which they can exercise the franchise. I support the proposal to give to all qualified electors the opportunity to exercise the franchise, whether sick or well ; and if their physical condition does not allow them to go to polling places, I maintain that the law should be altered to permit them to vote by another' method, and I know of no other method so amply safeguarded that gives this opportunity better than the postal-voting provisions that the Government seek to reintroduce. There are honourable members opposite who represent country electorates, and they know that in many of the country districts it is the exception, for an elector to be within 5 miles of a polling booth; also, that there are certain districts where, after a fall of 50' points of rain, it is impossible to travel over roads by any means of conveyance. The honourable member for Gwydir knows that two-thirds of his electorate are known as the "" Black Count r y , "" and he knows, from his experience,, as I know it , that a person cannot travel over that country immediately after a fall of 50 ]joints or 60 points of rain. It is not reasonable to prevent people from exercising the franchise because they are shut off from personal attendance at polling booths by reason of climatic and other conditions over which they have no control. It is only a reasonable of aud democratic proposition that we should secure from, every qualified honourable elector an expression of political opinion, so that we can once and for all have in this Parliament a representation of the political views of all people in regard to the candidates before them. The second class of people who were permitted to vote by post were women, who would, The on account of ill-health, be unable to attend a polling place on polling They were day. A m I told that any honourable member of any party claims that our womenfolk all belong to one side in politics? Most of us, certainly those on this side of the chamber, are great advocates of equality of opportunity. A m I told that it is wise and proper to disfranchise the 22,000 women who. are daily sick, and so incapacitated that they cannot walk to a polling booth? Is it democratic or solicitous on the part of men, who desire to give the fullest opportunity to persons to express their political opinions at a polling booth, to deprive these women of that opportunity ? Surely that is not so. The same remarks can apply to the third class of people who were permitted to vote by post-thos e who would be prevented by serious illness or infirmity from attending a polling place on polliug day.",38
257,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"What safeguards would you have?  regard to voting by post were more ample than those in force today. The provisions for postal voting that the Pisher Government repealed were infinitely more satisfactory than those they provided in other portions of the electoral law now in existence. In regard to the sick and infirm, how many pioneers are there who, through no fault of their own, but as a result of their pioneering efforts, find themselves in such a state of health that they cannot leave their chairs-me n and women who have borne the heat and burden of the day and helped to make Australia what it is? The penalty for their efforts is that, under the present law, they are disfranchisednot allowed to give an expression to their political opinions because there is no method by which they can have their votes put into the ballot-box. Is that in accordance with our advanced and boasted Democracy?",39
258,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Did they vote previously?  they did. I am arguing on a principle. I maiutain that the safeguards were provided, and if any honourable member knew that they had not been carried out, he, as a guardian of the integrity of this Federal House, had an undoubted right to step in and see that the delinquents were properly punished. But we find that during ten' years' experience of postal voting under the Federal law the only punishable incidents were ten in number. Yet we hear so much talk in regard to maladministration or the misuse of the postalvoting provisions. Now let me deal with the safeguards. The authorized witnesses are specified in section 109(a) of toral Act of 1909. I need not read them all. They start with all Commonwealth Electoral Oflicers for States, all Commonwealth Returning Oflicers, and all Commonwealth Electoral Registrars. There is a whole list of oflicers,widely spread, so that there should be few localities without them. Further than that, all persons or classes of persons employed in the Public Service of the Commonwealth or of a State may be declared by proclama; tion to be authorized witnesses. And these authorized witnesses have a very solemn and proper function to perform, guarded in a way that does not apply in portions of the present Act. The next section provides that an authorized person shall not witness the signature of any elector to an application for a postal-vote certificate and postal ballot-paper unless he has satisfied, himself as to the identity of the applicant.",39
259,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,What is the honourable member reading from?  we are proposing to restore.,39
260,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,You are wrong.  second clause of the Bill provides that certain sections of the Act are to be repealed and certain provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1902-9 repealed by those sections are to be revived and re-enacted.

261,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,It is not the same; ask the Attorney-General.  out that that is one of the safeguards we have not got today.,39
262,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"That safeguard has been broken through.  safeguard where application is made for a postal vote, in view of the fact that the witness has to satisfy himself as to the identity of the claimant, than exists in our claims for enrolment. What do we find under the card system today? That there is no method of identifying the person of the applicant for enrolment with the signature on the card. I say, too, with some regret, that there is nothing to prevent a man who cares to take a risk, getting on to the electoral roll, and there is no method by which he can be detected.",39
263,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Do you"" suggest that the Electhere are men who do that ?  suggest anything. I leave that to the honourable member's wild and lurid imagination. I am trying to point out that we cannot identify the person of the applicant and the signature on the card, and in that way the door is lef t open for every subterfuge that the mind can conceive. There are other matters which must be taken into consideration in connection with the postal vote. First of all, the Returning Officer has to be satisfied with what comes before him, and after the election the applications for postal votes are on exhibition, and any person may see them. If there is anything wrong with these postal votes, why do not honourable members opposite take action against the offenders? We have a Committee of Disputed Returns",39
264,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"No , we have That shows how much you know about the electoral law.  be lodged with the H i gh Court, and I would sooner trust my case to a Judge of the High Court of Australia than to some Committees of Disputed Returns. I have ho hesitation in saying that, and I think that some of my friends on the Opposition side would declare the same thing.",40
265,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"We tipped one of your men out before.  honourable member did, and it would give him the greatest possible pleasure to t i p some of us out again; but, unfortunately for him, we are not going to have any of that sort of tipping. In the reintroduction of the postal voting provisions, the Government are not' actuated by the base motives which honourable members opposite would insinuate. We primarily, that there should be an equal opportunity to vote given to all electors. The Bill is not introduced merely for the sake of bringing about a double dissolution, although I am hopeful that we shall get before the people by means of a double dissolution, as the result of either this or some other measure. always prepared to trust the people, but honourable members opposite seem to have the greatest dislike to going before their masters and mistresses. My desire is to have the whole situation cleared up by the people, by any proper and legitimate means that can be adopted. Let the whole 111 of us go before the people, and let the people decide between us. I have nothing to fear, and I do not think any other honourable member ought to fear either. When honourable members attribute motives for the introduction of a measure like this, and suggest that the Government are hopeful of getting some advantage out of it, they are shooting wide of the mark, and saying things which are unworthy of their mental capabilities. I say at once that the restoration of the postal vote will be of great advantage to a large number of worthy settlers, who, today, are practically disfranchised, although they have had to be enrolled under the compulsory clauses of the Federal law, or make themselves liable to a penalty of £ 2 . I cannot follow honourable members when they. say that it is a fair thing to compel a not. person to be enrolled under pain of a penalty, and then not to give him or her an opportunity to vote. The sooner we get the postal provisions of the Electoral Act restored to the statute-book the better it will be for the reputation of all parties, and I have no hesitation in saying that we shall have an increased vote as a result of this Bill , because it will give an opportunity to vote to a number of electors who at the present time are unable to exercise their full political rights. In conclusion, I desire to say that so far as a number of those electors are concerned it seems to me to be little short of outrageous that they have been so long denied their political rights. I cannot understand for the life of me why honourable members opposite, who pretend to be the advocates of democracy with a capital "" D , "" should be so strongly opposed to the re-introducdesire, tion of the postal voting system. The safeguards are ample and satisfactory if they are carried out in their entirety, as they evidently have been in the past. I do not suppose that under any other A ct on the statute-book there have been so few as ten proved cases of malpractice in ten years, and if that is not evidence of the I am safety of these particular provisions I do not know what conditions could be introduced to make them safe.",40
266,Mr YATES,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Adelaide) [3.53] - I do not intend to occupy the time of the House very long, but I desire to point out, in answer to the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, that the advocates of democracy with a capital "" D , "" as he termed us, have been mainly responsible for all the advantages of the extension of the franchise that we enjoy today. It is not our desire to rob any elector of that right which is inherently his. We are prepared to see that, as far as possible, every voter in the Commonwealth has the right to exercise his or her franchise. We have nothing to fear from the greater vote that may be given by virtue of the fact that every eligible person in the community is given that opportunity of expressing his or her opinions at the polls. In asking for fair and adequate safeguards against fraud and deception, and methods which are not too clean, we are accused by members on the Government side of belittling the integrity .of the general public. But there was never an Act placed on the statute-book for the regulation of the general public that did not assume everybody to be innocent until proved guilty. We do not know of half the crime that is perpetrated; only that which is discovered comes within the purview of the law. And an Ac t is placed on the statute-book to regulate the life of the community so that any person who transgresses may be brought to book, and made to pay a penalty for his breach. During an election, people necessarily take a keen in terest in what takes place; but if you ask them to come forward afterwards and relate incidents that occurred within their knowledge, so that those who have done things they ought not to have done may be brought to book, they are always backward in coming forward, and, consequently, it is difficult to get proof of any offence. The figures are significant in that regard. A f t last general election the newspapers were going to flood the country with in stances of personation, dual voting, and the dead rising from their graves to record votes in favour of the Labour party. From all the hullabaloo that took place, one would have thought that all the gaols would have been filled with those who took advantage of a lax Electoral Act , and inflated the vote on that occasion. At the declaration of the poll for Adelaide, when my predecessor, the late Hon. E . A . Roberts, was elected, his opponent made the same complaint from the public platform; but when he was asked why he did not move to have people prosecuted on the knowledge he then possessed, he replied that he was prepared to do so at Mr Tates. JH-_.J8.S£?SI the right time. I desire to ask the present occupants of the Treasury bench if they have done anything to create "" the right time ' ' for Mr Craig to bring forward his evidence as to the wrong-doing which he was positive took place at that election? Mr Shannon, who was formerly a member of the Senate, made a similar statement-that he had knowledge of malpractices during the election, and he would bring forward his evidence at 1 the right time. "" Not now, O Lord, not now,"" if I may paraphrase the honourable member for West Sydney. It was not then, hot upon the deed, that he was going to prove his words; he would do it at the right time; but, notwithstanding that the Electoral Commission has paid two visits to Adelaide, those two gentlemen, who were so desirous that the electoral machinery should be above suspicion, did not voluntarily go before the Commission and state who were the persons who had done those things which ought not to have been done. Those gentlemen threw suspicion on innumerable electors, and the newspapers were very liberal in their denunciation of the practices which they considered at the time were putting the Labour Government back into power. Had the newspapers thought that the Fusion party would be returned with a majority, they would not have made those threats; but it looked odds on the Fisher Government being again returned to office, and that h u r t the Liberal organs so much that they made extravagant statements as to what had been done under the Electoral Act. No honourable member on the Government side has taken the press to e r the book for the way the general public was maligned on that occasion; but when, in the face of evidence we possess as to what can be done under the postal-voting system, we ask for safeguards, we are accused of being afraid to trust the people. We are not afraid to trust the people. So much was said about the likelihood of depriving the sick and invalid' of a vote by the abolition of the postal vote, that the Fisher Government agreed to establish polling booths in the hospitals. Such a booth was established in the North Adelaide Hospital, a private institution, which a workman could not enter, except at a risk of plunging himself into debt so deeply that he might never be able to get out of debt again. But at the Adelaide Hospital, which probably contained many who would vote for Labour, the State Government, which represented the Fusion crowd, refused to permit a polling booth to be established. Yet we are told that the Labour party would not allow the sick to vote. It is even suggested that we are restricting the franchise, although, as a matter of fact, the Constitution declares what shall be the franchise for the Commonwealth Parliament, and there can be no restriction of it without an' amendment of the Constitution itself. The sole question at issue, therefore, is whether there is any attempt to restrict the exercise of the chise. My contention is that the Fisher Government did everything in its power to facilitate the exercise of the franchise by the people. At the last general election, to which the Act, as amended by the Labour Government, applied, the percentage of voters was larger than ever before. The Prime Minister has told us that, according to Mr Knibbs, at the last general election there were on the rolls 175,216 names which should not have been there. That represents, approximately, 6 per cent., and, allowing for that percentage, we find that, according to the Senate returns, 79 per cent, of the electors voted. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that many were deprived of the right to vote. In the last analysis it would probably be found that those who were actually deprived of the vote were persons whose votes could not possibly have been obtained under any circumstances. Seeing that 73.66 per cent, of the electors on the roll, or, allowing for the number which, according to Mr. Knibbs, should not have been enrolled, 79 per cent., exercised the franchise at the last election, at which the Fusion party was returned with a majority of one, how can it be said that the exercise of the franchise has been restricted in any way by"" the Labour party ? Newspapers and supporters of the Fusion party made wild statements as to alleged malpractice's at the last general election, but they were not prepared to prove their assertions. They have not been prepared with evidence to support a successful prosecution. In my own State there were one or two convictions in cases which showed that new citizens-immigrants-had , perhaps, been more enthusiastic than discreet, and had secured enrolment a few days before coming of age. They were evidently enthusiastic in the desire to become citizens of the Commonwealth, and to exercise the rights of citizenship. The honourable member for Hume has said that the greatest outcry against the postal-vote system has come from representatives of the city constituencies. When he made that statement. I interjected that the greatest number of postal votes were recorded in city constituencies. The actual figures bear out my statement, and go to show that the argument that the system facilitates the exercise of the franchise by those franwho are far removed from the polling booth has no substantial foundation. Let us look at the figures in respect of the general election of 1910, when the postalvote system was in operation. In the electorate of Adelaide, which is commonly called "" the square mile,"" although it covers a little more, since it crosses the Torrens, there were 340 postal ballot papers issued, while in Boothby, another metropolitan constituency there were 276. On the other hand, in Wakefield, vvhich comprises the mid-northern area of the State, and covers a wide extent of country, only 286 postal votes, or ten more than were recorded in the metropolitan constituency of Boothby, were polled. In the electorate of Barker, which runs from Mount Gambier, in the south-east, to Glenelg, within 7 miles of Adelaide, and which covers a wide tract of country, 299 postal votes were recorded, as against 340 in the congested city constituency of Adelaide. These figures go to show that the system is largely availed of by those whom it was not designed to help. It is hard to prove the existence of these abuses, but it is as plain as a pike-staff that they do exist. The figures I have quoted support my contention. In the electorate of Brisbane, at the 1910 election, 620 postal ballot-papers were issued, whilst in the vast country electorate of Maranoa thore were only 146. Yet honourable members opposite tell us that representatives of city constituencies should not complain of the operation of this system. H there are in the cities people who are too lazy to go to a polling place",40
267,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The voting by post system is impracticable in country districts unless organizers go round with the postal-vote certificates.,42
268,Mr YATES,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I am rather in favour of the postal-vote system if proper safeguards be provided. On this occasion, however, we are asked, not to accept, but to reject, a proposal to re-introduce the system. The Age put the position very clearly this morning. The Government wish us to vote against this Bill. . They wish us to reject it so that they may ask the Governor General for a dissolution. The honourable member for Hume spoke of the Democracy of Australia, and I am j>roud to know that we represent the democratic section of Australia, and represent the Democracy, if the honourable member likes, with a capital D. To return to the figures as to the postal voting in 1910, I find that in Maranoa only 146 postal ballot-papers were issued, although the electorate is a widely scattered one, whereas in the city constituency of Brisbane there were 620. Does this not prove that advantage was taken of the system in a way that was not intended by the framers of the Act? Coming to Victoria, I find that in Melbourne 397 postal ballot-papers were issued, while in the rural electorate of Echuca, 414, or only seventeen more than in the city electorate, were issued. In byrnong, which also comprises a thicklypopulated area, 527 postal ballot-papers were issued, as against only 480 in the country electorate of Corio. The same sort of thing obtains throughout the list. It is hard, however, to induce people to come forward to support prosecutions for au abuse of the postal-vote system. According to this morning's newspapers, a representative of the Typothetae gave evidence before the Inter-State Commission yesterday that it was most dimcult to induce members of that organization to give evidence. They cannot be induced to come forward to give evidence which is really necessary to show in what respect the printing industry needs to be stimulated. That being so, how can we expect persons having no direct interest in the matter to be prepared to give evidence regarding the abuse of the postalvote system ? Many persons may know that the system is abused, yet not be prepared to make a criminal of a man who has violated it . The figures I have quoted are sufficient, I think, to show that the system was abused in 1910. I hope that politics are becoming cleaner in Australia, and I should not fear the postal-vote system today to the extent that I would have done a few years ago. The organization of the two parties is socomplete that I do nob think there could be anything like the same abuse of the system. The honourable member for Boothby has indicated his intention to move certain amendments to bring this measure into line with the South Australian Act. We have in that Act the best safeguards yet devised. It provides that if a woman has reason to believe that on polling day she will not be able to go to a polling booth, she may go to a post-office, and there record her vote by post. In most country places the residents can once in three years make it their business, if likely to be incapacitated on polling day, to go to the post-office in advance to record their votes. The voting-paper that would be used in such a case would be a long slip of paper, which the elector would have to show to the postmaster, so that he might see that it had not previously been used. The elector would then turn away, and write down the name of the candidate for whom he intended to vote, sealing the paper up, attaching his name, his electoral diviMarision, and his address; and, havinghad the postmark stamped on it, could put it into the letter-box himself. Dnder this system, there would be no possibility of interference by any partisan or agent. I do not deny the existence of political partisans. I hope that our supporters will always be party men. Should partisan enthusiasm weaken, our party would be unmade. I trust that the proposals of the honourable member for Boothby will be accepted by the Government. If they are, I shall uot feel as much distrust about the efficiency of this measure as I must otherwise feel. The honourable member for Werriwa alluded to the number of unionists that we represent. I would inform him that it is not only unionists that we represent, but all the electors who have voted for us. If we represented only unionists, we should stand in a parochial light, such as the honourable member for Werriwa always appears in when addressing this House. Another member of the Liberal party has told us that we should have some consideration for the poor; that the rich can use motor cars to get to the polling booths. To twit members of the Labour party with want of consideration for the poor was surely irony. Honourable members opposite know that if it were not for them we should have no poor.",43
269,Mr FLEMING,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"If it were not for us, the poor would be dead, I suppose.",44
270,Mr YATES,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"No ; there would be no poor, because all would be happy and smiling. Australia would no longer have to buy immigrants, and the earth would be a place worth living on. To t w it us with a want of commiseration with the poor is so puerile an argument as to be laughable. Never can the Labour party be accused of the desire to inflict hardship on any section of the community in respect of either industrial conditions, social conditions, or electoral conditions. Our aim has always been to pass laws for improving the conditions of the people. By having the best conceivable Electoral Act, honestly administered, we shall get the best Parliament. I hope that in Committee the Government will be amenable to reason, and will consent to the insertion in the Bill of amendments safeguarding the exercise of the postal vote.",44
271,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Capricornia) [4.20] - I do not suppose that any Liberal is anxious to speak, bu t if there be any man on the opposite side desirous of speaking, I shall sit down. The Attorney-General having appeared on the scene, I have a few observations to make regarding the aim of the Bill . As far back as August of last year, - a well-informed journalist mentioned that it was the intention of the Government to introduce two short test Bills, of one or two clauses each, in order to secure a double dissolution upon their rejection by the Senate. The Prime M in ister the other day got the. surprise of his life because of the treatment given to one of these Bills, and said that within a few hours he would approach the Governor General to ask for a double dissolution. We thought that honourable members opposite were in earnest; but, after holding a Caucus meeting, they decided that they would not push matters, and would wait until this other test Bill had gone through. This Bill is going through, I hope, with certain necessary amendments. Why does the Government propose to amend the electoral law? It is because, finding themselves after the last election with a majority of only one in this House, Ministers came to the conclusion that there must be something radically wrong in our electoral system. Accordingly, they made all sorts of accusations against the electors, and alleged that the electoral system was defective. But the only man of any political i m portance who has admitted that he broke the electoral law is a Liberal-ex-Sen a to 1, Chataway. He stated before the Electoral. Commission that on polling day he entered fourteen polling booths. The Act saysNo candidate shall in any way take part in the conduct of an election; and no one, other than the presiding oflicer, the poll clerks, doorkeepers, and scrutineers, and the electors voting and about to vote, shall be permitted to enter or remain in the polling booth during the polling except by permission of the presiding officer. How did ex-Senator Chataway get permission to enter fourteen different polling booths? He stated that he voted in one booth for the Senate, in another for the House of Representatives, and in another on the referendum. How did he manage to do that?",44
272,Mr RODGEKS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The conduct of the elections was controlled by the Labour party.,44
273,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The facts only show how difficult it is for any Government to get an election properly carried out. I am glad that the Prime Minister is now going to give me the benefit of his attention. Ex-Senator Chataway also said that he had got several sets of official ballot-papers, and had taken them to his office. An elector has no right to take any ballot-paper out of the polling booth. How did ex-Senator Chataway get these papers from the Returning Oflicers?",44
274,Mr SINCLAIR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,He d id not say t h at he had got them from the Returning Officers.,44
275,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"When he approached the first Returning Officer he must have been asked his name and number on the roll, and when he had been given his set of ballot-papers his name must have been ticked off. Intending to vote only for the House of Representatives, he should have returned the Senate and referendum papers.",44
276,Mr SINCLAIR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,He did not get them.,44
277,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Did he tell the Returning Officer that he wanted a ballot-paper for the House of Representatives only ?,44
278,Mr SINCLAIR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"He d id say that, and got the ballot-paper that he asked for.",44
279,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The members of the Electoral Commission should have asked for the names of the Returning Officers whose booths the ex-senator visited, who, I venture to think, were not carrying out their duties properly. One of the reasons given for the introduction of the Amending Electoral Bill was that many more persons voted than were thought to have the right to vote, and that there had been a duplication of votes. If ex-Senator Chataway voted before three different Returning Officers his name must have been ticked on three different rolls. But the amending Bill that was introduced last year has, for some reason of which I am not aware, been abandoned by the Government. We have shown today that when the Government bring d'own measures of which wo can approve, we are willing that they shall pass. Two second-reading speeches were made this morning, and leave was granted for the introduction of two Bills. Apparently the Government abandoned the amending Electoral Bill and introduced the Bill now before us because Ministers would not tolerate any interference with their proposals. That surely is wrong. The thirty-seven representatives on this side are entitled to the consideration of their proposals. Last session we passed the Norfolk Island Bill , the Pine Creek to Katherine River Railway B i ll",45
280,Mr RILEV,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The Audit Bill.,45
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The A u d it B i l not get through Parliament.,45
282,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"This House passed it ; but the Government, notwithstanding the passing of these measures, object to any interference, and insist on introducing two test Bills for the purpose of obtaining a double dissolution. I agree with the honourable member who said that as Parliament was returned for three years it ought-to use a word I have heardto "" f u n c t i o n "" for that period. I remember that word, because an objection was taken to the honourable member for West Sydney being a member of the Wharf Labourers Union by some one who said that he did not "" function "" as a wharf labourer. However, the case has been put very clearly by a well-known critic, who says that the attempt of the Government to make an issue isHollow and unsubstantial, simply because the principle of postal voting is not in dispute between the parties, and because the Labour party contest the Bill only on the ground that they believethe system^ when re-established, ought to be surrounded with safeguards against dishonesty.",45
283,Mr FLEMING,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,I know where the honourable member got that from-the Age.,45
284,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Yes , it is from the Age of 3rd June.",45
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The Age is a great deal kinder to the Labour party nowadays than it is to us.,45
286,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"That is because the Prime Minister and his supporters have forsaken their pledges. The Age is, above everything, a Protectionist paper; and, as the Prime Minister's Victorian followers have, as I say, forsaken their pledges, it looks to the National Labour party to give Protection. I wish to assist the Prime Minister in his desire to get to Government House, but I have the right to say that we are in favour of postal voting if it be properly protected. It seems to me that the greatest defect in the system is that the canvasser, under the Act, is an authorized witness, and he may take charge of the ballot-paper for posting purposes. Some one asked for an illustration of wrong-doing in this connection, and I may say that at Coleraine a Mr Lesser, who is a justice of the peace, a storekeeper, and, I suppose, a Liberal, was prosecuted for an infringement of the Act. It transpired, from in quiries made by a constable, that Mr . Lesser had asked no fewer than eleven healthy young women, who lived within l did 300 or 500 yards of a polling booth, to use the postal votes, and collected the papers from them. That is the sort of thing we wish to stop; and we suggest that the Act should be amended so as to provide that the authorized witnesses shall be permanent employees in the Commonwealth or State Service, or even municipal officers. If that were done, there would be no objection on the part of the Labour party to postal voting.",45
287,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Yarra) [4.35] - I do not think that such a Bill has ever before been introduced in a Parliament of this kind. It does not explain itself, and I am sure that no one on looking at it could understand it . It sets for t h that, ""Sections 3, 4, 14, 23, 35, and 3 8 "" o i the Act of 1911 are repealed; but when we look at that Act we find that the sections mentioned are not there, for the simple reason that tliey had been repealed previously. Section 14, which is the bone of contention, is represented in that Act by a row of stars, so that by the Bill before us we are asked to repeal stars. Honourable members opposite who have been quoting sections which they believe to be in existence, have really quoted clauses in the Bill which was introduced last year and abandoned. What is the history of postal voting ? Those who have been in this House since 1901 will remember that voting by post was introduced in the first Electoral Act . Prior to that, the system had been introduced in South Australia in 1896, in Western Australia in 1899, and in Victoria in 1900; but in the Commonwealth A ct the sections were adopted only from the Acts of South Australia and Western Australia. In the Act of 1909, to the part devoted to voting by post, we find the following foot-note: The whole of Part X of Act No. 19, 1902, as amended by Act No. 26, 1905, is repealed by Act No. 19, 1909, s. 18, and this Part is substituted in lieu tliereof. The postal-voting provisions have been amended in every Electoral Bill introduced. Postal voting was first instituted in 1902, and the sections were amended in 1905, 1909, and 1911; and I ask honourable members opposite to give another instance of any measure passed in this or any other Parliament that has been so chopped about.",45
288,Mr KELLY,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,There are very few cases wliere so much effort has been spent to perfect a measure.,46
289,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The measure was perfected by some honourable members, and, of course, the people were becoming more used to voting by post. We have been told by the honourable member for Kooyong that postal voting is not only for the infirm, but for business people. J remind the honourable member that if business people are able to get about, they can go to a polling booth, and the. absent vote is provided for them. No evidence has been produced that the absent voting provisions were abused at the last election. The Honorary Minister, when in troducing the amending Bill last year, said that some 80,000 persons had been deprived of their votes in the absence of voting by post, and he, at the same time, told us that voting by post was not safe. However, as a matter of fact, there have never been more than 30,000 postal votes at any election. In 1910 there were 29,249 postal votes returned; but the danger lies, not in the ballot-papers returned, but in those that are kept back. Let the Honorary Minister ask his own officers as to the number of postal ballot papers that are missing. Most honourable members have had experience as scrutineers, and have otherwise assisted at elections, and they know that the utmost care is taken to account for every ballot-paper provided. In the case of voting by post, however, there are many ballot-papers never returned. In 1910 there were 36,820 postal ballot-papers issued, and only 29,249 returned and counted. There were, however, 2,000 returned after the close of the poll, and too late to be counted; but there were 5,445 never returned at all. No trace of these ballot papers can be found ; and it is admitted by the electoral officials that 15 per Gent, are missing.",46
290,Mr RODGERS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,It may be that the votes were never exercised.,46
291,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"It may be, but I know Of a case where a woman, ill in bed, desired to vote, and the doctor who was attending her declined to witness the - ballot-paper because she insisted in voting in a certain way. However, the woman got some one else as witness; and I ask how we can be sure that if the doctor had witnessed the ballot-paper, it would ever have been sent back to the Returning Officer. At the election of 1913 the Federal Government offered to make every hospital in the Commonwealth a polling booth; but the Victorian Liberal Murray W at t Government refused to allow that to be done.",46
292,Mr RODGERS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The State Government have not absolute control of the whole of the hospitals.,46
293,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Wor d was sent to every hospital by the Commonwealth Electoral authorities as to the desire of the Government, but at one hospital the secretary told the Committee that the Victorian State Government had written urging them to refuse the application. The Victorian Government sent word to every hospital committee, urging them to refuse to permit a polling booth to be established.",46
294,Mr RODGERS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,I do not think that is right. The privilege was granted by many hospitals in Victoria.,46
295,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I am glad to hear it , but I do not know of any.",46
296,Mr KELLY,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"If it is a good thing to give patients in hospitals the right to vote, why do you object to giving the postal vote to sick people who are not in hospitals?",46
297,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Because it means handing the matter over to irresponsible people. In his speech last session the Honorary Minister said that the postal vote was not amply safeguarded.,47
298,Mr KELLY,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I said that the first of offenders was a Labour supporter. The first case was that of Stephen Barker, J.P.",47
299,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"When the information was dragged out of the Honorary Minister he had to admit that there was no fine imposed in that case, and that the Supreme Oourt held that the magistrate had given a wrong decision. What has the Honorary Minister to say about Mr. Lesser, of Coleraine, who ought to be in gaol for fraudulently using the postal vote, or about Mrs Humble, of Geelong, a member of the Australian Women's National League, who, I believe, was fined for some other offence in 1906. Honourable members claim that the postal vote will be of great advantage to people in the country districts. I have the official return issued by the Electoral Office of the last occasion on which the postal vote was in operation. There were the following votes recorded in the different StatesN.S.W. ... 25,084 ... Vie. ... 19,430 ... 13,338 Q. ... 7,662 ... 4,129 S.A. ... 5,981 ... WA. ... 3,371 ... 647 Tas. ... 1,608 ... 1,483 It will be seen that in regard to absent voting the percentage of electors to the population of the States was fair, but we find a differeut state of affairs in regard to voting by post.",47
300,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,To what vote are you referring?,47
301,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"To the 1911 vote on the referenda. Victoria is the most densely populated State, and has more polling booths to the square mile than any other part of Australia, yet this State polled 54 per cent, of all the postal votes recorded in Australia. Now let us see whether these votes were polled in the country or in the town. In New South Wales the highest number of postal votes recorded was in North Sydney. Is there likely to be more ill-health in North Sydney than in South Sydney? Yet 310 postal vote3 were recorded in North Sydney as compared with 19 recorded in South Sydney. In Victoria, at the 1911 referenda poll, there were 3,028 postal votes recorded in the three city constituencies of Balaclava, Pawkner, and Kooyong, as the compared with 2,048 postal votes recorded in the six Labour electorates of Batman, Bourke, Yarra, Melbourne, Melbourne Ports, and Maribyrnong. There were 876 in Balaclava, 926 in Fawkner, and 1,226 in Kooyong. In the last-named electorate 4.4 per cent, of the people voted by post.",47
302,Mr RODGERS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Do you say that it is wrong for people to take advantage of a privilege the law gives?,47
303,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"If honourable members desire this privilege for the country electorates alone, they can have it ; but they are not country electorates that I have quoted.",47
304,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,We desire it for all the electorates.,47
305,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The honourable member is honest enough to admit that he is anxious for these provisions for town and country, and they are used far more extensively in the city electorates. But when he goes to his electorate he will not Absent. Postal. say that he has urged the privilege for 2,554 the town people as well as the country people.",47
306,Mr GREENE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Why discriminate be2,646 tween the country and the city?",47
307,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Persons have to be more than 5 miles away before they can 63,136 24,797 apply for a postal vote.",47
308,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Not in the case of sickness or illness.,47
309,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I shall speak directly in regard to sickness and illness, and to the maternal duty that the Argus spoke of on Monday last. The honourable member for Hume also spoke this afternoon in some high-flown language about the women of the country. I shall show the birth rate in the districts which mostly use the postal votes.",47
310,Mr MATHEWS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"They get more ""buds from heaven"" down my way than in Kooyong.",47
311,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I shall compare the honourable member's electorate with such places as St. Kilda and Brighton. We were told by the Argus on Monday that "" by denying the vote to women laid aside by maternal duty that party sought to diminish the following of its opponents,"" but in those electorates where they make most use of the postal vote the birth rate is twenty per thousand, as compared with thirty-six per thousand in Footscray. If honourable members claim that the postal vote is used on account of ill-health, can they say that there is more ill health in Kooyong than in the electorate of Yarra? Do the conditions under which the people of Kooyong live compare less favourably with those under which people live on the other side of the Yarra in the district that I happen to represent? Every honourable member knows that the conditions in Kooyong are far more favourable than those in the Yarra electorate. Whereas about 4 per cent, voted by post in the electorates of Kooyong, Balaclava, and Fawkner, only 1.6 per cent, voted by post in the Labour constituencies of Batman, Bourke, Maribyrnong, Melbourne, Melbourne Ports, and Yarra. More than 5 per cent, of the electors of Ballarat voted by post in 1911, and at that time Ballarat was a compact electorate. Will honourable members say' that it is right to have a system of voting whereby 15 per cent, of the ballot-papers could go astray, as was the case in the 1910 election? cials admit that there is no means of tracing 15 per cent, of the postal ballot papers issued at that election. statement is taken from official figures given in a return prepared to the order of Senator MCColl, and laid on the table of the Senate in 1910. Fifteen per cent, of the votes were not returned. able members will understand that once a man applies for a postal-voting certificate he cannot get an ordinary ballot paper without handing up the postal-voting certificate. Every presiding officer asks, "" Have you applied for a postal-vote certificate ? Have you voted anywhere else in connection with this election?"" If any postal ballot-papers were returned in that way, they would have been credited by the officials and checked off, but in Ballarat at the 1911 Beferendum 5 per cent, of the people voted by post-1,009 out of 17,023.",47
312,Mr CONROY,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,And there were about 150 votes not accounted for?,48
313,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Thes e .votes do go astray, because it is known that partisans can witness ballot-papers, and, having done that, can destroy them if the votes are not to their liking. Honourable members opposite speak about the women desiriug to vote. In some electorates nearly as many men as women voted by post, and those men could have utilized the absent vote. The marvellous unanimity of the postal vote is a feature' that strikes one all along. I find, in connection with the referenda, that in Kooyong there were 1,115 cast in a certain direction in reference to one proposal, and 1,114 cast in the same direction in reference to another proposal. Right through the whole of the divisions the same thing applied; but there was nothing quite like those figures for Kooyong, where the postal voters - were all so well-tutored, or had the votes made out for them.",48
314,Mr CONROY,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,You r objection is that more voted Liberal than voted Labour.,48
315,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I have never said anything of the kind. I guarantee that in my electorate I will get far more postal votes than are recorded against me, and I always have done; but, naturally, if one is getting three or four votes to every one that his opponent receives, he is likely to get a majority, even of postal The offivotes. Honourable members argue that the postal vote is for the benefit of the country constituencies. Is it not wonThis derful that all the big postal votes are recorded i u the towns? The metropolitan constituencies of Balaclava, Fawkner, aud Kooyong recorded more postal votes than any half-dozen country places. Honor- In New South Wales, North Sydney, which is not a country electorate, topped the list with 310 postal votes, whilst Cowper, a country electorate, had only 25. In Queenlsand, Brisbane, the city electorate, recorded 1,069 postal votes out of a total poll of 18,962; and Kennedy, an electorate twice the size of Victoria, 166 postal votes out of a total poll of 10,774.",48
316,Mr FLEMING,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,How many did not vote at all? They are not accustomed to the system.,48
317,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,It has been in existence for twelve years.,48
318,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,What is the total percentage of votes recorded in Kennedy? ,48
319,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The percentage of votes recorded to enrolment was 46.,48
320,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,That is very low.,48
321,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"It was lower during the 1911 vote than in the elections of 1910 or 1913. There was a smaller average vote in 1911 than there was afterwards. The only country electorate that used the postal vote more than the city electorates was Swan, in Western Australia, but the total for Swan, which was the highest in the State, was only a few greater than Perth. In all the other States it was the city and town electorates which used the postal vote most. Honourable members on the Government side are always sneering at the town electorates, and saying they are only as big as pocket handkerchiefs or counterpanes, and they desire to disfranchise the people who dwell in the towns. The honourable member for Hume said this afternoon that the postal vote was of great advantage to women, who, on account of child-birth, were unable to attend a polling booth to record their votes. I have already said that the birth rate was higher in the districts which had the lowest percentage of postal votes than in the constituency of Kooyong. What is the position in regard to the birth rate? In Malvern, Camberwell, and Hawthorn-whic h are in the Kooying electorate-and in St. Kilda, Balaclava, and Brighton-Hent y electorate-and all of these are Liberal electorates-ther e is a population of 96,730. The number of births, according to the Statistical Register of Victoria, during the year 1912, was 2,096, and the birth rate is only 21 per 1,000. In Richmond, in the Yarra electorate; Brunswick, in the Bourke electorate; and Footscray, in the Melbourne Ports electorate-thes e are Labour electorates - with a population of 99,570, the number of births was 3,129, and the average 31 per 1,000. In other words, the birth rate in the working-class suburbs was 50 per cent, higher than in the aristocratic districts. It is not the working classes, as exPresident Roosevelt said, that, are going in for race suicide. Is it not the rich who are doing that?",49
322,Mr RODGERS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,That is a cruel thing to say.,49
323,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"No ; it is not. figures speak for themselves. adult population in those aristocratic suburbs is higher than in the working class districts I have mentioned. In the latter there is a large population of children, yet the birth rate in Richmond was 29.33 per thousand; in Brunswick, 29.47; and in Northcote, 32.70.  rural constituencies compare?",49
324,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The average for the metropolis is 27.48, for the urban places like Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, and Warrnambool, 33, and for the rural districts, 22 per thousand. That is how the far-back rural places compare.",49
325,Mr FLEMING,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,A lot of the country people come into the towns.,49
326,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I know they do. Then where is the argument of honourable members opposite, if the country people come into the towns ? The birth rate in Footscray was 37.53, and in Fitzroy, 28.42these are all in Labour electorates, which do not use the postal vote-as compared with St. Kilda, 23.69; Brighton, 29.61; Hawthorn, 19.86; Malvern, 22; and Camberwell, 19.85, the electorates which used the postal vote extensively.",49
327,Mr RODGERS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,You are over-proving your case.,49
328,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"-No , I am not. I am showing that the birth rate is 31 per thousand in the working places, whilst in the' districts represented by my honourable friends opposite, who say that they desire to restore the postal vote for the benefit of women who are performing the highest function of their sex, the rate is 50 per cent, lower.",49
329,Mr RODGERS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,You must remember that the electors have to travel longer distances in the rural electorates.,49
330,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I have surely proved that the postal vote was not exercised in the rural constituencies to the same extent as in the towns and cities. In Yarra, wliere the birth rate was about 30 per thousand, 181 persons used the postal vote idle in connection with the 1911 referenda. In Kooyong, with a birth rate of only about 20 per thousand, 1,226 persons used the postal vote. In otlier words, more than six times as many people voted by post in that district compared with an The electorate where the birth rate was 50 The per cent, higher. Where, then, is the argument of honourable members that the vote was taken by the Labour party away from women when they are performing their highest function?",49
331,Mr RODGERS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Suppos e you prove your figures, you do not then prove that there was any illegal use of the vote.",50
332,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"If the argument for the postal vote is that it is required hy mothers at the period when they are unable to get to the polling booth, surely we as a party would be doing ourselves an injury by taking away that vote. For instance, we know that in the constituency represented by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports the birth-rate is 50 per cent, higher than in the constituency of Kooyong. know that the postal vote was abused, as was admitted by the Honorary Minister, and that it was used by people whom the Act never intended to use it . The adult population is higher in the electorates of Kooyong and Henty than in such electorates as Melbourne, Yarra, Batman, or Bourke, yet the latter are the places where the birth-rate is highest. figures prove that the arguments of honourable members on the Government side are not correct. They profess to be desirous of extending the franchise, but in State politics which is the party that restricts the franchise of the Legislative Councils ? Is it not known by every honourable member that less than one-third of the persons who are enfranchised for the Federal Parliament are enfranchised for the Legislative Council of Victoria? Yet has any Liberal stood up and advocated the liberalization of the Upper House franchise in any of the States ? "" Mr Rodgers - The present Attorney General has done more to liberalize the franchise than any other person.",50
333,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The Attorney-General has a great record in regard to the enfran- the franchise. chisement of the people! He has done more to restrict the franchise than has any man in politics today. I regret that he is not in the chamber. If he were I should have more to say about him in this regard. Honourable members opposite profess to be in favour of extending the franchise, but they cannot point to a speech made by any member of their party in favour of extending the franchise for the Legislative Council of' Victoria. They complain of the composition of the Senate, where we have twenty-nine members of the Labour party as against seven Liberals. They say that the Constitution needs to be amended, and that [71] the people are not properly represented in' that Chamber. But have they ever said a word in favour of broadening the franchise for the Victorian Legislative Council, where there are thirty Liberals to four members of the Labour party? The honourable member for Melbourne conclusively proved last night that members of the Liberal party in State politics have always blocked the way to the re-, form of the Victorian Legislative Council, and that they will continue to do so until the State Labour party becomes We strong enough to assert itself.",50
334,Mr GREGORY,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Who framed the Commonwealth Constitution? Did the Labour party have anything to do with it?,50
335,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,There was only one Labour man in the Convention. The rest o.f the delegates were anti-Labourites.  present franchise.,50
336,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"They did not; As those who were in the first Federal Parliament know, the franchise for this Parliament was fixed by the Parliament itself.",50
337,Mr GREGORY,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,What nonsense!,50
338,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The honourable member was not a member of the first Federal Parliament. At that time he was being tossed out of ' politics in Western Australia. This Parliament determined the franchise.,50
339,Mr GROOM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,But the Federal Convention framed the Constitution which enabled the widest possible franchise to be given.,50
340,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,This Parliament framed,50
341,Mr GROOM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Unde r the Constitution.,50
342,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,There are so many interjections that it is difficult to follow the honourable member who is addressing the Chair. I ask honourable members to cease interjecting.,50
343,Mr TUDOR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"It would be a good thing, sir, if some of the interjectors opposite were put out. It would teach them a lesson. It cannot be denied that the franchise for this Parliament was fixed by the Parliament itself. At the first general election for the Commonwealth there was only one State-that of South Australia-in which females were allowed to vote. The first Parliament of the Commonwealth, however, deliberately extended the franchise to all adults, and increased the facilities for voting. In conclusion, I wish only to say that the Bill is so drafted that no layman, looking at it, could understand what it means. It professes, first of all, by one word to do away with a blank in the jAct of 1911, and to restore no fewer than four pages of legislation relating to the postal vote, providing only the safeguards which a member of the present Ministry has admitted were quite ineffective, and proved disastrous when previously applied. That is what the Government are proposing, not for the good of the country, but for a purely party purpose. It is admitted by them that this Bill has been introduced solely for a party purpose, and I feel sure that but for that fact they would be prepared to listen to proposals brought forward by us to render it a more perfect piece of legislation.",50
344,Mr BENNET T,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Gippsland) [5.21]. - Mr Deputy Speaker - Mr JH CATTS - Why this ""stonewall""?",51
345,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"When the supporters of the Government refrain from occupying the time of the House, they are accused of a conspiracy of silence; and when they rise to speak, they are charged with "" stone-walling."" The measure before the House goes much further than many honourable members appear to imagine. . It is somewhat remarkable that,. whilst honourable members opposite profess a great anxiety to extend the franchise, they are fertile in objections to a measure having for its object the extension of facilities for the exercise of the franchise. I am not going to say that the'Bill is perfect, butit will at least bring"" us up to the position which existed in this respect between 1901 and 1910- Having regard to the result of the elections held from time to time during that period, it is difficult to understand why the Opposition should oppose this measure. It was at the general election of 1910, to which this system of postal voting applied, that Labour achieved its greatest success. The honourable member for Yarra and the honourable member for Oxley have quoted certain statistics as to the percentage of postal votes cast, but it is worthy of note that the figures they submitted related in every case to the referenda, and not to the general election of 1910. To me the figures relating to the referenda in 1911 are easily explainable. We are all aware that the supporters of the Labour party were by no means unanimous as to the wisdom of proposed amendments of the Constitution, whereas the Liberal party of Australia were united in their opposition to them.",51
346,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,All the Liberal voters ?,51
347,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Yes . In these circumstances, the poll was very largely a Liberal one. The proposed amendments of the Constitution as put forward by the Labour party were defeated by something like 250,000 votes. Many supporters of Labour absolutely refused to vote. For that reason, the percentage of persons who made use of the postal-vote system in Labour constituencies was comparatively small; whereas in the Liberal constituencies, the Liberals having decided to vote against the f>roposed amendments of the Constitution, there was a much larger percentage of ballot-papers issued. It will be found that at the 1910 election the percentage of postal votes recorded in Labour constituencies was larger than that in the case of Liberal constituencies. A great deal bf attention has been given to the use of the postal-vote system in the electorate of Kooyong. But, as the representative of that electorate pointed oub this morning, the number of postal ballot papers issued there in 1910 was less than in many other constituencies within the metropolitan area. In the electorate of Bourke, for instance, 925 postal ballot papers were issued, whilst in Kooyong there were only 849.",51
348,Mr RODGERS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,What is the explanation ?,51
349,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Accordin g to the honourable member for Oxley, the man who had the most money to spend got the most postal votes. We must apply that explanation to the other side.",51
350,Mr BURNS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The honourable member for Bourke has a lot of money!,51
351,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The argument is not mine, but that of the honourable member for Oxley. Coming to the rural constituencies, we find that at the general election in 1910, 1,122 postal ballot-papers, were issued in the electorate of Wannon, which, so far as Victoria is concerned, was second only to Ballarat in this respect. On .that occasion, the Labour J3 candidate, Mr MCDougall, was successful in the fight for the Wannon seat. These figures dispose of the contention that the postal-vote system is of greater service to one section of the community than it is to another. I hold that we a should be prepared to adopt any amendment of the Act which will increase the facilities for voting.",51
352,Mr ARTHUR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Subject , of course,- to proper safeguards.",52
353,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The honourable member's reference to safeguards reminds me that under the Electoral Act of 1911, which was passed by the Pisher Government, it was provided that any elector who had reason to believe that he would be out of Australia on polling day should be at liberty to vote at any time after the issue of the writs.",52
354,Mr ARTHUR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Before whom ?,52
355,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Before an Electoral Registrar. Under that Act it was not even necessary, in such circumstances, for a ballot-paper to be issued. The elector had merely to enter an Electoral Registrar's office, state that he was on the roll for such-and-such a constituency, and, without furnishing any proof of his statement, he was allowed to vote.",52
356,Mr ARTHUR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Jus t as he would do on polling day.,52
357,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Quite so. I am not objecting to the provision. All that I contend is that if it was right to make that provision for the exercise of the franchise by one section of the' community-by people who were going out of Australia, many of them, never to come back again-surel y it is fair to provide for the exercise of the franchise by taxpayers who are remaining in Australia but who, because of sickness or infirmity, cannot go to a polling booth.",52
358,Mr ARTHUR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"We agree with that idea, provided that the voting takes place before such an officer as an Electoral Registrar.",52
359,Mr JH CATTS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,That provision was not inserted for the benefit of people permanently leaving Australia.,52
360,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I am not speaking of what was intended, but I have no hesitation in saying that some of the first votes which I received were cast by persons leaving Australia, who, although they intended to return, have not done so, but have taken up their abode in another part of the world. Honourable members opposite made it possible for any [71]- 2 amount of fraud to take place. I do not say that there was fraud. This Government is proposing an amendment of the law which widens the franchise for those who live in the country, and at the same time necessary safeguards are provided. Honourable members opposite provided no safeguards. No doubt it suited them to pass the legislation that they did, and to benefit certain sections of the community. I desire that the amendment now proposed shall become law, because it will make it easier for the primary producers, especially those who live in remote and rough parts of the country, to record their votes. The constituency which I have the honour to represent covers a fifth of the area of Victoria, and is probably the most rugged and mountainous in Australia.",52
361,Mr ARTHUR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,And the most neglected by the State.,52
362,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,I am not now discussing State matters. The State Government and Parliament are able to deal with State affairs.,52
363,Mr GROOM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Thing s would be worse if the Labour party got into power.,52
364,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Yes. _ The first thing that the Labour party did last Parliament was to repeal certain sections of the Electoral Act of 1909, and thus preventing a large number of electors from voting at the election of 1913. Last session the Government submitted an amending Electoral Bill, but the opposition to it was so great, the talk lasting for weeks, that it had ""to be abandoned, notwithstanding that the Attorney-General had promised the fullest consideration for amendments in Committee. Then the short amending Bill, which we have now before us, was brought in. The honourable member for Melbourne yesterday mentioned incidents which reflected no credit on those concerned in them. But the electoral law was amended after the Committee whose report he quoted had made its recommendations.",52
365,Mr GROOM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Yes , and in consequence of them. Furthermore, the amendments were accepted by the Labour party, which was satisfied then with the postal vote.",52
366,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Seriou s penalties were provided for any breach of the law, and care was taken to prevent fraud. I have been closely connected with elections for many years, and I cannot cite an instance of undue or improper use of the postal vote in either State or Commonwealth elections. It is an insult to the honesty and intelligence of the community to suggest that our people are ""so weak-minded that they could be influenced to vote against their convictions, or so dishonest that they would attempt to use improper influence. Honourable members opposite, when it suits them, accuse their opponents of slandering the country, but they do not hesitate to slander it themselves. The restoration of the postal vote will give to electors in remote places facilities for the exercise of the franchise, of which they were deprived by the Labour party, and in a democratic community every elector should have an opportunity to vote. The honourable member for.Bendigo recognises the need for amending the law in this direction, though he opposes the proposal of the Government.",52
367,Mr ARTHUR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,We wish to propose another amendment.,53
368,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I maintain that the Government is doing the right thing. The Bill may not be perfect, but it will make the electoral law better than it is now, and I hope that it will soon be placed on the statute-book. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee:",53
369,Mr JH CATTS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I ask for a [Quorum formed.""] Clause 1This Act may be cited as the Postal Voting Restoration Act 1913.",53
370,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Ballarat) [5.42] do not know why this measure should be cited as the "" Postal Voting Restoration Act 1913,"" seeing that this year is 1914.",53
371,Mr GROOM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,A Bill may be postorable dated.,53
372,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The first year the Hegira might be used in the title.  was away when the Bill was introduced.,53
373,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,That may account for my not knowing the reason for datglaring ing the Bill 1913. My impression that the Bill of 1913 disappeared when this Chamber refused to accept the amendments made in it by the Senate. I do not know who is to blame for this evident error in regard to the date.,53
374,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,It is not an error; it is intentional.,53
375,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I see; this is a test Bill, and must be a copy in every particular of the Bill introduced last session. This shows that the Government do not introduce the Bill to give the postal vote, but only to bring about a double dissolution. Why did the Government not t date last year's Bill 1912 instead of' 1913 ? I am not surprised, however, to find this Ministry a year behind the times; but the plan adopted will be very misleading in the future to people who desire to look up the legislation of the present year. Further, there is the absurdity that, while the Bill itself is endorsed as having been read for the first time on the 29th May of this year, it is to be cited as an Act of last year.",53
376,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,It was . read a first time this year.,53
377,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Then why cite it as an Act of last year?,53
378,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Because we like the title-it is a very good title.,53
379,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The records of every Australian Parliament might be searched in vain for a precedent of thiB kind.,53
380,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The Government Preference Prohibition Bill was so dated.,53

384,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I do not believe that the Bill will become law by 1955, - I because the people have to pronounce judgment on it, and the sooner the better, especially - as far as this House is concerned. It is remarkable how silent honmembers opposite were a little while ago, and how, now when there is of an opportunity for the Bill to go through, they are talking against time.",53
385,Mr AHERN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Le t the Bill go through now.,53
386,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"What , with this anomaly in it? I agree with the is qld Chartists who, in their petition to Parliament, demanded universal suffrage, exemption from the corruption of the wealthy, and the violence of the powerful, and secrecy of the ballot. I suppose the Government are afraid to go to the Governor General and ask him for a double dissolution on a test measure that is not an exact copy of the measure of last year. However, I move That the figure "" 3"" bo left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the figure "" 4.""",53

388,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,We prefer the present title.,54
389,Mr ARTHUR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"That may be, and I have no doubt that, under the powers of Parliament, the Bill might be dated 4,000 B.C., or given the number of the beast, 666. Why say that this is to be cited as an Act of 1913, when it really, if it passes, will be an Act of 1914 ? The present title certainly makes the real object of the Bill most apparent. Does the Attorney-General think that the section of the Constitution is so technical, or so devoid of substance, as to necessitate the citing of this Bill as an Act of 1913? Mr W. H . IBVINE - Does the honourable member think it pleasant or material to suggest a double dissolution?",54
390,Mr ARTHUR,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I do not know whether it is pleasant to the Attorney General, but it is pleasant to me to discuss the matter, because I think the real object of the Government is emphasized by the citation. On what grounds does the Attorney-General think it necessary to date the Bill "" 1913,"" when such a citation is utterly irrelevant to any part of the measure? I hope..that our Constitution is not such an absurdity as to require a procedure such as this. I hope that the amendment' will be carried, .in order that the sincerity of the Government in introducing this Bill may be. made apparent, and that it will be made.,, more apparent that the Bill, and that preceding it, are simply a part of a scheme to mit a fraud ou the Constitution - the figures "" 1913.""",54
391,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Kennedy) [6.1] As the Government are making a desperate effort to remain on the Treasury bench, and as it is their object to there as long as they can, and seeing any alteration to this clause would them in that object, I trust the honourable member for Ballarat will withdraw his amendment. The other day the Attoran ney-General challenged us in a most phatic way. He said, "" Do so-and-so, and we will show you what we shall do."" But the honourable member, when he got the opportunity, failed to do anything, and I have not the slightest doubt that if this Bill goes through in the present form he will take as little action as he took in relation to the Government Preference Prohibition Bill. I do not think that he is sincere. If I thought that he was sincere I would be anxious to see the Bill go through, but Ministers are simply marking time, and are prepared to be sat on whenever the Senate care to do so. We should not play with legislation merely to satisfy the Government. The honourable member for Bendigo has just shown that the Bill is a fraud on the Constitution. Every one knows it. The honourable member raised a very important point in asking whether an alteration from ""1913"" to ""1914""- would make any difference in the matter of obtaining a double dissolution. I do not think it will make any difference, because there is no possible hope of a double dissolution being obtained. The Attorney General will take no action so long as he gets the measure through. It is one of his pet schemes. The amendment suggested would make no difference, because later on legal gentlemen, in citing this measure, will not bother much as to whether it is dated ""1913"" or ""1914."" In the circumstances, we might let the clause go.",54

Mr Webster - Surely after all the Opposition have done for them they would not turn us down. I cannot understand comhow the Attorney-General is clinging to",54
393,Mr AGAB WYNNE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,They are lucky.,54
394,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"We thought so at one time, but it was a delusion, and out of stay sympathy with honourable members oppothat site I am doing them an act of kindness aid in pointing out that it is not wise to adhere to them. How can an Act of Parliament passed in 1914 be designated Act of 1913? We cannot legislate emretrospectively. The Attorney-General, with all his wisdom, his marvellous concentration of mind, and ability to detect little technical details and flaws in legislative enactments ov constitutional proposals, with all his skill, training, ability, circumspection, and alertness, fails on one of the simplest propositions which it is possible to conceive. He surmounts mountains, yet falls over a molehill. He fails to recognise that the present year is 1914. The Treasurer, who is usually good at figures, has also failed to perceive this error in the title of the Bill.",54
395,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I have a suggestion to make to get over this great difficulty. Mr ""WEBSTER - I am glad to hear that we are to receive something in the shape of a materialized idea from the Attorney-General. He has been so satisfied through getting a certain Bill passed that we did not expect anything of the sort. He made a promise that when he got that Bill passed he would soon let the country know what the Government would do. He said they would act quickly. I wish him to act quickly in this regard. Knowing that it is dangerous to hold him back when he is anxious to say something, I shall be kind to him, and give him the opportunity he desires.",55
396,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Flinders-Attor ney-General) [6.13] - It is my duty to do everything that I can to meet these great constitutional difficulties, and I desire to point out that a proposal to amend the Bill by substituting ""1914'^ for "" 1913 "" is a little premature, because the measure may not be. passed until 1915, or 1916, or even 1917. However, I can tell honourable members what I shall do. If they allow the Bill to go through in its present form, and if it goes through another place, and is sent back to this House witli an amendment from that place substituting "" 1914 "" for "" 1913,"" the Government will accept it.",55

399,Mr MATHEWS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Melbourne Ports) [6.15] - I do not understand the figures 1913. I thought the Attorney-General would have been kind enough to those honourable members who entreated him to do so, to explain how it is possible for this measure to have in its title the year 1913, when it is only introduced in the year 1914.",55
400,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The honourable member for Bendigo has already told you.,55
401,Mr MATHEWS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I know the Attorney-General has told us that, if another place merely alters the figures to 1914, he will accept the amendment. But why the Attorney-General should leave his work to be done by another place, I do not know. Remembering the honourable member's past political actions, I have some suspicion that he has an intention, in regard to this title, that is likely to be disastrous to those whom I represent. It .appears to me that if, when the Bill is passed under this title, it suits the Attorney-General and his party, they will allow it to remain as it is; but if it does not suit them  vernor-General to alter it.",55
402,Mr MATHEWS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I believe they could even get him to do that if it suited them. Is this a case with the Government of ""Heads we win, tails you lose""? I have' never seen a Bill bearing a date earlier than the year in which it was introduced. When the Government can deprive honourable members of privileges, which we are supposed to have, and which are just as necessary to us as any Act, there is nothing to prevent a majority on the Government side from passing the Bill in such a form that, if it suits them, it can be accepted, and if it does not suit them, they will object to it. There seems to be some such, intention on the part of the Government in putting the year 1913 in the title. As a rule, the Attorney General gives honourable members all information that is required, and I should like to know why he is so oyster-like in regard to this Bill? I do not believe that even the Government members know why 1913 appears in the title. I doubt' if the title was ever discussed in the Liberal Caucus. It emanated ""from the mind of the Attorney-General, who, no doubt, wondered if honourable members on that side would discover this peculiar feature of the title. There does seem to besomething peculiar in using 1913 instead of 191*, "" Mr GROOM - What do you mean to insinuate? Do you mean peculiar in the drafting ?",55
403,Mr MATHEWS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I do not blame those who drafted the Bill. No doubt they carried out their instructions. idea of the Government was, I suppose, that, with a view to making this measure a means of bringing about a double dissolution, the short title should be same as that of the Bill of last session: They might just as well have given the measure any other short t it l e . might equally as well have called it "" The hope to keep the Treasury Bench Bill .

I do not know whether the Attorney-General has drafted the title in this way for that When there is a Government composed of a large number of legal men, they consider that their first duty is to their own calling, and thab they are bound to make as much work as possible for the legal profession. This bears on the face of it the word? "" Bead a first time, May, 1014,"" and under that appears the short title "" Postal Vote Restoration Act 1913."" I cannot stand that contradiction. It does seem strange that we cannot have Bills so drafted that the outside public will be able to understand them without the aid of members of the legal profession.",56
405,Unknown,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 2Sections three, four, fourteen, twenty-three, thirty-five, and thirty-eight of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1911 are repealed, and the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902-1909 which were repealed by those sections aro hereby revived and re-enacted.",56
406,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Hunter) [8.1] - Clause 2 provides for the restoration of the system of voting by post, for which the Ac t of 1902-1909 provided, and which was repealed in 19H because of the abuse to which if had been subjected. I take the view that party considerations should not be imported into the discussion of electoral questions. Our electoral machinery should be designed to give those who are entitled to vote the fullest opportunity to do so. We should divest ourselves altogether of party feeling in - discussing a question of the kind. I have The always held this view, believing that the electoral law is a people's question. We cannot compel people to vote, but we should give them every facility to do so. the Experience having shown that our system is not all that we could wish it to be, we should try to remedy its defects. They We should profit by our experience and try to prevent the recurrence of incidents which no one can justify. Finding that the postal-voting system was abused and did not meet the real purpose for which it was designed, we abolished it . In the light of later experience we are justified I am in making whatever amendments may be necessary in our electoral system, but as a deliberative Assembly we ought not to restore provisions that were found to be obnoxious and unsatisfactory. Instead of a recognition of the fact that this question should be dealt with on its merits, purpose. we have had a party significance attached to it . We all know that the Bill has been introduced by the Government to secure a certain definite object. I .hold that there is no justification for auy party to introduce a measure of this kind Bill merely to achieve the particular purpose that we know the Government have in view. This question affects every adult in Australia, and we should approach it under- as reasonable men, anxious to provide facilities for the exercise of the franchise by all who desire to do so. When this Bill was before the House last session I submitted an amendment with that object in view. It was not, however, acceptable to the Government and was rejected. The Bill has been re-introduced in its original form. Many amendments of the Electoral Act which are certainly necessary have been allowed by the Government to remain in abeyance. They, have centred their attention on the question of the restoration of the postal vote. No one has a keener desire than I have that every person shall have ample opportunity to record his vote, but to re-subm it a measure for the restoration of a system which has proved to be unsatisfactory, is to ask us to take a retrograde, rather than a forward, step. If the Government are prepared to meet us in our effort to arrive at a reasonable solution of the problem as to the best means of enabling the sick and the infirm to vote without, at the same time, leaving the door open to abuse, they will have my whole-hearted support, and; I think I may safely say, the support of the party wibh which I am identified. We are, and always have been, in favour of every opportunity being given the sick and the infirm to record their vote. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Is that why Labour Government repealed altogether the postal-voting provisions of the Act?",56
407,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,We repealed them because they were open to abuse. We found that tliey were being used by many who were neither sick nor infirm.,57
408,Mr ABCHIBALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,On l y scheming.,57
409,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Quite so. found that they were being used most freely in thickly populated centres of population, where certain persons appointed under the provisions of the Act were able to get to work in a systematic way. People who were capable of doing their daily work, when recommended to apply for postal-vote certificates in very many cases did so. Hundreds of those who availed themselves of the system were not sick. Por instance, can it be said that there was a larger proportion of sick persons in Kooyong than in any other electorate ?",57
410,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The birth-rate there is the lowest.,57
411,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Yes , yet more applications were made for postal votes there than in any other electorate. Is it reasonable to believe that there were more sick people in Kooyong than in the rest of Victoria? I think not, and the fact that so many applications were made for postal-vote certificates in that electorate suggests that many who were able tb go to the poll adopted the suggestion made to them that they should vote by post.",57
412,Mr BOVD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The Labour party would cure a cold by cutting off the patient's head. Mr . CHARLTON - We sympathize with the sick and the infirm.,57
413,Mr RODGERS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Why Labour party's sympathy with them take political, shape during the three years that they were in office?",57
414,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"We would give the sick and the infirm every facility to vote. We cannot go back to the old system which so lent itself to abuse, but if we find that there is room for improvement, surely we should be prepared to make the necessary amendments of the law. We should devise some means of meeting the position which has since arisen even if we have to send the whole matter to a Committee. I think we ought to endeavour to provide a means of enabling the sick and infirm to vote without opening the door to any abuse of the the law. W it h that object in view, I propose to move an amendment. It must necessarily be a lengthy one since this is practically a Bill of only one clause re-enacting a large number of sections in the Act of 1902-1909, providing for voting by post, which were repealed by the Act of 1911. My amendment is deWe signed, as far as possible, to provide the machinery to enable the really sick and infirm to exercise the franchise. It is in two sections. I would eliminate clause 2, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following: 1. (a) An elector who, owing to serious illness or infirmity, has reason to believe that he will not be able to record his vote at any polling place during the hours of polling on the day of election, may, at any time after the issue of the writ, and up to within seven days preceding the day of election, make application to the Returning Officer of the Division in which he is enrolled that he be allowed to record his vote. . (b) The Returning Officer on a day previous to the election, and after the time for receiving applications has expired, - shall instruct a Presiding Officer, who sball, prior to or on the day of election, call at the address of the person who claims a vote, and if satisfied that the applicant is entitled to vote under the provisions of this section shall supply the applicant with a ballot-paper which the voter will mark - in the prescribed manner in the presence of the officer, and if the voter so desires, of a relative or other person, but so that the officer cannot see the manner in which the ballot'paper is marked, and shall then fold the ballot paper so as to hide the vote, and then in the presence of the officer deposit the ballot-paper in a sealed ballot-box which shall be provided and remain in the custody of the officer until it is given into the charge of the Divisional Returning Officer. The ballot-paper shall be opened by and counted by the Returning Officer at the scrutiny after the closing of the Ballot. (c) Provided that in the case of any elector who resides more than five miles from a polling did not the place, and who owing to serious illness or infirmity has reason to believe that he will not be able to record his vote at any polling place during the liours of polling on the day of election may, at any time after the issue of the writ and up to within seven days preceding the day of election, make application to the Returning Officer of the Division in which he is enrolled that he be allowed to record his vote. The Returning Officer may, if the elector makes application to record his vote, appoint any c-f the following persons to wait upon the elector, viz. :-Postmaster s or postmistresses or persons in charge of post offices; head teachers in the employment of a State Education Department; officers of the Department of Trade and Customs; members of the Police Force of the Commonwealth or of a State; and such persons so appointed shall and may exercise all the powers of the Presiding Officer as set forth in (b) of this clause. 2. Any elector who has reason to believe(a) That he will not on polling day, during the hours of polling, be within five miles of any polling place; or (ii) That he will on polling day be in quarantine within the Commonwealth; or may after the issue of the writ, upon making a declaration in the prescribed form before a postmaster, vote under the provisions of section 139 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 19021911 or as an absent voter. Provided that(1) The declaration shall be made and the vote shall be recorded only at the post ofilce of which such post master is in charge; and (2) The declaration shall not be valid unless such postmaster stamps the declaration with post office letter stamp of the date upon which the declaration is made.",57
415,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The amendment is not in order. The honourable member practically proposes the insertion of a new clause. Before that can be done, clause 2 must be negatived. May, dealing with Bills in Committee, page 487, saysNeither may an amendment bo proposed to insert words at the commencement of a clause with a vievi' to proposing an alternative scheme to that contained in the clause, or to leave out from the first word to the end of the clause, or, in order to substitute otber words, such amendments being in the nature of a new clause. In such a case the regular course is to negative the question, that the clause stand part of the Bill, and to bring up a new clause at the proper time. £",58
416,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,I wish to know whether we are to be ruled by May or by our own Standing Orders?,58
417,Mr GROOM,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The honourable member for Hunter intimated that his amendment would be a new clause.,58
418,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"He did moved the insertion of certain words. I ask whether the Standing Orders do not - permit a member of the Committee to move to insert certain words, or to leave out words, or to insert a new clause. If we are not to do this, let it be said distinctly that the Chairman is going to assist others to prevent the proper course of business. Then we shall know where we are.",58
419,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Where ing Orders do not expressly provide a rule, recourse must be had to May's Parliamentary Practice.",58
420,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Our Standing Orders expressly apply in this case.,58
421,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"So far as my recollection serves, it has always been the practice to negative a clause before substituting for it some other provision, and I can conceive of no other procedure as being proper. I have ruled in accordance with our Standing Orders and with May's Parliamentary Practice as-1 understand the authorities to apply.",58
422,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Is it not possible to move the omission of certain words, with a view to the insertion of other words, when the amendment is relevant to the question before the Committee ?",58
423,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,What is proposed to be inserted is practically a new clause. The amendment cannot be moved in substitution for the existing clause.,58
424,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I would point out' that the clause differs from ordinary clauses. It does not contain any definite enactment in the ordinary sense, but repeals a number of sections of an Act, and substitutes for them already repealed sections of an earlier Act . The amendment is in order, because it is relevant to the clause, and it is not a new clause.",58
425,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I rule that the amendment is in the nature of a new clause, and therefore cannot be moved u n t i l the clause before the Chair has been negatived.",58
426,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I moveTlint the Chairman's ruling be dissented from. My reasons for taking this step are-first , that the amendment which is now ruled out of order was moved last session and accepted; second, that it is competent for any member of the Committee to move the* omission of words i i i ' a clause for the insertion of other words. To show the absurdity of the contention that the not. He amendment is a new clause, I would point out that if the clause werecarried there would be no use for the amendment. The proposal is to amend the clause in certain respects. The proper course is to put from the Chair the question that certain words proposed to be left out stand part of the clause.",58
427,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Will the honourable member put into writing, according to the Standing Orders, his objection to our Stand- the ruling?",58
428,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I have merely to dissent from your r u l in g ; but if it is wished to waste ""time, I have no objection to doing what is suggested. As I have pointed out, it is only in cases in which - our Standing Orders are silent that recourse is to be had to May's Parliamentary Practice. Standing order 128 says, speaking of amendmentsA question having been proposed may he amended (1) by leaving out certain words only, (2) by leaving out certain words, in order to insert or add other words. 'The Chairman ruled the amendment out of order on the ground that it is a new clause.",58
429,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The honourable member for Hunter, in moving the amendment, distinctly stated that he proposed it in substitution for the provision - in the Bill.",59
430,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"As I understand the amendment, it would partly amend the provisions proposed to be re-enacted, restoring the postal vote to sick persons and persons in a delicate state of health, whereas the clause, as it stands, restores the postal vote in its entirety, and allows its exercise by persons who may not be sick, but who may, on polling day, be more than 5 miles from a polling place for the division for which they are enrolled. There is a vital difference betweeiTthe two proposals. I take objection to the ruling that we cannot amend this clause. I say that it can be amended so long as the amendment is relevant to the clause.",59
431,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The honourable member himself gives a reason why I should not accept the amendment. He states that there is a vital difference tween it and the clause. If there is a vital difference, that puts the amendment out of order, because any amendment must be relevant to the clause.",59
432,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Althoug h there is a vital difference, I did not say that the amendment differs totally from the clause. It deals with exactly the same matters. The honourable member for Hunter would prohibit voting by post by persons who may be able to go to the polling booths.",59
433,Mr BOYD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Did not the honourable member for Hunter say that the amendment was a new clause?,59
434,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I do not know; I only know that it was attempted to get different. rid of the amendmenb without discussion and without a vote. May's Parliaterial mentary Practice is one of the worse authorities for the guidance of an sembly like this, because it states, first, the general practice, and then gives exceptions, with the result that a Speaker or a Chairman, having ruled in accordance with the general practice as therein laid down, is coufronted with the exceptions, which are generally pressed, and one party fights against the other, each using the same authority. The very amendment which is now ruled out of order was moved by the honourable member for Hunter, and accepted, last year. Mr KING O'MALLEY - B y the same Chairman. Mr MCDONALD:-Wit h all due respect, I ask why has this been done? By way of protest, I have moved dissent from the ruling. Even if the honourable member for Hunter said that he intended to move the amendment in substitution for the clause without directly proposing to do so, there is no justification for ruling it out of order. There may have been justification for pointing out that the honourable member had not indicated where he desired to insert the amendment, but to rule his proposal out of order is not in accordance with our practice and procedure. However, my main contention is that our Standing Orders, apart from May, permit our making this amendment, and as an exactly similar amendment was moved by the same honourable member on an exactly similar Bill last year, I maintain that it is in perfect order now.",59
435,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I recognise that this amendment is brought forward in a perfectly bond fide* way, and that there be- is a serious point of difference between the two sides; and, therefore, we are desirous of granting the honourable member for Hunter every opportunity under the Standing Orders. It is a pity to test' these questions more than is absolutely necessary by a motion to disagree with' the ruling of the Chairman; but my difficulty arises from not knowing exactly the form in which the honourable member, wishes to have his proposal carried into effect. In the first place, I point out to the honourable member for Kennedy that this is not the same amendment that was moved last year. '",59
436,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,On e or two words are,59
437,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"There is very madifference. And in the second place, this amendment is not brought asforward in the same way as the amendment was last session. There was then a somewhat similar scheme, though differing in detail, and the amendment was, ""That the following words be added to the clause."" Standing order 128, to which the honourable member for Kennedy has referred, governs, I think, the proceedings. That standing order provides that a question may be amended, in the first place, by leaving out certain words only; in the second place, by leaving out certain words in order to insert or add other words; and, in the .third place, by inserting or adding other words. It does not appear to be the honourable member's intention to leave out certain words only; and if he proposes to take the second course we are entitled to ask him what words he proposes to leave out. The only thing he is prepared to do is to propose to leave out the whole clause with a view to insert other words. I am sure that the honourable member for Hunter will recognise that this clause repeals a number of provisions in a previous Act, the effect of which was to repeal provisions in a still prior Act, and thus, in effect, reinstate the postal-voting provisions, not only as applicable to the sick and the aged, but also to those absent from their homes. If the honourable member now wished to do what he did on the last occasion I should not take the objection, which does not appear to have been then taken, namely, that the addition of the words would not be relevant, but entirely inconsistent with the clause before the Committee. The honourable member now desires to leave out certain words in order to insert others, and we have a right to ask the honourable member to say what words he proposes to omit. I think he will find that he cannot consistently omit any without omitting the whole, which is really the test of the ruling of the Chair.. It would be. impossible to omit the first word, because that would leave the clause meaningless.",59
438,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,That could be altered later on. Mr W. H. IRVINE - It is clearly evident that May represents the common sense and only possible way of dealing with the matter. This amendment is an absolute reversal pf the whole scheme and the substitution of another. Can the honourable member comply with any one of the three alternatives in the standing .order ?,60
439,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Does the Attorney General contend that we cannot leave out words with a view to insert others?,60
440,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,What words could we leave out of this clause?,60
441,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Leave out all the words after "" section.""",60
442,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Then what should we have left? I ask honourable members to endeavour to carry on the business according to the rational meaning of the rules. It may be proposed to leave out certain words because they are objectionable while not desiring to negative the whole of the clause. Under the third alternative certain words may be added, and the intermediate alternative is that, while agreeing with certain parts of the clause, it is desired to leave out certain words in order to add other words. I ask the honourable member for Hunter to admit that he cannot, on the common principles of English and common sense, leave out any portion of the clause and get his scheme in. Some questions commence with the word "" That,"" and an amendment may be moved*to leave out all the words after "" That "" ; but even then there is left a skeleton on which to hang something,. Can the honourable member for Hunter suggest any word of this clause that can remain consistently with his amendment?",60
443,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I shall be very pleased to suggest to the Attorney-General a common-sense and rational method of dealing with this clause. According to standing order 122, it may be ordered that a complicated question shall be divided.",60
444,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"In the first place, that is, in the House, under the control of the Speaker.",60
445,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I point out that the rules which apply in the House apply also in Committee; and, according to May, when two or more separate propositions are embodied in a motion, the attention of the Speaker may be called to the circumstance. Apparently the Attorney-General is desirous of crippling discussion by introducing the Bill in this form. The postal-vote sections of the original Act run from 109 up to 121, and each section is a separate question. I am going to ask you, Mr Chairman, when the present matter is out of the way, to separate this complicated question, and permit us to deal with it as it ought to be dealt with. The Attorney-General talks about common sense, rational methods, and yet he submits a clause repealing a whole number of sections by which voting by post is to be re-enacted. The clause is submitted in such a way that the honourable member for Hunter is not permitted to submit an amendment; but if the question is divided he will be able to propose ati amendment that will be relevant.",60
446,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The honourable member for Kennedy is under a misapprehension in regard to the present position. The honourable member stated that this was the same amendment that had been accepted last session.,61
447,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Practically , with the exception of one or 'two details of no importance.",61
448,The CHAIRMAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"It is quite a different amendment. That which was moved by the honourable member for Hunter last session was different in substance, inasmuch as there are a great many provisions covered by the new amendment that were not covered by the older one, and the latter was moved as a proviso to be added to the clause. Now, the honourable"" member for Hunter distinctly states that his amendment is a substitution for the existing clause, and it is moved in that form, and not as a proviso. It will be seen, therefore, that the two amendments are entirely different.",61
449,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I have no wish to press the matter, but the trouble was,* Mr. Chairman, that you promptly ruled the amendment out of order, and that was what I resented. It is now admitted by the Attorney-General, and everybody else,-that the amendment can be moved - that it is not irrelevant.",61
450,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"We know the substance, but we dp,, not know ho,w the honourable member desires to move the amendment. >-'",61
451,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The impression left on my mind by the ruling was that the amendment could not be moved in any form, and, under the circumstances, I naturally, with all due respect, resented the ruling. Now I find that there are several ways in which the amendment can be moved. The honourable member for Hunter may not have indicated the precise method in which he would submit the amendment, but that is not sufficient justification for ruthlessly ruling it out order.",61
452,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Why not? Surely the Chairman must have regard to the forms of the House ?,61
453,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"It might have been pointed out that the honourable member for Hunter had not made himself clear on the point; but the amendment could not be ruled out of order. The sections involved cover four pages of the original Act, and it will be seen, therefore, that there is presented a question very broad and of vital importance. It is very difficult to say exactly where the amendment should come in. It is a reasonable request that we should be permitted to take a test vote on the matter. Though the Attorney-General argues that if this amendment were inserted after the word "" sections,"" the clause would not read well, he must know from his parliamentary experience that it is the common practice to have clauses so mutilated by amendments that it is necessary to postpone them, and have them re-drafted and brought forward again to meet the views of honourable members.",61
454,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"If the honourable member for Hunter can put the amendment in any form that is acceptable to the Chairman, I shall assist him, because I wish to have a decision upon the matter.",61
455,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"There would be nothing to prevent a consequential amendment to strike out the word "" sections."" That is a common practice. All we desire is to get an expression of opinion on the matter. There is a good deal in what the honourable member for Capricornia has said-that we should have the clause split e up into sections, so that we might know that with which we are dealing. However, I do not wish'to press my motion. Motion to dissent, by leave, withdrawn.  understand the Attorney-General'* to say that he will assist the honourable member for Hunter, so that there may be an expression of opinion on the proposal that the honourable member has brought forward ?",61
456,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Yes .  member for Hunter can move to strike out the word ""sections,"" and take that of amendment as a test on his proposed provision as against the clause in the Bill before us. That is a practice that has been frequently followed where similar complications have arisen. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am quite willing to accept that suggestion. it is the only way in which it can be done.",61
457,Mr DANKEL,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Boothby) [8.51] - I can see a way out of the difficulty by accepting an amendment striking out all the words after "" repealed"" in line 2, with a view of inserting a new clause. Mr \ V . H . IRVINE (Attorney-General-Flinders ) [8.52] - That course could not be followed; because if the words as far as "" r e p e a l e d "" stand, the whole of the postal-voting provisions will become law, and an amendment making further provisions will not be consistent with them. The honourable member for Grey has suggested the only way, according to the practice of the House, in which the matter can be tested. I am prepared to assist him in doing that.",62
458,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Capricornia) [8.53] - I would like the Chairman to treat the clause as a complicated question, and di vide it so that honourable members can deal with the various provisions embraced in it . Standing order 222 provides that every question in Committee shall be decided in the same manner as in the House itself, while standing order 227 provides that the same rules that regulate the conduct of business in the House shall be observed in Coinnvittee. bring a question before us in the present fashion may suit the Government, but it is not the regular method of conducting business. The Attorney-General has said to himself, "" We will not tolerate in terruptions in the way of criticism from the Opposition. We object to the Opposition having any say. We shall curtail their speeches, and embody a dozen clauses in four lines."" He wishes to ride rough-shod over the Opposition. On a former occasion I referred to the danger of submitting the civil servants to his tender mercies.",62
459,Mr CHAIRMAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Order !,62
460,Mr HIGGS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"We are getting a taste of his qualities now. He brings down a clause of four lines dealing with , perhaps, thirty odd questions on which there could be t h i r t y or forty divisions. .admit that he is now willing to allow the honourable member for Hunter to get his amendment tested, but I offer these few remarks in a kindly way as a caution to him not to bring forward a Bill in this way again, because, if he does, I shall ask the Chairman to deal with it as a I think complicated question.",62
461,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Hunter) [8.56] I am particularly anxious to have this amendment tested, so that the country may see the exact position, and I may safely follow the course adopted last session, namely, that of adding a proviso instead of eliminating words in the clause. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That will not give effect to what honourable members desire. There is nothing inconsistent in giving people away from home a vote, and your scheme of giving invalids the righ t to vote, but tliere w i ll be two schemes standing together.",62
462,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The amendment is of the same substance as that I submitted last session, and if it was relevant last session it should be relevant on this occasion.",62
463,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,I am not taking objection to it on that ground. I merely point out that it will not achieve what you wish.,62
464,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I m o v e That the following words be added :- "" Provided nothing in those sections shall be inconsistent with the following provisions :(1) (a) An elector who, owing to serious illness or infirmity, has reason to believe that he will not be able to record his vote at any To polling place during the hours of polling on the day of election, may, at any time after the issue of the writ, and up to within seven days preceding the day of election, make application to the Returning Officer of the Division in which he is enrolled that he be allowed to record his vote. (1>) The Returning Officer on a day previous to the election, and after the time for receiving applications has expired, shall instruct a Presiding Officer who shall, prior to or on the day of'election, call at the address of the person who claims a vote, and if satisfied that the applicant is entitled to vote under the provisions of this section shall supply the applicant with a ballot-paper which the voter will mark in the prescribed manner in the presence cf the officer, and if the voter so desires, of a relative or other person, but so that the officer cannot see the manner in which the ballot paper is marked, and shall then fold the ballot paper so as to hide the vote, and then in the presence of the officer deposit the ballot-paper in a sealed ballot-box which shall be provided and remain in the custody of the officer until it is given into the charge of the Divisional I Returning Officer. . The ballot-paper shall be opened by and counted by the Returning Officer nt the scrutiny sifter the closing of the Ballot. (c) Provided that in the case of any elector who resides more than five miles from a polling place, and who owing to serious illness cr infirmity has reason to believe that he will not be able to record his vote at any polling place during the hours of polling on the day of election may, at any time after the issue of the writ and up to within seven days preceding the day of election, make application to the Returning Officer of the Division in which he is enrolled that he be allowed to record his vote. The Returning Officer may, if the elector makes application to record his vote, appoint any of the following persons to wait upon the elector, viz. :-Postmaster s or postmistresses or persons in charge of post offices; head teachers in the employment of a State Education Department; ofBcers of the Department of Trade and Customs; members of the Police Force of the Commonwealth or of a State; and such persons so appointed sball and may exercise all the powers of the Presiding Officer as set forth in (&) of this clause. (2) Any elector who has reason to believe(a) That he will not on polling day, during the hours of polling, be within five miles of any polling place; or (b) That be will on polling day be in quarantine within the Commonwealth ; may after the issue of the writ, upon making a declaration in the prescribed form before a postmaster, vote under the provisions of section 139 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 19021911 or as an absent voter. Provided that(1) The declaration shall be made and the vote shall be recorded only at the post ofilce of which such postmaster is in charge; and (2) The declaration shall not be valid unless such postmaster stamps the declaration with post office letter stamp of the date upon which the declaration is made."" My object is to make provision for the sick and infirm recording votes. session the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General raised objection to my proposal on the scor,e of expense, and it was claimed that there was no provision for limiting the area over which Presiding Officers would need to collect votes. this occasion I have limited the area, and I have provided that where an applicant resides more than five miles from a polling booth certain other persons specified such as police constables, school teachers, postmasters, and others, may be permitted to take the votes of the sick and infirm, thus obviating the necessity for the Presiding Officer being sent beyond the radius of five miles to collect votes. was also taken last session to the use of the words, ""Assistant Returning It was pointed out that this would mean fresh appointments for the purpose, and would add to the expense, but I pointed out that I intended to use the"" words, "" Presiding Officer,"" and I have amended my proposal on this occasion by providing Mr Charlton. that Presiding Officers shall be instructed by Returning Officers to wait on the different persons who wish to vote. These Presiding Officers will not be specially appointed persons. . They are already appointed to the different booths in the various electorates. Previous to the last week before the election they will have time to collect these votes. Some honourable members will say that if this scheme were adopted there would be a large number of applications, and the system would be very expensive. I venture to say that when you remove the element of the canvasser and leave it to the genuine sick person to apply for a postal vote, the number of applications will be much less than in the past. The officer who will collect the votes will be the one appointed by the Returning Officer to preside at the nearest polling booth, and he will be a man of repute. He will know his responsibilities, and when he goes to collect a vote he will see that the person is entitled to vote and is really qualified. When he has obtained the vote he will put it in a sealed box, which will not be opened u n t i l the counting of the poll. Such a system is not going to cost so much as honourable members expect. Honourable members have referred to the probable difficulties of collecting the votes in remote parts of Australia, but in such cases I have provided that the vote may be collected by the nearest constable or other Last officials referred to. How many persons are there in remote parts of Australia, where the population is sparse, who will apply for a postal vote? H this system were put into operation as an experiment such applications would be few indeed. On Therefore, I anticipate no difficulty in collecting the votes in sparsely populated districts.",62
465,Mr SAMPSON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Is there any limi t to the distance which the Presiding Officer would go ?,63
466,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,I provide that he should go not more than five miles from his polling booth.,63
467,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"There are over 2,000 Exception electors in my constituency residing at a greater distance than five miles from a Officer."" polling booth.",63
468,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I have provided that when they are more than five miles from a polling booth the Returning Officer, on receipt of an application, can instruct a police oflicer, a .school teacher, a postmaster, or certain other officials in the employ of the Commonwealth Government, men whom we can trust, to collect the votes. So far as the thickly populated centres are concerned, I suppose that most of the electorates in the city are not more than five miles across. In such electorates there would be probably fifty or sixty polling booths, and thus the Returning Officer could collect all the postal votes in his district in a few hours.",63
469,Mr SAMPSON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Would he carry ballot-box with him?,64
470,Mr CHARLTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Yes , and the same thing would apply in regard to"" the collection of votes outside the fivemile area. Whatever we do, we must maintain the secrecy of the ballot. The expense may run to one or two thousand pounds, but what is that, if by such expenditure we can give facilities and prevent abuses of the Act? In order to get a clean roll we propose' now to spend over £100,000 every three years, and surely if. that expenditure is justified, we ought not to cavil at the expenditure of a few thousand pounds in order to give a vote to the sick and infirm. The system can be tried, and if it fails defects can be remedied or the system can be wiped out altogether. It is preferable to give a trial to this proposal rather than to revert to the provisons of the old Act, which were so open to abuse. I hope that the amendment, will be discussed, and that members on both sides, seeing that this should not be a party question, will try to come to some terms. I am suggesting the amendment as a proviso to the clause, in the hope that the Committee may see their way clear to agree to it, either in its entirety or in some amended form that will be acceptable to both parties.",64
471,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Flinders-At torney-General) [ 9 . 7 ] - I interjected during the honourable member's speech that the course he proposes is not likely to carry out his views, and I want to make that clear before the amendment goes to a vote. If this amendment is carried as an addition to the clause, clearly the result will be that, first of all, we shall have reinstated the whole of the postal provisions, of the Electoral Act applying to sick and infirm persons, women who are unable to attend polling booths, and persons who will be absent from their homes, and then we shall be tacking on this amendment, which appears to give additional facilities to a certain class of persons to whom those facilities have already been given.",64
472,Mr WEBSTER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Would that be inconsistent ?,64
473,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"No ; but we should be giving advantages by the clausein the Bill to all classes, and then, by the amendment, repeating them to certain, classes.  the the power.",64
474,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"But it applies to only one particular class of the community. In a measure of this sort, all sides ought to have an, opportunity of discussing the provision; and last session I intimated that in the Committee stagethere would be such an opportunity.",64
475,Mr FENTON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,I remember that opportunity.,64
476,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"So do we on this side. But even honourable membersopposite, have admitted that it was nob altogether the fault of members sitting behind the Government that the matter was not fully debated at that time. However, we need not go into ancient history. The Committee can, in a Bill in this form, make any modification in the votingsystem which we desire to introduce by adding words at the end of the clause to amend any of the provisions that have been reinstated, providing that so much of the provisions which have been reinstated be amended by leaving out certainwords.",64
477,Mr BRENNAN,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Is not that the effect of this amendment?,64
478,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"No . I do not wish to mislead honourable members in this matter. First of all, this repeal clause is merely repealing a previous repealing section, and the effect is to reinstate all the sections contained in Part X. of the Act, which set up a scheme of postal voting, and applied, not only to sick persons, but also to absent persons. If we add on the words of this amendment, we shall be adding that ""any elector owing to serious illness, who has reason to believe,"" and so on. What will be the effect of the amendment? Nothing. It will be repealing portion of the privileges in a very much limited form, to persons to whom the clause has already given the whole of the privileges. If the honourable member had desired to test the opinion of the Committee, he would have been very much better advised to have adopted the suggestion of the honourable member for Grey. In regard to the substance of the amendment, the Government cannot accept it. The Government do not admit for one moment that the charges which have been relied upon by members of the Opposition in regard to abuse and fraud in connection with this measure have been substantiated. Charges of that kind have been made broadcast in this Chamber and throughout Australia! and no evidence worth anything has been brought forward to substantiate then.. One or two instances have been raked up, after most diligent search, but they substantiate nothing. We believe that the machinery of voting by post, as it existed before the repealing Act of 1911, was as honest and useful a piece of electoral machinery as exists anywhere, and was not more open to abuse than is any other electoral machinery. Human nature is imperfect, but the charges of misconduct in regard to the exercise of the postal vote are so flimsy that the Government are not prepared to accept any material alteration of a system which worked well, and afforded opportunities for voting to hundreds and thousands of persons who otherwise would have been unable to vote. We shall insist, so far as we can insist upon anything, upon maintaining the provision as it stands. Whilst that is the attitude of the Government, honourable members must be permitted an opportunity, if they desire it, to test the feeling of the Committee. I have shown how that can be done, and I do nof wish to throw any difficulty in the way of doing it. The amendment that has been moved, with a sincere and earnest desire - to secure a test vote on a substantive motion, which the honourable member for Hunter thinks of great importance, will not effect the object in view.",64
479,Mr MAHON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Kalgoorlie) [0.17] I ask whether the Bill is a measure intended to assist persons who are unable to get to the polling booths to vote by post? If that is its object, the Government ought not to propose the re-enactment of sections which were framed in .1909, and. have proved ineffective. The Attorney-General intimated that he would accept some modification of the Government proposals.",65
480,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,No . I said that I would give every opportunity to test the feeling of the Committee in regard to any modifications that it might be desired by any honourable member to propose ,65
481,Mr MAHON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Does the honourable gentleman contend that the postal-voting system which was devised five years ago cannot, in view of our experience, be improved ?",65
482,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I do not say that anything is impossible of improvement, but I contend that the postal-voting system has worked well.",65
483,Mr MAHON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Then why does the honourable gentleman refuse to permit the amendment of the system?,65
484,Mr WH IRVINE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Le t us know the amendments proposed.,65
485,Mr MAHON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"If the honourable and learned gentleman wishes to give to the sick and infirm the necessary facilities for voting without going to the polling booth, he will not re-enact, without modification; the postal-voting provisions of the Act of 1909. He should agree to the omission of all the words after the word "" repealed"" in the second line of the clause) with a view to the insertion of an amendment which would make the necessary modifications. I shall not detain the Committee more than a few minutes, but I wish to show that the postal-voting sysr tem of the Act of 1909 was absolutely and radically defective, and did not give per'sons living'in the remoter parts of the Commonwealth adequate opportunities for voting by post. If there is any class whose interests should be protected, who should be able to make their opinions, felt in Parliament, and have effect given to them by the statuterbook, it is the pioneers who are opening up the country. In the old division of Coolgardie, which I reprer sented, the Divisional Returning Officer was stationed at Coolgardie, but the residents of Broome and other parts of the north-west coast of Western Australia had communication with the outer world only by means of a steamer running, perhaps, every fortnight. Now, section 109 of the Act of 1909 saysAn elector who has reason to believe that he will not (luring the hours of polling on polling day be within. 5 miles of any polling place for the division' for which he is enrolled Many of these persons are 50 miles from a polling place.",65
486,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Some of them are 100 miles away, and more. Mr Mahon"" - Yes . An y such elector may make application for a postal-vote certificate and postal ballot-paper. The application may be in the prescribed form, and must be signed by the elector in his own handwriting, in the presence of an authorized witness, and must be made and sent, after the issue of the writs, and before the polling day for the election, to the Returning Oflicer for the division for which the applicant elector is enrolled. In many cases the interval between the issue of the writs and the polling day is about three weeks. How could persons in such remote places as I speak of make, within that period, application in the prescribed for m for a postal-vote certificate and postal ballot-paper? It takes three weeks to get in the electoral returns from some parts of ""Western Australia.",65
487,Sir JOHN FORREST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"There is the absent vote. Mr Mahon"" - The party that is to be thanked for the absent-voting provisions of the law is not that to which the right honourable gentleman belongs. Will ho associate himself with the disfranchisement of many persons in Western Australia who regard him as the saviour of the country?",66
488,Sir JOHN FOREEST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Unti l we can get better, we shall keep what we have.",66
489,Mr MAHON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"T be right honourable gentleman knows that it would be impos-sible for many persons to take advantage of the provision that I have read, and that it is humbugging the people to pretend that postal-voting facilities are being given to them.",66
490,Sir JOHN FORREST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"We can postal-voting facilities to a good many, though they may not be available to all who are f ar away.",66
491,Mr MAHON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Does the right honourable gentleman say that any one living north of Carnarvon would be able to get a postal-vote certificate and postal ballot paper from the Returning Officer at Northam in time to make use of it under the provision that I have read""? nonsense for the Government to pretend that it is providing facilities for postal voting for the most deserving class in Australia.",66
492,Sir JOHN FORREST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The honourable fore the Committee. member has named only one place.,66
493,Mr MAHON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,What I have said plies to many parts of Australia. I am referring to districts with which the right [72 ] honourable gentleman and myself are familiar. Other honourable members can testify that the provision that I have read will not be applicable in districts with which they are familiar.,66
494,Sir JOHN FORREST,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The postal vote was very much used in my division.,66
495,Mr MAHON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The right honourable gentleman has had a polling booth provided at every cross road in his division.,66
496,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Unde r the Bill , he will have one at every house.",66
497,Mr MAHON,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"No doubt he has looked well after his electorate in this respect. I am willing to assist the Government, so far as I can, to give proper facilities for voting by post; but that cannot be done by re-enacting the postal-voting provisions of the Electoral Act of 1909. A f t e r the lapse of five years, we are in a position to devise something better than the clumsy machinery which the Government seeks to bring into operation again. If there is a genuine desire on the part of honourable members opposite to extend the facilities for voting by post, they will provide proper machinery, and will have the support of those on this side to a man.",66
498,Mr GREGORY,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Dampier) [9.26] - I thank the honourable member for K a l goorlie for the kindly interest he has taken in those who live in the back country of Western Australia, but I ask why it is that, when honourable members opposite had an opportunity to extend the franchise to those who are developing Australia, they scrupulously refrained, give from using it? It is the principle of the postal vote that we want.",66
499,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Fraud is all thab these provisions will lead to.,66
500,Mr GREGORY,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"The honourable member may be a judge of fraud. Last session the Government introduced a Bill for the amendment of the Electoral Act generally, but was any effort made by honourable members opposite to assist in It is improving our electoral law? On the contrary, they boasted that they would prevent us from passing the Bill , and the impossibility of doing so made necessary the introduction of the measure now beWe are determined to have the principle of postal voting. I aprealize as well as any honourable member the difficulties that [have to be faced by those who live in the back country. If it was not for the producers out in the back-blocks there would be no big cities. Some honourable members opposite represent constituencies whose electors can get to a polling booth by walking a few hundred yards, but in the Dampier division there are persons who motored 200 miles, there and back, to record their votes, and many who travelled 70 or 80 miles to get to the poll. Why should such persons be disfranchised ? We have compulsory enrolment, and yet no provision is made for the voting of large numbers of electors. Thousands were disfranchised by the measure passed through Parliament by the Labour Government, although honourable members opposite claim credit for the so-called absent-voting system.",66
501,Mr SHARPE,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,The voting at the last election was the heaviest that we have had.,67
502,Mr GREGORY,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Knowin g the method of enrolment, I can understand that. It is essential that in the near future there shall be a thorough amendment of the electoral law. I believe that at present the door is left open to all sorts of doing. The Act requires amendment almost from beginning to end. I admit that the old sections will not give us all the facilities we require, and which we should have under a .proper postal-vote Bystem; but I am prepared to accept the principle, and that is what we are fighting for now. I have not spoken before on the subject, but I feel very strongly regarding it, for I know that a large number of people, including the sick and infirm, not to mention the maternity cases - of which there are 130,000 every yearsuffer very much in this regard. The position is certainly most acutely felt by those who live in the back country; but under the Bill any person may write to the Returning Oflicer for a postal vote, and the only delay will be between the application and the reply. No doubt there will still be some who, owing to distance and difficulties of transit, will still be disfranchised; but the Bill represents a great advance, and I am content to accept it for the present. I feel sure that my constituents will regard it as a move in the right direction; and I support the measure in the hope that, in the near future, we shall have a Parliament prepared to pass electoral laws which will enable every person to exercise the franchise.",67
503,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Kennedy) [9.35] I wish to bear out what has been stated by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. It is perfectly true, at any rate in my electorate, that, under the present system, there are large numbers of people in the country who will not be able to obtain a postal vote.",67
504,Mr BENNETT,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Why did the honourable member not think of that when the Labour Government were in power?,67
505,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"That Government made the necessary provision in the absent vote, and it minimized the inconvenience to the lowest possible extent. When I say that the postal vote permits of fraud, I know that fraud has been committed in ' connection with it . To begin with, the system practically wipes out the secrecy of the ballot, and that is the one thing that members of Parliament, and the community generally, should cherish. Throughout the civilized world, our system of voting is envied, and the very moment we institute a postal vote, we shall begin to undermine the principle for which wrongrivers of blood have been spilt. The honourable member for Dampier regards this Bill as an assertion of the principle of postal voting; but it is just that principle that the Blouse and the country should not tolerate. Already such men as Chief Electoral Omcers have talked of schemes to permit of all-the people voting by post; but, in my opinion, that would be simply going back to the conditions of open voting of fifty or 100 years ago.' If we are not prepared to progress, we must retrograde; and I can speak from experience regarding the - postal vote. I was a member of a Select Committee which inquired into the Melbourne election, when, owing to the corruption in connection with the postal vote, Sir Malcolm MCEacharn was unseated, and the present member came into this House. I am prepared to sacrifice anything to maintain the secrecy of the ballot; and not for mere party purposes, but as a matter of principle. Does the honourable member for Dampier mean that this Bill represents the first step to universal voting by post?",67

507,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I am glad to hear the honourable member's denial, for he was not clear on the point when he spoke. Why is this and another Bill introduced ? Do honourable members not know that the day after their introduction, facsimiles appeared in the Argus, and they were described as the two "" t e s t "" Bills? There was no idea of this measure being introduced in order to give the postal vote; it was merely a measure to be used as a step to a double dissolution. The Attorney-General has said to-night that the Government are prepared to accept modifications in the Bill ; but, as a matter of fact, we know that they are not prepared to accept any whatever. date of the Bill is stated to be that of last year, simply because of a fear on the part of the Attorney-General that the alteration of one word or figure might in terfere with its value as a "" t e s t "" Bill to be presented to the Governor General. We know, at any rate, that the Treasurer was never in favour of extending the franchise.",67

509,Mr MCDONALD,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"That was only when the honourable member was forced to do so by the realization that the Goldfields desired separation in order to join Federation, and that it was necessary to strengthen the vote on the coast. For a good many years past I have taken an active interest in the franchise, and the bitterest fights I have ever known have been in connection with proposals for its extension. Even today, in Queensland, the State Government are introducing a reactionary measure, which means disfranchisement to thousands and thousands of people. It has been pointed out that if the figures of the Queensland Government are correct, and represent the number of people that should be on the rolls, that State is receiving £130,000 more than it is entitled to under the distribution of 25s. per capita. Further, if that is a true reflex of the adult electors of Queensland, that State is not entitled to ten members in the Federal Parliament. However, we know that the suggestion is wrong, and that these statements are made because of the large number of people who are disfranchised in Queensland.",68

But I have no desire to discuss thab matter. If I had my way, the whole Bill could go right through. I have gone over the subject so many times, and repeated myself so often, that I am tired of discussing it .

This leads me to protest as strongly as I possibly can against any re-enactment of the postal vote.

520,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"Judgin g by the honourable member's acquaintance with such things, I suppose he knows some who voted for him in that way.",68
521,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"They voted for you, most of them, and you know it .",68
522,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"If they voted for me, they showed very good judgment. The anxiety of honourable members on the Ministerial benches to secure people opportunity to vote amuses me. These honourable members have been associated with a party that has always denied the working people the opportunity to vote. They belong to the great Liberal party who, in Victoria, disfranchised the i mates of charitable institutions, and ill becomes them to pose as advocates extending the franchise. However, I wish to ask the Treasurer why the Government have included in this Bill the provision by which the elector voting by post the ballot-paper to the person who witThe honourable nesses the vote. The fact that the toral Bill introduced last session that provision shows that ""the Govern the ment recognise that this practice leads corruption and unfair play. I u fact, Honorary Minister, in introducing the Bill last session, said that the ment had omitted this provision because it led to a great deal of corruption. omission would give to the individual voting by post the right to post his own ballot-paper or hand it to his friends to post, and it is an error on this occasion on the part of the Government to re-introMinistry duce the old provision. I therefore ask the Treasurer whether he is prepared > accept an amendment which will give to the voter who votes by post the right post his own ballot-paper. It has been ture? said that we are opposing the postal vote because the majority of the postal votes are cast for anti-Labour candidates. have had to contest elections where the postal vote has been in operation, and have never been defeated by it . I know just as much aboub the postal vote remain on the statute-book. as honourable members opposite. It needs a little organizing to beat the fellow.",68
523,Mr RODGERS,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,You are not absent voting.,69
524,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"I guarantee that the roll now being compiled in the Ballarat district will show as many voters as that issued prior to the last election, and will be a complete answer to those who said that it had been unfairly enlarged. But if the honourable member for Wannon knows of anything that was wrong in connection with the compilation of the last Ballarat roll, let him go before the Royal Commission that is now sitting and prove his wild and unfair statements. There was the fullest investigation after the last election, and a detective who made in the quiries reported that in every case the enrolment was genuine. The Royal Commission is going to Ballarat next week, and we will take care to see that all tliose who made statements concerning the last election shall have an opportunity of n - proving them. Now that the Prime M in it ister has entered the chamber, I ask wheof ther he will accept an amendment that I shall move to strike out the sections in the Act of 1909 which compel the elector who votes by post to hand his ballot-paper hands to the person who witnesses the vote. member for Yarra Elechas said that 15 per cent, of the omitted ballot-papers that were sent out in Ballarat district were not returned. to That is easily understood when that the section is left in the Act. Many people who witness tliese votes are partisans, Governand when they know the vote is given against their candidate the vote never Its reaches its destination. The Ministry admitted that by their Bil l of 1913. Surely the Prime Minister has not changed his views so quickly. Are the prepared to accept an amendment allowing a voter to hand his vote to his to friend, instead of compelling him to give it to the justice of the peace or policeto man who may be witnessing the signa",69
525,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,I think that was I in the Bill last session.,69
526,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,It was in the Bill I of 1913. But if we carry this measure the provision I am referring to will still It is reonly markable that the Government should other have abandoned the principle contained in the previous Bill .,69
527,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,You know that we bad on had to abandon that Bill because we could not get it through.,69
528,Mr FISHER,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,Nothin g of the sort.,69
529,Mr MCGRATH,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,"D u r in g the. session of 1912 the Prime Minister spoke for altogether 44 hours. The thirty-seven members of the Labour party in this House last session spoke for only 200 hours. Had each of us spoken as long as the Prime Minister we would have spoken altogether 1,665 hours.",69
530,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSTAL VOTING RESTORATION,After that I will give you the adjournment. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.3 p.m.,69
