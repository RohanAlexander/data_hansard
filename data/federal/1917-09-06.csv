2,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Henty) [2.34] - I suggest that the report of the Royal Commission on the Federal Capital administration, should not be printed. MT. TUDOB - It has been printed. It is a bulky document, about 3 inches thick.",20
3,Mr BOYD,Unknown,It is in the printing of such documents that extravagance takes place. These huge reports should not be printed. Question resolved in the affirmative. WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT. STATUTORY RULE NO. 196.,20
4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The honourable member for East Sydney asked me a question, regarding certain cases in - which he is interested.",20
5,Mr WEST,Unknown,I am not interested in them; I am merely acting in connection with bhem.,20
6,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"' I wish to inform the honourable member that further information as to the facts has been asked for, and should be forthcoming in .a few days. There is no ground for the disallowance of the regulation; the only question is whether consent should the given to proceedings. If I have to decide against the honourable member, I shall notify him,, so that he may take what action he pleases. NA COMMITTEES.",20
7,Mr HIGGS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I ask you, Mr - Speaker, a question which has reference to the rights, privileges, and immunities of honourable members. I wish to know whether it is within the power of the Chairman of Committees, without reference to the Oommittee or to the House, to order the Serjeant-at-Arms to remove an honourable member from the chamber. MT. SPEAKER - I do not feel called upon .to give an expression, of opinion on* any action of the Chairman of Obmmittees in the conduct of the proceedings of a Oommittee. That officer is responsible for the maintenance of order in Committee of the whole House, and, unless when some matter is specifically reported to mefrom the Committee. I have no official cognisance of what takes .place there. In the present' instance, I understand the Committee, by vote, confirmed the action of the Chairman.",20
8,Mr ANSTEY,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"As a personal explanation, I wish to say that I did not know that the honourable member for Caprioornia intended to ask a question on this subject. I wish it to be understood Uiat I have no complaint at all to make. I quite enjoyed what occurred.",20
9,Mr SPEAKER,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"That is not a personal explanation. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). INDUSTRIAL CRISIS : GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION. Mr SPEAKER reported that he had received from the honourable member for ' Yarra an intimation of his intention to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, ""The desirability of the Government taking action to .bring about a just settlement of the present industrial disturbance."" Five honourable members having risen in their places. Question proposed.",20
10,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Yarra) [2.38] - I make no apology for moving the adjournment of the. House to discuss this matter. It cannot be said that Government time will be taken up by the discussion of the' motion, because .this being Grievance Bay, the sitting would in any case have been devoted to the discussion of grievances, and this among them. . Every honourable member will admit that the present industrial crisis is the greatest with which Australia has been faced. What I ask is that the Government should intervene to obtain a just settlement of the strike. It is not my intention to do more than the Prime Minister, in many statements to the press, has said that he would do; that is, to touch very briefly upon the original cause of the dispute. The Prime Minister in his frequent utterances has been pleased.to say-that the men who are-at present connected with the Labour movement in Australia are men who have had no experience in industrial troubles.",20
11,Mr HUOBBS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,I have not said that.. My remark applied to those who are responsible for the strike; that is quite a different matter.,21
12,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"There has never been a more spontaneous uprising by the people than that which has recently occurred. The trouble experienced by the Defence Committees, at any rate in this State, has' not been to get the men to go on strike, but . to keep them at their work. .That has been the experience throughout Australia.",21
13,Mr GREGORY,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,You will find it difficult to make us believe that.,21
14,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"It is absolutely true. I care not whether or not the honourable member believes me, but there are thousands of people in the country who will take my word in preference to his.",21
15,Mr GREGORY,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,Why are not the allowed a secret ballot 1,21
16,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,The trouble is that the unions do not think r,21
17,Mr COBSEB,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,That the result will be. satisfactory.,21
18,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I am anxious that this matter should be dealt with fairly. I do not desire that we should do anything to fan the flame, as is being done by the newspapers at the present time. On Tuesday the Argus, in the course of an alleged account of the proceedings at a union meeting, stated that it was the intention of municipal employees to throw Melbourne into darkness. The Prime Minister, in a statement published ih today's press, states- "" In Sydney the gasworkers have endeavoured to throw the city-into darkness. Melbourne is threatened with the same .calamity."" The secretary of the Municipal Employees Union wrote to the Argus denying its statement, and one would have thought that that journal would have had the common honesty.to publish the letter amongst the strike news, but the Argus, which pretends to be fair, inserted the letter at the bottom of a column amongst the telegrams. That letter was as follows:. Sir,- I wish to contradict a report appearing in your issue of yesterday, stating that at a meeting of the Municipal Employees Union on Monday night, it was suggested that the Victorian strike committee should at once cut off the supplies of gas and electricity. Nothing of the Kind took place. The meeting discussed a totally different matter altogether. Neither gas nor electric power was mentioned. Neither was any discussion raised as ts whether the men would cease work or not Trusting you will insert tbese few lines so as let the public know the facts of the case Yours, &c, D. H. GRAY, Secretary. To that the editor attached this footnote - "" Tho statement, to which Mr Gray takes exception was communicated to us by an officer of the union."" It is known that the State Government boast that they have spies attending union meetings, and are. able to know what takes place at those meetings. No union would allow spies at its meetings; but, unfortunately, ths unions do nob.know these men who are betraying them. It has been stated by honourable members in this .House and elsewhere that the present trouble is political, and not industrial. That statement is absolutely wrong. men The men in New South Wales have gone on striko as .a protest against the proposed card sytsem. I worked in America ut piece-work, and I know a little of the speeding-up methods employed in that country.",21
19,Mr RODGERS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,You survived them.,21
20,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,I stayed there ten months.,21
21,Mr WEBSTER,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,There was no card sys'tera then.,21
22,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"No , but I know the methods which - were employed in America at that time, and through reading and correspondence I am conversant with some of the conditions obtaining there now. A system exists in America which I hope will neverbe introduced in any part of the British Empire. The men have been periodically speeded up, u n t i l in some large establishments an inquiry as to the whereabouts of the middle-aged employees elicits the answer, "" They are in the cemetery.""",21
23,Mr RODGERS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,That statement is food for 'rhildren.,22
24,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,That Foster Fraser's statement.,22
25,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,It is correct. I know that some men who gained their experience in America by gazing at it through a railway carriage window have pretended to know all about the working conditions of that country. The very worse features of the system in operation in America are to be introduced in New South Wales.,22
26,Mr ARCHIBALD,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,It is not the Taylor system that is to be introduced into New South Wales.,22
27,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"That statement is all very well; bub what does the honourable member know about it? Of all the at workers, the last to become dissatisfied with their working conditions are Governhave ment employees, especially if it involves going out on strike. Men in the Governagainst ment Service will submit to almost anynot thing rather, than go out on strike.",22
28,Mr LECKIE,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,What about Wonthaggi?,22
29,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I am not referring men of that class. An y coal miner can go to Wonthaggi and get employment, but I am referring to regular employees, must pass a preliminary medical examinaup tion, and who once they are in the Service are there for life - It must not be thought that this card system was considered the men only a few days before they deselected cided to strike; it was submitted to them attack. nine months ago, and they informed Mr . Fraser then that they did not. think it fight? proper that new conditions of employment should be introduced during the one word is said by the opponents of the men as to that particular phase of the question, but every argument is show that the men precipitated the trouble. The fact is, that the Commisemployer sioner was responsible for the trouble, and compelled the men to take action, or conthe fight here ? sent to a method of employment which they consider will undermine their mantralia ? hood. Practically only one side of this dispute has been placed before the people. The whole press of Australia is supportsome ing honourable members opposite, and w i do anything to insure that the placed in the worse possible light. They get organizations such as municipal conferences to carry resolutions condemning the men, and speakers on recruiting platforms to denounce the strike. We do not hear a word concerning the gentleman who saw fit to introduce this is card system during the war. Nothing that has happened since the outbreak of the war has caused such a falling off in recruiting as this industrial trouble has done. The recruiting platform has been deliberately used to put - the men on strike in the worse possible position-to make it appear that they are wrong and thatr the employers are right.",22
30,Mr GBEGORT,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,They could not be in a much worse position than they are by reason of the fact that they saw fit to strike at this period in our history.,22
31,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"The honourable member would have us believe, I suppose, that the workers must submit to any injustice this particular juncture, and that the railway men of New South Wales should allowed the card system , to be in troduced without making any protest it . In my opinion, they would be worthy of the name of Australians if they did not stand up against it . Why does the honourable member refrain from ""* to any reference to the action of the New South Wales Railways Commissioner in introducing the card system? Is there nothing to be said concerning him or the who State Government who have backed him ? Some employers assert that for years they have seen this trouble coming on. They say that there must be a fight beby tween Capital and Labour and they have this particular ground for tlieir",22
32,Mr HEITMANN,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,Who started this x,22
33,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,The New South Wales war. Not Railways Commissioner.,22
34,Mr HEITMANN,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,Listenin g to the honourable member one would think that the used to employers had started it .,22
35,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,The Commissioner is an of labour and he started it .,22
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"But who started""",22
37,Mr HEITMANN,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,And in Western Aus,22
38,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Heitmann) who haa knowledge of trade unionism, knows l l that once a strike occurs no one can tell men are lo where it will spread.",22
39,Mr HEITMANN,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,I know that the men who started this trouble will drop the trade unions of Australia like a hot potato. They are a rabble.,23
40,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Such statements as that just made by the honourable member were often made in years gone by. Bogus unions have been formed before. At the time of the London dock labourers' strike in 1889', I was working in London, and well remember the action then taken by Tom Mann, Ben Tillett, and John Burns to secure new and improved conditions for the workers. Their efforts were spoken of by such organizations as the Cotton Spinners' Association and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers as "" the new unionism."" The members of those associations declared that they were fighting for the old system of trade unionism. We may be sure that some people will always - consider that those who have anything to do with any struggle to improve the conditions of the workers should be denounced. The New South Wales Railways Commissioner sought to compel the men to adopt a system that had never before operated in their particular branch. Several honourable members interjectHrtq,",23
41,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,On e at a time. Five or six Ministerial supporters in their anxiety to defend their own position are all interjecting at one time.,23
42,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,Can the honourable member explain the card system as introduced ?,23
43,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,I have not time to do so at this stage.,23
44,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,The member can secure an extension of time.,23
45,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"The honourable member may tliink that the system is impossible of satisfactory explanation from our point of view, but there are on this side of the House today several honourable members who have been in New South Wales since the trouble arose, and who know exactly what is proposed.",23
46,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,I cannot obtain an explanation.,23
47,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"It is not my fault that the honourable member cannot get an explanation; but it cannot be denied that the action taken by the men can be satisfactorily explained. I know something of both piecework and day-labour work as carried on in factories, where there is a continual speeding up of workers. Some employers would make their employees practically mere cogs i u the machine. They grind as much as possible out of their men, because they know that, as a rule, a 6d. advertisement will bring others to take the place of those who in the struggle are knocked back. The object of the card system is to compel men to work at top speed.  takes place, and that the men go too slow, what would the honourable member do ?",23
48,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I know what the employers would do in such a case; they would pass out the men every time. As a matter of fact, that is done. There are in this Australia of ours many men who dye their hair because it has grown grey, knowing that it would be difficult to secure employment if they were thought to be old. I could bring here men who have had to do that in order to hold their own in the struggle, for employment. I contend that the employees had a right to object where this speeding up 1 was being insisted on. All that we ask. the Government to do is to intervene with the object of bringing about an equitable settlement of this industrial trouble, which is affecting all Australia-.",23
49,Mr RODGERS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Will the honourable member suggest what the Government should do? He must not forget that, as the political leader of the Labour forces in Australia, he has a responsibility.",23
50,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I shall not shirk my responsibilities. In answer to the honorhonorable able member, let me say that I would have the Prime Minister do precisely what he did last year in. connection with a lesser industrial dispute - In reply to a question put to him a few days ago, the Prime Minister said that he would not interfere with this dispute unless requested by both parties to do so. That, I think, was the effect of his statement. What did he do, however, in connection with the coalminers'strike last year?  again on strike.",23
51,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,I wish the honourable member would give us something new.,23
52,Mr HEITMANN,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,I was thinking that of the Leader of the Opposition.,23
53,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Apparently , some honourable members opposite do not like what I am saying, and they are interjecting with the object of breaking the continuity of my remarks. When the coal-miners' strike took place last year, I do not think the Prime Minister was asked by either side to intervene, but he did. Mr CosrsronoE - Neithe r was Senator Pearce, as Acting Prime Minister, asked to intervene in the Broken H i l but he did.",23
54,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I was a member of Labour Government then in office. SenaI tor Pearce was Acting Prime Minister, and he induced the President of the ciliation and Arbitration Court to interthe vene, and to compel representatives of both the employers and employees to come before him with the object of bringing about a settlement. That was in controublewhich nexion with the Broken H i U trouble of 1914 or 1915. I do not think that either the employers or the employees asked the labourers, Prime Minister last year to intervene in ists ""-cal l connection with the coal-miners' ^ strike, but he compelled representatives of both sides to come to Melbourne to discuss matter.",24
55,Mr FOWLEE,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"The coal miners got they wanted, and yet they are out on strike again.",24
56,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Because they conceive it to be their duty to support those are protesting against the introduction of affected, the card system.",24
57,Mr BOYD,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,That is not the reason f their coming out. They are out because their general secretary was arrested fo breaking the law.,24
58,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"That is correct so as the coal miners in Victoria are cerned, but as to whether it is correct regard to the coal miners in New South Wales I am unable for the moment to say. But I do not know of a single blunder calculated to intensify this struggle, to make it spread, that has not been committed by the New South Wales M i istry. I know tha responsibility of State Ministry to keep the wheels of dustry'going, but I submit that some the actions they have been guilty of have not had the effect of throwing of l troubled waters, but of throwing oil a fire, and so widening the disastrous effects. The result has been the creation of f u r t h er disputes, and the objelct a policy is to practically cover up the that blame that ought to attach to the Minof istry. ' If there is one blunder that stands out it is the arrest of Willis, Cavanagh, and Thompson. That case, I know, is before the Court, where it will have to be judged; but I protest against the postponement of the trial until the trouble is over, when we know that in all probability the result will be a dismissal of the charges. All this is done for the purpose l trouble, of creating further disputes. We are told that this is a revoluthe tion and a mutiny; but, personally, do not believe that it is any such thing. It is all very well to say Conthat the Strike Committees can prevent spread of the strikes. In Victoria, I know what is being done; and the Defence or Strike Committee have done their utmost to prevent any extension of the has, however, continued to spread in spite of any action of theirs. Once goods are handled by these ' ' f r e e ' * ""blacklegs,"" or ""loyalthem what you likeunionists will refuse to handle such goods. Though, as I say, I know the Strike Comthe mittee or the Defence Committee have done their best to prevent the spread of all the disputes, they have been unable to do so; but it must be added that but for their action the trouble would have been more widespread than it is. There are who nrobably from 80,000 to 100,000 workers and these "" l o y a l is t s "" or "" f r e e workers,"" as they are called-thoug h they o r are sometimes given other names, such ast "" blacklegs "" number something less than r '10,000, although they are promised permanent employment, and some of them are to be given Government employment, and far in spite also of the efforts of the two conGovernments, with the whole of the in . national resources to aid them. We are told that these free workers are capable, and are giving a better return for their . pay than did the ordinary workmen. 1 and No one, however, can believe' that these young men from school and others are nmore satisfactory than are the ordinary the workers. An y one who has employed insuich men knows that, as a rule, they cost of double or treble what is usually paid, simply because they are not used to the on work. Some of the so-called unskilled on labourers are 'so used to the work demanded of them that they are able to give a better Teturn than any others possibly of such could. These free labourers are promised there shall be no "" v i c t i m i z at i o n "" them after the strike is over. . They have been promised that their employment shall continue, and that they shall have Government situations without examination; and yet, with all these inducements, they number only about a tenth of the men-at present on strike.",24
59,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,Y o u should incite the strikers 1,25
60,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I am not doing so. say truly that if I could do anything to bring these disputes to a satisfactory conclusion I should do it . The Labour party, ever since the trouble arose, has refrained fro m raising the question in this chamber, for the simple reason that they are anxious that the matter should be settled amicably. Surely the Government will not say that they do not desire a just settlement? A r e we asking anything unfair when we ask for a just settlement? There are many employers who believe that they now have a chance of which they intend to take advantage, to crush and smash unionism, and who believe that, after this struggle, unionism will never be able to lift its head in Australia - again. This was what the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Willia m Irvine) thought he had succeeded in effecting in 1903, with the aid of the Kyabram movement. But what is the result? - The Kyabram movement is dead; and with the exception, perhaps, of the honourable member himself, not a man connected with it is in political life today. minded that the honourable member for Echuca was connected with that move-ment, and he is a worthy specimen of those who were with him.",25
61,Mr SAMPSON,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Is he dead? Mr TUDOR,-No , he is not; he is .walking about to save funeral expenses.  ought not to be offensive.",25
62,Mr TUDOR,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"We were told thati unionism in the"" Victorian Railways - was crushed , in 1903. What is the position of the railway unions today in Victoria ? They have probably trebled the number of their financial members since 1903; that does not appear as if unionism was checked. day's Argus we are told that those "" loyalists "" on the wharfs have united in an organization of their own. There have been several similar attempts in the past; and the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Spence) will remember how, when he was president of the Australian Workers Union, a Machine Shearers Union- a "" blackleg "" union-wa s brought into existence by the Pastoralists Association. Further, a few years ago in Victoria an attempt was made to organize the free not labourers under a man named Packer. Where are those free unionists today ? I Every one gone; and what happened then will happen to the organization of which the Argus tells us today,- Honourable members opposite may think that they have the whip-hand of the workers-that they have won a political battle, and in tend to carry it into the industrial field, so that they may grind down the workers as never before. I am not going to say that the workers are defeated yet-fa r from it-bu t even if they are unsuccessful in this particular struggle, they will become stronger than ever, and the results will be precisely the same as those which followed similar attempts in 1903 on the occasion of the railway strike. A fte r that trouble the railway workers in Victoria organized as never before, and obtained greater benefits. I hope that the Government will intervene, and that wiser counsels will prevail. I trust that the Prime Minister and his colleagues will request the New South Wales Government to refer this matter to a tribunal that will be able to judge it on its merits or demerits, so that I am re- we here in Australia may r i d ourselves of this terrible industrial crisis.",25
63,Mr HUGHES,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [3.13] - I regret that the time at my disposal will not permit me to traverse the whole ground of this most important matter. The Leader of the Opposition, in the course of his speech, has raised a great many questions, which, even to lightly touch on, would occupy me far beyond the l i m it of the time at my disposal. I have been waiting to hear from the honourable gentleman some definite and concrete statement by way of justification of the present state of things. But I have waited in vain. In to- It cannot be said, even by my enemies, of whom I have many, that I do not understand the Labour movement in Australia at least as well as any other' man. Others may have been in more strikes than I , but there is nohe who, for the last twenty years at any rate, has been engaged in a greater number of what may be termed national, or quasi-national, industrial upheavals. I , therefore, know as intimately as it"" is possible for any man to know, what unionism stands for. I say without hesitation that there is no evidence forthcoming that there is, as the honourable member has asserted, a conspiracy for the purpose of crushing unionism. On the other hand, there is abundant evidence that there is a conspiracy among certain persons in our midst to render government by the people of Australia, as delimited by constitutional means, impossible. To this conspiracy the overwhelming bulk of the unionists now affected are unwittingly lending themselves-no t deliberately, because they are mere pawns in the game. There is no conspiracy to crush unionism, but there is a conspiracy to injure Great Britain, to disintegrate the Empire, and to hamper the Commonwealth in its war policy, to make constitutional government impossible. And the conspirators are those violent extremists, whom I shall group under one heading, and call Syndicalists and Sinn Feiners. A man who shuts his eyes to such obvious facts as obtrude themselves upon, the notice of all citizens must be a fool. The reason put forward for this strike is, on the face of it, a mere pretext. It alleged that this card system is one which, if introduced in Australia* will reduce the workers here to the level of slaves. One honourable member in this House, by way of a question to me the other day, sought to persuade the House that this was so, and the honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Tudor) has spoken about the conditions of labour in America. He has referred to the consequences of speeding up, which, he says, occur there, deducing that all these things arose from the card system or something similar to it, and that if this system were introduced in Australia, conditions analogous to those he has alleged would obtain in Australia. I do not believe it for a moment. Such talk is transparent nonsense. When the unionists of this country waited on me in a deputation the other day, I told them that I regarded such an assertion as a palpable attempt to bluff the community. I know the unionists of Australia too well to believe that they would tolerate such a thing for a moment. These harrowing stories of men having to dye their hair in order to conceal their age will surely impose upon no one. Every one but a fool knows that the dyeing of one's hair does not conceal one's age. It is the sort of thing that amuses fools, and serves for the purpose of clap-trap on the Yarra-bank and other places. No, sir, this is not the cause of this trouble. We must look in quite a different direction to find it. The trouble in this country is that there haa been for some time an insidious propaganda in our midst urging the workers not to speed up, but to slow down. In regard to the alleged cause of this strike, I do not say that one side to the dispute is more entitled to credence than the other. I accept statements from both sides for what they are worth; but on the facts as presented by both sides it would certainly appear that, so far from the Government of New South Wales being to blame in the matter, they did all that was possible to. avert it. At a deputation of representatives of the Trades Hall which waited on me in his presence the other day, Mr Hall, a member of the New South Wales Government, dealing with the genesis of the strike, saidThe representative of the amalgamated engineers notified the Commissioners for Railways in New South Wales that unless the is Commissioners announced, within twenty-four hours, their intention not to introduce the card system, the unions would strike. The Government of New South Wales urged the men to withdraw this ultimatum, for a week at least, in order that the parties might discuss the question while the service was still being carried on. This the men refused to do. No man who believes in democracy can justify the action of Government employees in attempting to dictate to those who under the laws of a democratic country are entrusted with the management of State utilities as to how those utilities should be conducted. All that these men were asked to do was to continue in their work and discuss the matter amicably with the Government. Even such a thing as that is not entirely consonant with the principles of democratic government, but at any rate these men were asked tc remain at work and to discuss the matter while they were working. Yet they declined point blank to do this sensible and obviously proper thing, and stood upon their ultimatum and left their work. Whatever virtue there is in Socialism is to be found in the substitution of the whole community for the individual. There can be no question of profiteering i u State enterprise; no suspicion that some bowelless exploiter is going to make a profit out of speeding up workmen. The railway systems of Australia are State enterprises' over which the people, have ample power. Parliament can interfere in the most'complete and drastic w a y , it can alter the whole system; and the people can alter the whole Parliament - Therefor e the railway system of New South ""Wales, or of any other State, is fashioned in accordance with the determination of the people of the State.

H . Catts) and I were associated in one induscapital t r i a l upheaval,. or rather in the vention of one, in 1913-14. great New Zealand strike threatened into to involve Australia; we gathered gether a body of men, which I think am right in estimating at about 150,000, including the various waterside organizaunanimity tions, the coalminers, and the Australian grave anxiety.""

So far from my having committed a crime against unionism in that matter, the honourable member for Cook was one of those who was good enough to subscribe, in a very eulogistic address, to my many and great virtues and services in that connection. But every honourable member knows that That is owing to the dissemination of Syndicalistic and Industrial - Workers of the World doctrines{ the trouble with the of unions is, as the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) knows, not to get men to go out-an y fool can do that-bu t to get them to stay in . They ignore their They contemptuously repudiate agreements solemnly entered into . They will come out on any pretext or on Socialistic none rather than stop in . The real cause of this upheaval is polit is tical, rather than industrial^ It is an attempt on the part of those responsible for the debdcle of the 5th May when the I ask you to great Labour movement of Australia was split on the rocks, to get even - with their opponents, to prevent those to whom the entrusted the reins of Governmemment from carrying out their duty. to the conscription referendum a was hatched to declare a general strike should conscription be carried; of that I have absolute proof. The honourable member for Yarra says that the present strike is not a revolt; that the action of the men is an indignant protest, wrung from them by the attempt to introThere duce the Taylor system. Mr Buckley, halfmember of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, speaking on the f i th August, said that "" there was more in the I see around Mr. declared that the introduction of ' The honourable that system was quite a minor matter.

He said I have not said on any occasion that this was a test between the Nationalist party and the Labour party. I refer Mr Fuller to my statement that, so far as the Government is concerned, it was not so much opposed to granting the conference's request that the men should refuse to work on conditions, but that the Government, backed up by the Chamber of Commerce and the Employers Federation, was attempting to crush trade unionism.",27
70,Mr SPEAKER,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,The time allowed to the honourable member under the standing order has expired.,28
71,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Cook) [3.34] The Prime Minister states that the men who commenced this dispute are disloyalists, who seek to bring about the downfall of Great Britain and her Allies, and are engaged in initiating a "" goslow "" policy. Every one knows that the dispute arose in the Randwick tramway workshops. The railway and tramway men who are now out on strike have contributed £160,000 to the patriotic funds, a larger sum than has been contributed by any other section of the community. contributions have not been made like some of those of the big merchants and manufacturers. The evidence of the Prices Board shows that some of the latter have given £250 and like amounts to patriotic funds, and then charged their donations against the goods they were making and selling, passing on the cost to the general public while taking credit for patriotic spirit. The men at Randwick have contributed out of their wages, and their donations cannot be equalled, man for man, and proportionately to their means, by those of any other section of the community. Furthermore, the men worked on .Sundays and at night after their-usual working hours to provide furniture for the Randwick Militar y Hospital, and this they did free of' cost. Yet they are said to be disloyal and lazy, men who would not do a day's work if they could help it ! Every considerable family among them is represented at the Front. These facts are a sufficient answer to the statements of the Prime Minister. What is the question now at issue? The Prime Minister knows it as well as any man in the country, but it does not suit him at the present time to acknowledge the fact. The trouble goes to the very root of trade union organization. The principle that combined workmen shall have the opportunity to negotiate as to the terms and conditions under which they shall sell their labour in the market has been attacked. When Labour becomes unable to do that the edifice of trade unionism will crumble to the ground. No one knows this better than ^the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy., In a manifesto issued to the soldiers in the trenches, the Prime Minister said that if the Nationalist party were returned, not one stone in the temple of labour would be disturbed. Now, however, the Commonwealth and State Governments have joined to crush trade unionism in Australia. We have been told of the twenty-four hours' ultimatum given by the men who are now out on strike. The Prime M in ister has adcepted the statement of the Attorney-General of New South Wales to this effect, but he has not given publicity to the oflicial statement of the Strike Committee, which is an absolute denial of that of the At torney-General of New South, Wales. As a matter of fact, a card system was These introduced into the Randwick workshops twelve months ago, when the men were called upon to fill up their own cards. They made such a strong protest against this to the management, that the system was withdrawn; and it was re-introduced on the second occasion without notification or warning. There is a dispute as to the exact intention of the system. On behalf of the strikers it is said that a system, involving the use of a series of six cards, has been introduced which, if not actually the Taylor speeding-up and sweating system of America, is an approximation, imitation, or modification of it . It has "" been said that the New South Wales card' system has nothing to do with speeding up; but Senator Gardiner, when addressing a meeting of the tramway men at Waverley on the 12th August, produced ,a card-that numbered "" 6 ""-and read this question from it 6. Are there any hands in your section who are not satisfactory? The questions were to be answered by so called sub-foremen, about 300 of whom have been lately appointed. These are not men in whom the workmen have confidence. Their job was refused by those who are looked upon as decent unionists and decent workmen. It is those who are Considered sneaks by their fellows who have become sub-foremen, and these had to fill up the secret cards, which were not to be seeu by the men, stating, among other things, whether the work of the dozen or twenty men in the section of each was, or was not, satisfactory. Before Senator Gardiner's statement was published in the press, the Sydney Morning Herald's representative waited on the Chief Railways Commissioner regarding it , and asked for an explanation. This was published in the Herald on the 13th August in the following terms: Mr Frazer denied the statement. The card system, he said, provides only for a record of work done, and time taken on each job, and 1 does not make any provision whatsoever for answering questions as to the men being unsatisfactory. Senator Gardiner then called at the Herald office, and produced the card from which he had read, which had been printed at the Government Printing Office, Sydney, and bore the imprint of that office. The Herald next day printed what he had said, which proved that what the Chief Commissioner had said - was not true. Having thus been absolutely bowled out, the Chief Commissioner repliedYes, that was one system which had been got together, but that is not the system which we were introducing.",28
72,Mr WEBSTER,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,He said that it was a system which had hot been introduced.,29
73,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"He said that it was one of a number of systems which was being considered, but that it had not been introduced. The fact that the Chief Commissioner said that he knew nothing about such a card, and then, when bowled out by the presentation of it in the newspaper office, gave another explanation, so qualifies the denial of the effect of the system, as urged by the strikers, as to strongly support the claim for a tnorough inquiry. Remembering the negotiations that ' have taken place during the past twelve months, the statement that the men left work within twenty-four hours is absolutely untrue. A change was being introduced into their working conditions, and, surely, when a large and respected body of workmen unanimously object to such a system there is reason for inquiry into it. If the fears of the men are groundless why shirk an inquiry? The Arbitration Court is in existence to determine the conditions of employment, and the men have stated officially over and over again, and still say, "" Give us an inquiry, choosing your own tribunal, and if we cannot make out a case for the withdrawal of the card system, and if the decision of the Judge is against us, we shall return to work immediately?"" The Government refuse that fair request.",29
74,Mr HEITMANN,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"""When was it put before the Government ?",29
75,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"At the very commencement of the dispute, and it is before them now. ,'",29

77,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Yes .  ""Return to work, and we shall consider the matter.""",29
78,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"The Government say, "" Go back and work under the card system for three months."" The men refuse to work under these sub-foremen and the card system for three months.",29
79,Mr ABCHIBAXD,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"The men would not have struck had they taken, a secret ballot. MT: J. H . CATTS - There have been secret ballots, and, in every case, the decision has been overwhelmingly in favour of stopping work.",29

81,Mr ABCHIBALD,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,Then why do they not ballot?,29
82,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"The Government asked, "" Will the Strike Committee agree to take a secret ballot as to returning to work?"" and the committee replied, "" Yes, we are prepared to take a secret ballot on two propositions: (1) Whether the men shall return tc work under this system upon the appointment of a tribunal of inquiry; or (2) whether they should return to work unconditionally""; but the Government rejected the offer. They did not want a ballot on those terms and conditions.",29
83,Mr RODGERS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,There should have been a secret ballot before any of the men came out.,29
84,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Unde r the m rules of some unions it is not possible to take a secret ballot before the men cease - work. The Prime Minister has referred to the stoppage of work by large numbers of men who have no cause in this dispute, and the Minister for the Nav$_has made a statement to the same effect. union leaders, those Ministers know perfectly well that where "" black "" labour is introduced into an industry for the purpose of strike breaking, and where the goods handled by that ""black"" labour are sent into another industry, uniformly the strike follows those goods. Those gentlemen have been, times out of number, parties to strikes against the introduction of "" scab "" labour. The Prime Minister referred to the New Zealand dispute. Of course, some men were prevented from leaving their work because, as the honourable member as an old strike leader knows, strikes must be conducted by obedience to orders. Those men who are directed to remain at work must do so, and those directed to cease work should stop immediately. That was done in connection with another strike when the Prime M in ister was one of the leaders. Some men ceased work and others remained in their employment when they were ordered to do so. The request at that time that the wharf labourers and others should remain at work, was not in order that they could better help production by remaining at work, but because they could better help the industrial dispute by so doing. The Prime Minister knows that such things happen in the management of every strike.",29
85,Mr HUGHES,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,It did not happen 1913.,30
86,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"The right honourable member knows that he has carried out the doctrine to which I refer, time after time. I had hoped to refer to the partisan attitude of the Commonwealth Government in connection with this dispute, and the use of the machinery created for the conduct of the international conflict for the purpose of crushing unionism within Australia. I have some matter to place before the House in reference to those aspects, but as my time has expired, I shall defer my further remarks to a later hour.",30
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"ParramattaMinister for the Navy) [3.40] - As the honourable member for Cook mentioned my name several times during his short speech, I should like to say a few words on this very important matter. Not one of the reasons stated by the honourable [66] member for the extension of the strike applies in regard to a great deal of the labour that is on strike. The honourable member said that! the men left their work As old because they were asked to do this and to do the other thing. There are 2,000 men out of work at the dock today for no earthly reason. They left their work at a minute's notice. They were not asked to handle anything that was "" black."" They were attending to the ordinary work of looking after the transports, and sending men to the Eront. They dropped their tools' at a moment's notice without rhyme or reason. It is too late in the day to begin to raise these gags; they are not true, and they ought not to be repeated. The reasons stated by the honourable member are not those for which the men went out on strike. Just what the reasons are I do not pretend to know. I was not even paid the compliment of being told that the men intended to leave their work. Do honourable members know that the men are.still refusing to man a hospital ship? Last! evening they agreed that! they would load by union labour a hospital ship now at Port Melbourne, and today the stokers are out on strike, and will not permit the work to proceed.",30
88,Mr FENTON,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,And the committee are trying to get them to return.,30
89,Mr WEBSTER,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"That statement will not work. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I could cite many similar instances. I do not wish to dilate on the existing state of affairs-it i in is sad enough and tragic enough-bu t I do say that, union or no union, the men had no right to hold up the transports, i Whatever their feelings may be as to local disputes, they are not justified, in any circumstances, cr from any consideration, in preventing the transports leaving for the Front. Honourable members opposite know, as well as I do, that there is no excuse for what has been done. Everything in reason has been done to induce the men to do this work, but without avail. For what reason have they acted in this way ? The reason is that they were ordered out of their employment by an official, who simply told them to cease work; and cease work they did , on the instant. That is how the general cessation of work at the docks has happened. There was no notice or intimation that they were about to strike. They were simply ordered out of work, and out they went. 'When men do that sort of thing in connection with war work, there is something deeper than unionism at the bottom of it . Every man will , and every man must, place his own interpretation upon their action; but it cannot be said that there is any union reason for stopping that work.",30
90,Mr FENTON,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,Me n who voted for National party at the election are out <on strike.,31
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I believe that many of the men on strike voted for the present Government at the last election. I believe, also, that 75 per cent, of those on strike would be glad to get back to their work, and that they disbelieve in the strike, and certainly in its extension What is the strike for? The honourable member for Cook says it is a strike for the right to negotiate as to the conditions under which the men shall sell their labour. Sell tlieir labour to whom?",31
92,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,The Railways Commissioners.,31
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,For whom do the Railways Commissioners act? A r e they the catspaws of some private profit-making employer ? Every striker is a shareholder in those railways.,31
94,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,You know that is a lot of buncombe.,31
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"For the purpose of this argument, the honourable member alters his tune from that I have heard him play very often when stating the case for Socialism. The men are not striking for any special purpose, as far as I am able to ascertain. It is not a dispute in which the old ethics of profiteering apply at all. In this instance, they are striking against the Government, and against themselves as constituent shareholders in a huge national concern; and I say they are not justified in dropping their tools and laying idle the whole enterprise of the country on any such pretence as that on which - they left their work.",31
96,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,You say nothing about the speeding-up system.,31
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I do not see where the speeding-up comes in . system proposed in New South Wales is not the Taylor system, and all the arguments . honourable members like to apply to it cannot make it so.",31
98,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,Has the honourable member seen the system ?,31
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I have seen the cards aspublished, and I see nothing in them but a record of work done. Really, there is nothing in them more than takes place in connection with much union employment today. Every miner's tally is taken from him every night and checked. Mr J.. H . CATTS - So is a railway the man's tally.",31
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"What more than that does the card system do? It takes account of what quantity of work a man has done - during the day; many unions are working under the same system today, and. strange to say, would not work under any other system.",31
101,Mr FINLAYSON,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,Does the honourable - member approve of the Taylor system ?,31
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I frankly confess that I do not know what the Taylor system is. I know it is some system of speeding up, but precisely what the details are, I do not know. I have been informed that some such system is in operation in the Victorian Government Printing Oflice now, and I suggest to honprable members opposite that they should straight way call a strike against it . The Leader of the Opposition asked the Government to intervene, and to effect a just settlement of this dispute. May I remind honourable members that the Prime Minister did intervene in a serious dispute a few months ago ? The result of that » intervention was to give the coal miners 3s. per ton increase in their rates. Mr J. H. CATTS - That was in the middle of the conscription campaign.",31
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,What is the insinuation ?,31
104,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"There is no purpose to be served now by intervention. Mr . JOSEPH COOK - The Prime Minister effected a just settlement in the coal dispute, and the miners have thrown 'it to the winds. Surely there must be some guarantee that when just intervention takes place, it will effect the purpose for which it has been invoked.",31
105,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,The honourable member has engaged in strikes under'the same The circumstances.,31
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I have never taken part in any strike. Perhaps that is news to the honourable member. I should like to see this strike end. That is the dearest wish of my heart. I should like to see it terminated by the men themselves coming to reason. There never was a strike founded on a mose flimsy basis than the present trouble, and for the Government to intervene and take the matter out of the hands of any State Government would be, in my judgment, to do an unwise and an unjust thing.",31
107,Mr HIGGS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Capricornia) [3.50] The Minister for the Navy has made a very noisy speech, which gives us very - little hope that the Governmenx will do anything to try to bring the strike to a conclusion. If we may judge by the speeches of the Prime Minister and his colleague, it would appear that the Win-the-war party, having succeeded in. smashing the Labour party politically, hope to smash it industrially. They hope to break up the unions. There are two classes of industrial unions. The one may be spoken of as* the genuine trade unions, while the other is the bogus production calling itself labour, but fighting the genuine trade unionists all the time. I regret that the Prime Minister is not present. He seems of late to come into this chamber 'as little as possible. He attends to answer questions, and then leaves. The explanation, I suppose, is that he is unable to bear the criticism of the Opposition, although it may be that he realizes that he occupies a most inconsistent .position. Ministerial supporters aTe welcome to both the Prime Minister and his first lieutenant, the Minister for the Navy. If the situation were not so serious, it would be amusing to them to find that they have as their leaders two honourable gentlemen who, in the olden days, used to teach the working classes of Australia the principles of trade unionism. If the workers err at all at the present time, it is because of the teachings they had from the lips of the Prime Minister and the Minis-, ter for the Navy (- Mr Cook) when they were leading the trade union movement.' It jappears to me that a section of tha employing classes in Australia are very glad that the strike has taken place. They feel confident of success. They believe that they will smash trade unionism. They think that the general public, because of the inconvenience to which the strike has put them, will not sympathize with the workers; that there table is a possibility that the Arbitration Courts will be called upon successfully to deyear register existing unions, and to establish but, new unions; ;that all the arbitration high awards will go by the board, and that [66]- 2 working classes will again be competing one with the other, with the result thai wages will come down. If honourable members opposite are prepared to take warning from any one, let me warn them that, in so far as they succeed in destroying the genuine trade unionism, they wall create in this community the very class which they have been declaring unlawful - a class of people who believe in the In-, dustrial Workers of the World methods. We cannot educate the people and expect them, with their education, to submit to injustice. We must have our schoolmasters; we must see that every child in the community is educated, and, since we do that, is it reasonable to expect that educated people will put up with conditions that belong to a by-gone age? This trouble has arisen because of the determination of the New South Wales Government to introduce the card system. We need not trouble ourselves with the question of whether or not it is the Taylor system, or a modification of it, that has been introduced'. The outstanding fa'ct is that a card system, to which the men object, has been introduced during war time. Mr Beeby, a member of the New South Wales Government, came to Melbourne to tell the Prime Minister everything concerning the impending dispute, and if the Prime Minister had pointed out to him that the Federal Government could not support the State Ministry in making such an important change during war time, I do not think the State authorities would have taken up such a strong position. I take leave to say that the Prime Minister was fully aware of every action that the New South Wales Government was taking, and I cannot believe that he did not encourage Mr Beeby to go on. Neither the New South Wales Government nor any. Administration has, in my opinion, any right to speed up ib? workers. In his most recent volume of statistics Mr Knibbs, referring to the railways in all the States, writesInterest returned on capital expenditure It may be seen from the figures given in the in paragraph 13 hereof, that the State Government railways in Australia have, on the whole, made a substantial profit during eacb since the inception of the Commonwealth, unfortunately, the community does not get the full benefit of this profit, owing to the rates of interest at which money for railthe ways was borrowed in the early days. If the railways are showing a substantial return on the money invested in them, why should the New South Wales Government try to Sipeed up its railway employees? The nation organized, through its Government, should set an example to all other employers. It is claimed-and I ibelieve it is true-that the system which the New South Wales Government desire to introduce throughout its railway service is not in use in any private establishment in Australia. I am reminded by the honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) that in the State railway workshops locomotives are being made for less than the price at which they can be obtained from America. What, then, is the reason for this speeding up? The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy have said that the other anions are striking without reason. They forget that one of the first principles of trade unionism is that "" An in j u r y to one is the concern of all . "" What is the treatment that doctors and lawyers, shipping and banking companies, and business men generally mete out to any members of their associations who infringe their rules 1 Does any one believe that the 20,000 or 30,000 workers who have gone out on strike have done so merely as a matter of child's play ? I suppose that the majority of these people when employed earn sufficient only to provide for feeding and clothing their families, and for the payment bf rent. They run every risk, therefore, in going out on strike. If Ministerial supporters belonged to a union they would have a great deal of sympathy for the men ' in New South Wales who are fighting this battle. I propose now to draw attention speech made some time ago by the Minister for the Navy. The right able gentleman was at one time secretary of a trade union known as the Lithgow"" Miners' Union. It was not a very tensive organization, but it was > sible for his entry into public life. a considerable number of years he mained with the Labour party, and I would remind him of the speeches he used to make in those days. him a few minutes ago discussing strike. Let me quote now from a speech made by him some time ago-a which, I think, discounts the very and boastfuL utterance in which he inMr Biggs. dulged this afternoon. He said, speaking at Broken Hill , on one occasion"" Just as storms prove the activity of the ' elements in the atmosphere, so do strikes prove activity in the industrial world. It has' been said that strikes are wasteful; but, if that be true, so are all efforts at reform. Strikes are beneficial, even though the workers sometimes lost."" The right honourable gentleman was rather poetical in those days, and * he went on to say"" It was the same as the sea, washing up on the shore. It recedes and returns, but in the long run it reaches the full tide."" Mr Cook concluded an eloquent address on the benefits of unionism, and the advantages to be gained by returning Labour members to Parliament pledged to the cause of the workers.""  delivered ?",32
108,Mr HIGGS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"On 24th' October, 1892. The Prime Minister has refused to allow Mr Justice Higgins to arbitrate in a dispute between the Queensland Government and the railway employees in Northern Queensland. Both parties are agreeable that Mr Justice Higgins should arbitrate. They have .approached him, and he is willing to do so; but as the Commonwealth Government are, so to speak, his employers, he desires that their approval shall be obtained. He says, "" If the Prime Minister will consent I shall be pleased to arbitrate."" He is prepared to .go up to Queensland during his holidays, and to arbitrate in the matter, but the Prime Minister declines to consent. This goes to ' show that, not only the righ t honourable gentleman himself, but the Government as a whole are involved. Although it would appear on the surface that only the Prime Minister and his chief lieutenant-tw o former Lato a bour men-ar e taking any part in this . matter, the fact is that the Treasurer (Sir John Eorrest), the Honorary Minishonorter (Mr Groom), and all the members of the old National Win-the-war Partv, though keeping quiet, are involved. They exare leaving their newly-found leadersrespontwo Labour men-to say wicked things Por concerning Labour, and to refuse on berehalf of the Government to take ste,ps to bring about a settlement of this dispute. I hope the public will recognise that the We heard Commonwealth Government are not orethis pared to do anything to bring about in dustrial peace, but are willing to let the speech strike extend throughout the length and loud breadth of Australia in the hope that trade unionism ""will be broken up industrially as it bas been politically.",33
109,Mr LAMOND,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Illawarra) [4.3] - The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) concluded his speech with the statement that the strike is due to an effort on the part of the National Government to smash trade unionism. 'venture to suggest that a much truer description of it would be that it is an effort on the .parti of those who desl'royed the Labour movement as we have known it in Australia to go further, and to destroy the trade union movement. I have listened with attention to the 1 speeches delivered by honourable members of the Labour Opposition in the hope of hearing some reasons for the strike, or some words in .justification of it . I am not surprised that we have heard nothing of the inner history of this strike from those who have addressed themselves this afternoon to that task. The new masters of the trade union movement have the same contempt for a Labour member in Parliament that they have for the old leaders of trade unionism in this country. The honourable gentlemen who profess to expound the inner working of this strike are little, if any, more in the confidence of the men who made the strike than are honourable members on this side. The whole design was made in the City of Melbourne as part of the anfi-conscription campaign a long time ago; and I think that this is the thir d occasion on which the movement has got away from its leaders. It was not intended that this strike should take place this month; it has come a month before its time. certainly never could have been intended to have it fought on so flimsy a pretext as that, when an employer asked his employees to say how .they spend the hours for which he pays them, such a request sliould be regarded as an invasion of the sacred rights of Labour. During the whole of my working lif e I have had, myself, to fill in just such details as the railway men are now asked to fill in . The Labour paper which I managed is still managed under the. same - system, and more details are required from its workmen than the Railways Commissioners are asking from their employees. new unionism has been opposed by the best men in the trade union movement since first it showed itself in Australia. It preaches a doctrine of utter destruction to the. industries of any country-the doctrine that a man may loaf, may take the wages of an employer, and not earn them, and that the more a man loafs the more it is to his credit.",34
110,Mr BRENNAN,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Who preaches that? I Mr LAMOND - The gentlemen who are responsible for this strike, and responsible for the destruction of the Labour movement as it existed before last election, preach this doctrine openly, and it is preached in the processions in Sydney today as part of the strike propaganda. This pretence of honourable gentlemen not very closely associated with the Labour movement except in its political offices, that this is not 'being done, is idle talk at this time of day, when everybody interested in the preservation of the trade union movement knows that, unless this new element can be scotched, the movement is going to lose the whole of its power. When they talk about the National Governments of Australia being determined on the destruction of the trade union movement, I say that the only thing that can save the movement for the effective work it has hitherto done is for the political leaders-hardl y the political leaders, but the political heads-of the Labour party as it exists today to set themselves determinedly to crush out the new element instead of becoming its ready mouth-pieces in a crisis sucb as this. What is this strike about? This strike in New South Wales professes to be about the introduction of a card system by which a return is made of the time spent on the various jobs. The honourable It member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) most ingeniously tried to convey the idea that this matter had been in .negotiation for twelve months.",34
111,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,So it had.,34
112,Mr LAMOND,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"That is absolutely in accurate. It is twelve months since the Railway Commissioner asked the men to do what men in other engineering establishments have been doing all along-to fill in their own cards-bu t at that time they refused to do so; and u n t i l a few months, or weeks, ago the proposal had not been revived. Therefore, to say that This there had been agitation and negotiations for twelve months is an unfair misrepresentation of the facts.",34
113,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,: :-REPRESENTATIVES.] Industrial,34
114,Mr LAMOND,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I do not. To show how unreal are the reasons given for this strike, the objection first taken was that the men .were not allowed to fill in the cards themselves; that is, the first public objection taken in New Soutn Wales to the proposal that sub-foremen should fill in the cards, was that the men had not been allowed to fill' them in themselves. The Commissioner said to the men, "" Twelve montlis ago you refused to fill in the cards yourselves "" and' from that time, on a new story haa been told. But the striking fact in connection with the trouble is that the leaders of the men have doned all pretence that the proposed system is the speeding-up system of America. As is shown quite clearly in the negotiations of the Lord .Mayor of Sydney with the State Government, the condition on which the men now talk of going back to work is not the withdrawal of this iniquitous system of speeding-up, but an inquiry into all the grievances of all the meu who have come out. What State enterprise 'can hope to live, if a Government give in to that sort of proposition-if on the flimsiest pretext a dozen men may stop work somewhere, and immediately' all the other associated unions come out and refuse to return until a Royal Commission, or some other body, inquires into all the grievances that all the leaders can produce for investigation f I point out again that not only are these new leaders of the Labour movement set on the destruction of the indust r i a l movement as we have known i 'they are making it impossible for any extension of State enterprise to be considered. They have done more in the past year, in the State of New South Wales-thos o men who are controlling the trade union movement today-to undo the work that the Labour movement has done in securing the nationalization of indusbries, than all the enemies of nationalization have done in the twenty-five years of the existence of the Labour party. In supporting the men who have the conduct of this strike, those who are pledged to the introduction of nationalization are assisting to make it impossible for further industries to be nationalized. If successful, this doctrine that a man may take the wages of another and loafthat a man may make a solemn agreement today and break it to-morrowwill reduce our nation to a level below Crisis. that of any other civilized community. What basis are we to have for our association with other men when the pledged word cannot be accepted ? What basis have we for association with bodies of men, ior the conduct of industries, for social intercourse, for anything in the world, if the written agreement given today is to be flouted without concern tomorrow ? The doctrines that these men are preaching in cessantly throughout the Labour movement are doctrines entirely subversive of all human intercourse. The duty of trade unionists who respect honour-wh o beaban- lieve in a fair return for the benefits they enjoy at the hands of society today-is to set themselves the task of rooting out of the movement every element of this new propaganda that has been brought into Australia during the past seven ""or eight years.",35
115,Dr MALONEY,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,Seve n or eight years?,35
116,Mr LAMOND,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Yes , since it began to get any hold. /",35
117,Dr MALONEY,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,Then you belonged to the party for five of those years.,35
118,Mr CONSIDINE,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,The honourable member for Illawarra would have been out defending the strikers today if it had not been for the conscription issue..,35
119,Mr LAMOND,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I venture to say, and I speak with full knowledge, that but for the conscript-ion issue we should not have been considering this strike at all. Those honourable gentlemen who, by their approval, have incited those men to ret , but, main on strike when they might have gone back with honour and dignity, overlook two facts. First of all, they overlook the fact that this country is at war, and that it is still on. the knees of the gods whether we shall retain this country. Then they overlook the fact that, by encouraging these men to go out on strike, and keep out, they are producing misery in the families of the best of the unionists. Who are the men who, in these industrial upheavals, always lose their jobs, if jobs are lost? The men who are edging on the strikers take care to get back to their jobs. The man who shouts loudest at the mass meeting is the one who goes back, helter-skelter, as in the last tramway strike, and rushes the office for his job. The men who will pay for the mistakes of these new leaders are the best men in the unions, together with their wives and families. Ha d this fact been kept to the front instead of the personal advantage of some of the leaders being kept in view, the strike would have been over in a week. I am inclined to believe that while the overwhelming majority of the trade unionists of this country are entirely opposed to those who are trying to paralyze the arm of the nation in this war, there has been, throughout the industrial organizations, a persistent and consistent propaganda directed to one object, and to one object only-the object of provoking any trouble anywhere that will add to the difficulties of the Government in conducting the war. The best evidence that honourable gentlemen on the other side could have given of the sincerity of their protestations of loyalty at this time would have been to tell the men what the inevitable effect of their action must be. Why was it necessary that the State Government should give an answer to the men in twenty-four hours? The Leader of the Opposition this afternoon gave no reason for the strike at all. The honourable member for Cook (Mr J . H . Catts) gave some reasons; but neither of these gentlemen attemped to say why it was necessary that th© Railway Commissioners, should come to a decision in twenty-four hours.",35
120,Mr JH CATTS,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,After twelve months there musb be some ending.,36
121,Mr LAMOND,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,The honourable member knows as well as I do that it is not a question of twelve months.,36
122,Mr CONSIDINE,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,You admitted yourself.,36
123,Mr LAMOND,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I did not. I said that twelve months ago the men were asked to fill in the cards,- and declined to do so.",36
124,Mr CONSIDINE,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,That is what the honourable member for Cook said.,36
125,Mr LAMOND,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"No ; that honourable member said that this proposed system had been a matter of negotiations for twelve months, whereas, from the time the men declined to fill in the cards, there were no negotiations u n t i l a week or two before the strike occurred.",36
126,Mr SPEAKER,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,The honourable member's time has expired.,36
127,Mr ANSTEY,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"Bourke) [4.19] The remarks of the honourable member for LUawarra (Mr Lamond), from beginning to end, may have been absolutely correct, and, as such, we might possibly agree with them. But the honourable member presents a most remarkable spectacle. He could not enter into the debate without making some imputation on honourable members on this side. Whatever may have been the faults and errors of trade unionism-and there are. many-the y do not commence today; they date back for many years. They are part of the weak- "" ness of the individuals composing the unions - But the honourable member for Illawarra never assumed the virtues of unionism until it provided him with a job, nor did he find any vices in it u n t i l he lost that job. We have had denunciations of trade unionism for twenty years past. The right honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Joseph Cook) left it because he thought that - it was being improperly manipulated, and other men from time to time have denounced it , but we have not heard from the honourable member for Illawarra a single word as to its vices or follies until he came to be separated from it . So far as the honourable member is concerned, I leave the matter at that point.",36
128,Mr LAMOND,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,The statement of the honourable member is untrue.,36
129,Mr ANSTEY,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,It is absolutely true.,36
130,Mr SPEAKER,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,I ask' the honourable member for Illawarra to withdraw his statementr,36
131,Mr LAMOND,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I withdraw it and apologize; but on a point of order. I ask whether the honourable member for Bourke is so in order in imputing to me-motives that are not based on facts. He said that I gave expression to certain principles only when I was paid, not before and not after. His statement is untrue, and I would like him to withdraw it .",36
132,Mr SPEAKER,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,If the honourable member for Bourke made any reflections on the honourable member for Illawarra he was certainly not in order.,36
133,Mr ANSTEY,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I had no wish to make any imputation or reflection upon the honourable member for Illawarra. I merely stated the facts, and I left the matter there. It is open to any one else to make whatever imputation he chooses. In the succession of strikes that we have had in Australia the honourable member and others have not been opponents of the action of the workers I lament the situation tha£ confronts the country today as much as any man does. The Prime Minister says that it is not the product of an industrial dispute, but that it is a conspiracy brought about by men who are Syndicalists and Sinn Feiners, whose objects are to bring danger to the country, and to do things that are inimical to the Commonwealth and its anxiety to carry on the war to a successful issue - If the Prime Minister believes this, why has he not done his duty, and brought these men to justice? This Government has refrained from taking any action against these men who are supposed to be the enemies of the country and the Empire, and who are supposed to be preventing the Government from doing what it wishes to do in connection with the war. No one knows what that is. No one has seen any action towards winning the war on the part of the Government since it has been elected.",36
134,Mr BAMFORD,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,The honourable member is right; the Government ought to take action against these men.,37
135,Mr ANSTEY,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"It ought to take action, but it has refrained from doinj; so - Either the statement that the men who have instigated this strike are inspired by Syndicalists and Sinn Feiners cannot be true, or the Government stands condemned of treachery to the community and the Empire by remaining inactive. The Dean of Sydney seems to have put the present position accurately - and his contention is unanswerable; at least, it has not yet been answeredwhen he said that if the employer is entitled to put conditions on the men, the men have not a less right to resist. The Age, in a leading article in which it condemns the men, admits that what incited this strike was the action of the New South ""Wales Government in producing the cause of the dispute.",37
136,Mr FINLAYSON,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,In refusing to arbitrate.,37
137,Mr ANSTEY,POWEKS OP OHAIKMAN OF,"I am not talking of arbitration. If it was a case in which a body of men held up the Government by asking for the imposition of a new set of conditions, the primary cause of the trouble would be theirs, but it is admitted on all sides that the primary cause of this trouble was the action of the State Government. If ever there has been need for clear and definite action on the part of the Commonwealth Government to intercede with a State Government it is present now. In fact, when the present dispute arose the. Commonwealth should have demanded of the State Government that it should do nothing to precipitate this country into an industrial crisis at this time. If it be true that, behind all this, there is a veiled and shadowy figure of some unnamed conspiracy, the Government likewise stands condemned. Surely the conspirators are known. They cannot be like those German agents who walked abroad and distributed money everywhere, and yet could not be discovered. We were told that German influence had been eliminated, and that the last tentacle had been cut, but it was a deliberate lie, or it was an act of treachery on the part of the Government that no action was taken against those"" German agents who were supposed to be walking abroad and distributing this money broadcast. We have to face the present position and deal with it with something more than words. If men are conspiring to do what the Prime Minister accuses them of doing it was an act of folly on their part to declare a strike at this time of the year. Tn the history of the Comnfonwealth there has been no proposition put up by the employing class or by a Government representing the employing class against the working classes and against which it was believed the latter would rebel that has not been put up just about July or August. That was the case in the big maritime strike, and again in 1893; it was the case also in 1903; it waa likewise the case in the agricultural implement makers' struggle. Whenever anything is put up that the working' classes are likely to dispute it is always done in July or August. I see no evidence of any conspiracy in this strike, but I do see evidence of mad folly. The right honourable member for Parramatta, in stating that 75 per cent, of the men are absolutely loyalists in regard to the interests of their country, has answered the statement that these men are the mere tools and instruments of individuals. As a matter of fact, the men on strike are absolutely leaderless. I have never seen such spontaneous action, such a spontaneous uprising of the working classes as has occurred on this occasion. There has been a clear break away from everything. As the Prime Minister has said, the trouble has always been to bold the men. Any fool can get men to go on strike. If the interests of the country are stake, surely the National Government should say, "" We are going to bring this to an end."" Where is this matter going to end? Surely we are not going to - et it d r if t ! I know nothing of the case, and I do not propose to discuss them; I do .not raise the question of whether the card system proposed to be introduced is a good one or not; I simply say that if this trouble is inimical to the interests of the country it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government paid to intervene, but if they do take action domestic mica? let them be sure that they do not merely take action against the workers.

Speaker, are the custodian of our liberties, and should, if the occasion calls for rule even against those who placed you in power. I have expressed my pleasure at your election to the high office that you occupy. When you took that office, yoii pledged yourself to maintain the liberties of every member, no matter wheTe he might sit. MT. HUGHES - I have moved the postponement of the Order of 'the Day to allow of the consideration of a matter which is urgent.",41
168,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,iShal l we have an opportunity to discuss grievances after that business has been dealt with?,42
169,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Yes . As a compromise, I suggest that the discussion of grievances should go on until the dinner adjournment, and that this evening the House should deal with the business which the G-overnment wishes to take in hand.",42
170,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I feel that, if we give way in the slightestdegree in respect of any invasion of our privileges, we shall the met with a still further infringement of them very soon. The history of all Parliaments shows that every party some day becomes the minority. The grievance discussion might, perhaps, in any case, be ended before the dinner adjournment; but, in my opinion, it would be better to let it proceed unchecked, and, should it then be necessary to keep the House sitting all night to get the Government business through, I promise to stay to keep a quorum. There is a grievance about which I wish to speak, and which I shall mention now, as an argument against' the postponement of the Order of the Day.",42
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL," I am afraid I cannot allow that. The discussion now must be strictly relevant to the question of postponement. Mr J. H . OATTS - I rise to order. The second paragraph of standing order 241 saysExcept that while the Committees of Supply and Ways and Means are open, the first Order of the Day on every third Thursday shall be either Supply or Ways and Means, and that on that Order of the Day being read, the question shall be proposed- "" That the Speaker do now leave the chair."" to which question any member shall be at liberty to address the House, or move any amendment thereon. I submit that the motion to postpone the Order of the Day is out of order; that what is needed to do what the Prime Minister desires is the suspension of the Standing Orders.",42
172,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I am willing to withdraw my motion if honourable members opposite will accept my suggestion that the grievance debate should continue until 6.30 only.,42
173,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"The Order of the Day had not been read when the.i Prime Minister rose to make his motion. Similar motions have previously been moved. As an instance in point, on the 21st April, 1904, when it was ordered that general business and - Orders of the Day No. 1, Government - business, be postponed until consideration of Order of the, Day No. 2, Government business. Fren quently, in every session, similar motions! are moved. The motion is in order, and it is for the House to decide what shall be done. ^",42

175,Mr ANSTEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Bourke) [4.48] - The Prime Minister has told us that the events that have been under discussion this afternoon constitute, not a strike, but a revolt.",42
176,Mr HEITMANN,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"A political rebellion. MT. ANSTEY - Jus t so. If that be so, it is the right honoraible gentleman's bounden duty to take action. At present, there can be no communication between one body of workmen and another. The country is being governed, not by the ordinary laws, but by regulations under the War Precautions Aot, which it was never intended should be used as they have been used. The Government are using against the workmen the powers conferred by that Act. I draw attention to the fact that the ordinary processes of law are not being exercised in the country at the present time. The War Precautions regulations, which, we were told, would never be used for the purposes for which they are being used, and the power to issue which the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), myself, and others opposed in this House, are being employed today in connection with a local industrial trouble. The latest regulation is of such a character that no man can stand on the public platforms of the country in safety. He does not know in what manner he may be infringing the laws, or to what penalties he will be subjected. We have been told that the men on strike are causing immense injury to recruiting. I assure the House that the principal injury to recruiting is not caused so much by the action of any men in this country as by the statements which are reaching the people in hundreds of letters sent from the Front. The mail today has brought me two or three letters mentioning several cases. Here are particulars of several cases that came before Brigadier-General Graham-Thomson. One man was asleep in his dug-out when the sergeant-major came in and kicked him. He absented himself for forty-eight hours. He was charged with being absent without leave and with having struck a superior officer in the execution of his duty. It was admitted that the kick was administered before the offence was committed, but he received two years' imprisonment. The prisoner's letter continuesThere are 250 prisoners here, 75 per oent. Australians. The work is mostly pick and shovel. I have been bashed about with t'renchtool handles t ill I am raw meat from top to bottom. I have been here in chains from the middle of March last; These chains fit round your legs, connected with another chain that runs to the waist, and is there fastened. this gear on, we are ordered to work at the double, and if you fall you are kicked or jumped upon. Wo. 4769, of the 6th Battalion, was tried by court martial on the 13th July, 1916. He Was charged with drunkenness and with having fallen out of the march, and received twelve months' imprisonment. He was put into a cell, and StaffSergeant Barry called him out, and bashed him on the head with a trenching implement and when the man came to his senses he found a gag in his mouth. These sort of statements are contained in hundreds of letters that are coming to Australia, and are doing more to injure recruiting than any action of the indusMr Anstey. trial workers. No. 858, of the 6th Battalion, was charged with seven offences(1) Drunkenness, (2) absent without leave, (3) striking an officer, (4) insubordination, (5) breaking out of camp (6) refusing to obey orders, (7) refusing to parade, and the same officer who gave the other man twelve months for falling out. on a march to Armentieres awarded this man forty-two days' No. 1 field punishment. I shall state subsequently why this soldier escaped with so light a sentence when the other man got twelve months. . Mr Watt - Why not state the reason now?",42
177,Mr ANSTEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Because I am not sure of my facts, and""I have been charged before with making statements that are not supported by facts. Another man from Heidelberg was fined £15, and his father, who is a cripple, cannot get any money for maintenance. Another man was brought before a Court and charged with neglect of duty, and was fined f l 15s., and was kept seventy days in detention before being placed on trial, and his pay for the whole period, £17 10s. was stopped.",43
178,Mr WATT,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"You mentioned one trial which had taken place in July, 1916. Did all the cases occur in 1916?",43
179,Mr ANSTEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"They occurred in 1916 and since. These are the things that are detrimentally affecting recruiting. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) read to the House particulars of a whole series of cases in which brutal punishment was inflicted, but nothing has been done to remedy the With injustice. Hundreds of letters are reaching the sisters and mothers 'of Australian soldiers in all parts of the Commonwealth with regard to the harsh treatment meted out to men at the Front, and it is the circulation of these facts that acts as a deterrent to enlistment. The Prime Minister asks, "" Who is to govern this country, Democracy or the strikers?"" I say a more pertinent question is. whether the country shall be governed by a Democracy or by the profiteers. What is the underlying cause of the discontent among the great mass of the people and amongst the organized workers? It is not incitement by union officials, because I venture to express the opinion that the ' mass of organized - workers today are, to a large extent, leadeiiess. The prevailing terror of the War Precautions Act and its regulations makes many men afraid to come out on the platform and say what they believe. But the fact which can no longer be hidden is that,' throughout the masses of the people, there is an immense and rapidly growing discontent. is an absolute f r a ud and an insult to the country to say that those thousands of men, generally intelligent men, are organized for revolt by a few underground conspirators. is the general maps of discontent among the workers everywhere that has incited them, in spite of the advice of their leaders, to engage in the trouble that is confronting the Government today. That discontent arises largely from the fact that the profiteers are governing the country. Bodies of workmen throughout Australia who have adopted peacef ul processes, who have approached the Arbitration Court and the Wages Board, and have followed the ordinary processes of the law in order to improve their conditions, and, who in many cases have loyally abided by the awards of those tribunals, have found that when they get an increase of 6d. or ls. per day on the one hand, the profiteer on the other hand takes from them, their wives, and children, An additional 3s. per day. do not rely on my own knowledge in making that statement. the words of the Prime Minister before he went to England as to the conditions in this country. pamphlet which he was about to issue in connection with the referenda, he stated that the bitter enemies of the country were the men who were seeking to make profits during this time of war. fiteering is the fundamental cause of the widespread discontent. The upheaval is not a conspiracy, because there is no organization in it . It is a spontaneous outburst of popular resentment.",43
180,Mr WATT,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Is it not a fact that of all the countries engaged in the war Australia has experienced the smallest relative rise in prices?,44
181,Mr ANSTEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I am prepared to admit that. Many things that do not cause discontent in other countries produce an aggravated form of in this Commonwealth, largely because our workmen have enjoyed a higher standard of living, and, therefore, object more keenly to its reduction. In 1903, when the honourable member for Plinders (Sir William Irvine) was Premier of Victoria, and a big strike was in progress, I appealed to him to show some consideration in the direction of a settlement. I urged that no bitter and hostile spirit should be displayed, but that, recogIt nising the crisis which confronted the country, the Government should not ask who was righ t and who was wrong, but should seek earnestly to secure a settlement. That It is the soundest policy that could be pursued by any Government today. I urge its adoption by the Government in the present crisis. I see quite plainly what is happening. The most bitter men' in this Parliament are not our old opponents, such as the right honourable - member for Swan (Sir John Porrest), and the honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine). The most bitter and vindictive and the most foolish are those who were our old associates in the Labour party. The oresent struggle is the outcome of a personal, political vendetta between two parties of politicians, and it is an absurdity.  position to judge of the merits of this dispute than former Labour men ? I Mr ANSTEY - Eve n if that be so, is this bitterness a sound policy to apply I take in connection with what is not a revolt, but a spontaneous protest by a body of workmen, and whioh may develop In a into we know not what. The Governments may defeat the workers in this struggle; they may crush them down, but they can never destroy the fundamental basis of - their organizations. The Government may Pro- intimidate the leaders of the men today, but the great fact to be faced is that this is not an ordinary time such as that in which the honourable member for Flinders dealt with the railway strikers. This is a time of war, of great nervous strain, and of inevitable carelessness and indifference to events which in normal times would be viewed with the gravest concern, and if the men are pressed too far we may at last reaJch a point when even among the masses, among men whose disposition it is to be orderly and law abiding, a blood-lust will spring up, with discontent consequences no man can foresee. The workers are confronted daily with newspapers, the columns of which reek of ; blood, and mention the slaughter of immense numbers of men as quite an ordinary daily occurrence) and one can understand that the readers may become careless of - what happens and begin to view matters with an indifference to bloodshed to which we are not accustomed. Honourable members opposite may say that a man has not offended against the laws of the country because he is a loyal citizen, but by his very actions he is building up a spirit of resentment amongst the workers engaged in the struggle. If this trouble continues, we may reach a point when the Government will have to take up arms to suppress the strikers, and when that happens in a time of war the consequences may be something that all would be very anxious to avoid. We ought not to discuss in this Chamber who is right and who is wrong in the present dispute. It may be that the men are wrong, and I say, - if they are, ought ir not to be the duty of the Government to endeavour to bring influence to bear on the Government of New South Wales, and say that no matter who is right and who is wrong, there must be a conclusion to this conflict? I shall conclude, as I began, with tation from Dean Talbot, who said that when a body of employers, or a Governassist ment, impose new conditions on men, those men have a right to resist. If i't, unwise for the men to resist, it was equally unwise in a period of war for New South Wales Government to impose new labour conditions. It may be absoI lutely true that the card system and anything altered conditions were necessary for the improved working of the railways.",44
182,Mr WATT,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The Arbitration Court has been imposing new conditions in every award.,45
183,Mr ANSTEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"That took place after deliberation. I am not saving that if these altered conditions had been agreed upon by a process of arbitration, or had been awarded by a Court or Wages Board, the men would not be loyally bound io observe them. I have always told the tramway employees that when they go before a Court or a reference board they must not always expect to get what they want. They cannot protest if the deciafternoon sion is adverse to them, but they loyally abide by it , for only by that means can we get industrial peace. But those are not the conditions obtaining day'.",45
184,Mr WATT,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Thos e conditions obtained in the coal trouble. A special tribuna l made a long investigation into the dispute.,45
185,Mr ANSTEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"That is so. But in any case there existed certain conditions in the New South Wales Railways at the commencement of the war, and an agreement had been made between the Commissioners and the men that those conditions should .not be altered. It would have been a sound and wise policy to have allowed the conditions to remain unchanged during the currency of the war. I earnestly urge the supporters of the Government to bring influence to bear on Ministers, and* I appeal to the Government not to pursue a vendetta againsb the workers, but to put aside all questions of right or wrong, and endeavour to bring this trouble speedily to a conclusion by even telling the Government of New South, Wales that a settlement is necessary in the interests of the Commonwealth. Let us force a conclusion to the conflict. Let some tribunal be appointed to deal with the grievances of the men and some decision arrived at. That is the soundest and wisest policy for Australia and for the future happiness of the people. It is a quothe only safe means by which the Government can take effective action to in winning the war. If they desire to assist in winning the war, they can was hope to do so only by easing the bitter feeling that exists, and not by pursuing a the policy which tends to intensify that bitterness. These are the only suggestions have to make. I have no desire to say that will incite bitter feeling on the part of people either inside or outside this House. I urge the Government to bring its influence to bear on the New South Wales Ministry, with the object! of bringing this industrial trouble to an end. We have 'only to secure the settlement of the dispute so far as the New South Wales railway workers are concerned, and an end will be brought to the whole struggle. I present these facts to the Government for their consideration.",45
186,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Barrier) [ 5 . 7 ] - I wish to discuss certain matters relating to the present industrial upheaval. This I asked the Minister representmust' ing the Minister ' for Defence1. Whether it is a facti or not that a' special train and a picked number of soldiers were held in readiness to be sentto Broken. toHill, from Mitcham Camp, South Australia, within the last fourteen days? 2. If so, at whose request were such arrangements made ? 3. Who issued instructions for such preparations to be made? The answer I received was an evasion. It waa as follows:I \ am informed that owing to serious, civil disorder with which the local police were powerless to deal, it was found necessary by the State Government to send additional police from Adelaide, and subsequently others from Sydney. I am further informed that in order to meet with any development, a special train was held in readiness to despatch further police to Broken Hill. No special .train was detailed for the conveyance of soldiers to Broken Hill.",45
187,Mr WATT,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,That is not an evasion.,46
188,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,It evades the question as to whether or not a picked body of soldiers from Mitcham Camp was held in readiness to be sent to Broken Hill .  of the .allegation.,46
189,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"It is only a denial that a.special train was held in readiness for the despatch of soldiers to Broken Hill . I may briefly state the facts which led me to put this qutestion. Recently I visited Sydney, and subsequently went to Broken Hill . In passing through Adelaide, I was told, in the course of conversation with some soldiers from Mitcham Camp, that it was a positive fact that a picked body of men was held in readiness for despatch to Broken Hill . employees of the South Australian Government also told me that a special train to convey the men to Broken Hill was held in readiness at Mitcham Camp.",46
190,Mr WATT,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The honourable member has a direct contradiction of the statement as to the special trainT I presume he accepts it .,46
191,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I cannot do much else. I certainly accept the statement made to me by men in Mitcham Camp, who had no reason to tell me an untruth. One of their number .actually informed ' me that he was thinking of applying for inclusion in the contingent, as he desired, to revisit Broken Hill . I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the statement made by these men. There is another question to which I desire to refer. This afternoon I asked the Postmaster-General whether it was a fact that a telegram sent on the 17th August last by the secretary of the Barrier branch of the Coal and Shale Miners Federation to Mr Willis, general secretary of the federation in Sydney, asking what action should be taken by the Barrier miners, was not delivered u n t i l Monday, 20th August, the day after the Broken Hill miners went on strike. I in quired further whether the Postmaster General would inform the House of the cause of the delay in the delivery of the message. The answer I received was that inquiries were being made, and that a reply would be furnished as soon as possible. While at Broken Hill , the secretary of the Barrier branch of the Federated Coal and Shale Miners informed me that he had sent this telegram to Mr . Willis. That telegram was kept back; it was not delivered promptly to Mr Willis. Messrs. Willis, Thompson, and Kavanagh were arrested in a provocative manner, and the men at Broken Hill received no reply to their message. On the other hand, a news telegram from Sydney was allowed to reach Broken Hill stating that the coal mine employees all over the country had been called out by the Strike Committee sitting in Sydney. The telegram to Mr Willis did not reach him until the Broken Hill miners had gone out on strike.",46
192,Mr WATT,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I suppose the honourable member is certain of his facts?,46
193,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I am. I met Mr . Willis in Sydney, and while in Broken Certain Hill I also met Mr Barnett, who told me that he had despatched the telegram. Mr . Brookfield, the member for Sturt in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, telegraphed to the editor of the BarrierTruth asking for the true facts in connection with the alleged riot in Broken Hill . Mr Innes informs me that he telegraphed a reply stating that the South Australian police were responsible for the trouble in Broken Hill . The telegram, as it reached Mr Brookfield, however, stated, "" Police not responsible for the trouble."" That also calls for some explanation. Coming to the present industrial trouble, the fact which confronts us is that the New South Wales Railways Commissioner tried to impose new conditions on the railway men. The men offered, and are still offering, to return to work simultaneously with the appointment of at r i bunal to deal with the whole matter, but the Government of New South Wales, backed up by its friends, is still holding out. It refuses to depart from the attitude which it originally took up. It seems to be a case of "" Servants, obey your masters! Do as you are told! You job. have no right to open yourmouths in protest against these new conditions. You must first of all accept them, and then Government, if , in its wisdom, it sees fit Hill. to do so, may appoint a tribunal to inquire into your alleged grievances.""  Courts to settle such disputes.",46
194,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,There are some grievances with which those Courts not deal. ^  tried to go before the Arbitration Court.,47
195,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"On e of the principal requests made by the men is that special tribunal shall be appointed to deal with grievances that are outside the diction of the State industrial Court. Mr S63»t's, Fuller is aware of that fact, and so are his friends, both here and elsewhere. The men asked that their conditions of ployment should be inquired into by a special tribunal. Why is that request rewait long. fused? Is it because the State Government fear an exposure of the incompepresent tence and mismanagement which exist in connection with the Railway Department. What about the material that appropriate person to shift him. has been wasted? What have honorpoint able members to say as to the charges that have been made by the men in on'the asking ' for the appointment of this tribunal? The men have said that over £50,000 of material has been wasted through the incompetence of officials the running of the New South railways. They allege that material can be dug up in the workshops, where i been buried in order to hide the incomDamascus. petence of certain officials.

210,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,In what group do you reckon yourself ?,48
211,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Not the particular silly question. group the honourable member is' in , anyhow. I would sooner be in either of the two mentioned by the Prime Minister than in the one with which the honourable member is allied. I , too, believe there has been a conspiracy, just as I believe 'that Mr Fuller, the Acting Premier of New South Wales, was right when he stated that there was a strike promotion committee in New South Wales. I think, however, that both Mr Fuller and the Prime Minister know more about the strike promotion committee, and the conspiracy to cause this general upheaval, than any other men in ' Australia. I believe that this upheaval is a direct result of the conscription agitation in Australia - that it is the result of the. failure to secure conscription, not for the purpose of winning the war in Europe, but for the purpose of "" w in n in g the w a r "" against labour in Australia by diluting skilled labour and bringing down the strength of the industrial organizations. That, in my opinion, was the real purpose of asking the people to vote for conscription. Ever since that conscription campaign failed, there has been a newspaper campaign against' the unions in Australia. The people have been told that the insatiable demands of labour must be met by organization on the part of employers-that the cessations of work from time to time will have to stop, and that labour must be taught that it does not rule the country. That is the-kind of business that has been going on; and we have had the mouthpieces of the employers speaking in similar strain throughout the length and breadth of the land. Mr Beeby has, metaphorically speaking, been dragging his coat all around New South Wales, and inviting the unions to tread on the t a i l ; he has talked about the trend of industrial organization, and the development of one big union, which, according to him, will attempt to dictate to the Government of the country. Let me say, right here now, that the industries of the country intend to dictate to the Government of the country, because they intend to have the government of the country in their hands.",48

217,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"When I was in terrupted, I was speaking of those gentlemen who just now are trotting around » the country telling the people that there is a damnable conspiracy on the part of labour and certain inciters to revolution. Those gentlemen have been engaged in working up public feeling against labour ever since the failure of conscription to find approval. There is no doubt in my mind that the card system was introduced into the New South Wales railway workshops with the full knowledge of what the result would be. The interference with telegrams, not only at Broken Hill , but elsewhere, and also the labour interference with the letters and mails of . persons connected with the industrial and political movements of this country, show that there has been a conspiracy, but that conspiracy has been on the part of the employers of the country, and their agents. There never was a more damnable conspiracy than this conspiracy to force men out on strike against their will , and for the purpose of breaking down the labour organization.",48
218,Mr LAIRD SMITH,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,What proof have you of that?,48
219,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"What did Campbell, the secretary of the Farmers and Settlers Association, say in Sydney!

220,Mr BAYLEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,That was for defence; they were not attacking the men.,48
221,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Of course, no one would ever dream of charging the emthe ployers with making an attack on Labour ! It is always, we know, Labour that att h at i tacks the employers!

Yet these gentlemen pose as injured innocents who were taken unawares by this strike. It is a lie that there was any such conspiracy on the part of Labour; but there was a conspiracy the other side, when the conscription present issue failed, to repeat 'the result of maritime strike in Australia for the purning the war."" pose of downing Labour. Before this Parliament finishes its term I would hot be much surprised to see the electorates gerrymandered, if Labour is beaten,. to prevent Labour ever getting back to the Treasury benches. We know what is behind all this. We know that the hundreds of thousands of pounds that were spent on the election honourable members opposite have to be paid back somehow. We have heard down about the £4,000,000 that ithe new award, has cost the nastoral industry, and how a general uprising in Australia, if provoked, tions Act might have the effect of saving that money. We have heard a great deal about the 95 per cent, of honest, hardheaded working men, and the 5 per cent, of walking delegates, and so forth , though I was glad to hear from the M i ister for the Navy today that the 5 per cent, has risen to 25 per cent.",49

Time after time that Labour newspaper has been persecuted for what it has published, and I need go no further for-an illustration that "" Jack "" Brookfield, the much-persecuted member for Sturt in tha New South Wales Parthe liament, who has been most unfairly treated throughout the country. Again, about f if t y odd men have been arrested at Broken Hill , some thirty of them under the Unlawfu l Associations 'The charge in many of the cases would take half-an-hour to read; and it is hard to say where it was dug up, if not the dark ages. A remarkable feature of these proceedings is that the men who have made themselves most obnoxious to the Broken Hill mining companies in times industrial peace are singled out for proseassure cution in times of industrial trouble. whole conduct of the fight-the non-interference of the Federal Adminisfere tration, and its actual interference on side of the employers-show s that there is a conspiracy to "" d o w n "" Labour, smash the unions, and afterwards, I supintroduced, pose, to gerrymander the electorates order to prevent Labour ever getting into power again. This would give the other side another quarter of a century i session of the coercive powers of the try, and enable them to impede the growth and development of the industrial movement-to reduce Labour to the im - a sweating system. potent state in which it found itself after the 1890 strike. That is the scheme, and that is what the people of the country .will wake up to if we are allowed put our side. We are not now allowed do that. The censorship established to win the war has been used for the purpose of breaking Labour. The Government have behind them the moneyed interest, press, and every public agency, and also the War Precautions Act ready for the dividual outside Parliament who opens his mouth for the purpose of telling lic the truth . I do not believe that the Prime Minister or those who sit behind him wish to intervene. I believe that Mr . Beeby, Mr Fuller, the Prime Minister, and the Federal Ministry generally, know very well the full facts of the case nexion with this industrial trouble. They are no doubt a very happy family. There will be no interference on the part of Commonwealth Government, or any action taken by them, towards bringing this flict to a speedy termination. They are out to "" wallop "" Labour as speedily and effectively as they can. The opportunity given to us today to ventilate facts w do little more than allow us to express our feelings in regard to the attitude Government - Never was there a more hypocritical attitude taken' up by any Government, On the one hand they are pretending to be anxious to intervene, and on the other hand they are helping Act . the .enemies of Labour.",49

The people of Austhe tralia realise that when the servants of a Democracy go out on strike on no better and pretext than that a card system has been there is no need for interferi n ence. Bather do they hold that these men should be brought to the realization that it is their duty to return to work. n posWhat is the card system against which counthese men have rebelled? Mention has been made of the Taylor system. The Leader of the Opposition stigmatized it as Mr . WEST - It is nothing else.",50

236,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Late r on you will find that I have got a word to say against it .,50
237,Mr BAYLEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"The honourable member's reading has shown him what the the Taylor system really means. When we speak of the Taylor .system, we have in in - our minds a number of systems which have been introduced more particularly in the pubthe United States of America.",50
238,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"The Taylor system is a clear and distinct system by itself. Mr BAYLEY , - That is so, but there is also the Gantt system, and there are others. They have all sprung out of the in conTaylor system, which was introduced in the United States of America in 1880 by Mr Taylor, an engineer in Philadelphia. the It struck Mr Taylor that much of the labour being performed by the workmen conin the United States of America was wasted, and he asked himself whether iti was not possible to apply scientific management to the utilization of that labour. ill The Labour leaders in the United States of America opposed the system. I take of it that ithey did so for the same reason that actuates our Labour leaders in opposing its introduction here. Mr Fenton,-How many men working under that system in America?",50
239,Mr BAYLEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I suppose that there are at least 50,000 skilled workmen workbeen ing under that system.",51
240,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"The number is more likely to be 2,000,000.",51
241,Mr BAYLEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"The population United States of America is about 100,000,000. If we divide that number by two we get 50,000,000, and if divide that 50,000,000 by five we arrive at 10,000,000, a fair proportion of which on still another pretext. is 50,000. That is about, the number men who are devoting their time to branches of industry in which the Taylor downed their tools. system may be successfully employed.",51

243,Mr BAYLEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"No . That may be been declared '-' black."" the attitude of the leaders of Labour in America, but the rank and file, the men who have been employed in institutions where 'the Taylor system has been in are vogue,-are one and all for it . In 1911, When a strike took place in one of the largest arsenals in the United States America the leaders of the men endeain voured to induce them to remain out on strike until the Taylor system had been abolished, but they kept the meu out privations. for a few days only. No sooner did the men find out that the abolition of this system was the sole bone of - contention than they returned to work. Why are the leaders of labour opposed to this tem? They oppose it because they find that its introduction weakens their hold upon the men. Every person admits that trade unionism has worked wonders for are out on strike today. the working man all over the world. I has resulted in increasedwages, and in improved working conditions.",51
244,Mr FINLAYSON,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,They have had to be fought for every inch of the way.,51
245,Mr BAYLEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Yes . That was the sole reason for .the springing up of trade unionism; but men who have been ema ployed in institutions where the Taylor system has been in force find that autothat matically, as a result of the system, in creased wages have resulted, and working conditions have improved. It is one of the axioms of the Taylor system that there must be improved working condisome tions in order to put it into operation. Here we find that on the pretext of the introduction of the card system into the are railway workshops at Randwick the whole industrial fabric of Australia is threatened, and the National Government has asked to intervene; but the onus is upon the men who have gone out, and upon those who are advising them to remain oub until the matter is taken under of the review. The railway men at Randwick went out on strike on one pretext. The wharf lumpers in Melbourne went out on we strike on another pretext. The men on the east-west railway went out on strike The Minister of for the Navy has told us this afternoon the that the men at Cockatoo Island have For what reason ?

248,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Melbourne) [5.47] I hate war, and the next thing I hate is strike. I have never advocated a strike; but my memory and my reading tell me during the long and painful war of - industrial progress, whenever a strike has been declared, there was always some reason for it . Therefore, when a strike is declared, knowing that there must be grievance to be remedied, I am with the strikers, and particularly to help the women and children. Behind every soldier are the women and children who suffer from a war, and equally behind every striker are the women and children who suffer from a strike. When I fought for adult suffrage I did hope that when every adult man and woman had a vote there would be no more strikes. I have Deen disillusioned. I regret to say that in the last fight the all-powerful financial institutions,"" backed up by the great powers of the press, gave the combined party which occupies the Ministerial Benches the huge majority which it secured.",51
249,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.] - Dr MALONEY - I have been in formed that some member on the other side intends to make a record of the time that I spend in this chamber. I care little for that. This building is situated in the middle of my constituency, and I am therefore frequently called out of the chamber to interview constituents who send in their cards to me, and whom it is my duty to see. When interrupted by the call for a quorum, I was saying that I hate war, and next to war, I hate a strike, because behind the striker, as behind the soldier, I see the woman and the child. I thought that when woman was given the right to vote, strikes would cease, but in that I was deceived. Since the last election, I have recognised that f t is necessary that the men .shall be as independent as the capitalists. The worker has never been in a position to meet the capitalist on equal terms. K in g Starvation, K in g Misery, K in g Penury always help the capitalist; it is nob a fair fight. Tho honourable member for Flinders, when Premier of Victoria, introduced into this chamber the most terrible Coercion Bill ever proposed in a British Parliament; thati proposed by the Gladstone Government on the day that the poor bodies of Burke and Cavendish were buried, when one could nob wonder at the introduction of a severe measure, did not equal it . I said then, as I say now, that, law or no law, I shall, so far as I , c a n , help the women and children in 'their need. I do not care a snap of the fingers for what the Government may do to prevent it"". _.As I said then, I say now, "" GaoT or no gaol, I am wilting to do what I can for them."" Bussia, by a magnificent effort, freed 21,000,000 slaves without the loss single life, but in this accursed in dustrial trouble one man has already been shot - A newspaper which is strongly opposing labour at the present time, the .Sydney Sunday Times, publishes a photograph of thati man s funeral (procession. In it , men are to be seen marching four abreast to do honour to their dead comrade. I ask honourable members if they can expect the honour of such a funeral. Daniel O'Connell once said that "" nothing in this world was worth the loss of a drop of blood."" I agree with him. I glory in life, and could not believe in a Creator if I did not. It is infamous thati the head of the Government! does not take action in the in terests of the women and children, and of the men, too, who are suffering because of the strike. The Prime Minister, when asked the other day what was the meaning of the card system, said that he did not know. He has had long experience of unionism. Men and women collected their pennies, and psid him well-as he deserved to be paid-for what he did for them. Surely during his connection with unions, he learned something of the card system. An honourable member opposite said that) I had studied it only during the last few days, but the quotation that I made regarding it was from a book published in 1904, and that) was not the first book from which I gained knowledge of it. Possibly Mr Taylor was a scientific observer and inquirer, who never thought that his system would be misused by the "" kind employer,"" to use the phrase of the late Mr Ord, who, in a report on the apprentice system, said that the ' ' k in d employer"" paid his apprentice half-acrown on Saturday and collected it from, him again on the following Monday. Let ' me give an instance of the way in which scientific methods have been abused. As honourable members know, the ingots of pig iron are very heavy and fairl y large. A man of magnificent physique, a phenomenal man, only to be equalled by such another as was tb be seen in the picture "" Cabiria,"" was put to work at moving pig iron. His movements were studied and corrected, and after a month's training, it was found bhat ""he could move 48 tons, whereas the average weight previously handled was 12 tons. That was the result of scientific methods, but the employers used the information as of a to what was possible by requiring the shifting of 24 tons of pig iron. sweating was brought about by the application of scientific principles. Foster Fraser is a keen observer-reader s of his books do not agree with him in all his statements-bu t I should like to read Borne of his observations regarding American methods for honourable members to take as they may think fit. I have a very large acquaintance with Americans who have visited this country, and have had the honour of knowing every American Consul who has been in Melbourne over a very long period of years. Foster Fraser says on page 48 of his book, Industrial 'AmericaBut it is the American idea that the harder a man works the harder he can work, and working under a stimulus like this, an American working man will often do double, and even treble, the work of a British working man, but though it is at an increased wage, it is not a double or treble wage, and that is where the American manufacturer scores. He says that an English workman will not hurry, bub that he has seen an American workman run to get a hammer. Yet after twelve months the English workman in America will acquire the hustling methods of the American workman. Mr . Fraser saysI t is a hard system-no t so hard at Baldwin's, - for Baldwin's among American works is almost an ideal place. Baldwin's is a big engineering works, but they see there that they get every ounce of effort that the men can give during the ten hours that they work each day. Mr Foster Fraser says- ' Where are your elderly workmen, I asked a Philadelphian manufacturer once, twice, three times? At the* third time he opened his cigar case. With a careless smile he said, "" Have a smoke, and we'll take a car ride along to the cemetery."" Those who will take the trouble to search the American medical journals-the y are not so well indexed as the English publications-wil l find that the average life of the worker is less in America than in England.",52
250,Mr BAYLEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"If that were markedly so, the life assurance companies would alter their rates accordingly, and they have not done that.",53
251,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The workers cannot afford to insure.,53
252,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Mr Foster Fraser says The majority of the companies will not promote a man to engine-driver over the age of twenty-seven. If by that age he has not Thus proved his ability to drive an engine, he must stop as fireman or something even lower. Mr To say that the men out on strike are revolutionists and unpatriotic is proved an untruth by the fact that the Randwick union has subscribed £160,000 to patriotic funds. It is all . very well to ask, "" What about the men at the Front ?"" I know how the voting there was faked. The soldiers never had a chance to give a fair vote. Let me read from a letter which I received this very day. I see by a paper that Webster made a speech Mr from the Post Office that they may put the referendum again before the people. Well, all I can say is that Hughes and his mob will get a shock. I - suppose they are going on the result of the elections; but a great many of the soldiers took no interest in it, and voted any way, and some said "" Good old Billy Hughes "" - w e say "" old Billy Hughes."" - Any way, I will bet my last shilling the .majority for conscription did not come from the boys in the firing line. Of course, the ANZACs in London and in base depdts, with good jobs, they might vote for it, but not the boys in the front line. That is only a synopsis of many letters I am receiving. I * have one, which I shall show to any honourable member who wishes to see it , signed by no less than eighteen men of the 1st Battalion in France. Members on this side have had to fight against everything; even the blasphemy of vile religious bigotry has been uttered from the pulpits. Archdeacon Hindley had the baseness to lie about me in the pulpit of the House of God. He accused me, amongst others, of possibly participating in an address to the Kaiser. No one has spoken more strongly against the Kaiser than I have. I have said at meetings which I have addressed in furtherance of voluntary enlistment that the day had come when not only should men give their lives, but the men who had caused the workers to die should pay the penalty, and I hoped that the Kaiser and every kinglet and princelet who had caused the war would be hung in the streets of Berlin. Are such words as those likely to be welcomed by the Kaiser? I would die willingly if I could cause that brutal destroyer of human l if e to disappear. And yet Archdeacon Hindley blasphemed and lied about me in the pulpit. When such statements are made in the House of God, it is no wonder that Mr E r i c S. L . Murray, of Ballarat, wrote this letter in tendering his resignation as a vice-president of the Protestant FederationI regret very much .to resign my position as one of the vice-presidents of the Protestant Federation. The fact is I will be no party to vile attacks on the members of other creeds, such as have been going on since the great movement began new movement has better ambitions than to engage in vilifying the Roman Catholic Church. Because we outnumber them in Australia is no reason why Protestant Federation parsons should try to stir up sectarian bitterness and strife. It is not enough fpr some people that our Empire is involved in the greatest war of all time; it is not enough that Australia is in the throes of internal strike trouble; but, like disloyal .persons, they use the Protestant Federation platform to abuse our fellow subjects of the King-thousand s of them at this moment under the Union Jack fighting for liberty and justice for all I just remember reading about the Irish ,priest in Flanders. He had been asked to speak to the Irish prisoners in the Kaiser's interests. After service he turned to them, and said, "" Boys, I have been asked to speak to you to fight for Germany; but, in the name of God, I beseech you to be true to your own King, your own flag."" I absolutely decline to be associated in the Protestant Federation with those who, in my opinion, are hindering recruiting and playing into the hands of ourenemies. Their speeches and sermons should be severely censored, and they should be interned as dangerous firebrands. All honour to Mr Murray for expressing those sentiments. If there is anything vile on God's earth, it is blasphemous falsehoods in the pulpit of the House of God. I remind honourable members that a large block of land in Collins-street was given to the Anglican Church, of which Archdeacon Hindley is an officer, as a site for a house of worship. On that land there was first built a* brewery, and the fumes of beer almost enshrouded the House of God. But that was not sufficient. James Service and Company, wine and spirit merchants, next erected preo mises there, and the church was then clouded in the fumes of wine, beer, and spirits. Not satisfied with that, the money changers were allowed to build about the temple of God, and in the end the church, from foundation to steeple, was hidden by the weeds, and disappeared. That land, having been given for the erection of a church for the worship of. God, I say, should be given back to the State, and I raised my voice in the State Parliament in protest against the transaction. Was it, not said that the House of God should be founded on a rock? The church authorities did not believe there was a rock on that site, so they shifted the church. The present strike is engineered by Mr . Fuller, who was once an honoured Cabinet Minister of the Commonwealth. Surely the Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honorablo member does not believe that he engineered that strike?",53
253,Mr BAMFORD,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,He was one of the gentlest men who was ever in the House.,54
254,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I found him a gentleman, but he was willing to go into the witness-box and lie. He was one of eleven witnesses, ten of whom were im prisoned for perjury and conspiracy. When I waited as a deputation upon nations. John Murray, who was then Premier of Victoria, in order to ask that the law should be honoured, he, to his honour, said, "" In God's name, how is it Fuller escaped imprisonment as well ?"" Let honourable members read the summing up of Mr Justice Hodges in the Harper-Ronald case.. It had been said that a filthy story had been told by the Rev. Mr Ronald. Judge Hodges asked Mr Fuller, "" What were the words?"" Mr Fuller answered, "" I do not remember, but the story was a w f u l . "" "" Judge Hodges said, "" That is for me and the jury to say. What were the words?"" Mr Fuller replied, "" I do not remember."" He was then asked, "" Do you deny that you stated that you never heard Mr Ronald make that statement?"" and he said, "" If that has been sworn, I will not deny it . "" I need say no more than to ask honourable members to read the Judge's summing up to the jury . I regret that Mr Holman, clever man as he is, and a political. opponent of mine, is absent from Australia at this time, because if he had been present I do not think the strike would have occurred. I desire to say a few words about the honourable member for Illawarra. I remember on one occasion when I went into the office of the Worker there was industrial turmoil , and the honourable member said, "" We must do everything we can for the strikers."" I said to him, "" Is the strike j u s t ? "" He replied, "" N e v e r m in d; we must do everything we can for them."" When he was addressing the House and accusing the strikers of being led by the Industrial Workers of the World and the Socialists, I asked him , ""How long ago is that?"" He said, "" Seven years."" The honourable member has then been for five years out of the seven advocating assistance to the same people as are pn strike today; for he has not been out of the Worker office for more than about a year. The honourable member has said that this strike would not have occurred but for the curse of conscription. The party now in power - tried to force that curse upon the people of Australia, and they will try to do it again. I challenge them to do it . We shall hear then what, the people will say, and the men at the Pront will be able to record a fairer vote than was recorded on the occasion of the last referendum - N/oes . . I had thought that honourable members would have been kept loyal to their party by means of the pledge. . The pledge has proved to be no good, and there is only one thing which we can do to stop strikes in future. There may be a comparatively small minority of members cruel and brutal enough to desire a strike, but the great majority of members on both sides have no wish for such a calamity. The reform to which I wish to see effect given is the introduction of the referendum, initiative, and recall. W it h that system in operation honourable members will not be so ready to change their opinions. We have heard talk about the slowing down practices of the workers. Let honourable members look at the beautiful Queen's H all in this building. There is bad workmanship in it , and .bad contracting. The walls have been painted to hide the cracks. That contractor sacked the man who refused to pass bad plaster. Every stone in the secon 1 story of the Law Courts, the-emblem of justice, is rotten, What is the history of the erection of that building? The model stone disappeared, and the Government offered a reward of £500 and the contractor a reward of £50. The stone weighed about a quarter of a ton, and could not have been carried away in a waistcoat pocket, but as soon as it disappeared the contractor began to use bad stone. In the second story nearly every stone is spotted like those spotted dogs that used to follow carriages. Yet honourable members talk about slowing . down. . What about robbing the country of hundreds of thousands of pounds in order to make bigger profits? The contract for those Law Courts was an infamy and a disgrace, as honourable members will see if they look at the building. Motion (by Mr MASSYGREENE ) proposedTliat the debate be now adjourned.",54

This is the fourth War Loan Appropriation Bill. The first was for £20,000,000. the second for £18,000,000, and the third for £50,000,000- a total of £88,000,000. The third Loan Bill for £50,000,000 was introduced to this House on the 20 th May, 1916, without any speech. This Bill is to authorize the raising and expending of £80,000,000 for war purposes. The total amount at present authorized to be raised is £88,000,000, of which approximately £82;000,000 has been raised. A further sum of £6,000,000 may therefore be raised under the Acts already passed. The following are particulars of our war expenditure:War Expenditure out of Loan and Revenue up to 30th June, 1918.

The estimated expenditure by the B r i tish Government in respect of the Australian Imperial Force up to 30th June, 1917, is £28,500,000, and up to the 30th June, 1918, a further .amount of £29,750,000. Included in the above war expenditure of £212,741,509 is an amount of £2,850,000 for advances to the States for the construction and erection of silos for wheat storage, and an amount of £2,000,000 to be advanced to the States for the repatriation of returned soldiers. On the 30th June last the balance of war loan moneys unexpended was The instalments to be received after the 30th June, 1917, in respect of the fourth war loan issued in February last amount to . . 6,187,668 Total loan moneys in hand or in sight at 30th June, 1917 .. £23,932,831 The estimated expenditure out of war loan in 1917-18 is .. £84,051,230 Deduct loan moneys in hand or in sight as above .. .. £3,932,831 Add amount which probably would be in hand on 30th June, 1918.. Total loans which apparently must be raised in 1917-18 .. . . £64,065,922 Even if this £64,000,000 were all borrowed during 1917-18, there would be an additional sum still outstanding of about £27,250,000 due to the British Government, which, however, it is not intended to pay during this financial year. The amount required for war loan expenditure, if everything were paid, would be about £91,000,000. Parliament is, however, asked for only £80,000,000 of authorization at the present time. It is proposed to at once issue the pros£ pectus of another war . loan for £20,000,000, maturing on the l 5 t h December, 1927, being two years later than previous war loans. 214,880,673 2,139,164 The conditions will be the same as for the previous four issues, viz., for approximately ten years at par, at 4 | per cent, interest, the interest being free of both Gommonwealth and State income taxes. . The Government is acting in complete accord with the financial institutions, which have promised their valuable assistance. It is believed that the new war loan will be very successful. The Government has given a good deal of consideration to the question whether it would be advisable to alter the terms and conditions for the future, pr to adhere to the terms and conditions of the former loans. We have decided to do £.s I have stated, namely, to adopt the same terms and conditions as previously. We propose to raise the money at 4£ per cent., which is cheaper than money is being raised in England for the States at the present time. The other day we raised A loan in England for £4,500,000, with interest at 5£ per cent., and the price of issue was £ 9 8 10s. It will be £17,745,163 seen, therefore, that we shall do far better in Australia than, in my opinion, we could do if we endeavoured to raise the money in England; indeed, we could not, in fact, raise money at the oresent time on the London market. ' Mr Fenton - What is the cost of raising the lo^an ?",55
259,Sir JOHNFORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I could not tell the honourable member off hand, but we have to consider underwriting and £60,118,399 other charges.",56
260,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Is it 3J per cent. 1 3,947,523 Sir JOHN FORREST - Not so much as that, though we have to pay l per 1 cent, for underwriting, 12s. 6d. composition duty, and for the advertising. W « have a war certificate scheme in force, which is working very satisfactorily, inasmuch as by this means about £2,000,000 has already been raised for war purposes. The loan now proposed is ° for war purposes, and. war purposes only. I am sorry that my voice is not sufficiently strong to enable me to speak longer with jEiny comfort or convenience to myself, but I think I have explained the main features of the measure; and I shall be able to give any further information desired by honourable members. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported.",56
261,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Swan-Trea surer) [8.58] - I move That the Standing Orders be suspended to enable the remaining stages to be passed without delay. We hope to be able to issue this prospectus on Saturday, if honourable members will .assist in putting the Bill through as soon as possible. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution adopted. Ordered That Sir John Forrest and Mr Joseph Cook do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Sir JOHN FORREST, and read a first time. Motion (by Sir JOHN FORREST) posedThat the Bill be now read a second time.  it that this Bill will commit us to pay 4£ per cent, interest on the total of £80,000,000, as well as to the exemption of investors in this loan from Federal and State income taxation on the interest earned by their investment. It may be looked upon as inconsistency on my part to raise objections to the proposal to exempt the interest earned by investors i u the Commonwealth war loans from income taxation, but the experience that I gained in connection with the last flotation convinced me of ,the inequality.of the system. Freedom from payment of income tax means nothing to the small men, but it means an enormous amount of money to the men who would otherwise be liable to pay income tax at the highest rate, and, instead of our borrowing the money at 4-§ per cent., it will really mean 5 per cent, in many instances, and in some cases as much as 6 per cent. I would much rather the Treasurer had asked us to agree to the payment of 5 per cent, interest, making the interest liable to income taxation. It would have been much fairer than the present system, which gives the big man so much advantage over the small man. Certainly the rate of in terest received by the big man is the same as that received by the small man, but, as the income tax rate on the highest grade of incomes is 6s. 3d. in the £ 1 , the Treasury will lose a considerable amount of revenue by the exemption from liabilit y to pay income tax of the interest earned by the big man on his investment in Commonwealth war loans. There is another way of looking at the matter. We have already borrowed £80,000,000 in Australia. That means that about one-twelfth of the available capital of the Commonwealth is not liable to the payment of income tax, and before we are through this war we will exhaust practically one-sixth of the area available for the taxation of income. It will i m pose a very much heavier burden on the remainder of that taxable area. In giving consideration to the matter of warsaving certificates, I fixed the rate of in terest at 5 per cent., and provided for no exemption from the payment of income taxation, for the very reasons that I am pronow advancing, but my successor has extended that freedom to those certificates, and the consequence is that the man who - I take puts £1,000 into the certificates derives a much greater advantage than does the man who invests £20 in them. I am quite satisfied that a little increase in the rate of interest would enable us to raise the whole of the money that we require for war purposes without there being any necessity to grant an exemption from income taxation; the taxation will create a very serious situation in the future. In any case, it would insure equality of treatment to those who subscribe to our loans. I feei sure that when we make allowance for the reduction in our income tax revenue, which would otherwise be paid by those large institutions that have put so much money into our war loans, we shall find that the actual rate of interest paid on our scrip is at least 6 per cent. I am anxious to know whether this authorization will commit us to float the full £80,000,000 with the freedom from liability to pay income tax, State and Federal, on the interest earned by^ investors.",57
262,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"That is the posal, though it is not in the Bill .  told us that he proposes to pay 4£ per cent, interest. I think he is making a mistake. Assuming that the war is over at the end of this financial year-thoug h there does not seem to be much prospect of it at present-ou r war indebtedness will be about £250,000,000, but it w i l two years after the war is over before we will have secured the return of our men. B y that time the result of this continued exemption of interest paid on our war loans from liability to income taxation will be to place a very much heavier burden on those who do not escape the payment of income taxation. Although I floated my loan on exactly the same terms as the Treasurer now proposes, I regard the step taken in the past as an unfortunate mistake. :",58
263,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"That would have been the time for the honourable member to have carried out his proposal.  reform in connection with the war saving certificates, but the right honourable gentleman altered it .",58
264,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Yes , the honourable member proposed to treat the poor man differently from the rich man.  have received equality of treatment, correct. which he does nob get under the present proposal. He gets very little, i any, advantage from the exemption owing from income taxation. On the other hand the rich man does get a big advantage from that freedom. the saving certificates we cater for man with £ 5 , £ 1 0 , or £ 2 0 to invest. Certainly a man can invest £1,000 those certificates, but the men we propose to reach are those who do not pay income taxation. Consequently, in nine cases out of ten the purchasers of war-saving tificates will derive no benefit from - the freedom from income taxation on the terest earned by them, but the man invests £1,000 in those certificates gets decided advantage from that exemption. - That advantage is more pronounced in the case of a man who can put £100,000 into the Commonwealth war loans. It means an exemption to the extent of 6s. 3d. in the £ 1 on the interest earned by that £100,000. pro- Sir JOHN FOBBEST - It is much more difficult to get money now than when the honourable member was Treasurer.  much more dimcult to raise taxation if we are to continue exempting the interest on the Commonwealth war loans from liability to pay income tax.  l take ber think thati the Government could float a loan if they made the conditions different from those of previous loans?  loan if they offered to pay interest at the rate of 5 per cent., or even if they offered to pay the British rate of 5£ per cent: It would be cheaper money than we will get at 4£ per cent -, with freedom from payment of income taxation. I have no doubti that we will get the money, but the trouble will be that the area available for taxation will continue to shrink under this process u n t i l we have a very limited number of income taxpayers.",58

266,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Capricornia) [9.12] - If am in great sympathy with the Treasurer to the fact that he is not able to speak with his usual vigour and clarity of voice. I was hoping that when he Under moved the second reading of the Bill he the would give some explanation as to why he is not carrying out the pledge made in by the Win-the-war party that they would make wealth bear its due share of the expenses of the war. Every one expected the Government! to come forward cerwith taxation proposals. I do not suppose there is any, person with a considerinable income who did not expect to be who called upon by the Treasurer to' pay a heavier taxation, but the right honourable gentleman has made no attempt to tax the general public except in respect of war profits. But before dealing with that question, let me say that the Treasurer has been very careless in regard to financial matters. His first proposal that we should raise £100,000,000.",58
267,Sir JOHN FOBREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Who said that*,59
268,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"He brought down a tion message from the Governor General redo commending the raising of £100,000,000, bub within a month he has reduced the amount to £80,000,000. In a Financial .Statement made on the 6th March, the Treasurer referred to the serious financial, position in which Australia was, ancl in effect saidThe position in 1917-18 may be roughly out as follows:-The shortage of revenue 1917-18, £2,634,000; additional revenue required for interest and sinking fund for loans and war pensions, £6,800,000; increase invalid and old-age pensions, £250,000. Total additional moneys required, £9,684,000. He also saidIn this £9,684,000, there is no provision for interest and sinking fund on any loans may be raised for new Federal railways and other works. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers) asked, "" How is it proposed to raise the £1,000,000 required tion purposes?"" To that the Treasurer repliedI shall deal with that matter at a later needed ? stage. One might imagine that the right honorthat able gentleman had had a legal training. That is the answer that a lawyer always gives when a question is addressed to h in this House. He c o n t in u e d It would be unwise for any Treasurer what he is going to do in order to finance year that has not arrived. . . . If the items of revenue which now exist maintain their probably £5,000,000 will cover the additional revenue which must be obtained in 1917-18. The manner in which so much more money be raised will have to be decided upon, is undesirable to indicate at the present how it can be done. Now we discover how the Treasurer prohe poses to raise the additional money needed to meet the heavy expenditure of the 1917-18. He proposes to take £1,000,000 from war-time profits taxation, and to i pose a class tax on the single men who, various reasons, have not gone to the war. We have a right to look at this question as it affects our personal reputation comfort as politicians. Most of us, presume, will be here for a year more, at least. There never was a time borrow £80,000,000. in the history of this country when people were more prepared than they at present to pay taxation. The right was honourable member for Swan (Sir John Forrest) proposes to postpone his plain duty in regard to the imposition of taxau n t i l after the war, although, if we not avail ourselves now of the public spirit of the community, and its sympathy with those who are managing its affairs, and tax the public to the l i m it that they are prepared to pay, we shall haye great difficulty after the war in getting the people to contribute the money necessary for the government of the country. They will set ask, "" Why did not you tax us in war in time? Y o u ask U3 for money now in a war time of peace, when the expenditure canin not be so great as in war time . "" The Treasurer will make it difficult for the politicians w£o will govern the country in the future. MT . JOSEPH COOK - Is it the honourable that member's point that we should have a heavier taxation now?",59
269,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Yes .,59
270,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Whether it be for repatrianeeded or not ?,59
271,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Does the honourable member for Kooyong deny that it is - Sir ROBERT BEST - The Treasurer says it is not-needed immediately.,59
272,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"He told us in March last i m that we required £9,684,000 to meet our obligations, but that if the revenue kept to say up to what it was, we should need only a £5,000,000. He knows that the Customs .yield revenue has fallen off, and may decrease by £2,000,000 this year, because of the shortage of the shipping, the restriction on can importation, and for other reasons. My as it argument is that the public is ready to time pay taxation. Cannot the Treasurer propose an increase in the income tax? If postpones taxation, he will make it very difficult for f u t u re Treasurers and year members of Parliament; and we all have to take our share of responsibility for the m - imposition of taxation. We are entitled for to ask posterity to bear its part, but we ought not to load on to it services which should be paid out of current revenue. I and ask honourable members to consider what I it is that the Treasurer proposes to do or two with this loan money. ' He wishes to Of this sum, the £5,000 is to be spent on the adminisare tration of the Australian Repatriation Fund.

273,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"If it is a mistake, that goes to show that there has been great carelessness on the part of some one re-, sponsible for the allotment of this £80,000,000. Another item on which the loan money is to be spent is the printin g of the Commonweplth Manual of Emergency Legislation. That the Treasurer proposes to pay out of loan to avoid taxLug the general public, including himself.",60
274,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Do not put it in that way.,60
275,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I shall deal with the right honourable gentleman as tenderly as I can. He said the other day, when we spoke of the rich people in the community being richer since the war, that he was not half as well off now as before the war.",60
276,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I did not say that that was due to the war.,60
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Will the honourable member tell us what he put down for repatriation administration last year, and from what fund he proposed to provide the money ?",60
278,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The honourable gentleman succeeded in outing me before I had time to consider the Estimates of last year.,60
279,Sir ROBERT BEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The member resigned.,60
280,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I had no other course open to me, holding the views that I did.",60
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"The sum of £5,000 is put down for this year, and last year £4,300 was provided.",60
282,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"That was not my appropriation. I had not time to deal with more than two or three pages of the Estimates. Our children will have to pay back the £SO,000,000 which it is now proposed to borrow. Yet the Treasurer proposes to apply £1,200 of the borrowed money to the press cable service, which supplies news for members of the Expeditionary Forces. That is the news sent to the soldiers at the Front, including the one-sided accounts supplied to' assist the Win-the-war party and to smash up the Labour party.",60
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Las t year amount was £742.,60
284,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,That was. not arranged for in my time.,60
285,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The honourable member is always talking about what he did when in office.,60
286,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I am saying now what I did not do. Then £100 is put down to pay for a "" Conference to settle returned soldiers."" This, I suppose, is one of the Conferences which the Prime Minister calls for so freely. If any one approaches him about any matter, he says, "" I should like to see a deputation regarding the matter, and it must be a representative one. I am not going to deal with two or three persons only."" The other day, when the Tasmanian and Victorian f r u it growers met him , he wished to know where were the representatives from the other States. H is office must be magnified as much as possible, and, therefore, there must be representatives from every State. This costs money, and posterity is to be asked to pay the cost of this Conference for the settlement .of returned soldiers. The loan money is to be spent also on a Royal Oommission to inquire into the Navy and Defence administration. Surely the cost of such an investigation should be met out of the current revenue. What is the matter with the administration that .the inquiry is necessary?",60
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Thos e engaged in the investigation urgently recommend the appointment of six additional clerks. honourable They say that the office is undermanned.,60
288,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,We are charging the Loan Fund with expenditure connected with the war.,60
289,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,How can this be war expenditure? Is posterity to pay for the incapacity of men in the Defence Department who have failed to properly perform the work of accountants? The Government.is always appointing Royal Commissions. Three thousand pounds is to be taken out of loan money to pay for an inquiry into the keeping of the Defence Department's accounts ,60
290,Mr HEITMANN,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The honourable member complained just now of the expenditure of loan money on administration. He must know that that is not unusual. 1,60
291,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Surely an inquiry as to the manner in which accounts are kept, and to ascertain why money was drawn the for a regiment which di d not exist, ought not to come out of Loan Fund.",60
292,Sir JOHN PORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The procedure has not been altered since the honourable member was Treasurer.,61
293,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"If the Treasurer will look through the papers, he will see that I did my best to secure the dismissal from the Defence Department of a man who had been guilty of' irregularities.",61
294,Sir JOHN PORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The charging of money ? war expenditure to loan has not been altered since the honourable member was the Treasury. He did the same thing we are doing.,61
295,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I did what I could to get the Defence Department run properly.,61
296,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,We all do that.,61
297,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"But the Treasurer penditure. wishes posterity to pay for the expense the Royal Commissions appointed to i quire into defalcations. I eome now to some further items which, in my opinion, should be met out of current revenue. Honourable members on both sides will agree that if we, as a Commonwealth, wish to be generous to those whom we emwhile I was in office. ploy, we ought to be generous out of our own money, and should not raise loan money for the purpose. I ask honourable members to look at the item, "" Premiums on life assurance policies of Commonwealth public servants who are members of the Expeditionary Forces, including contrithe butions to Trust Funds, officers' assurof ance account, £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 . "" We are doing something for our civil servants which few people will be prepared to When members of our - Public Service go to the Front, we undertake to pay the premiums on their life insurance policies. That is a generous action. We are not doing it for Tom, Dick or Harry in private employment, but only for our own employees; but we are paying for that vice out of loan funds which somebody coming after us will have to repay.",61
298,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Who began this policy ? ,61
299,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The Treasurer will find that no loan money was used for that purpose by any previous Government.,61
300,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,This expenditure was approved of before I took office.,61
301,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Amongs t other so-called war. services, I find an item, "" Universal military training (Citizen Forces), £100,000."" Whether we are at war or not, we shall have to pay for the training of our Citizen Forces.",61
302,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I thin k that money is for Citizen Forces who were mobilized for special service.,61
303,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Anothe r item which appears amongst war services is £200 towards the compilation of the history of Australia's share in the war. ,61
304,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I am not sure, bu t I in think Mr Bean is the compiler of the as history. There is £7,319 provided as a '' payment to the Commonwealth Bank, Melbourne, for credit to the Egyptian Canteen Account (to be recovered)."" That is like a number of other items which will be found in the war loan exThere is, for instance, the of item of £70,000 in connection with the n - manufacture and purchase of munitions for the British Government, portion of which is t b be recovered. Is the Treasurer keeping track of those items?  pended by the Commonwealth on behalf of the Indian Government was paid back",61
305,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"We used to buy for the British and Indian Governments out of ordinary revenue, and recover the money. What I desire to know is : whether the money expended in buying goods for the British Government, or the payment to Commonwealth Bank for the credit the Egyptian Canteen Account, will be paid into ordinary revenue, when it is repaid, or whether it will go towards the challenge. redemption of our loans?",61
306,Sir JOH NFORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"If it comes from Loan Account, it must go back to Loan Account; there is no doubt about that.",61
307,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I hope that will happen. The Treasurer has said that certain items of administration were paid for out of serloan during my administration. I submit that that statement is not correct. The Treasurer proposes to pay out of Loan Account the expenses of the administration of the W a r Precautions (Prices) Regulations. In the year 1915-16 that service was paid for out of revenue. The"" printing of the Commonwealth Manual of Emergency Legislation was also paid for out of revenue, and only since the present Treasurer came into office has the practice of charging these items to loan pay been instituted. The Labour Government called a conference in connection with the settlement on the land of returned soldiers in 1915-16, and paid £ 4 7 in that connection, and for premiums on the life assurance policies of civil servants at the Front £10,590, both out of revenue. The present Treasurer proposes to pay for such services out of the £80,000,000 which he wishes to borrow.",61
308,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I know change in the system since I came into office.,62
309,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"The expenses of the Federal Parliamentary W a r Committee, including the salary of the secretary to the Honorary Organizer, were previously paid out of revenue. This item in 1915-16 absorbed £2,510, and I am in terested to know how the Federal Parliamentary War' Committee incurred that expenditure.  on the State recruiting committees. Federal Committee received none of the money ",62
310,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I believe the major tion of the expenditure was in connection with the engagement of the Hon. J . C. Watson as Honorary Organizer. I have from loans. often wondered why it was necessary to appoint Mr Watson adviser to the Government Federal Parliamentary War Committee.,62
311,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"He travelled all over the country, and acted in an rary capacity.",62
312,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Yes , in an honorary pacity, but received £ 2 2s. per day travelling expenses, in addition to railof way fares, which is more than he received as manager of the Labour paper which he never started.  was Treasurer at that time.",62

HonTreasurer orable members must recollect that I in office only twelve months, and the Treaheading £22,622 out of revenue. surer's job is a big one if he is to deavour to keep track of the £80,000,000 or £90,000,000 expended by the Comin monwealth on war and ordinary services. It is true that Mr Watson travelled all over the country, but he seems to have been engaged in ascertaining the names of gentlemen who were prepared to sell land to the Commonwealth for the settlewhich ment of returned soldiers. The Labour Government paid out of revenue for the war census £57,444. The present Governto ment propose that any further expendivided ture of the kind shall be paid for out loan moneys [67] Sir JOH N FOBBEST - Where did I state that?",62
314,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"That matter comes under the control of the Prime Minister.

315,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,That is not chargeable to loan.,62

317,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Is the honourable member taking the figures for 1916-17-18 ?,63
318,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I am showing what items we paid out of revenue in 1915-16. - Sir JOHN FORREST - What honourable member to say in regard to payments made in 1916-17?,63
319,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,They have nothing to with me. They were made by the W i the-war Government.,63
320,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,We did not come into power until February of this year.,63
321,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"The present Minister and his National party came into power on 14th February, 1916.",63
322,Mr HEITMANN,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,We r e nob tEe Estimonopoly mates for 1916-17 prepared by the honas orable member for Capricornia ?,63
323,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"For a young member the honourable member displays extrapages ordinary audacity. It is true that had experience in other Parliaments, he is talking of something that he knows nothing about. I have told the House Wales, on more than one occasion that I had opportunity to go through the Estimates acres; South Australia, 114.000 000 acres; for 1916-17, and he ought to accept, denial. If he is not prepared to let him put a question on the notice paper, and ascertain from the Treasury officials whether I went through the Estivided mates for 19.16-17. The Prime returned from England on 10th August, 1916, and nothing but turmoil followed. There has, indeed, been nothing but moil in the political arena of the monwealth ever since he returned from the Old Country, where he lost his head owing to the applause showered upon and because of the fact, possibly, that was invited to dine in the pink room, to sleep in the blue room.",63
324,Mr HEITMANN,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,This is sour grapes.,63
325,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Not at all.,63
326,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"This is very interesting, but does the honourable member propose to connect it with the question before the Chair ?",63
327,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"The Labour party can only be held responsible for the Estimates for 1915-16. In that year we paid out of revenue £46,500 in respect of the '' Citizen Naval Forces, Royal Australian Naval Reserve pay,"" but the Treasurer this year proposes under that heading to pay £62,750 out of loan. "" Contingencies under the control of the N a v y , "" 'which may mean anything, are to be paid out of loan to the extent of £19,000, and "" Medical services,"" representing an estimated expenditure of £7,000, are also to be paid out of loan. We paid both items out of revenue. I could go on has the multiplying these items, but I shall not weary the Committee by doing so. I come now to the question of the do £2,000,000 that we proposed to raise by n - way of loan for the settlement of returned soldiers. I fail to see how we could raise by way of taxation the large sums that will be required for the rePrime patriation of our soldiers, and especially to settle them on the land. The general public will be surprised to learn that land is nearly as great in Australia it is in the United Kingdom. In support of this statement. I would refer honourable members to' the figures given at 264-5-6-7-8-9 of the last edition of he has the Commonwealth Year-Book. It is but there shown that the unoccupied lands of Australia are as follows:-Ne w South 17,000,000 acres; Victoria, no 11,000,000 acres; Queensland. 65,000.000 t my Western Australia, 418,000,000 acres;' do so, and Tasmania, 8,744,000 acres.",63
328,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I would remind the honourable member that we have pro£170,000 for universal training out Minister of revenue this year.",63
329,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,That is so.,63
330,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The honourable turmember would lead the House to believe Comthat the whole of the cost under that heading is charged by us to loan account.,63
331,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"No ; I have said that a him, portion is being paid out of revenue. he Some arbitrary method of splitting up and these items must have been adopted. The whole thing is in keeping with the Treasurer's scheme not to impose any additional taxation at present but to meet his requirements out of loan moneys. should not be necessary for the Commonour wealth to raise the vast sum-£22,000,00 - whic h they propose to lend to the States for the purpose of purchasing land, ing advances to returned soldiers, and settling them on the land.",63
332,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"The final estimate reached £60,000,000.",64
333,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Quite so. In this countax try of ours, which is larger than Europe, and which has a population of only 5,000,000, it should not be necessary the State Governments to repurchase estates on which to settle returned solline to obtain land. diers. I submit that it is not. Mr. Knibbs shows that in New South Wales there are 39,825,380 acres alienated, 18,837,281 acres in process of alienation, and 127,000,000 acres representing leases under Government Departments. I grant that a great deal of the 17,000,000 of unalienated land in New South Wales may consist of stony ridges or. mountainof ous country, on which we could not hope to settle any one.",64
334,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The trouble is that we cannot settle these men on the map of Australia.,64
335,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"That is so. They must be settled on land convenient to railway systems. In Viotoria there are 24,000,000 acres alienated, 7,000,000 acres in process of alienation, and 13,000,000 acres under lease, while the area unoccupied 11,000,000 acres. I should, weary honourable members if I gave figures for all the States, but a reference to them will show that in eaoh State idle. there are immen'se areas held under lease. Certain companies hold huge areas member under lease, which ought to revert to the Government if the terms of these leases were carried out. is generally a clause in these leases viding that, after the lapse of a tain number of years, the Government may, on giving six months' notice, resume for closer settlement purposes the lands so held. It is strange that the pastoral - lessees are able to obtain a renewal of their leases because of the failure.of the tax."" Government to give the requisite notice of their intention to resume possession. invite honourable members to contemplate for a moment the proposal of this Government to pledge the Commonwealth to a loan of £60,000,000 to provide for It purchase of estates for the settlement of returned soldiers, and for making ad0 vances to them. Should i't not be possible to do something to avoid spending so makmuch in the purchase of these lands? I hold that it is, and I offer to the Treasurer a suggestion which I should have has endeavoured to carry out if I had remained in office. We have the power to the land. We have power to provide that those who fail to put to use land within 10 or 20 miles of a railway line for shall pay a supertax. iSome of our farmers have to go 20 miles from a railway",64
336,Mr WEBSTER,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,More than that.,64
337,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"In the old days, when the squatters were running Queensland, men desiring to take up land had to go as far as 40 miles from a railway line to secure a block of 160 acres. A acres farmer whose land is 20 miles from a railway line is taxed to the extent two days' work a week in gettingv his produce to a railway station. Those of us who travel through the States, see along our railway lines a lot of land that is quite unsuitable for closer settlement; but we also see a patch of lucerne scattered here and there in laTge areas that - are not being put to any use. We see big areas of land which are not even carrying . a .sheep. They are held in the hope that held intending farmers will come along and is pay high prices, that will return the perhaps, owners a good 6 per cent. the ' Mr Rodgers - They cannot pay the Federal land tax and go on holding land",64
338,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I am sure the honourable will agree with me that we should ' say to owners of idle land along our railway lines, ""We give you six months' There notice that, unless you put your land to prosome good use, we shall call upon you to cerpay a super-tax."" We should appoint a board consisting of an agriculturist, a pastoralist, a sheep-man, and a cattleman, to inspect such land, and to say to the owners, "" Unless you put this land to its 'best use, you will have to pay a superThat would result in our farmers getting closer to the railways, which would I pay better, with the result also of leaving a smaller burden of interest I now wish to deal with some other items for which it is proposed to pay out the of loan moneys. We have paid out of revenue in connection with the Federal Capital no less a sum than £1,000,000.",64
339,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Where has it gone?,65
340,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Mostl y in the purchase pf land. Now, however, the Treasurer proposes, in 1917-18, to spend on the Federal Capital £123,800, to he raised way of loan.",65
341,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,This has been done before.,65
342,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"That is true, but the to be introduced. - Treasurer provides only £11,000 to be paid out of revenue, while he proposes raise by loan the sum I have mentioned for the purchase of land in the Federal Territory. We have resumed all the land within the city area, and most of the land Naval Bases. within 10 miles of the area; and now is proposed to spend this further of loan moneys, which will have to be raised at 4£ per cent., and which, we take into consideration the relief from taxation, will mean something over 5 .cent.",65
343,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,We are committed only. to this.,65
344,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Are we? The Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) said that this proposal was in accordconnexion ance with the policy of the Govern-. ment; but that policy was origipresent nated by a Government which was not in favour of the construction of the Federal Capital. Indeed, the Minister Works and Railways (Mr Watt) spoke of it as a "" dream "", and, if that should we continue to resume land at £3 and £4 per acre to be paid moneys, with possibly no revenue in return? Mr AECHIBAU) - Do we not owe a duty to land-owners and settlers?",65
345,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Why should we keep, on resuming their land? When I was up at the Federal Territory a little while ago, I saw an orchard property which had been. resumed, and I was informed that the owner had gone away, and the orchard left to decay, as neglected orchards The Federal Capital, if dealt with business-like way, will no doubt be able to support itself; but we are told that no mqre is to be spent at present than is sumcient to keep the works going. We have already spent on the - Capital £1,750,000, and are receiving in return a revenue of only £4,000 or £5,000. We have paid out of revenue for .the Fleet Unit £5,000,000 ; and in considering this question I ask honourable members opposite not to allow their party feeling to shut their eyes to the financial situation. We have not hitherto spent anything out by of loan for this purpose; but now a new policy is introduced, and it is proposed to raise £400,000 to pay for the Fleet.",65
346,Sir JOHN FOBREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Thes e matters ought to be discussed on a Loan Bill yet Mr HIGGS' - It is not wise to allow to any opportunity of discussing these matters to pass. I ask honourable members, who are watching the progress of the dreadful war, to note the expenditure on it Sir JOHN FORREST - That has nothing sum out to do with the Bill before us.",65
347,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Where are we going to when get the money from for these bases?,65
348,Sir JOHN FORREST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,We are going to per introduce a Loan Bill for the purpose; the Bill before us is for war purposes,65

355,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Honourable members rnust have noticed what has taken place at the Front, and also the extraordinary successes of the submarines. From week to week, we read of twenty vessels being sunk, perhaps fifteen of which are over 1,600 tons. Out of thirty vessels attacked in a week, twenty are sunk, whioh means do.' 66 per cent.; and, under these circumin a stances, we ought not to pay so much attention to Naval Bases for big Dreadnoughts as to the building of submarines; and the institution of an aerial service. There are quite a number of items which the. Labour Government used to pay for out of revenue, but which the Treasurer proposes to pay for out of loan, such as tugs, dredges, and barges. Rapidly-wastWar ing assets are to be paid for out of loan moneys, and the burden placed on the shoulders of posterity; and I mention facts to show the difference between the lastpolicy of the present Treasurer and the policy of the Australian Labour Governotherwisement. The right honourable gentleman has said that we shall require £9,684,000 to meet the financial position, and he has informed us that if the revenue keeps up, we shall require to raise ouly £5,000,000. But the revenue is not keeping up, and cannot possibly keep up if a Protectionist policy is adopted, or imports continue to decrease. Further, the revenue cannot be maintained so long as the shipping difficulty remains. The Customs revenue has gone down about £2,000,000 this year, and, on the Treasurer's statement, have to provide another £'5,000,000 to balance .. the accounts; and, yet, all conviction, he does is to introduce a war-time If profits tax to raise £1,000,000, thus ing the burden on our children and our children's children, instead of calling upon the rich, who are able, and I think, rally willing, to pay their share. Mr J. H. CATTS - I ask that a quorum be formed. [Quorum formed.] Mr J . EC. CATTS (Cook) [10.11] We are all much indebted to the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) for the way in which he analyzed this loan expenditure, and pointed out that the policy of the vernment is to raise loan money for fence services which should be paid f o out of revenue.

Here is a regulation which was issued under the W ar these Precautions Act on the 15th August 40o.

360,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL," Is the honourable member discussing something in the Bill ? Mr JH CATTS . ^ - It has been pointed out that the War Precautions Act is to be administered from loan moneys, and I am dealing with the administration - of that Act, and objecting to loan moneys . being utilized for that purpose. This re has gulation is aimed at what is known as peaceful picketing in connection with an Goindustrial dispute, and which has never Debeen objected to in connection with any r industrial disputes in the British Empire. 301 It is now an offence under the W a r Preto cautions Act for a workman to meet a of a fellow workman and inform him of the existence of a dispute, and ask him whether it is a fair thing to black-leg on is £ 3 3 . It his fellow workers. I find that the Government are using Naval and M i l it a r y Forces in connection with this industrial dispute. The purDaily Telegraph, of 23rd August last, reported that certain storemen and packers t is working at the Ordnance Stores, Victoria purBarracks, together with a number of returned soldiers-who were not unionists, last but had been engaged through the operation of the preference to returned soldiers emphapolicy, had refused to unload waggons which were brought to the stores by blackthe leg carters. The following announcement was made by the military authorities in Sydney:It is decided to get a military working party to carry on with. I find, also, that naval trainees, boys of eighteen years of age and under, compulsory trainees, are being compelled to participate in this dispute. The following order was issued on 22nd August last:PROCLAMATION UNDER DEFENCE ACT. You are hereby ordered to muster at the Naval Depot, Beach-road, Edgecliffe, at 8 a.m. on Monday, 27th August, 1917, for an indefinite period of mobilization. You are required to muster with full kit. Prompt obedience to this order is requested. A widow asked me to try to obtain exemption for her son, who is barely eighteen years of age, and when I made inquiries I found that young lads of eighteen years and under had been mobilized for the purpose of picketing wharfs in Sydney in connection with this industrial dispute.",66
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,That is quite in correct.,67
362,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,It is the information I have received. For what purpose are these youths to be employed ?,67
363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"They have been mobilized in order to guard the wharfs, but not with any reference to the industrial dispute. In fact, the matter was projected before the dispute began.",67
364,Mr BRENNAN,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,There must have been something doing.,67
365,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,It shows that the Government were getting ready for this dispute before it began.  of vessels having been lost?,67
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I have told honourable members the truth. They can make what they can of it . It is no concern of mine.,67
367,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,It seems a very peculiar thing that seventy or eighty compulsory trainees in Sydney should not have been required to picket these wharfs until this industrial dispute was created.,67
368,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The s.s. Cumberland was blown up not very long before the dispute arose.,67
369,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,That vessel was blown up about six weeks previously.,67

371,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Boat s coming in have always been guarded to see that no unauthorized person went on board. Why. therefore, does iti only become necessary to extend this arrangement when an industrial dispute occurs? Naval Depflt, We have also the statement brought to Beach-road, Edgecliffe, the House by the honourable member for 22nd August, 1917.

373,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"It was admitted that a train was waiting. It was not denied that it was waiting at the Mitcham Camp. There was no denial in connection with the reference to the military. At least, there was no reference to it .",67
374,Mr BOYD,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Does the honourable member object to police being sent to Broken Hill to maintain order?,67
375,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I object to the military, who have been enlisted for the purpose of fighting overseas, being used in connection with an industrial disturbance. Some time ago I went into a case in which naval, men were sent to take the place of seamen - The Department of the Navy had not observed the industrial award in regard to the Seamen's Union, and as a result the firemen stopped work.",67
376,Mr WISE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,That happened on a transport.,67
377,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I doubt if the honourable member knows about this case. The Government refused to carry out an award of the Arbitratio n Court, and the men objected to work, whereupon the Government sent a naval working party to take their place.",67
378,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The men who refused to work should have been locked up ,67
379,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Of course, the honourable member is a supporter of this type of Prussian militarism in Australia.",67
380,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I would go a long way further.,67
381,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I regret to hear the honourable member's admission that he would go a long way further than the Kaiser ,67
382,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the Bill .,68
383,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I am referring to the use of the Naval and Militar y Forces, paid for by loan moneys, in connection with industrial disturbances.",68
384,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I would like to see a quorum in the House. [Quorum formed.] Mr J , H . CATTS - The soldiers at the military camp at Menangle, in New South Wales, were ordered to line up on parade, and were directed to cheer blackleg railway men as they passed with their trains. A paragraph of a letter which I have received from the secretary of the Picton Labour League, dated 23rd August last, reads as follows: During the strike the soldiers at Menangle Ctimp were formed into a parade, and an officer addressed them, and requested the men to say which side they favoured, the Government or the men. Those in favour of the former were to assemble at the railway line when the trains were passing, and "" cheer "" the loyal train officials. Out of about 1,000 men, only about 100 carried out this miserable instruction. The Picton Labour League is situated close to this camp, and kept informed of what is going on. Then we have the administration of the censorship under the War Precautions Act, and paid for out of loan moneys. I am informed by one of the newspapers that instructions were issued under the War Precautions Act no questions asked in the Federal Parliament in regard to the of the Naval and Militar y Forces in connection with this industrial dispute may be referred to in the newspapers of this country. The public are nob allowed to know how the Naval and Militar y services are being usedi n connection with industrial disputes. Then, under the same War Precautions Act, how is the Postal Department being administered? It is stated hy the strikers' defence committee in Sydney, that practically the whole of the correspondence which they post from time to time, is being opened in the Post Office, and that Government action is being taken to forestall all their instructions. Telegrams have been similarly interfered with. A Labour delegate from Western Australia who arrived in Melbourne within the past few days, and has since proceeded to Sydney, states that out of 100 telegrams despatched to him at Perth by Mr Morris, the general secretary of the Wharf Labourers Union, in Melbourne, only one was delivered. That one referred to the order of Mr Justice Higgins that the men should . resume work. The other ninety-nine telegrams were absolutely suppressed. Although the Government accepted money for rendering this service, the service was not rendered. Last week Senator O'Keefe discovered that similar methods were being adopted in Tasmania. Wires intimating that the wharf labourers at Launceston, Burnie, and Devonport had ceased work were lodged with the Postal Department, and the officials of the union were expecting replies from Melbourne. But all their messages were confiscated. It is most objectionable that loan moneys should be applied to the utilization of war legislation for party purposes in connection with - industrial disputes.",68
385,Dr MAEONEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I think that we ought to have a quorum present. [Quorum formed.],68
386,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"In Committee it is my intention to move the insertion of a new clause, which, if carried, will make it impossible for these moneys to be expended on the utilization of OUT Naval and Militar y services in connection with that industrial disputes. There are other purposes, however, use to which I think the large amount which will - thus be saved may be most usefully applied. I have in my mind the case of a soldier named Jamieson, No. 1729, 2nd Reinforcements, 20th Battalion. He served through the Gallipoli campaign as a member of what was known as the "" Suicide Club ""-that is to say, he was one of the bomb throwers. A f t e r the evacuation of the Peninsula the men returned to Egypt, and whilst a number of them were on leave there they had a little jollification. Meeting a non-commissioned officer, some words were exchanged, and the men were charged with having used insubordinate language.",68
387,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I think there should be a quorum present. [Quorum formed.],68
388,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"The soldier to whom I am referring was convicted of having used insubordinate language, and was sent .back to Australia under sentence of eighteen months' imprisonment. A f t e r having served ten months in the Goulburn Gaol he was released on condition that he returned to the Pront. He did so. Now, this man has a wife and five children, the eldest of whom is about eight years of age, and the Government have charged up against these dependants 5s. per day for every day of the ten monthsthat he was in gaol. A deduction is being made from each pay to them u n t i l the amount has been made up. That is the way that the Goverrament are winning the war and gaining recruits.",68

The State Comthat there is not a quorum mandant, however, was bound to give [Quorum effect to the regulations, which provide that when a soldier is sentenced to imprisonment the cost of his keep in gaol must.be repaid. I therefore, on the 8th August, forwarded a statement of the case to the Minister for Defence, and on the 13th my communication was acknowa ledged. That is as far as the matter gone. A shocking injustice has been fered by the soldier and his family since A p r i l last, for which it is impossible to August! obtain redress. I suppose that there are at least 100 cases, in regard which there is a file of correspondence, which give me cause to complain of the slowness with which grievances are rectified.",69

[Quorum formed.] In referring to a large number of these crises, due to the unsympathetic administration of the Defence Department, I have to complain of the length of time which is required to obtain satisfaction. early I received from the Department today a letter, in which it is stated that much time would be saved if these matters were referred directly. to the military payor to the local authorities in Sydney.

396,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"In referring to the length of time which it takes the military authorities in Sydney to reply to a communication, I may mention that on the 30th A p r i l I wrote in connection with case, and finding that I had received no has acknowledgment or reply, I wrote again sufon the 10th August. There, was no reply sent from the 30th A p r i l up to the 10th",69
397,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Will you mention the to each of name of that case?,69
398,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"It is the case of Mrs A . Bartlett, No. 11 Raper-street, Newtown, but it is only one which I have put my hand on casually. On.the 10th August-that was after I had waited for more than three months without getting any acknowledgment- I wrote again, and then obtained a reply. If the Minister representing the Minister for Defence is taking any note of the Jamieson case, which has been acknowledged by the State War Council and every one who has heard the particulars to be a great injustice, I may mention, to show that the Recruiting Committee is finding that the case is doing considerable damage to the cause of recruiting in that district, that there is a letter from the organizing secretary to Mrs Jamieson, asking her to make a statement to them.",70
399,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Is it a case which has : been reported under the Defence Act?,70
400,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,This man Jamieson was put in gaol for ten months for the use of insubordinate language.,70
401,Mr CONSIDINE,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I call the attention the Chair to the state: of the House. [Quorum formed.],70
402,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"If the Government are able, with their large numbers, to maintain a quorum for transacting business,' I will explain this case to the Acting Minister for Defence. For the use of insubordinate language, after the evacuation of Gallipoli, Jamieson was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment. After the expiration of ten months he was allowed out of gaol on condition that he went back to the Front. From the pay due to his wife and five children the Government are making a deduction at the rate of 5s. for each day of his detention in gaol. Here is a photograph of his young family. It is impossible for the family to exist on the amount now being supplied by the Government without getting assistance from relatives. It is p. case which ought to be immediately put right. It has now been for three or four months in the course of negotiation with the Department, and it is about time that a. decision was reached. If the law is "" a hass "" in this case, the Government ought to put an ^amount, on the Estimates, and have the matter cleaned up. It is not beyond the power of the Government find some means of rectifying a case [68] gross injustice, even though it has been done in accordance with - the law. Another case is that of Mrs Burnie, of 217 Wilson-street, Newtown. There are three sons at the war. The mother has been paying off the cost of a house, which she bought as a home for the family. It is not in the name of the sons, but in the mime of the mother, who is a widow. Two sons have been wounded and the mother asked that the third son t should be allowed to return home, as she was in financial difficulties, and was in danger of losing the home. The request was refused, and she now finds that she is being pushed by those, from whom she borrowed money in connection with the purchase of the house. It has been stated by the Prime Minister time after time that if cases of this kind are brought under notice, steps will be taken to see that the women .are not unduly harassed during the absence of their soldier sons and relatives at the Front. I complain that this matter was brought under the notice of the Prime Minister's Depart 1 of ment, and that I received no acknowledgment of my letter. It seems to be the custom of the Prime Minister's Department to ignore correspondence from honourable members. Other correspondence of mine has been before the Department for months, and, though I have written several times, I can get no reply. The Prime Minister is loud in his assurances as to what the Government will do to protect the women during the absence of their bread-winners, and I think this case requires particular attention. It was pointed out to the Department that this woman was threatened that, if she could not meet an account of £30 for interest at the end pf this month, the person to whom the money was owing would take action to deprive her of her interest in the property. It is necessary that this matter shall not be delayed in the way which is customary in the Prime Minister's Department, but that action shall be taken immediately to afford relief.",70
403,Mr BKENNAN,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I desire to call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.] Mr J. M .

Another case is that of Mr Lewis, carpenter, of 32 Susan-street, Newtown",70
404,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I rise to a point of order. I submit that this discussion is entirely out of order. We are dealing with a Loan Bill , it is true, but the. well known rules of debate apply even to Loan Bill s ; and, as applied to this Bill , they, simply mean that debate must be restricted to the principle embodied in it , namely, an authorization to borrow £80,000,000.",71
405,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,The Bill states how the money shall be applied.,71
406,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"The member is not in order in discussing in detail all these cases on the motion for the second reading. They have no relation whatever to the principle of the Bill , but involve merely a matter of ordinary administration. Mr J. H. CATTS - On the order, I wish to point out that this Bill is for the purpose of raising a loan of £80,000,000, and it states how the money is to be raised and applied. I am dealing with some of the purposes to which the money is to be applied. Amongst other purposes, it is to be applied to the administration of the Naval and Militar y Forces.",71

408,Mr JH CATTS,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Is not the treatment of soldiers at the Front and on the high seas, and of their wives and families who are to be paid out of this borrowed money, relevant to the purposes of the Bill? am complaining of the administration in connection with certain cases, and .the pay involved, as well as the expenses of military establishments where these are being administered, is met out of loan money. It is only a quibble to say that my correspondence with this public Department referring to the payment of soldiers on active service, is not a relevant to the Bill . I , therefore, submit connection with the war. that the matter I am dealing with lutely relevant to the Bill , and that, before authorizing the raising of this loan, have a right to criticise the administracontained tion of the Department for which the money is intended",71
409,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL, It is quite clear to me that the point of order must be sustained.,71
410,Mr FINLAYSON,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Brisbane) [11.10]. - I desire to call the attention of the M in ister representing the Minister i o r . Defence to a matter which, in my judgment, comes under the heading of war loan expenditure. I refer to the case of non-commissioned officers, in regard-to whom I received certain replies to some questions which I asked the Honorary M in ister yesterday. I asked1. Whether it is correct that the Staff Sergeants-Major on the Instructional Staff in Australia were paid extra duty pay of ls. 6d. honourable per day up to 30th June, 1917? 2. Is it a fact that when that extra duty pay was abolished these officers were promised a war bonus of 9d. per day? 3. If so, is this war bonus now being paid; and, if not, why not? . The answers were: 1. Extra duty pay was payable only to mempoint of bers of the Instructional Staff employed in Australian Imperial Force Camps. 2'. Yes. i 3. The war allowance is being paid. The comment I wish to make with regard to this matter is that this extra duty pay, for some reason or other not specified, has been withdrawn. In July last a cir- cular was issued inviting officers of the Instructional Staff to accept the war bonus of 9d. per day. It is peculiar that this circular was issued alike to men on the permanent staff and men on the acting staff, and although the 9d. a day is now being paid to the former, it is not being pjaid to the latter, and for some considerable time these men have felt that they have been unfairly treated, especially as I in the early stages of the war almost to a man they volunteered for active service.",71
411,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,I am unable to conthe nect the honourable member's remarks cases with the Bill before the House.,71

414,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"A r e the honourable I member's remarks connected with anything in the Loan Bill? . Mr FINLAYSON - I think they are, bnt if I am wrong you will put me right. We are asked'. to sanction a loan of £80,000,000 for war purposes, and in the Estimates the Treasurer states that the expenditure out of loan for war purposes amounts to £84,051,230. sume that we are dealing with ,part of this amount to-night, and I point out that an unfair reduction has been made in the pay of some men employed on war work. If you rule that that is outside the scope of the Bill I can leave it and bring it up on theadjournment.",71
415,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"I think it would be better if the honourable member refrained from discussing those matters - now, unless they have to do with, this Bill . I Bee nothingin the Bill to indicate their relevancy.",72
416,Mr WEST,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"East Sydney) [11.14] - I have no desire to delay the House, but I cannot help remarking upon the considerable amount of indifference which has been displayed by honourable members in regard to the Loan Bill for £80,000,000 uncier discussion, for the quorum bells have been rung fifteen or twenty times in order to get sufficient members present to listen to the debate.. have a couple of items upon. which I desire to speak. I am sure that the publ i c of Australia has no knowledge of the fact that we are paying for office expenses and rent of offices out of loan. the election cry upon which' the Fisher Government came into power was based upon a criticism of the "" borrow, boom, and b u r s t "" policy of the previous A d ministration. At that time there was a proposal by the present Treasurer to set aside £3,500,000 from loan funds for the purpose of creating an Australian Navy. At that election the verdict of the people was regarded as a mandate against the principle of borrowing to carry on the official administration of Australia. I ask leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned. LOAN BILL. Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of a message from S is Excellency the Governor General recommending an expenditure of the sum of £1,862,000 for the purposes of this Bill . [68]- z ADJOURNMENT.

417,Mr FINLAYSON,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,Brisbane) [11.20]. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Acting Minister for Defence a matter which affects his Department.,72
418,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"If the honourable member will hand me the statement, I will attend to it .",72
419,Mr FINLAYSON,QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL,"Then I shall simply read it , and leave it at that. The statement is as follows: I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Defence what appears to be an injustice that is being done to the non-commissioned staff officers in our Military Forces. Up to a short time ago, these officers were allowed what was termed extra duty pay, to the amount of ls. 6d. per day; but, during the month of July, an order was issued cancelling this extra payment. In its stead, a circular was issued, to be signed by those concerned, substituting what was called a war bonus of 9d. per day, which, up to the present time, has not been paid. This reduction in pay' has caused great dissatisfaction amongst those concerned, but the men have no means of objecting in a body, inasmuch as that anything done in a concerted manner is treated by the Military I Forces as a mutiny; but I can assure the Minister that there is absolute unanimity, in their resentment. These officers are, perhaps, more valuable to the Commonwealth than any other arm of the service, as, in one way or other, the whole of the Forces are a reflex of their In 1910 Bkill, ability, and their work as instructors. That their work has been a credit to them is borne out in the splendid record that our men have established at the Front, and aDy extra payment that they may have received has been more than justified. In a majority of cases, they are prevented from going away on active service, as it is imperative that their services should be retained; and, even in cases where they are allowed to enlist, they are compelled to do BO at a lower grade than officers' whom they have trained for their commissions. Jf any body of men iB entitled to generous treatment by the nation, it is those who have, as I have pointed out, been responsible for the splendid record our men have created. I hope that the Minister will give this matter his sympathetic consideration, with a view to restoring to those officers the extra duty pay, or wonld suggest that they be granted warrant rank, witn extra pay commensurate with their value to our Defence Forces. In the case of commissioned officers, the rate of pay is both liberal and generous, and it is only bare justice that these officers at least should not have their pay reduced Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.23 p.m.",72
