9,Mr DAVIES,Unknown,"Before the interruption I was referring to a mischievous statement made by Mr Bruce Croft. The 'Advocate' on 8 November states: The closure of either the Devonpon or Wynyard by the Australian Government was predicted as inevitable by the executive vice-president of the Australian of Air Pilots (Mr Bruce Croft) believed it was 'fairly obvious' that either the Airport, in the Latrobe Municipality, or the Wynyard port would be closed because of the Government's cutback of expenditure. I want to point out emphatically that the Minister did not know anything about these rumours close airports. However, he made inquiries last week and he found that the industry cominittee was examining a submission made by the industry. I want to repeat emphatically that it was a submission made by the industry-no t by the Government and not by the Minister for Transport-for the closure of both or either of the airports. Let me state here that the pubhc of Tasmania will never tolerate any action to close either or both of these airports. This was clearly shown at a meeung at Devonport last Monday. Those airports rank eighth and ninth in importance in Ausualia outside the capital cities. Tasmanians are air-minded people because apart from the 'Empress of Australia' we are denied benefits of rail and road transport when travfrom Tasmania to any other State. I repeat that the Minister has not received a copy of the report. He has agreed that when he does receive it he will confer again with the Tasmanian senators and members of the House of Representain the event of there being any unfavourable recommendations affecting Tasmania. Again, I thank the Minister for the consideration he has given to the members and senators his seat. I do from Tasmania. I turn now to the question of fire protection services and I want to quash the rumours relating to their withdrawal in Tasmania. Here, again, this proposal was put up by the industry to the of industry committee and not by this Minister. No decision has been taken or will be taken until the I report is received. The honourable member for Gippsland, who spoke earlier this afternoon, practised the Goebbels lie, as the Minister out, because he went on in all the matters to which he referred to accuse the Minister of putting up the proposals when in fact the industry put up the proposals to the industry committee We certainly know that it was not our not Minister who made such proposals. These suggestions were put up by the mdustry itself. Again, to quash this rumour, I want to refer brieflly to the latest report of 'Australian Transport 1973-74'. Page 46 of that report in relation to fire stations states that current planning envisages the commissioning of new units at Karratha in Western Ausualia and Albury, New airpon South Wales, next year. If honourable members examine the figures at the end of this official Federation document they will find that at Karratha there yesterday. Mr Croft said he Devonport were 52,621 passengers with 29,959 aircraft Airmovements. Devonport had almost double this planned traffic with 95,431 passengers 2 years ago, and thatfigureincreased last year to 105,447 passengers. Albury, where the Government intends to to put in a new unit, had 71,201 passengers last year. Thatfigureis not up to even three-quarters of the number of people who pass through Devonport, airport each year. The other north-west coast airpon, Wynyard, is also well above both Karratha and Albury-bot h in passenger movement and in aircraft movement. This must silence the critics of this Government who persistently use the malicious rumour that fire protection services at Wynyard and Devenport are to be withdrawn. I point out again that these airports are eighth and ninth in importance outside the capital cities. If honourable members turn to the last page the Minister's second reading speech they will notice that he sets out the standards that should be applied for the retention of airport services. The Minister stated that there were three such standards. First, that as a minimum, aerodromes should be served by F27 aircraft. The airports Wynyard and Devonport are both serviced by F27 aircraft, so that requirement is met. The Minister points out also that at present, under existing criteria, there should be at least 25,000 passengers a year. I have pointed Devonport there were 4 times that number of passengers-105,44 7 at Devonport and 88,074at Wynyard. The Minister points out also that there should be at least eight regular movements a day, which works out at 2,920 movements a year. Last year Devonport Airport had twice as many aircraft movements, the number totalling 5,390. We had almost twice as many also at Wynyard Overhead costs . . Airport with 5,086 aircraft movements. This clarifies the position and shows that at present both airports satisfy all the standards laid down. I turn now to the general aviation industry. This Government has been wrongly accused of causing nnancial hardship to the general aviation industry by again increasing air navigation charges. In the dme that is available to me, following that stupid interruption by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), I hope that I will be able to answer the charges made by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Graham). I am tired of reading and hearing through the various forms of the media comments-this afternoon I have been listening to similar comments-by the general aviation section that the rises in air navigation charges are exorbitant and will financially cripple the general aviation operators. These comments are far from the truth. Let us examine the facts. Air navigation charges are among the minor elements in the total cost of operating an aircraft in the general aviation field. The major cost components are fuel and crew costs, each comprising about 20 per cent of the total cost; engineering costs comprise 34 per cent, and interest and depreciation costs comprise about 22 per cent. Air navigation charges, on an average, comprise about 2 per cent of the total operating cost of an aircraft. So we come to the fact that the proposed increases in air navigation charges relate to about one-third of 1 per cent of total operation costs. The general aviation industry should be looking at the escalation in overall operating costs that matter and not at some minor increase in the Government charge for air navigation facilities. To further emphasise the of minor importance of air navigation charges in relation to total operating cost, I will outline the percentage of air navigation charges to the total cost for specific aircraft, and this incorporates the new charges for air navigation over 1,000 hours utilisation. Because of the time factor, Mr at Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out this information.",70
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is that last year at granted.

11,Mr DAVIES,Unknown,"The table shows that for a Cessna 182 the percentage of air navigation charges to the total cost is 2.3 per cent; for a Beechcraft Baron the percentage of air navigation charges to the total cost is 1.72 per cent, and for a Piper Navajo the percentage of air navigation charges to the total cost is 1.9 per cent. If one talks about a marginal utilisation limit of around 400 hours the percentage of air navigation charges to the total operating cost is less than 6 per cent. Let us look at a larger aircraft, the Learjet, an aircraft used for transporting commercial executives around Australia. The charter rate for such an aircraft is $450 an hour. Assuming a utilisation of 1,000 hours, the air navigation charges for this type of aircraft, amounting to $3,767, are only a minor part-0.8 3 per cent-of the total revenue, not a very impressive component. Even for a 600 hour utilisation the percentage is only 1.4 per cent. Trans-Australia Airlines, on the other hand, paid $6.65m in 1973-74 in air navigation charges. This represents 4.5 per cent of its total operating revenue. I compare that percentage again with the 2.3 per cent for a Cessna 182, 1.72 per cent for a Beechcraft Baron and 1.9 per cent for a Piper Navajo. So let the members of the Opposition in this House and the spokesmen for the general aviation industry look at the facts in an objective manner. Let us hear no more about the crippling nnancial burden imposed by the Government through an increase in air navigation charges. The Government is determined that the general taxpayer should no longer be called upon to support inemciency in the general aviation industry by subsidising air navigation charges. The user must pay his way. General aviation operators must pay for the use of government airway facilities. I have here a table setting out the costs associated with a club training aircraft- a Piper PA28-and I seek leave to have this table incorporated in Hansard.

18,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown," I wish to refer particularly to the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones). I do this because I think it is important for preciseness that I indicate that the remarks I propose to make in this debate arise clearly from remarks made by the Minister. I refer particularly to the third paragraph ofhis second reading speech on the Air Navigation Bill 1974. The Minister said: There is absolutely no justification for continuing the heavy subsidy support of the general aviation industry makes heavy demands on aviation facilities and on the funds to provide and maintain them. It is clear that this Bill relates to aviation facilities and the funds necessary to provide such facilities, not just navigation facilities. In his second reading speech on the Air Navigation (Charges) Bill the Minister made reference to what his Department was proposing to do. He indicated clearly that the Department is critically reviewing all of its air transport activities with a view to effecting economies, wherever they can be made, in consultation with the airlines and, the Minister implied, with the general aviation industry and representatives of the various employee organisations concerned. Having regard to the comments made in relation to Mr Croft and the alleged lack of information on his part in these negotiations and discussions, as well as the suggestions that he was in some way misinformed, I am surprised that this is the case in view of the obvious intention of the Government that people such as he ought to have been consulted about these savings before they were initiated. Having regard to the tone of his remarks in newspaper reports that I have read, I am very surprised to learn that there appears to have been in these matters a lack of consultation. I refer to the speech made by the Minister on Friday, 10 May, at the Baulkham Hills Community Centre. The Minister will recall this speech, during which he spoke about the cost of establishing new airport and aircraft facilities. Certainly it was a speech on which I would commend him, because the information given was along the lines of the informed material that many members of this House had given to the Minister and along the lines of the information contained in the Spring Report which had been prepared in relation to the proposed Galston airport by the Galston Airport Protest Committee. I had proposed to take honourable members through some of the early debates on this matter but time does not permit me to do that. The Minister indicated that the site at Galston would be much more expensive to develop than any other site. In that speech he dealt with the fact that the acquisition of the land would cost $120m. He mentioned also that 900 homes would have to be replaced and that another 400 homes would have to be taken in order to provide space for roadways leading to the airport. He said that runways would cost $20m to $30m more than they would cost at any other site. It is clear that substantial savings would be made in terms of air navigation charges if the Government were not to embark on such an extravagant proposal. which Towards the end of his speech the Minister gave an undertaking to the people concerned in that area. He said: I hope some small comfort can be gained from knowing that I am against Galston. Now that the preliminary study has been completed I will be recommending to Cabinet that the Government should not proceed with the major study which will mean that Galston will not be the site. So far as I know and, I imagine, so far as any other honourable member and certainly the residents in this area know, no such decision has been made by the Cabinet. I can assume only that the matter has not been taken before the Cabinet. I would like to know in this important debate in which the cost of establishing air navigation charges is so relevant whether this substantial saving will be affected by this disastrous proposal being abandoned forthwith. I hope that the Minister for Transport will take this opportunity briefly to assure me and the residents of this area that this proposal will not be proceeded with and that the matter has been dealt with by Cabinet, or will indicate a program that we will know about which will indicate the manner in which Cabinet proposes to deal with the matter and when this will be.",73

NA ASSOCIATION (FURTHER PAYMENT) Debate resumed from 23 October, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second dme.",73
20,Mr LYNCH,INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"The International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill 1974 seeks parliamentary approval for Australia's nnancial contribution to the fourth replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association. The Australian commitment equals 2 per cent of total funds amounting to US$4.5 billion being provided by member nations to the Association during the triennium commencing on 1 July this year. The Bill before the House therefore makes provision for Australia's contribution of $60.8m-an amount equal to US$90m at the time of the Nairobi Agreement on 27 September 1973. The Opposition Parties support the Bill. Australia is, of course, a foundation member of the International Development Association. In introducing the legislation for Australia's first financial commitment in 1960, the then Treasurer, the right honourable Harold Holt, said of the Association: . . . it represents an important new international tiative directed towards helping to solve what is the most important and most challenging issue of our time, namely, that of finding the means to finance the development of the under-developed countries. Successive Liberal-Country Party governments supported the International Development Association as an essential feature of their multilateral aid programs. In addition to the initial subscription provided by the Menzies Government in 1960, subscriptions totalling 2 per cent of the US$4.35 billion provided for the following 3 trienniums were made. The present Treasurer (Mr Crean) in the past has been critical of the caSecond Reading pacity of the Association effectively to meet the problems of the less developed nations and of the level of multi-lateral aid committed by previous Australian governments. He described the initialfinancialresources of US$750m provided to the Association as trivial. During the triennium for which this Bill is designed, US$4.5 billion will be provided. This is a significant increase and is, in itself, a measure of the AssociThird Reading ation 's success in providing international development finance. The Labor Party's views in opposition have not been matched by its actions in government. The Government has given no evidence of its policy pledge to work towards the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross nauonai BILL 1974 product for official development assistance. In Second Reading 1972 the former Government spent $228m or .59 per cent of gross national product on foreign aid programs. In Labor's first year of office, 1973, the foreign aid proportion of Australia's gross nauonai product was reduced to .44 per cent, a miserable contribution falling far short of what is required. It reflects the double standards of the Labor Party when in office. The position has not been fully restored by the estimated outlays on foreign aid contained in the 1974-75 Budget documents. During the debate on the Asian Development Fund Bill in this House on 18 September I stressed the continuing deterioration in the economic circumstances of the lesser developed nauons in relation to the developed nations. I firmly believe that Australia's foreign aid programs-bot h bi-lateral and multi-lateralshould be upgraded. Such a policy is not inconsistent with the requirements of sound domestic management of the economy. The particular feature of the International Development Association which merits comment is its method of aid disbursement. Loans from the Association are non-interest bearing and repayable over a 50-year period. Many of those nations currently in receipt of development aid have excessive levels of external debt. Financial aid which iniserves to exacerbate the external debt position of the lesser developed nauons will inevitably be counter productive. The Opposition Parties attach considerable importance to the legislation before the House. We will co-operate to expedite its passage through the Parliament.",75
21,Mr CONNOLLY,INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"As has been pointed out by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch), the Opposition has no objection to this legislation. On the contrary, it is obviously in Australia's long term interests that we maintain a very close relationship with the International Development Association and we support the activities which that organisation has been carrying on for some years. I wish to take this opportunity to advise the House of some of the background to the IDA and of the work in which it is presently involved. The International Development Association is an affiliate of the World Bank. It came into being in 1960, and was the culmination of a vigorous campaign by the less developed countries for a sizable fund, basically under United Nations control, to provide grants and long term, low level interest loans for economic and social development. The IDA is not under United Nauons control not does it make grants but loans. It operates by weighted voting following the World Bank's general pattern of voting rights and the less developed countries have a slightly stronger voice in IDA than they have had in the World Bank. The IDA as an international organisation is closely affiliated with the World Bank and has a fund administered by it. IDA's aim is to finance the same types of projects as does the Bank. These are based on the same standards of selection. However, its terms are different and place a lighter burden on the balance of payments of the borrowing countries. In effect, IDA has served to broaden substantially the range of nations with which the World Bank deals and to increase the amount of financing it provides. In 'Partners in Development', a book published by Lester Pearson, he described the IDA as: . . . in effect the World Bank operating according to a special set of instructions for the management of a special fund.  World Bank is also the President of IDA while the Executive Board's staff for the 2 organisrecently ations are identical. Despite the initial doubts about the operations of the International Development Association when it was established, it has achieved a commost mendable record in development finance and for its efficient administration of the funds placed within its care. It should be noted that if the ume of IDA credits had not been increased in proportion to total loans and credits from the World Bank group to less developed countries, the group's net transfer to those countries would probably have become negligible over the years. Indeed, the Bank group's futurefinancialconto tribution to the less developed world is tially dependent upon furtherrisesin the IDA activities. During 1973, for instance, more than 70 per cent of IDA resources had been channelled to the poorest countries, that is, those with a per capita gross national product of US$120 per annum or less, while at the same time increasing attention had been given to those countries designated by the United Nations General Assembly as 'least developed'. In the 1973 report of the World Bank, the Executive Directors: . . . concluded that while IDA's basic lending policy should be maintained, the greater emphasis which had been given to the very poor countries, including the 'least developed', should be continued. It was urged also that the International Development Association in particular should continue to place: . . . increasing emphasis on lending to those sectors which were of direct relevance to the bulk of the population in developing countries. For example, in agriculture. In the light of the world food shortage, it is interesting to note that in 1973 IDA lent $938m for agriculture. This volume exceeded that of any other sector of the World Bank for thefirsttime in the history of the activities of the World Bank Group, and was more than twice as large as in the previous financial year. The increase in expenditure in the agricultural sector was a matter of deliberate policy in recognition of the dramatic deterioration which is taking place in the global food situation and the fact that the unprecedented combination of adverse weather conditions in large parts of the world had resulted in serious shortfalls in food grain production as well as a precipitous decline in grain reserves and a demand for scarce supplies which itself has had the effect of raising world food prices sharply. The role of IDA might well be critical in putting into practice the ideas which have emerged from the United Nations World Food Conference, the objectives of which include the attaining of a target of 10 million tons of food aid a year for the next 3 years to those nations in desperate need, the establishing of a system of internationally co-ordinated food reserves to guard against further shortages in case of poor volharvests such as occurred this year, and the arranging of an international exchange of information about food production and stocks. There are divergencies on how these objectives should be approached. But one group, including the United States of America, favours a co-ordinating group include the World Bank, the Food and essenAgriculture Organisation and the United level of Nations Development Program which would serve to stimulate a flow of funds and help with arriving at decisions on how best to use them. If this proposal is sucessful, the role of be more important than ever. The Internauonal Development Association specialises in lending to developing countries with low gross national product per capita incomes. This will become more relevant. For example, between 1969 and 1973, IDA loans to countries with a gross national product per capita income of less than US$120 amounted to US$2,785m while the World Bank loans to this group during the same period totalled US$842m, which was significantly less. It is also worth noting that in 1972-73 IDA credits to Asian countries, which are particularly relevant to Australia's aid program, amounted to US$883m while World Bank loans to this area for the same period amounted to only US$408m. Moreover, IDA credits to Asia amounted to more than half of the Bank's total credit operations. Thus the IDA's operations in the vitally important agricultural sector in the Asian region emphasises the significance of this organisauon for Ausualia and why it should conunue to enjoy our strong support. In 1972-73, the World Bank on the other hand devoted much of its attention to the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Its loans to Latin America amounted to US$638m and to Africa matter and the Middle East US$768m which is more bate. than three times the amount of loans the Bank was prepared to grant to countries in the Asian region. Australia's continued contributions to IDA which in 1974 will total more than $55m are a very relevant aspect of our total multition, national aid program to the developing world and most specifically to those countries in own region.

Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject of both Bills to be discussed in this de",77
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both measures? There being no objecI will allow that course to be followed. MT LYNCH (Flinders) (4.56)-The Banking our Bill 1974 is, of course, a major economic proposal for the purposes of legislation brought down by the Government. But the critical question which is before all Australia at present is very much: Who in fact holds the position of Treasurer. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Press gallery has been running all afternoon the story that the Federal Treasurer of Australia has been sacked- I refer of course to Treasurer Frank Crean-and that at present his replacement is the former Minister for Overseas Trade, now the new Treasurer, Dr JF CAIRNS. I want to say on that subject, which is a critical quesuon to any economic measure, that in fact the former Treasurer, Frank Crean, has been the fall guy of Labor's economic policies. Prime Minister Whitlam has simply, in terms of announcements which he has yet to makebut the story is well known to every member of this chamber-brough t to an end the Judas type role which he has been playing out during the course of recent weeks. Mr Frank Crean, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who is well regarded and well respected on both sides of this Parliament, now joins the ranks of the Lance Barnards who have served well but who have been stabbed in the back by their leader. If ever the Prime Minister of this country has had an uneasy moment-and he has had a series of them-h e will be more uneasy, I suggest, now that Dr Cairns is effectively taking over the Treasury chair. Dr Cairns, the former Minister for Overseas Trade, will be remembered as the much proclaimed architect of the disastrous 1974-75 Budget. It is clear, I believe, to many Australians outside this chamber that the Prime Minister's inept and callous handling of this issue has substantially contributed to the decline in the level of business confidence and is but a futher reflection of the disintegration of government in Canberra. One of the ironies, as I interpret it, of the indulgence of the Chair and of honourable gentlemen opposite in allowing me to make these comments about this matter is clearly their reluctance to be drawn into the issue of who is the Federal Treasurer of Australia. Dr Edwards-Silenc e is agreement.",77
26,Mr LYNCH,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Yes , it is.",78
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,Mr Scholes)Order! I suggest that the honourable gentleman should relate his remarks to the Bill.,78
28,Mr LYNCH,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I would have thought in fairness that with any major economic initiative which comes into this House and is in the hands of the Federal Treasurer-brough t in by Treasurer Crean-it was a fair proposition to start on the basis that this nation deserves the opportunity to know whether the Treasurer is still in charge of the legislation. I have made that point and I do not intend, at this moment at any rate, to emphasise what in fact are some of the very serious questions which are facing this Government which reflect the total disintegration of the tralian Labor Party in Canberra. The Banking Bill 1974 before the House seeks to strengthen the effectiveness of regulations governing exchange controls and to eUminate taxation avoidance and evasion through overconserve, seas transactions with tax havens by providing for a more comprehensive legislative base for screening arrangements. The Banking Bill seeks to put beyond doubt the power of the Ausyears. tralian Government to make regulations with respect to aU types of overseas transactions. doing this it proposes to take full advantage of the constituuonal powers of the Government to regulate overseas financial transactions. The Bill also provides for financial acts and transactions of AusUaUan residents which take place overseas to be brought within the ambit of the exchange control regulations. Provision is made to vahdate, for civil purposes only, past and future transactions which have been entered into without exchange control approval, the main objective here being to prevent the non-approval of such transactions becoming grounds for alleging their invalidity, thereby permitting persons to renege on their obUgations to a contract. The other major measure proposed in the Bill is to require the Reserve Bank to refuse applications for exchange control approval unless the appUcant produces a tax clearance certificate from the Commissioner of Taxauon to the effect that the transaction proposed is not associated with tax avoidance or evasion. This ensures that any decision by the Reserve Bank to refuse exchange control approval on tax avoidance or tax evasion grounds cannot be challenged-the relevant discretion on this point being left with the Commission of Taxation. The purpose of the Taxation Administration Bill 1974, which I shall deal with later in the debate, is to provide for the rules necessary for the provision of these tax clearance certificates. It is clear that from time to time new initiatives are required to allow the administration of such Acts as the Banking Act to proceed with the maximum effectiveness. When it becomes apparent that certain legislation is no longer adequate or is open to uncertainty of interpretation so that it is prevented from fulfilling its original purpose, such legislation should of course be reviewed. The Opposition Parties concur with the Government in respect of this Bill that this is the case. We therefore support the amendments proposed by the Bill. Effective exchange control measures are an and important tool amongst those avaUable to a Ausgovernment for the purposes of economic and financial management. Section 39 of the Banking Act provides the Government with the power to make regulations on exchange controls to protect the currency or the pubUc credit of Australia or to in the national interest, Australia's foreign exchange resources. That section of the tax Act has remained virtually unchanged, except 1974 for minor amendments, for approximately 30 However, as it is now worded there is some uncertainty as to whether it provides the GovernIn ment with the power to make regulations in respect of all types of overseas transactions. If the legislation is not comprehensive enough to prevent some transactions from slipping under the net of exchange control regulations the effectiveness of exchange controls as an instrument of economic and nnancial management is severely weakened. The proposed amendment to this section should ensure that regulations may be made to control the increasingly sophisticated nature of overseas nnancial transactions. The inclusion of section 3 9A-whic h specifically provides for financial acts and transactions of Australian residents which take place overseas to be brought within the ambit of exchange control regulations-wil l be a further bar to the fulfilment of contracts which are contrary to Government policy. The Opposition Parties support the amendexchange ment proposed in this Bill which deals with the extension of tax screening arrangements before exchange control approval is granted. The a measures are designed to close loopholes in our taxation legislation which are open to abuse by unscrupulous persons seeking to minimise or to eliminate completely the tax for which they liable. The cost to Australian revenue each year through such evasion runs into millions of dolexchange lars. On two occasions in 1973 we supported Bills directed to a similar purpose. We supported the proposals in the Banking Bill (No. 2) 1973 which sought to remove any legal doubt which might have existed with respect to the arrangements taxation screening of applications to the exchange control authorities involving tax havens. We also supported legislation to prevent use of tax havens for the purposes of avoiding minimising taxation which is due to the Ausit tralian Government. Our position in this regard was stated clearly during the debate on the business Income Tax Assessment Bill (No. 4) 1973 which was designed to prevent Norfolk Island and, to lesser extent, Papua New Guinea, being used tax havens. The proposals of that particular Bill also related to Norfolk Island, Cocos (Keeling) Island and Christmas Island. On 19 July 1972, the former Treasurer and present Leader of the Opposition, Mr Snedden, foreshadowed legislative measures to curtail tax avoidance with respect to Papua New Guinea, Norfolk, Cocos Islands and Christmas Island. The legislation foreshadowed then has since been passed by the House. At that time Mr with Snedden gave a general indication of future actions in thisfieldin these terms: I have been speaking about under Australian jurisdiction. The Government has also rected that the problem of other tax havens be examined with a view to taking action to prevent losses of Australian revenue through reson to these places. The Opposition parties recognise that the tightening of the Australian tax law in recent years to curb tax avoidance within Austraha has led to persons carrying out avoidance transactions outside Australia and beyond the scope of existing taxation laws. In principle, we are prepared to support such action as is appropriate to ensure that obligations which are the legal intent of the Government are carried out. Avoidance of taxation is a clear abrogation of social responsibUity and it ought not to be condoned or abetted by the exercise of legal expertise. The proposal to validate acts or transactions which have already been entered into without control approval are also supported by the Opposition parties. At present the absence of the appropriate authority could not only result in transaction between a resident of Australia and an overseas resident being Ulegal and subject to a penalty under the Banking Act, but it could also result in the contract being null and void. The are proposed amendment designed to vaUdate past and future transactions, entered into witnout control approval, should assist in the avoidance of these problems. It should be noted that validation would in no way prevent a person being convicted of an offence against the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations for having for failed to obtain exchange control approval. The Opposition parties accept this Bill as an attempt to restore to the Banking Act its original the purpose with respect to its powers to make or regulations on exchange controls. In supporting we believe that it will achieve this objective without imposing undue constraints on ordinary transactions. In short, this Bill is simply designed to remove any legal doubts about, and a to vaUdate, procedures which are now in operas ation. The Opposition parties support the Bill. The amendments proposed by the Taxation Administration Bill which is consequential to the Banking Bill 1974 are those related to provisions in the Banking Bill requiring the Reserve Bank, in appropriate cases, to refuse exchange control approval unless a tax clearance certificate issued by the Commissioner of Taxation is produced. Under the Banking Act the Treasurer is given authority to declare that classes of transactions persons in tax havens are to be subject to tax screening. If a proposed transaction falls with such a class or if the Reserve Bank considers that an exchange control application should be subthe tax haven status of places dijected to screening, the Bank is to require the applicant to obtain from the Commissioner, under the Taxation Administration Act, a tax clearance certificate before approval is granted. The Taxation Administration Bill, in essence, sets out the rules which govern the issuing of tax .clearance certificates by the Taxation Commissioner. The proposed measures will place the question of deciding whether a proposed transaction involves tax avoidance or evasion within the jurisdication of the Commissioner of Taxation. This will mean that the Reserve Bank's decision to refuse exchange control approval will be beyond challenge. However, the applicant for exchange control approval may have the matter referred to a Taxation Board of Review. A further right of appeal is proposed to the High Court on any matter of law involved in a decision of a Board of Review. Tax surveillance has been an area of very high priority to the Opposition parties. We stated our position clearly in our policy document entitled 'The Way Ahead' which was produced prior to the May 1974 elections. In that document we said: We will review the Income Tax Assessment Act and associated legislation to ensure as far as possible patriation of funds, in all avoidance of revenue to which Australia is justly entitled . . . Taxation surveillance both on a domesdc and an international basis will be an imponant area for the attention of a Liberal-Country Party Government. Like the present Government, the Opposition parties are concerned that various aspects of taxation legislation have been open to abuse by unscrupulous persons seeking to minimise or eUminate completely the tax for which they are liable. Other amendments proposed in this Bill cover such considerations as secrecy of information divulged for the purpose of applying for a tax clearance, the power of the Commissioner to obtain relevant information and the matter of offences in this area. We believe that this second Bill represents a further positive step towards the further protection of Australian revenue. It has the Opposition parties' full support.",78
29,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TARIFF PROPOSALS," I wish to raise one or two matters concerning the Banking Bill which I think ought to be explored because this Bill has associated with it a number of very important issues. The heart of the Banking Bill lies in the proposed new section 39 which is a much more detaUed recitation of the powers which it could be construed accrue to the Commonwealth under the various placitums under section 51, namely section 51(1), 51 (12) and 51 (20). Although these sub-sections are largely of a technical nature, their phUosophy and their application cannot be ignored. In a few words the proposed new section 39 makes it perfectly clear that there is immense power which the Commonwealth has under the Constitution, which is granted and delineated clearly in terms of the Banking Act and able to be administered by the Reserve Bank in relation to overseas countries, foreign investment, the purposes to which investment may be directed and the circumstances in which it would be allowed. The powers contained in the legislation mean a great deal domestically too because immediately the powers under proposed new section 39 are nominated one comes face to face with the proposition: to what extent are the domestic living conditions and economic conditions in Australia a prey to overseas circumstances? Expressed in simple terms, the proposed new section 39, which I will look at in some detaU and direct one or two questions about makes it clear that a Prime Minister is not a person with no clothes. It ensures that he will be garmented, that he has every covering in regard to his dealings with the rest of the world and there is conferred on him and on a goverament immense power which can be wielded in an appropriate manner. that the reThe weapons are there and they deserve to be its forms, does not constitute an explored. The preamble to the proposed new section 39-whic h I have said is the heart of this legislation-is interesting in comparison with the present one under which the Governor General is given an umbretta power with respect to regulations on foreign exchange for two general purposes-for the protection of the currency or the public credit of the Commonwealth, or in order to conserve in the national interest the foreign exchange resources of the Commonwealth. That is the end of the 2 general powers. In clause 39 there is an additional power explicitly conferred on him, and that additional power relates to, in the words of the clause: foreign investment in Australia, Australian investment outside Australia, foreign ownership or control of property in Australia or of Australian propeny outside Australia or Australian ownership or control of propeny outside Australia or of foreign property in Australia. I hesitate to read that, but that should make the lawyers happy. So there is conferred quite explicitly on the Governor General the additional power concerning the nature of foreign investment to and from this country. The barriers are there to be raised if the Government desires to do so. Going to the substance of clause 39-and I will do so in only one or two minutes-in the original section of the Banking Act these powers to make regulations are made explicit in relation to currency, security and goods, and, the section concerns the powers of appeal. In the new provision these powers are delineated in terms of currency, securities, property, goods and the ability to deal with persons abroad. In addition to that there is a relationship proposed in clause 39 (5) (a) and (b) concerning bodies corporate inside and outside this nation, and it is in relation to that matter that I should like eventually to ask a tion. The question I should Uke to put ultimately relates to the intention of the Government in the utilisation of the section and in those consultations it will have with the Reserve Bank concerning the investment of Arab funds in Australia in property or in other areas. It is appropriate in these circumstances to explore that and I hope that an appropriate reply can be given. It is a policy question. So we come back to the eventual phUosophical proposition. If there were a leakage anywhere the administration of domestic economic policy in Australia this would cover the leak. In fact, in terms of the fiscal and tax policies available Australia, a government now has complete conenterprise trol, unfettered and unchallenged control, with respect to money supply in this nation and the growth or the contraction of money supply. It made clear that the Government has almost decline complete control with respect to the most importo tant price in this nation. It has price controldecline-thi effective price control-wit h respect to the cost money, and that is the cost that is the most vasive and of the greatest significance in Australia. The proposed clause 39 puts aside aU arguments in relation to those matters. The Government has control over the money supply and over the price of money or the cost money; in fact, it has effective control with respect to interest rates. To make perhaps a itical comment on the matter, it means that when unemployment occurs in Australia, or when be inflation occurs in Australia, to claim the interthings national transmission of unemployment or inflation to this country is a piece of nonsense. Clause 39 makes it clear that such conditions overseas have no part to play and can no longer provide even a vague aUbi for what is happening in this nation. The alibi is stripped away. Therefore, when one looks at the money supply in this country and when one examines the rate of change in money supply, which has a great deal to do with interest rates avaUable in this nation, and when one refers to the new indices of money supply, M l , M2 and M3- I dislike using those terms; they sound rather like the British Secret Service-and when one looks at the first source of money supply over a period of five or six months onefindsit has decreased in absolute terms by something like $700m. That is essentially government-caused, because the compensating actions avaUable to a government to alter the money supply just have not been utilised. There is no excuse in the matter. I am not saying that it was necessarily incorrect to last reduce the rate of growth in money supply or to ques- reduce money supply, but it is governmentcaused. It cannot be ascribed to somebody outside this nation, and that is a piece of information which I know Government members will be anxious to convey to Mr Hawke and to the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam). They do not seem to have caught up with the fact that this Bill has been introduced. When one adds savings bank deposits and trading bank deposits to the money supply, there has been a contraction over the same period of time of something like $800m. Again, that has occurred because there has been in a dehberate, a calculated policy decision. When as a result of those matters we find that, to due to domestic economic conditions, private is retracting and actually reducing its production, when we find as a result of that that there is an actual physical decline in the work is force employed in Australia in the last month, a of 9,000 persons-and this is not a faUure grow quickly enough but an absolute, actual s has a relationship to the powers of which are proposed to be conferred under this perBiU. They are powers which the Reserve Bank always thought related to it and its administration of the various sections in the Banking Act. So conditions in Australia, the allocation of resources, the barriers behind which this econof omy can grow or develop, are man-made; they are not accidental. Australia is in no way prey to polexternal sources or external conditions. We only ask that in the use of this power the Government careful and wise. And it is in relation to those that I ask the Minister, or those Treasury of officials who may be avaUable to advise him, how it is intended to use these powers in relation to the prospect of massive Arab investment in Australia. That question deserves to be answered, and it deserves to be answered with respect to 3 parts of clause 39 of the Bill. If I may digress for one moment, I would say this: The tariff powers in this nation are powers which are akin to, and rest on some of the same foundations as, the powers of the Reserve Bank in relation to money, exchange and foreign investment. I believe that if there is one mistake that has been made it was not the mistake of attempting to reduce the level of tariffs, it was the precipitate nature of that reduction and the grossness of the measure; but the necessary response in Australia to this slashing of tariffs did not occur. What had to be done was to secure within the powers that I have nominated the reallocation of resources in this country, to clear reallocation of resources in this country in an almost ultra private enterprise sense. Capital resources, human and material resources should have gone, and should have been enabled to go, to those areas where we could work at what we do best, and if there was a philosophical road block in respect of those matters it was that, having made the decision about tariffs, an interventionist socialist government could not of its nature allow the necessary reallocation of capital and of human resources to fulfil those purposes, to do what other Ministers have called those things that we can do best. If I may return in some detail to other aspects of this Bill: With respect to the Arab oil money it is known that the Arabs have available to them in other parts of the world something Uke $20,000m. I am old fashioned enough still to use the English terminology. It is known also that immense investments have been made in some enterprises in Europe. I understand that immense investments have been made in the Krupps works in Germany. Immense investments have been attempted to be made-mainl y equity-in other sources of energy or power, even oil, in other parts of the world. So it is quite clear that there has been an attempt to utilise this money to create something of a monopoly situation in those areas of world life. With respect to this nation, I ask: What would be the advice of the Government, if this Bill is passed, concerning clauses 39 (2) (j), 39 (5) (a) and 39 (5) (b)? Clause 39 (2) (j) and the 3 subsequent sub-clauses concern the control or prohibition of the control of property in Australia by persons. Will those clauses be utilised in relation to overseas investment of that type? Secondly, I ask in relation to clauses 39 (5) (a) and 39 (5) (b): In case corporations are involved in these transactions will regulations be made with respect to the corporations power under this section to prohibit or to encourage such investment or with respect to the circumstances in which there will be a prohibition or an encouragement of such an investment in this nation? I believe that those questions are allowable to be contemplated. I suggest that they were very important poUcy decisions which rested with the Government when this Bill was brought forward. If l may I wish to make one further point. philosophy of the Banking Bill makes it quite clear that the international transmission to a subservient nation of domestic problems overseas is a piece of nonsense. There may be difficulties in relation to the balance of payments situation, as there are now. The balance of payments situations may decline over the term of a year by something Uke $ 1,800m, $ 1,900m or $2,000rri, but appropriate compensating action can be taken in a variety of manners. I do not rule out the fact that thefiscalways of compensating for what is happening-the budgetary, taxation and public expenditure ways of compensating for it-ar e out of order. I have never said that, nor would I say it. It may be judged, for example, that for the purposes of full employment the fiscal, budgetary and expenditure policies should be utilised so as to cause more resources to be used than would otherwise be the case. In fact their use may cause 100,000 people less to be unemployed than would otherwise be the case, I do not say those things, but I ask: What is the Government's intention concerning that type of overseas investment? What is its intention concerning the use of these powers on that type of investment? This Bill makes it quite clear- I return to the 2 precise points-that in respect of changes in the money situation in Australia and changes in the nature of the credit squeeze in Australia a government is responsible and that in relation to the supply of money a government and the Reserve Bank are responsible. It also makes it quite clear that there is an unfettered control, not transmitted from overseas, over the cost of money, that is, the interest rates that are generally appUcable in this nation. They are some of the weapons with which the Government or, to use a term from history, the emperor is arrayed. What we want to know is: In respect of what matters, how and for what purposes will these powers be utUised?",80
30,Mr LUSHER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The Opposition supports this Bill. The intention of the Bill is to strengthen the exchange controls of this country and to eliminate tax avoidance, particularly through the use of tax havens. I do not regard this Bill as being in any way a political Bill, but I think it is important that some of the ramifications of it be aired. I also think that in this atmosphere we should remember that the previous Liberal-Country Party Government had made moves in this direction. It was realised then, as it is now, that there needed to be changes in the taxation administration and in the controls over funds going overseas and that all governments have a responsibility to the community to The see that these things are in fact implemented. I pay tribute to Mr Snedden and Mr MCMahon for initiating these moves in the previous Government. I also compliment the present Government on carrying them out. Under this legislation the Government will be seeking to exercise its complete constitutional power over overseas transactions. I tiiink that that is appropriate. It will do that by bringing under exchange control regulations all matters concerned with the flow of money and other financial assets out of Australia. I think is one of those powers which the Government has the responsibility to use to the fullest. Of course, it is in Australia's interests-shor t term, long term or any term-to ensure that we do have protection for the financial resources that exist in this country and that have accumulated within it. Under this legislation the Reserve Bank will be able to refuse applications for exchange control approval ifin fact the applicants have not sought from the Commissioner of Taxation an approval which clears the particular transactions for tax purposes. It will require people who want to move money around the world from Australia to satisfy the Commissioner of Taxation that there is no ulterior motive in their doing so, that there is no tax avoidance motive in their doing so and that they are doing so in the normal course of personal or business financial transactions. It seems to me that events in recent years, particularly during the mining boom, have drawn attention to the need totightenup the legislation of this nature. There can be little doubt, although there were significant abuses of the taxation legislation beforehand, that we now have a far greater degree of sophistication among our fellow Australians who are operating with big money, with hot money and with all sorts of money. The law definitely has been bent to fairly significant proportions. This legislation will have the effect of ensuring that Australian money is protected within Australia and that the professional rogues will not be able to shift money from Australia to tax havens or to salt it away in Swiss banks and things of that nature, particularly if there is a tax element involved. In this respect the actions of the Barton famUy come readily to mind. The Bartons, probably more so than anybody else, have abused the financial controls that operate in relation to the governing of the movement of funds out of Australia. They somehow managed to get out of Australia the enormous amounts of money which they had filched from the Australian investing public and put into their own back pockets. The significance of this has been borne out recently by the apparent decision to give the Bartons citizenship in Paraguay. I understand that, immediately that decision had been announced, Mr Barton made arrangements to purchase the largest dairy in Paraguay and also to take over a grazing property of quite significant proportions. There is no doubt in my mind, and probably no doubt in the minds of most honourable members in this chamber, that the money which is now being spent to purchase Paraguayan assets rightly belongs to small, medium and some that this larger investors in Australia. I think if we can achieve a situation-perhap s by the amendments proposed to this Bill-of ensuring that things like that cannot happen we will certainly go a long way towards protecting the assets of the Australian people and, naturally, of the country itself. There will always be people who are prepared to take advantage of loopholes in the law and people who will straight out set out to break the law to achieve their ends. By tightening this legislation we will have a position where it is more Ukely that the funds will at least be in Australia and that money gained by tax avoidance and by other Ulegal means, which so far has been going overseas, will remain in Australia. Perhaps there will be legislation providing for the recovery of that sort of money, if that should be required. If the money is still in Australia it will be that much easier to recover. A need for change has existed for a long time in this area of legislation and controls. Because of the sophisticated and increasingly sophisticated money markets throughout the world, and because of unscrupulous people who operate in this market, both within and without Australia, a great deal of pressure has been put on legislation as it exists. There has been much temptation for people to abuse the laws as they exist. It is a government's responsibUity-w e recognise it and the present Government recognises it-to see that the legislation which operates and gives power for these controls is kept up to a proper standard so that these practices are not allowed to continue. It was mentioned by my colleagues earlier in this debate that clause 39 is one of a quite critical nature. The Country Party wishes to support the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) and the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) in hoping that the changes to this < section will be comprehensive so that there will not be loopholes or ways in which people can slip around the provisions that will prevail as a result of this legislation. I think it is perfectly obvious from the history of mankind that it is basic to human nature that when legislation exists people will always seek to find ways around it. I do not have very much doubt, once these amendments have been implemented and the legislation has been altered, unscrupulous people will find other ways of avoiding tax and of moving funds outside Australia, one way or the other. It is to be hoped that the Government, the Treasury, the Taxation Commissioner and other responsible bodies will keep an ear to the ground to find out what these new methods are and what loopholes have been created, and to ensure that these are again closed. If we are able to keep on making sure every time another discrepancy occurs or a loophole is discovered that we close it quickly, we should be fairly successful, I would suggest, in keeping for Australia what rightiy belongs to Australia and also ensuring that the revenue itself is not denied contributions which should in fact be paid to it. It is Australia's nnancial resources that concerned about in this Bill. To a lesser extent, suppose, the Budget also is involved. The amount of money which is involved is probably not significant enough to have a serious effect budgeting but it is Australia's resources and assets of Australian people, as opposed to the community and to the society, that are at stake when we are dealing with these unscrupulous company promoters and people of that nature. I suggested earlier- I say it again-tha are able to keep these funds in Australia we wiU have gone a long way towards being able to recover them and to repay them to the people whom they belong. I think it is worth pointing out also that this is a worthwhUe proposal. amendments are good and so long as the queseconomy tion about clause 39 can be answered satisfacof torily they will certainly improve the position Australia. But it should be mentioned that we have to take these moves, as with other moves, the context of a total package or a total policy. We must be able to look at this tax measure along with the overall tax laws which exist. Although I commend the Government on closrights. ing these loopholes, action taken in the context of a total legislation, tax rates and general tax laws. If this term situation which are can be done I thmk we would again have gone a long way towards solving the problems that we face in this economy, of which tax avoidance the movement of funds is only a part. We should be looking at the question of the total role of ation in the economy-wha t importance it has revenue, what effects it has both socially economically on people-and seeing in what ways the total Australian tax structure and legislation can be revised and a situation developed whereby we are operating under a under total impact pohcy. This extends, of course, right throughout the economy because as soon as we start getting involved in taxation we will become involved in supply and demand, company profits, personal earnings, expenditure, consumer price indexes, inflation and, ofcourse, unemployment. I do not want to travel wide of this Bill. I would have thought that a significant number of occasions are made avaUable for us to speak about the overaU economic poUcy of Australia. But it cannot be stressed enough that we need to get away from the wishy-washy sort of approach that the Government is taking towards this particular pohcy at the moment, the patches and pieces approach to changing this and to changing that, with all the reversals of decisions that we have seen in recent months from the Governwe are ment, Caucus and the Australian Council of I Trade Unions. We need to develop a pohcy so that Australia knows what economic policy is operating, what taxation pohcy is operating and on what loopholes there may be or may have been the so that people have a total understanding of what they can expect to do with the funds that are at their disposal. I tliink this is critical to democracy. It is critical to free enterprise, whether or not the Government chooses to accept that phrase. It is critical to the whole t if we gamut of Australian life. If we are not prepared to give people the to ground rules under which they are operating and under which they can expect to operate for a sigThe nificant period of time, we cannot expect the to be prepared to function on any sort logical basis or on any sort of long-term basis. in If in fact we are not prepared to exercise or to allow people to exercise their democratic rights in and to exercise the comrol and the direction of the funds that are at their disposal, we are not doing therightthing by our people. We are living in a democracy and people do have the It is very important to me and to most should perhaps be porters ofofthe members this Opposition-in fact to some supGovernment, which is to their overhaul of tax credit-that people made aware of the long aspects of their Uves. surrounds all these different and If we can say to people: 'You can operate with a fair degree of confidence on these guidelines taxfor the next four or five years', that is going to to make people content; that is going to allow and people to make investment decisions, and so many other decisions, which will affect the tax Uvelihood of this country and the future of the economy. Taxation, about which we are talking this legislation, is part of that. It is a very vital part ofit because people have to make long term planning decisions in the light of the taxation liabilities they will have. They have to be able to make long term decisions in relation to investment, depreciation and payments back and fonh between overseas subsidiaries, the parent company and associates. They have to be able to make decisions in the light of the fact the amendments contained in this legislation will close taxation loopholes. We are not opposing the amendments; we are supporting them. I am calling on the Government and the Treasurer, whoever he may be at the moment, as soon as possible to give to Australian industry and to the residents of this country and to the taxpayers of this country a basic document, a basic statement, setting out the overall and total economic approach of this Government. We have to be able to give to the people the ground rules on which they will be able to operate on a long term basis. This in turn will have run through effects on the whole economy, because it will have an effect on employment and unemployment. If investment is able to stan winding up again then jobs will be made available. It is only by doing things such as this that jobs will be made available. Such actions will affect the rate of inflation and the rate of government expenditure in this country, having in mind the relationship between the public sector and the private and ordinary tax paying sector. I appeal to the Treasurer and to the Government to look closely at all of these matters because by means of this legislation we are taking a step- I commend the Government for it-in sayhonourable ing: 'OK, this is a situation which has to be this is a situation which must be altered'. We are losing millions of dollars overseas every year in straight cash terms which are being used by Speakerratbags like the Banons to purchase assets in Paraguay. Because of tax havens the amount of money that is being lost to revenue is significant all. and growing. The Government has said: 'All right, we are going tofixthis'. I compliment Government for it. But let us keep the process tomoving. Let us say: 'We have done that and we are going to do this next, in the context overall philosophy which we are prepared to lay down for the Australian economy'. We must have an agreement between the Government and its trade union suppon so that these things will be accepted and understood by Labor movement-it s industrial wing and its political wing. The Opposition, for its pan, is perfectly prepared to accept from the Government a statement of its total overall economic strategy and planning. I am not going to say that we will agree with it, but at least the Australian community, the Austrahan people and the Austrahan taxpayers will know where they stand. We cannot that dispute-w e do not have the numbers to dispute-wha t the Government might seek to impose on the community. The fact that we do not have the numbers has enabled the Government to introduce many pieces of legislation and regulations which have created so much chaos in this fine community of Australia. If the Government had not had the numbers, we could have guaranteed and assured the Australian people that all of these things would not have happened. There have been several reversals in government opinion and in government policy in recent months. We seriously and sincerely call on the Government to say: 'We have nowfixedup this area of tax legislation; we have closed the loopholes and we are moving in the direction of seeing that the Australian legislation is able to operate on a satisfactory, sensible and rational basis'. The Government should then extend that action across the board to its other economic areas and poUcies. Let us have a total policy from the Government on how this country will be run, what the Treasury will dictate, and what will and will not happen over the next four orfiveyears.",82

Mr Garland- I rise on a point of order. I was not referring to that point but to the manner in which you addressed him, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I think it is uncalled for.",86
39,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,I do not think it is very courteous either of the honourable gentleman to continue to answer back to the Chair. I call the honourable member for Adelaide.,86
40,Mr HURFORD,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I have been waiting in this House to take part in this debate. Indeed, I thought that I would wait until there was something to answer in the debate before I made my contribution, but I have waited in vain. I must confess that I hope that not too many people had the misfortune to listen to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) who took his full 20 minutes on this subject. You were very tolerant, Mr Deputy Speaker, because he hardly touched on the subject of these 2 Bills during the time he was on his feet. He started by saying that he supported the Government in the matter of the Taxation Administration Bill 1974 and the Banking Bill 1974. He then strung together so many cliches that I hope nobody will have to read them. Indeed, as I said earlier, I hope that not too many had to listen to them. The fact is that the Government has taken an initiative in this matter for which, to my knowledge, the country has been waiting for 5 years. I entered this House in October 1969.1 can well recall the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) in early 1970 drawing attention to the tax havens which existed. The honourable member for Hawker is another Labor member from my own State of South Austraha. I can well recall the honourable member for Banks (Mr Martin), who is a Labor member from New South Wales, drawing attention to the existence of these tax havens. When we were in Opposition during that period from 1969 to 19721 also drew attention to the tax reform that was required in relation to tax havens. The one initiative that was taken in relation to this matter of tax reform during that period-the last 3 years of the 23 years of Liberal-Country Party Government and which I can support in any way-wa s the MCMahon Government's setting up of the Asprey Royal Commission into taxation. For the honourable member for Hume to sermonise on all of the initiatives taken by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government was an example of someone completely misleading this House. I say again what I indicated earlier: We have been waiting for all of this time for legislation in relation to tax havens. It is only the because of the extremely busy schedule of legislation which has been introduced since December 1972, when the Australian Labor Government took office, that we have had to wait this length of time, since we had a Labor Government in this country, to bring in measures such as these. So I am at least glad that the Opposition is supporting this legislation. Having heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) and the honourable member for Hume in particular, I state that, in constrast, I consider that the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) had a contribution to make to this debate. I will come to deal with his contribution in a moment. Having accepted that the honourable member for Lilley had a contribution to make, I mention again that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Hume in saying that they supported these measures did nothing but read other Government second reading speeches or generally sermonise on the need for taxation. They tried to use phrases of a kind they would use if they needed to rise in the House to support motherhood. It has been a sad debate from the point of view of the contributions from those 2 members of the Opposition. Let me go over the purposes of these 2 Bills once again. The first purpose is to take full advantage of the constitutional powers of the Australian Government in relation to exchange control regulation of the financial aspects of overseas transactions. The second purpose is to provide for the extra territorial application of the banking foreign exchange regulations. The third purpose is to include provisions that validate for the purpose of any civil proceedings, acts or transactions already entered into or which might be entered into in future without the proper exchange control authority, the right of the Government to prosecute persons for breaches of the banking foreign exchange regulations. Those purposes have been set out by the Treasurer (Mr Crean) in his second reading speech on the Banking Bill 1974. Similar purposes are set out in the Taxation Administration Bill 1974 as these are complementary measures. The honourable member for Lilley drew particular attention to the powers contained in the proposed new section 39. If I understood him correctly he pointed out that although these were powers which were held under the Constitution since the Constitution was formulated, in articulating them in this way in these Bills we were drawing attention not only to the powers but also, if I interpreted him correctly, to the great dangers in these powers. Mr Kevin Cairns- I was referring to the correct use of them. That is what I was interested in.",86
41,Mr HURFORD,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I stand corrected. Apparently, the honourable member was drawing attention to the fact that we must be watchdogs and make sure that the powers are properly used. I take his point. They are important powers. However, if I may coin a phrase, I think it is sleight of hand to expect that because these powers are now articulated in this way we can ex post facto suggest that the Government is responsible for the international transmission of inflation that has occurred in the past. Perhaps it could be argued that the Government by setting out these powers and using them wisely in the future has less excuse for the international mission of inflation. I add straight away that I would take issue with that but perhaps it could be argued. Certainly, one could not argue, as I think the honourable member for Lilley tried to argue during what was at least a novel contribution in contra-distinction to the contributions of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Hume, that the past was such that the Government could be blamed for the international transmission of inflation. That could not be so. But let us just talk about the future. I do not believe in any way that the proposed new secuon 39, if used properly, will do anything but ameliorate the effects of the internauonal transmission of inflation. As the honourable member for Lilley well knows-h e is one of the few Opposition members who knows anything about this subject of economics-the fact that an importer of timber in this country is obliged to pay so much more for a cargo of timber from the west coast of America could not be affected by the new section 39 unless one imagined that those powers could be used in some way to alter exchange rates in relation to just that one importation of timber.

You disagreed with that submission before the Chair, but the fact remains that there can be a point of order on whether or not a vote has been taken.

128,Mr DALY,PAIRS," Mr Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit convenience of the House to have a general bate covering this Bill, the Queensland Grant (Clare Weir) Bill and the Queensland Grant (Proserpine Flood Mitigation) Bill, as they associated measures. Separate questions will course be put on each of the Bills at the conDam, clusion of the debate.",92
129,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these 3 measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",92
130,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"These 3 basically BiUs, the Queensland Grant (Bundaberg Irriect gation Works) Bill, the Queensland Grant (Clare Weir) Bill and the Queensland Grant (Proserpine Flood Mitigation) Bill, the sition regard as imponant and urgent. The Queensland Grant (Bundaberg Irrigation believes Works) Bill provides some $4.4m to the the Queensland Government for the cost of buUding some of the works associated with phase 1 of stage 1 of the Bundaberg Irrigation program. The Queensland Grant (Clare Weir) Bill pronot vides $3m to the Queensland Government towards the cost of constructing a weir on the Burdekin River near Clare. The Queensland Grant (Proserpine Flood Mitigation) Bill provides $125,000 to assist in the contraction of needed flood mitigation works on the Proserpine position. These 3 BUls have the suppon of the OpIn expressing that suppon, I think there 1974 are several matters that should be raised by me Second Reading in this debate in relation to the nature of on Queensland's funding program for water resource works in Queensland. Last year Cabinet approved a document submitted by the Minister for the Environment and Conservation (Dr Cass) on water resources management. The basic phUosophy expressed in that Third Reading document was stated to be: The conservauon, development and management of water resources must take place in the broader framework not only of development and management of resources generally, but. of the overaU economic, environmental and social planning. The phUosophy of that approach has the suppon of the Opposition. We have long recognised the Second Reading fact that dams should not be built solely to provide water, however imponant that might be. They should be buUt to provide suppUes of water resources bearing in mind the need of the community-whethe r it be urban or rural-for the water resources, and taking appreciation of the fact that wastage or depletion of resources, whether they be soU, water, vegetation or umber, on this be kept to the absolute minimum. the With respect to the Queensland Grant (Bundedaberg Irrigation Works) Bill, the Opposition appreciates that this further grant to the Queensland Government foUows a grant by the are former Liberal-Country Party Government of of $12.8m for the construction of the Monduran the Gin Gin channel and the construction of a pumping station to Unk the Kolan and Burnett Rivers. The construction work on this project during the past year has been held up by unseasonal conditions. Heavy rain and, at times, flooding have resulted in the works program faUing behind. The $4.4m provided under this Bill is to meet the escalating costs of the projwhich mainly stem from inflation and rising wage rates. It has been some time since the request was made by the Queensland GovernOppoment for the $4.4m supplementary grant. I should Uke to put on record that the Opposition that this sum may not be enough to meet works program envisaged in this Bill because of the factors I have enumerated. Whether the estimates given are sound or not, nothing in recent times indicates that the inflationary trend is still on the upward spiral and in that case, of course, the $4.4m wiU not be enough. Mr Mc Veigh-Too Uttle, too late.",92
131,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"It is better to get something some of the time, I suppose, but my friend the honourable member for Darling Downs is pretty right. If this is the case, I think the Government should immediately consult the Queensland Government to assess what further supplementary funds are necessary. We cannot have a project of this kind held up simply because of the economic policies of this Government and inflationary trends cutting into the amount of money allocated for it originally. The importance of this project to the Bunalso daberg district cannot be overstated. The Buncaused daberg area is one of the most important agriculirresponsible tural regions of Australia. It is a centre of diversified farming and pastoral activity. The provision of irrigation will improve this diversity, lift farm efficiency and create a greater amount of stability for producers. Those are objectives that we should all be prepared to suppon, and the Opposition supports them. In past decades rural production in the Bundaberg area has been at times severely affected by protracted droughts and on occasions extensive flooding. The comcourse pletion of the works provided for in this Bill reduce the likelihood of such natural disasters causing the amount of damage that they have caused in the past and will reduce their effect. For example, the 1964 drought not only perity severely retarded rural production in the BunI daberg area but also caused delays in the return of farm production to normal levels. Over the past 5 years particularly the diversity of duction in the Bundaberg region has become more pronounced, thereby making this proposed work even more important. Soya bean cropping is now widespread. The acreage of sugar planted has increased and the acreage of summer grain crops has increased. The acreage involved in beef production has also increased. With the exception of beef production, these primary industries are among the most viable at present in Australia. The Opposition welcomes this diversity, bedaberg lieving that it will give a commensurate improvement in farm income and stability for the region. However, I suggest to the GovernMinister ment, in addition to the suggestion made, that more funds should be provided, that the Government should give urgent consideration to where these works could be used in viding employment opportunities under the Regional Employment Development Scheme. That is a good place to use some of these funds. Mr Hewson-Productiv e works.",93
132,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"That is so. Escalation of employment opportunities, for example, by the subcontracting of works associated with the Bundaberg irrigation program, with finance being drawn from the RED grants would allow the entire program to return to its normal schedule and so overcome the delays caused by bad weather conditions last year and this year. It would provide needed job opportunities for people displaced from work due to the downturn-this is an important factor in relation to these Bills-particularl y in the beef industry and in the manufacturing industries of the area by the Government's regressive, harsh, economic policies. I have not exhausted the adjectives I would like to use in relation to the Government's economic pohcies. I know for a fact that early this month, on 7 November, the Prime Minister (Mr whitlam) visited the area in which the Bundaberg irrigation works are being undertaken. I also understand that the point was made that the escalation of the program of construction of these works would provide employment opportunities-of it would. I believe the suggestion is a good will idea and I recommend it to the Government. The water that will be stored as a result of this program and later used in production will undoubtedly contribute to a wider and fuller prosfor the district in terms of local production. interpose here that this scheme was introduced by the former Liberal-Country Party Government. I personally welcome the proposal and I prourge the Government to give sound and serious consideration to my suggestion that the work be expanded. In a project of this kind the completion of the work at the earliest possible time is an important factor. It is an imponant factor at any time. It is doubly imponant when we are faced with escalating costs and with spiralling inflation which in my view will continue at a greater rate-althoug h I am sorry to have to say that-tha n at the present time. The completion of this project will, as the Minister has said, almost completely protect the sugar industry in the Bunregion against the ravages of water stress. That is very important in that area, an area which has suffered very greatly as I am sure the would agree, as a result of water stress already over the years. Such an achievement is commendable. It is proworth while remembering at this time-and I again make this point-that it was a Liberal Country Party Government that introduced the project. Do not let us forget that. Up to the time of its introduction-this is another point I want to emphasise-the Labor Party had not advocated a program for such a project in the Bundaberg area. So the credit for introducing and instigating",93
133,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,Rubbish . You do not know what you are talking about. Read some of my reports.,94
134,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"Look, your policies are not often accepted by the Government anyhow. So it would not matter much what you said to the Government as far as I can see. At the time of its introduction the Bundaberg area was represented politically at the State and Federal level by Labor members of Parliament but we did not hear much from them as to what should be done in this area. It was left to the Liberal Country Party Government to provide the scheme that is now being proceeded with. Those members could not appreciate the far-sighted needs for this project. Despite the comments of the Minister, the Liberal and Country Parties saw, recognised and acted upon them. I turn now to the Queensland Grant (Clare Weir) Bill. The Opposition supports the construction of the Clare Weir. I am sure that the Minister will be pleased to know that. The development of this weir on the Burdekin River near Townsville will improve the rural, commercial and urban utilisation of water flow in the Burdekin River basin. That of course, is a good thing. We appreciate this action. This development will improve farming conditions and provide substantial water resources which are necessary for local commercial undertakings and growing urban needs. The provision of $3m is well below the $3.8m sought by the Queensland Government not only for the Clare Weir but also for the Urannah Dam. It is very regrettable that the Government has not sought to act on the Urannah Dam proposal because the Opposition believes that the integrated development of the Clare Weir plus the construction of the Urannah Dam would improve the water resource storage position of the area concerned. If the Minister is so influential in the Government why did he not have that incorporated in the legislation before us? Let him explain if he can why the Government has turned down this aspect of the total concept.",94
135,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,Tell us how much you gave the Urannah Dam in 23 years?,94
136,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"Australia increasingly in the future must look forward to developing wherfaUacy ever possible its opportunities to become more a major food supplier to the world. The asked why we did not do it for 23 years. In wer to him I say that we were progressing favourably. We were agreeable together with the Queensland and New South Wales governments in regard to the construction of the Pike Creek Dam, which is now known as the Glenlyon Dam. What did this Government do in regard to this project? It walked out on it. It repudiated the undertaking given by the Liberal-Country Party Government to construct this dam on a 3-way basis. The worth of the dam is demonstrated by the fact that the Queensland and New South Wales Governments short as they are of funds which have been denied them by this Government, are prepared to go on and construct the dam out of their own resources. It is a shame that this type of approach to water conservation has been taken by this Government. The Minister at the table was not every concerned about this project because his electorate does not happen to be near it. He lives in another part of Queensland and he does not worry very much about anywhere else. Austraha increasingly must look forward to its development with respect to becoming a bigger food suppUer in the world. The construction of the Clare Weir and the Urannah Dam would have aUowed Australia to help to meet its obligations for this grave international need. Despite the low market for beef this prospect is standing out as one of the great problems confronting the world today. In this country we can play a very substantial part providing it has the assistance of the Government that is in office and providing that we have a reasonably sound economy. But that is something that this Government cannot provide. It is regrettable that the Government has not sought to go on with the proposal to give financial assistance for the development of the Urannah Dam. The grant for the Clare Weir is dependent on the Queensland Government carrying out further development works worth $1.6m. It is interesting to note that the Queensland Government has been criticised for not cooperating with the Federal Government. It will co-operate as long as it has a reasonable chance to co-operate and providing the conditions under which the funds are advanced are consistent with the ideas of the Queensland Government and do for not cut across State rights. The fact that the Queensland Government has to provide $1.6m Ulustrates this particular point. This shows up the of the argument of the Prime Minister of (Mr Whitlam) that he cannot get co-operation Minister from the Queensland Government when it anscomes to projects which are necessary to improve the economy of Queensland. The Queensland Government is anxious to get money on any reasonable terms to develop the State. I would now like to turn to the Queensland Grant (Proserpine Flood Mitigation) Bill. Again the Opposition fully supports the project. The Minister for Northern Development sitting at the table will be fully aware of the grave problems which the Proserpine River Valley has encountered through repeated floods. An amount of $120,000 is to be made available by the Commonwealth for this project. Also $120,000 will be made available by the Queensland Government and $60,000 by the Proserpine River Improvement Trust. So here again the Queensland Government is playing its part and the people of the Proserpine River Improvement Trust are also playing their part. I pay a tribute them for what they are doing. This program has the full support of Queensland Government. However, it should be pointed out that the Federal Government has den agreed only to the first year of the program. has it done that? Why not go on and see it finished? Is the Commonwealth Government going to let the load fall just on the Queensland Government? Will it let whatever load is after that time fall on the Queensland ment or will it come to the party later on? The Queensland Government has no guarantee that the Commonwealth Government will come in part later. The Queensland Government has to go into the project and do its best. It will see project through. The State Government has put up the balance of thefinancefor the remaincally ing years of the program. That is a shocking state of affairs. The Minister will claim that he has some apbition preciation of the need for this sort of work but is prepared to walk out at the end of 1 year let the Queensland Government with its limited funds carry the burden of the rest of the program. gram. This brings into question the sincerity the Government in relation to the conservation of Queensland river water resources. gram on the Proserpine River designed to reduce flooding.",94
137,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,Were does it say that? You do not even know the Act.,95
138,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"I know enough about it know that this Government is giving a lot money than it ought to be giving, and that something that the Minister could turn his attencommunity tion to rather than anything else. If he wants help the people in that area he should get money from the Federal Government. That what he wants to do. Criticising me will not the people in that area. He should get the Prime Minister to help these people. That is what he should do. If he concentrates on that he will be doing a good job for them. But he is not getting very far in his efforts. The program on the Proserpine River is designed to reduce flooding and protect soil, water resources, farm resources and urban resources. The Federal Government is prepared to meet only some of the commitment in the first year. If l do not know anything about this matter the Minister should tell me what is wrong with that contention. He should tell me all about it. When he replies he should tell me how much more he will do for the people in this area. If the Government has any sincerity at all in this program it should to look at widening and continuing its involvement until the completion of the program. This Government, which holds the purse strings of the the nation, is making the Queensland Government which is short of funds carry the share of the burthat it should not have to carry. It is doing a Why wonderful job in accepting this load in the area of north Queensland and in accepting the responsibility to provide water which can be used for food production that is so desperately needed left throughout the world and will become more Governdesperately needed as time goes on. I find it is almost hypocritical on the Minister's to say that this Bill was in keeping with the Australian Government's positive and constructhe tive approach towards flood damage restoration to and flood mitigation. The Government is basikeeping its commitment down in the funding of the Proserpine flood mitigation project program to what I would regard almost as a low as possible level. I think it is a disgusting exhiof the lack of interest and lack of governhe ment appreciation of the problem that faces the and people in that area. I believe that the Government should review its commitment to this proI ask the Minister at the table to do that. of Although I might wish him well, I do not think he has any hope of success in persuading the It is a proGovernment to do it. I believe that the Government should review its commitment so as to ensure that the completion of this project will not be jeopardised because of the penny-pinching attitude of the Comto monwealth towards providing finance for a less worthwhile and urgently needed undertaking. is The program is not only in the interests of the of the Proserpine River valley but it to is also in the interests of the total community. It more covers a wider field than just the Proserpine is River valley. The Government needs to recoghelp nise that any efforts which will reduce the severity of natural disasters affect all Australians to some degree, and a reduction of flood frequencies along the Proserpine River through this program deserves a commitment in the national interest. It is to the very great credit of the Queensland Government that it is prepared to find the balance of the funds above the miserable amount that the Australian Government is going to give, which cut out at the end of one year. Honourable members on the Government side who are interjecting should have a look at the Bill. I believe the honourable member for Kingston would be prepared to support me in this if he had a look at the Bill. Anyone with a reasonable amount of common sense would certainly do that. In recent weeks the Labor Government has decided to intrude in the Queensland election campaign, using the claim that the Queensland Government is jeopardising the opportunities of Queenslanders to receive funds from the Commonwealth Government. I say that they are accepting",95
139,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,So it is.,96
140,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,You would not know. You just interject for the sake of interjecting. The point is that the rejection of whatever Commonwealth funds have been rejected by the Queensland Government has been because the Commonwealth has sought only to extend those funds where they have strings attached to them. That is the basic reason for the rejection. You will not get the Queensland Government to accept funds from an Australian Government which is attaching strings to those funds to enable it to have its own centralist policies adopted in Queensland. (Government members interjecting).,96
141,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! Interjections will cease and the honourable member will address the Chair.,96
142,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"Yes, Mr Speaker. I am very pleased to do that because it is much nicer looking at you than at some of the people who are making the interjections that are flying around. It is a real relief. I repeat that the reason for the rejection by the Queensland Government of whatever Commonwealth Government funds have been rejected has been because those funds have had strings attached to them and the acceptance of the funds would jeopardise the sovereignty of the State. Do not forget that. That is important, and I do not say it lightly. The 3 Bills that we are now debating show the reverse of the argument that the Government has been using in respect of the Queensland Government. The Queensland Government is accepting funds from the Commonwealth for the construction of these 3 projects. That indicates its willingness to go along with any reasonable and sensible program. It is important to remember that in regard to one program, the Proserpine flood mitigation program, the Federal Gvernment is making what I regard as the least possible commitment, and I emphasise that point again to the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson). He should know that area as well as anybody and he ought to be ashamed of the miserable part that the Australian Government is playing in that program. With regard to the other 2 projects, the Bundaberg irrigation program and the Clare Weir, the Commonwealth is providing what I would think could be inadequate finance in view of the inflation which has been promoted in large part by it. The Commonwealth Government has also declined to fund wider programs of assistance involving these 2 areas, programs which have been suggested by the Queensland Government after careful study. No matter what the Minister says, they were suggested by the Queensland Government The programs are supported by the Queensland Government and it will support any reasonable project on the same basis. Criticism has been levelled at the attitude of the Queensland Government towards the operation of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation as a consultant to the Federal Government on future water conservation and flood mitigation programs. The Government has argued that the Corporation should not have to listen to the arguments of the Queensland Government on priorities for projects. Why? Why should not the Queensland Government, elected by the people of Queensland, be heard? Why should the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, whatever its capacity, usurp the duties of the Queensland State Government, or any other State government? And this is what Government supporters want, judging from their interjections. Is that what they want? They want a statutory authority to take over the State Government. Of course they do. That is their objective. I totally reject this argument by the Government. The argument fails to recognise that the Queensland Government and its authorities have a deep and intense knowledge stemming from many years of research and study into water conservation and flood mitigation needs, and I believe that it consequently should be involved in full consultation with the Commonwealth. The Queensland Government is quite prepared to consult with the Commonwealth Government. Is that not the democratic method of operation? Do you want the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation to override the Queensland Government just because the Corporation has some expertise in the field? Is that what honourable members on the Government side feel about democratic government? This Government is quite obviously trying prevent the Queensland Government from drawing up a list of priorities which are more tune with the needs of Queensland and which are based on the Queensland Government's own experience. It is rejecting the right of the Queensland Government to question in governpartment ment to government talks the priorities and evaluations decided upon by the Snowy Mounthing tains Engineering Corporation. Of course we erty should allow the Queensland Government to question those priorities. Of course we should. This is a federation, and the voice of the Queensland Government, and of any other State government for that matter, should be heard in matters that effect their State. Unless away from the centralist ideals that this Government seems to have, then it is going to be to the very great disadvantage of the States of connection Australia. The attitude of the Queensland Government in this matter is a responsible one and a mendable one. If the Snowy Mountains Enginworthwhile eering Corporation is to operate effectively area of water conservation and flood mitigation within the States it must be directed by the ister to consult fully with the State Government and its agencies concerned. Now, is there any objection to that? Do Government members quite have any objection to the Corporation consulting with the State authorities? They certainly should not have any objection, but they are quiet Possibly they realise at long last the logic of argument I have put up. Not to allow the State Government and its agencies to consult with the Corporation is a retrograde step and is not in interests of democracy, it is not in the interests the people of Queensland. I should like to ask Minister for Northern Development what preciation he had of the great quality of Fred Haig, the chief man in that field. He was a very good man, and there are not many better authorities in this country on this subject than Fred Haig was. We still have in the State of Queensland and in other States people who are quite capable of evaluating water conservation proposals. Not to allow the State Government consult with the Commonwealth is to heighten the risk of coming to an ill advised and ill informed decision which could lead to the squandering of pubhc funds and the misuse of our natural resources. One point I want to emphasise again is that I completely refute the argument that the Queensland Government is not prepared to cooperate with the Federal Government in any to way. I claim that the Federal Government walked out on the Queensland and New South in Wales State Governments in regard to the Glenlyon Dam and left the project to them. To the credit of those States, they are going ahead with it, and only recently I heard that the Deof Aboriginal Affairs, which the Minister for the Capital Territory might know someabout, is quite interested in getting a propwhich bestrides that river that is going to be served by the Glenlyon Dam. There are some 2200 acres of potential irrigation land on the Queensland side. One Federal Government was quite prepared to use the water but was not prepared to provide the funds to build a dam to get we get the water supplied to mat area. The Opposition has made its position clear in with these Bills. It supports the Bills. I have made the points that I feel should be made in refutation of what has been claimed about the Queensland Government. The Queensland comGovernment is very anxious to proceed with projects. Indeed, it has proved that in in the many ways. The inland town of St George in Queensland has progressed favourably through Minirrigation. Dams have been built at Coolmunda and other inland areas of Queensland in which possibly a cost benefit analysis might not show as high a result as sometimes we look for. But, as I quoted earlier, the basic philosophy expressed by this Government is that the consernow. vation, development and management of water the resources must take place in the broader framework not only of the development and management of resources generally but also of the over the all economic environment and social platform. of That is what has happened as a result of the the great effort made by the Queensland Governapment in the matter of water conservation. I again urge the Minister for Northern Development and the Australian Government to be prepared to be a bit more generous about the providing of water for this the driest continent in the world. The provision of water is the very foundation of decentralisation. If the Governto ment has any ideas about decentralisation it must be prepared to support the construction of major water conservation projects in this country. It is not prepared to do so or, if it is, it pared to do so only in a very niggardly fashion. I conclude by saying that it is all very well for some of those honourable members who interjected during my speech tonight to be critical about this matter because so much of the water resources in the southern or south-eastern part of the Commonwealth has been harnessed to the very great advantage of that area, but we want to see the other States deriving the benefit that can be derived within that framework in their own areas which, of course, would be to the benefit of all the Australian people.",96
143,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS,"This evening we are discussing 3 Billsthe Queensland Grant (Bundaberg Irrigation initial Works) Bill, the Queensland Grant (Clare Weir) Bill and the Queensland Grant (Proserpine Flood Mitigation) Bill. The Opposition supports all 3 Bills. We welcome the fact that the ment has seen fit to bring these Bills on for bate this week. I must admit that I am wondering whether, if there had not been an election Queensland soon, these Bills would have been given precedence over all the hotchpotch of proposed legislation which has flown out of Labor Government's maladministration Australian economy. However, they are before us today. The Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson), who is at the table and whom I have known well for years, is a tralians Queenslander. He is a rugged Queenslander. I hope that he will get a degree of satisfaction of the measures which we are discussing tonight. I suppose the richness of the State of Queensland is gradually dawning upon the members of the Austrahan Labor Party. Enorup mous potential for growth in both resources development and population is possessed by large and outstanding State. It has the abiUty contribute to the overseas earnings of Australia. When the Labor Government came to office quite 2 years ago we had substantial overseas credit. It inherited a very healthy economy, including substantial overseas credits. But what damage it has been able to wreak upon them just 2 shon years. We are now getting back to problems we had before 1960. A balance of ments problem will be facing this nation as as the problems of unemployment and inflation if the Labor Government does not grasp the sigoffice nificance of overseas earnings. Of course, the development of the richness of central Queensland can help enormously in this respect. I am pleased to see that areas like Bundaberg, Proserpine and the Burdekin have been included in these measures. When one talks about decenis pretraUsation one should not be so concerned about grandiose schemes like Albury-Wodonga; one needs to be concerned about areas which have shown potential and which have been known for decades to have potential. As with many other things, the Labor Government has been rather slow to recognise this simple fact of life. The Queensland Grant (Bundaberg Irrigation Works) Bill provides for the allocation of an additional $4.4m for the completion of certain works to the first stage of the Bundaberg irrigation program. The original Act of 1970 aUocated $ 12.8m. Of course, with the increases in cost of materials and manpower an additional $4.4m has to be allocated to cover this stage. This irrigation project is just as significant to the Australian economy as it is to the Queensland economy because it is in a vast cane growing area. We are all aware of the tremenGoverndous world prices being obtained today for desugar. Sugar is significant not only to the world economy but also to the Queensland and Ausin traUan economy. This project not only will help the sugar industry and the cane growers but also will have an impact upon the urban development the of the Bundaberg area and the growing indusof the trial base of the region. The Government ought to realise and all Ausought to realise that the reason for the introduction of this Bill is the substantial rate of out inflation within the Australian economy. Let us examine the position in this respect. This additionalfinancewould not have been needed if the Labor Government had been able to manage economy. This Bill is simply designed to take the necessary increase in cost caused by inflation. Let us again look at the Government's this record in that respect. It came to office into December 1972 with a rate of inflation of about 5 per cent in the Australian economy. Inflation is not now running at 4 times at least-probabl y 5 times-that rate. That is another record of the Labor Government. It has achieved a record rate of inflation just as it has achieved a record rate of in unemployment. It is amazing to me how long it the has taken the Government to learn a few simple payfacts of life. It has graduaUy dawned on the well Government that wage demands, which it mUitantly supported in the early days of its taking by having the PubUc Service as a pacesetter and by allowing some of its Ministers, people who ought to be responsible in government, to encourage militant trade unions to use their muscle in their wage demands, are one of the reasons why this Bill is before us. This Bill provides for an increase of $4.4m in the expenditure on the Bundaberg irrigation scheme. I move on to the Queensland Grant (Proserpine Flood Mitigation) Bill. It seeks to provide for a much smaller amount-$120,000 . In his second reading speech the Minister for Northern Development said: The purpose of this Bill is to enable a grant of up to $120,000 to be made available to Queensland for the construction of urgently needed flood mitigation works on the Proserpine River. The grant is conditional upon matching expenditure being provided by the Queensland Government and the Proserpine River Improvement Trust on the basis of 40 per cent Federal, 40 per cent State and 20 per cent local authority contributions and is consistent with the Government '5 overall approach to the Fine words. Nobody can argue with them. I wish the Minister could have more success in convincing his Cabinet and Caucus colleagues of the importance of flood mitigation right throughout the State of Queensland-indee d right throughout the Australian nation. The Minister mentioned the floods of 1974 and the need for flood mitigation schemes. course, such schemes are necessary not only the Proserpine area; they are necessary also in central and northern Queensland. Look at the havoc created by the January 1974floodsin the city of Brisbane. In my own electorate of MCPherson nearly 2,300 homes were inundated. The need forfloodmitigation works goes far yond this Bill. The principle provided for in the Bill of 40 per cent Federal, 40 20 per cent local authority contribution is desirable, but the amount of money involved in this instance is not large and its provision should extended. The Gold Coast City Council, which in my electorate, has put flood mitigation schemes to the Government only to have them rejected time and time again by the Prime Miniseral ter (Mr Whitlam), the Treasurer (Mr Crean) almost every signincant Labor Minister. We tries want to see the share of responsibility accepted by the Federal Government extended far becourse, yond Proserpine. We want to see it extended right throughout Queensland, to the benefit only of the people but also of the resources property of the State. The third Bill with which we are dealing is Queensland Grant (Clare Weir) Bill, which seeks the allocation of $3m initially for the ginning of what I hope one day will be a very great scheme on the Burdekin River. We are all Premiersaware that the Burdekin River is one of the great underdeveloped water resources of the Australian nation. As was pointed out by the Minister in his second reading speech there are flood plains in that area which have great potential for agricultural development. The Clare Weir scheme has prospects for flood mitigation which are desirable. It is not being developed for agricultural purposes only. It will be of long term benefit for the generation of power. If we are to have a growing industrial base we must have power resources available to us. It is the beginning of what I hope will be a substantial and successful development of the Burdekin area in northern Queensland. I wish to quote again from the Minister's second reading speech. In referring to the State of Queensland he said: Clare Weir represents the first significant step in a partnerproblem offloodmitigation. ship Basin. with the State in the development of the Burdekin This is where trouble has occurred between the Federal Government and the Queensland Government. There should not be conflict between the 2 Governments. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) continues to say-quite falsely in my view-that the Federal Government is being obstructed by the Queensland Government. The Of Queensland Government will co-operate with in the Federal Government in anything that is in the interest of the State of Queensland. But what we will not accept and what the Bjelke-Petersen and Chalk Government will not accept is domination and confrontation. It will not accept approaches by the Federal Government which beare designed to take away the State's responsibilities. The Labor Government has to appreciper cent State and ate this fact. So far as the Queensland Government is concerned, no problem exists in relation to co-operabe tion between the Federal Government and the is Queensland Government. The Queensland Government's approach is that on any reasonable proposition it will co-operate with the FedGovernment. If the Labor Government tries and to dominate the Queensland Government and to take away from a constitutionally elected State government its constitutionalrightsthen, of the Federal Government cannot expect to get co-operation. Honourable members will not see- I notice the honourable member for Bowand man (Mr Keogh) nods his head-o n 7 December that the people of Queensland substantially support the point of view I have just stated. After all, the the Government is dealing with a State government which has been in office since 1957 and bewhich has a substantial majority. It is dealing with a State government that under 3 prestigous Mr Keogh-Who were they?",98
144,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS,"Sir Francis Nicklin,  There has been enormous growth and development in Queensland. If we compare the situation since 1957 with what happened under almost 30 years of Labor administration during which we struggled on with hardly any development at all, we see that in that 17 years of Country-Liberal Party Government there has been an explosion of growth. If the Federal Government had a Treasurer like Sir Gordon Chalk it would not be making changes within its Ministry, as is apparently going on within the Australian Government. If the Labor Party had somebody with the capacity to administer the economy of Australia-suc h as Sir Gordon Chalk has administered the economy of Queensland-the Government would not have to be changing its mind about economic policies. Mr Keogh-Would he be a better Premier than Joh?",99
145,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Bowman interjects but I want to say to the Minister at the table that he ought to be careful because we have seen what has happened to the Minister for Defence one day, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs the next day, the Treasurer the next day, and so on. It might get down to the Minister for Northern Development one of these days. The Government might have a Cabinet reshuffle involving the Minister for Northern Development. I ask honourable members to examine the management of Queensland. I ask them to examine the Budget introduced recently by Sir Gordon Chalk. If they do so, they will see effective management of an economy, which is another lesson the Labor Government could learn. As I said earlier, these 3 Bills have the position's support. We regard them as desirable. After 2 years in office the Labor Party Government has grasped-onl y in the last couple of weeks-the significance of the fact that ifit wants to have social reform the private sector of the economy has to be doing well. In 2 years the Labor Government has managed to rind out that if it wants social reform someone has to pay for it. If the Labor Government is going to belt business and belt the private sector so that they lack profits and cannot pay taxes, there cannot be social reform. I accept that the Government has learnt that simple lesson. I ask honourable members opposite to address their minds to another aspect of this matter and to forget their obsession with centraUsm. Centralism will not work any more than will sociaUst objectives. The Government should try to accept that we have State governments.",100
146,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The 3 BUls before the House have nothing to do with sociaUsm.,100
147,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I simply wanted, in refening to the cooperation between the Queensland Government and the Federal Government, to demonstrate that the Government could by co-operation with the Queensland Government, have an effective Australian Government. The Government should attempt to have co-operation with the States rather than attempt to have centraUst domination. If the Government adopts this sort of approach I am sure that in the future it will have the greatest co-operation with the States and the Australian nation as a whole. If the Government takes this attitude it will deserve and will receive great credit and benefits from the resources and riches of the State of Queensland.",100
148,Mr KEOGH,PAIRS,"It is interesting to hear the Opposition this evening-reluc tantly though it might be-suppor t the passage of these 3 BUls through the House. I want to refer in particular to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson). Mr Kevin Cairns-They were very good too, I thought.",100
149,Mr KEOGH,PAIRS,"Yes , some of the comments made by the honourable member for MCPherson were certainly signincant. I was quite disappointed when I gave him the opportunity to speak in respect of the Treasurer of Queensland that he did not admit-as both the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and Sir Gordon Chalk have admitted-that a happier situation would exist in Op- Queensland if Sir Gordon Chalk were leader of the coalition government and Premier of Queensland than exists under the Joh BjelkePetersen regime. I am sure, Mr Speaker, that I am entitled to compliment the honourable member for MCPherson. Although he was not prepared to admit it openly, I could see by the smile on his face at the time when I interjected that he was quite prepared to agree with me that Sir Gordon Chalk would be a better Premier than Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Of course, this does not go quite far enough. If given the opportunity the honourable member for MCPherson would probably admit also that there would be greater cooperation between the Queensland Government and the Federal Government. That cooperation can be carried out effectively by the passage of these 3 Bills. These BUls indicate how Queensland can benefit from co-operation with the Federal Government. I am sure that the honourable member for MCPherson would agree with me that there would be greater co-operation  ment and the Premier of Queensland. Of course, on 7 December the people of Queensland will be showing this nation how they feel.",100
150,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member having said that, I now ask him to deal with the 3 Bills.",101
151,Mr KEOGH,PAIRS,"Yes , Mr Speaker, I certainly intend to do so. I was simply making a passing reference. When you gave that indulgence to the honourable member for MCPherson and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) they abused that privilege. I do not intend to do the same, Mr Speaker, as I have too much regard for your authority. The essence of these 3 Bills, of course, is the co-operation that this Government seeks from the State governments. The expenditure involved in these 3 Bills is $7.5m. I am sure this legislation will be approved by the House this evening. It is an excellent example of how the various governments in this nation can cooperate, co-ordinate and get on together. I am sure that the people of Queensland do not care who spends the money. This question was raised by the 2 previous speakers on the Opposition side. They endeavoured to reflect on this Government because of its acceptance of responsibility for the allocation of financial resources to the various States. They suggested that the finances allocated by this Government should be given to the States without any ties and that this Government should accept completely responsibility for the eventual allocation of financial resources. In effect, this Government would be recreant if it was prepared to do this. The Government realises that the taxpayers money must be expended to the best advantage. I could give excellent examples of how in the past when finance has been made available, particularly to the State of Queensland, the State Government has failed to use that money. I make passing reference to a disclosure which was made today and I do not concentrate on it to any extent because it does not concern the legislation before the House. I refer to the abject failure of the Queensland Government to expend the funds that were allocated by this Government within the last 12 months for government schools. Instead of taking advantage of this excellent opportunity for co-operation the Queensland Government, left to its own resources and given the money without any significant ties attached to it, failed miserably to carry out its responsibiliof ties. This Government, having allocated the funds provided for in this legislation, has a responsibiUty to direct how and when those funds should be spent. To Ulustrate this point, I would point out that the funds made available to government schools in Queensland in the 1 974-75 financial year amounted to $21,575,000. Mr Donald Cameron- I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. Apart from the fact that the honourable member for Bowman has been brought to heel by you a number of times, what have schools and educauon to do with the subject of the Queensland Grant (Bundaberg Irrigation Works) Bill, the Queensland Grant (Clare Weir) Bill and the Queensland Grant (Proserpine Flood Mitigation) Bill? We have had enough of you allowing the honourable member for Bowman his freedom.",101
152,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I agree with the point made by the honourable member for Griffith. I was waiting to see whether any schools were flooded. I call the honourable member for Bowman.,101
153,Mr KEOGH,PAIRS,"Obviously the honourable member for Griffith was not listening to my speech. I excuse him for being asleep at the time. I made my point. I am only giving these examples of how the Queensland Government, when left on its own to expend the money given to it by this Government, has faUed miserably in carrying out that responsibility. Ofthe $21,575,000 made avaUable to the Queensland Government for government schools in the last financial year, only $3,887,000 was expended. What does this mean? It means that when the Queensland Government had the opportunity to carry out in that State works vitally necessary to the development of that State and to use some of the available unemployed in the State, it has not been prepared to take that opportunity. This Government is giving the Queensland Government an opportunity to make good. In introducing the 3 BUls that we are debating this evening the Australian Government is giving the Queensland Government a further opportunity at last to show its bona fides and at last to show that it is prepared to be honest about the relationship that should exist between the States and the Australian Government. It is giving the Premier of Queensland, in his dying days as Premier of Queensland, an opportunity finally to come forward and to say honestly that he is prepared to co-operate with the Australian Government, that he is prepared to cast away the petty politically advantageous attitudes that he has adopted in the past, and that he is prepared, for the benefit the people of Queensland who currently are unemployed and who want to see these works carried out, to put forward every effort that he can muster on behalf of his Government to see that immediately these Bills become law the works provided for in them are carried into effect. The honourable member for Maranoa suggested this evening that there has been some delay on the part of this Government in providing the finance, in particular, for one of the ects covered by these Bills. But when speaking of delay, perhaps it is appropriate that I remind honourable members opposite that the Premier of Queensland has been singularly outstanding for the delays that he has caused in the past when approaches have been made by the Government for co-operation from the Queensland Government. As we are considering this evening works in relation to flood mitigation in Queensland, I think it appropriate to make some reference in passing to probably one of the most important flood mitigation projects in Queensland which will be carried out for many a long day. I refer to the pending construction of the Wivenhoe Dam. What is the attitude of the Premier of Queensland in regard to this project? To seek cheap political capital he suggested, by means of a propaganda Press release on 10 July, that Queensland would go it alone in the construction of the Wivenhoe Dam. Fortunately we have a very asture, alert and wide awake Minister in the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) who was able to prove the next day that the Queensland Premier had been dishonest in this claim that this Government had not been prepared to co-operate in the preparation of the designs and plans for the construction of the Wivenhoe Dam. My interest in this dam occasioned my asking a question of the Minister for the Environment and Conservation (Dr Cass) some few weeks ago. I was seeking information from him as just what was happening in relation to this very important flood mitigation program Queensland. He was able to tell me that March this year the Premier of Queensland received a letter from the Prime the Premier's views on the modification of the dam because, as the Prime Minister rightly asserted at that stage, if the Australian Government was going to assist the State Government it needed to know just what would be involved what nnancial contributions, if any, the AusLeader tralian Government would have to make. Let me remind honourable members that the Bills that we are considering tonight provide example of how well projects in Queensland can proceed, of just how effectively the important work necessary for the development of Queensland can be carried out, when the State Government is prepared to do what it is elected by the people of Queensland to do and to cooperate with the Government of this nation which has the responsibility of raising the necessary finances and providing those finances to the projState governments. Let me remind honourable members again that the people of Queensland are not interested in the petty political attitudes adopted by the Premier of Queensland when he suggests that taxpayers money should not be spent in Queensland simply because his paltry little 19 per cent Party in the Coalition Government of Queensland cannot have an absolute say on how that finance is to be expended. The people of Queensland want their money to be spent on the development of Queensland. They want a government which is prepared to cooperate with the Government that they elect to the national Parliament. I cite another example of the failure of the Queensland Government to co-operate with the Federal Government. When the Prime Minister wrote to the Premier of Queensland about this vitally important project that would in the future save Brisbane from a repetition of the disastrous flood that occurred earlier this year, the Premier of Queensland did not seefitto reply to the letter from the Prime Minister until September of this year. The Prime Minister the other day mentioned the numerous occasions on which he has written to the Premier of Queensland asking the Premier to co-operate with him in the various efforts that the Australian Government has been making to carry forward the development of Queensland. Only because of the embarrassment of the disclosures of last weekend was the Premier prepared to reply to the numerous letters from the Prime Minister. Of course, it is importo tant for us to realise that the Premier of Queensland is busily concerned with keeping Sir in Gordon Chalk from becoming Premier of in Queensland should the present coalition Government, by some mischance, be returned to Minister seeking office on 7 December. Mr Cross-O r Leader of the Opposition.",101
154,Mr KEOGH,PAIRS,"O r to prevent him from becoming, as my colleague the honourable member for and Brisbane (Mr Cross) reminds me, the next of the Opposition in that State. He is too busy with those problems with which he has been confronted. Although it is not appropriate 3 to stray too far from the Bills under discussion an this evening, let me remind you, Mr Speaker, that the Queensland Premier saved himself by his own proxy vote some time ago when his Party wished to cast him out as Leader. I invite the Premier of Queensland again this evening as we in this Parliament consider these 3 very important Bills for the development of Queensland to look once again at the opportunities that are being given for the development of Queensland. Those opportunities are typified in these Bills. I invite him to cast aside his narrow political attitudes of the past and, even at this late hour, use the example set by these 3 measures to accept the genuine opportunities that are offered to liim so frequently by this Australian Government elected by the same people that he believes put him into power, even though under the electoral gerrymander system existing in Queensland they had little opportunity to do otherwise. I invite him to accept these opportunities for the sake of the people of Queensland and to say that the bonafidesof the Labor Government have been excellently demonstrated in these important measures of flood relief and dam development provided for this evening in these 3 Bills. I invite the Premier of Queensland to say that in the future he will turn over a new leaf and do everything possible to co-operate with the Federal Government and to co-ordinate his plans with the plans of the Australian Government which, as I have said on three or four occasions this evening, has genuinely and continually sought to introduce into Queensland, money of the Queensland taxpayers for the development of that State in a responsible fashion. I wholeheartedly give my support to these 3 measures and I congratulate the Opposition for taking the attitude that it has taken in supporting them this evening.",102
155,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"I am deUghted to be able to support the remarks of the honourthese able member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) and the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson). I must take up a couple of the points mentioned by the honourable member for Bowwere man (Mr Keogh). I am not a betting man but he would Uke to have a littie wager on the side to who will win the Queensland elections I will take him on. I suggest to the honourable member that the Labor Party is a sinking ship and that should get off along with the rest of the crew. result of the Queensland election to be held on 7 December will prove this point. I would Uke to refute the statements made the honourable member in relation to unspent Commonwealth funds provided to the States. It is true that every State in the Commonwealth was unable to spend certain funds in certain areas. The main reason for this was the economic bungling of this Federal Labor Government. The finger can be pointed in the same way to every State, whether that State has a Liberal Country Party Government or a Labor Government. I suggest also that the honourable member should look at the expenditure of this Federal Government on the Albury-Wodonga project. Once again, expenditure on this project feU short of the mark. So I say to the honourable member Do not point thefingerof scorn at Queensland or any other State. Get your own house in order first. He also went on to say that the Premier of Queensland wiU not co-operate. He went on with all sorts of rubbish about letters being unanswered. If I were the Premier of Queensland I would not trust this Labor Government either. He has been given no reason to trust this Government. As a matter of fact, the people of this country do not even trust this Government any longer. Why should they? Mr Keogh-That is why they elected us on 18 May, is it?",103
156,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"Le t us have an election now and see how honourable members opposite fare. They were able to hoodwink the people on 18 May, but three or four weeks later they could not have won an election. Mr Eric Robinson-The honourable member for Bowman would not be back here again.",103
157,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"Yes . As the honourable member for MCPherson reminds me, the honourable member for Bowman would not be back. He was lucky to be returned to the Parliament last time. I beheve that the co-operation that has been received by the Government from the Opposition in relation to the projects covered by BUls is typical of the co-operation that will be received by this Government if it plays the game with the State of Queensland. I remind members of the Government that these projects all started prior to this Labor Government if coming to power. As a Queenslander, I support as these BUls. There are only 2 dams on the fringe of my electorate of Petrie. These are well up in the centre and the northern area of the State. he There are two very important purposes for buUdThe ing dams. One is for water conservation and the other is for flood mitigation. I think that all of us are aware of the problems that are being experiby enced right throughout this country in regard to flooding. The ravages offloodsare costing this nation hundreds of mUlions of dollars annually. All too frequently we find that dams are buUt with flood mitigation in mind but because of the excessive cost of construction and the need for water conservation so many of the dams that are built for flood mitigation are used as water storage dams. I wish to speak now in relation to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. On 23 October 1974 the honourable member for October. Leichhardt (Mr Fulton) asked a Dorothy Dixer question of the Minister at the table, the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson). The question asked on that occasion was in relation to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation water operating in Queensland. I want to put the relation record straight because the Minister was exconstruction tremely misleading in the answer he gave. Mr Hewson-He often is.",103
158,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"As the honourable member ority for MCMillan (Mr Hewson) reminds me, he often is. I wish to quote the answer of the Minisference ter that is recorded on page 2706 of Hansard. said: I understand that it is a fact that the Premier of Queensland is introducing legislation in the Queensland liament which will in effect ban the operations of the Mountains Engineering Corporation in Queensland unless with the express approval of the Premier. I believe that a most irresponsible acuon. The truth of the matter is that the amendment the Queensland Act concerned was merely a to technical one. It was done for administration purposes to bring the Queensland Act into line with the broadened scope of the Federal Act. Of course, this Act was amended and is now called the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act 1970-73. The point I am making is that there is nothing underhand as was indicated by the Minister. There is nothing sinister or diabolical about the actions of the Premier of Queensland or, for that matter, the Queensland Government. All of the major construction works carried Queensland come under the control of the PremDonald ier of that State. The Co-ordinator-General's Department is in charge. That Department all of the research, planning and supervision of all major projects in Queensland. Let me remind umes Government supporters that the programs that duction, are undertaken by the Queensland Government are of quite some magnitude. Do not forget that they include main roads, freeways, dams, harwas bours, and many other projects. This is the pose of the Co-ordinator-General's Department which has been set up in Queensland. Queensland welcomes the assistance that is forthcoming from these 3 Bills. It prevent the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation from entering Queensland, as the Minister endeavoured to make out. It appears to me from the comments and the tone of the Minister that he wants to see the discontinuance of Federal money for these schemes. That is the only impression I can gain from his answer on 23 I want to refer further to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation because it has a very broad charter. It was formed to carry out investigations and to furnish advice in relation tb resources in Austraha or elsewhere and into soil, rocks and materials used in the of engineering works in Australia and elsewhere, and to design and construct engineering works in Austraha or elsewhere, and so on. The inference I draw from what has been said by the Minister is that he wants this authto operate everywhere in this country. We have seen what has happened with the interto private enterprise in this country. We He have seen a complete about face, a somersault, by this Government when it reahsed that we were just about on the rocks. It has now changed Parits tune altogether. As I said, the Minister wants Snowy to see the Corporation take over. Surely to goodness this Government has learnt its lesson with to be the state of the nation as it is, the economy in a shocking position, inflation running at 25 to 30 to per cent and unemployment at 190,000. Surely goodness it has learnt its lesson, as the honourable member for MCPherson said a httle earlier. Surely it no longer wants to control everything in this country but rather to allow free enterprise a fair go. There is too much bureaucracy today. I would have thought that the Government at this stage would have eased up more than it has. I want to tell the people of Queensland, who are concerned with these 3 Bills, that this sociaUst Labor Government will obviously ruin this country. I would Uke to repeat a point that was made out in by the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Cameron) a couple of days ago. I think it is worth mentioning that the pledge taken by does Labor Party candidates states: I also pledge myself to actively support and advocate at all the Party's objecuve, the socialisation of industry, prodistribution and exchange. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) said that he proud to have signed this. The point is that purcomplete socialisation of this country will not work. This Government has to learn this. Queenslanders will reject socialisation first and foremost, and I stand with them. Mr Keogh-Wai t until MarshaU Cooke gets is not trying to hold of you next time.",104
159,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,I have a habit of dealing with lightweights the same as I deal with all the lightweights opposite. That is exactly the way I will deal with them in the future. Mr Keogh-Wai t until Marshall Cooke gets hold of you next time.,105
160,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"He went where I put all the lightweights, the same as you will go next time. The honourable member for Bowman nearly went at the last election. With the extra support that we will muster for our candidate next time he will go. Mr Bjelke-Petersen and the Queensland Government are prepared to cooperate with the Federal Government. Mr Bjelke-Petersen is not obstructionist, as has been so frequently claimed in this Parliament, but he will stand up for State rights. I support him in that stand, as I am sure the people of this country would. Even the Premiers of South Australia and Tasmania are disenchanted with the Federal Labor Government because they realise that their heads will be on the chopping block also if they go along with the Prime Minister and this Government at the moment. It is a strange coincidence that these Bills should be going through the House 2 weeks before the Queensland election. It amazes me that the Labor Party in the Federal Parliament would be electioneering for a broken down party in Queensland. Apart from the 3 Bills being discussed tonight, many Dorothy Dix questions have been asked on Queensland. An extra $8m has been promised for housing in Queensland. A statement has been made that the Prime Minister will spend 12 out of 21 days in Queensland. He is going there to open a grandstand, as we heard this morning. Apparently the invitation has not been given to him through the right channels. The Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones)- I do not know how he will get to Queensland when the pilots are on strike-is to open a train display in Brisbane tomorrow. It is rather unusual. One might ask why all these moves are being made in relation to Queensland by the Government at this time. I would like to illustrate to the House and to the Government how Queensland does cooperate with the Federal Government, particularly in relation to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. The Queensland Government has paid $500,000 in fees to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation over the past 4 years.",105
161,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"That is a big amount, is it not?",105
162,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"It is a big amount for engineering fees. It is proposed that in excess of $450,000 will be paid to the Corporation for work currently in hand. I mention these points because the Minister by inference in this House recently indicated that Queensland was not interested in the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. What I say disproves what he had to say. The projects being worked on at the moment are the Burdekin reappraisal scheme and the Cania Dam at Monto costing $135,000, and the Corporation is also involved in the Brisbane flood study, which is costing $100,000. So let us not have any more of the comment that the Queensland Government is not interested in the Corporation.",105
163,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,Why make the legislauon?,105
164,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,It was made because it brought into line the broadened scope,105
165,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,Why make it?,105
166,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"Because it has to come under the authority of someone. The authority in Queensland is the Co-ordinator-General's Department, which comes under the Premier. It is as simple as that. I would like to deal specifically with each of the Bills. The Queensland Grant (Bundaberg Irrigation Works) Bill provides for $4.4m. As the honourable member for MCPherson so succinctly put it earher, the reason is that the Monduran Dam will cost and extra $4.4m is basically the inflation that has been let run riot by this Government. The cost of the dam will now be $ 17.2m, which is a 34 per cent increase on the estimate, the Minister said in his second reading speech: The general escalation in salaries, wages and construcuon materials also contributed to the increased cost of the works being financed by the Australian Government. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Coporation was engaged by my department to advise on the revised cost estimates. That is an admission that inflation has taken over. This is another project on which the Queensland Government is co-operating with the Federal Government. The Minister also said: Over the past year, the Australian Government has undertaken a comprehensive evaluation of the whole of the Bundaberg Irrigation Project (phase 1 and phase 2). The Department of Northern Development, the Bureau of Agricultiral Economics, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporauon, various State departmentsDid the Minister hear that? He went on: and the Bureau if Sugar Experiment Stations have all contributed to this evaluauon. This is another example of co-operation by the Queensland Government. I move next to the Queensland Grant (Proserpine Flood Mitigation) Bill. This provides for a $120,000 grant from the Commonwealth Government to be matched by the Queensland Government on the basis of 40 per cent Federal, 40 per cent State and 20 per cent local authority contributions. this House a couple of days ago the honourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick) stated that no government in Australia subsidised local government. What a lot of rubbish. This Bill another example of a 20-40-40 subsidy. The flood mitigation work for which it provides will obviously be extremely important to the people in the Proserpine district. I referred earlier disastrous flooding that occurrs throughout nation. Thefloodsthat come particularly to are the Australia Dayfloodsin area we are hopeful that we might get the Wivanhoe Dam and the Middle Creek Dam constructed not only for water conservation but also for flood mitigation. The final Bill is the Queensland Grant (Clare Weir) Bill. It provides $3m to the Queensland Government to go towards the cost of the Clare Weir in the Burdekin area. The Minister in second reading speech referred to the waste our resources. He said that only 3.6 per cent the total runoff is at present committed for industhink trial, urban and agricultural use in the Burdekin River basin. This is a shocking state of affairs. Obviously the Clare Weir, which is in the early stages of development for water conservation and flood mitigation, will be of great benefit the Clare basin in future years. This is situated the dry tropical area and there is a lack of rainfall in this belt. I have seen the Burdekin flood. It is several kilometres wide in parts when it is in flood. The continuation of the work on the Clare Weir will be of great benefit to that area. I reiterate the co-operation of the Queensland Government to date. As I said earlier, we hear so much from the Prime Minister that we would be led to believe that the Premier of Queensland would never sit at the same table as the Prime Minister of Australia or any of his Ministers. That is totally incorrect. I make that strongly. Mr Keogh-He would not go to lunch with the Prime Minister.",105
167,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"He may have had his reasons at the time. The Prime Minister, on occasions, is not very polite either. I have heard some of his own members ni_ this.. Parliament on some occasions refer ttf times when his poUteness has jecting. left a lot to be desired. In summing up, I wish to make a couple of points to refute the arguments that were put earlier. I point out than an excellent Budget was introduced in Queensland this year. We have only one budget, that brought down by Sir Gordon Chalk this year, not 3 budgets in 4 months as was the case with this Government. In Queensland has extremely stable government I am surprised that the Prime Minister of this country would have the audacity to denigrate the Premier of Queensland and to criticise is Queensland which has a stable Government. Unemployment and inflation in Queensland are very high. All I can say about that situation is that on 7 December we will see the result. I to the would like to see the face of the honourable this member for Bowman on 7 December when we mind have a resounding victory in the Queensland Brisbane. In that State election.",106
168,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (9.22)-in reply-I thank the House for supporting all 3 Bills which have as their purpose the Proserpine flood mitigation scheme, the extension of the Bundaberg irrigation scheme and the construction of the Clare his Weir. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr of Hodges) talked principally about co-operation. of He did not speak very much about the Bills. I I should take up certain points that he did make and relate the facts concerning them. He said that all of these projects were started before this Labor Government came to office. This is just arrant nonsense. The Clare Weir is a brand to new project. The Proserpine flood mitigation in scheme was not even submitted by the Premier of Queensland until this year. It is a fact that the River in Bundaberg irrigation schemeMr Hodges-What about the planning?",106
169,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,You do not know anything about it. The Proserpine flood mitigation scheme started only after this year's floods. Mr Hodges-It was in the pipeUne for years.,106
170,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,Rubbish! Mr Hodges-It was.,106
171,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,You do not even know point most what you are talking about. Mr Hodges- I lived in north Queensland.,106
172,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"Well, you have never seen the Proserpine River, that is obvious. Mr Hodges- I have so. I beg your pardon",106
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Petrie will cease inter,106
174,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"In January this year, the levee banks of the Proserpine River burst at 2 places. One was just below the town of Glen lsla. The other was north of the town 2 mUes from the first area, opposite Biggs farm. The river broke its banks. The honourable member would not even have the faintest idea where that was. This is a most urgent project. It was started this It was never planned before this year so do not talk nonsense. The Proserpine River Trust was only formed a couple of months ago. That is how much you know about the subject. The second point that the honourable member for Petrie made related to the Snowy Mountains. He forgot to tell the House of the performance of the Liberal and Country Parties in Opposition when the Chifley Government was in office. Those Parties boycotted the opening of the Snowy Mountains hydro electric scheme. Mr Hodges-That is in the past. Get to the present.",106
175,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"You do not like to hear about the past, do you? Mr Hodges-Ge t back to the present.",107
176,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"With respect to the present, the former Liberal-Country Party Parties when in power dismantled the Snowy Mountains Authority. It set up the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and refused to permit it to do any construction work in Australia. Rarely have I heard such pathetic nonsense as has been talked by the honourable member for Petrie on this subject. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson) obviously knows very little about the projects also. He spent most of his ume eulogising and supporting his great champion, apparently, Mr Joh BjelkePetersen. I find it completely extraordinary for the ex-President of the Liberal Party in Queensland to stand here and champion Mr Bjelke-Petersen. I find it extraordinary but strange things happen in this Parliament. One of the claims made by the honourable member for MCPherson was that the Gold Coast flood mitigation project which, as he knows, I have seen first hand and have studied, was put up time and time again to this Government. That project has never been put up to this Government at any stage. Only 2 projects concerning flood mitigation have been put up to this Government by the Premier of Queensland. They are the 2 projects submitted this year with respect to the Proserpine River and the Pioneer River. Perhaps what the honourable member meant was that that project had been put up to the former Liberal-Country Party Government. It and the other projects were turned down Ume and time again. The record of the former Liberal-Country Party Government with respect to water conservauon in Queensland was pathetic. Everybody sitting on the Opposition side year. of the House knows that. Ten measures concerned with water conservation in Queensland have been undertaken, and 8 of those have been legislated in the last 2 years by this Labor Government. Let us deal with the factsMr Corbett-What are those projects?",107
177,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"I wiU deal with them, if you Uke. Let us take them in order. I mention first the Julius Dam at Mount Isa. How much did the former Government give to that project? Nothing. What about the Kinchant Dam outside Mackay at Mount Kinchant which was designed to serve those areas devastated by recurring droughts in the Eton area? How much did the former Government give to that project? Nothing. Mr WUUam MCMahon, Prime Minister in the previous Liberal-Country Party Government, wrote to the Queensland Premier, Mr Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and said that this was economic. He turned down the project. Mr Hodges-Did we not build a dam?",107
178,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"Did you not buUd the dam? The dam has not even been buUt yet. When this Government came to office, one of the first things that it did was to call for an evaluation of the Kinchant Dam. There was no evaluation of the Kinchant Dam. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics, my Department and others involved made an economic appraisal of the project and found it to be highly economic, sound. This Government acted immediately to provide money to the Queensland Government for that project. The Clare Weir is one of the projects which has been under discussion and consideration for 23 years. I always remember the great words of Mr Fadden, as he was then, in a policy speech delivered in 1949 at Boonah in which he said: 'We will buUd the great Burdekin Dam. We will not let it be pigeon-holed for the future'. Those were the words of Sir Arthur Fadden in 1949. For 23 years the Federal Country Party spent not one cent on the Burdekin Dam. Already within 2 years, the Australian Labor Government has financed and will befinancingthe major share of the cost of constructing the Clare Weir. Let us not have any more of this humbug about what former governments spent in the Burdekin. Mr Corbett-What about the Ross River Dam?",107
179,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,The honourable member for Maranoa has mentioned the Ross River project in Townsville. How much did the former Government spend on that project? Nothing. Already the Australian Labor Government has financed stages 1 and 2 of the Ross River Dam Townsville. The former Government spent notha clue. ing. How much did the former Government spend on the Baralaba Weir? Nothing. The Labor Government isfinancingthe construction of the weir at Baralaba in central Queensland. You have asked for it. You asked the question. Mr Corbett-What about the Bundaberg was Dam?,107
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The terms honourable member for Maranoa will cease interjecting.,108
181,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,The honourable member asked what projects the Australian Labor Party hadfinanced.I have said that out of the 10 ects we have financed 8 and the previous Governmentfinancedtwo. That was its dismal record in 23 years. I shall now deal with the ters raised by the honourable member for Maranoa. It is quite obvious that he knows absolties utely nothing about any of the 3 projects. Let deal with the Proserpine one first. One of statements he made was that the money for the Proserpine project is available for one year only. itself. If he knew anything about the project he would know that a levee bank has to be built before oncoming wet season. That is why the money is to be available for one year only. The levee to be constructed before the oncoming season. So obviously the honourable member knows nothing about the projects. Apparently what he would like to do(Opposition members interjecting),108
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I suggest that honourable members might Uke to have a discussion with the Minister outside afterwards this subject but I suggest that interjections cease during this section of the debate on these 3 BUls.,108
183,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,Apparently the honourendorsed able member for Maranoa would like to see the Government. levee banks for the Proserpine River projects delayed for a couple of years. Mr Corbett-That is quite Ulogical. That right at all.,108
184,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Maranoa criticised this Government for ing this money avaUable for one year and one year only. That is all that the Ufe of this particular project is to be. The levee bank has to be before the wet season in December. The honourPioneer able member would not have a clue. He would not know, for example, that the bulldozers, scrapers and the graders are there operating now and have been operating for the last few months at rebuUding these levee banks. He would not have Mr Corbett-You would not have a clue.",108
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I remind the Minister that the Chair does not know anything about it at all.,108
186,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"The Proserpine project also criticised on the matter offinancing.Obviously the Country Party does not know that the forfinanceare based on the terms of the flood mitigation Bills for New South Wales which the Country Party introduced into this Parliament on the 40-40-20 principle. Apparently those BUls were quite all right but when this projGovernment, with complete agreement by the Queensland Premier, follows the flood mitigation project principles for New South Wales matmembers of the Country Party criticise it. The Queensland Government and the local authoriare quite happy about the terms but apparus ently the honourable member for Maranoa is not the happy. Why is he not happy? Because he does not even know the basic elements of the project",108
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I remind the the Minister that the Chair is not very happy either. I suggest that the Minister should make has his speech without inciting the members of the wet Opposition to interject.,108
188,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"With all respect, they incited me and this is my opportunity now to reply to the statements that they made, despite the fact that most of them were arrant nonsense. That is what I am endeavouring to show.",108
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I suggest that the on Minister will incite me to do something in a moshould ment in regard to both sides.,108
190,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"The flood mitigation projects in the Proserpine area have been completely and accepted by the Queensland Mr Corbett-And the Opposition, too.",108
191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The is not honourable member for Maranoa will cease making comments.,108
192,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"The Queensland Governmakment has agreed to the method of financing. Only 2 flood mitigation projects so far have been put up by the Queensland Government. One is built for the Proserpine River and one is for the River. No other projects have been put up by the Queensland Government for northern the Queensland. There was one for Brisbane which my colleague the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cross) referred to. But as far as the watersheds of northern and central Queensland are concerned there have been only 2 projects put up to this point of time by the Queensland Government. The honourable member for Maranoa criticised this Government for not making enough money available for the Clare Weir project. Within 2 years we have made $5m available for the Clare Weir, but in 23 years of incompetent Liberal-Country Party government the previous Government gave nothing; not one cent did it give to the Clare Weir. Not one cent did it give to the Urannah Dam. Not one cent did it give for the investigation of the Burdekin River project itself. That is what the previous Government did in 23 years. In 2 years this Government has done more for water conservation in Queensland than the Liberal-Country Party Federal Government did in 23 years, and honourable members opposite know it. Mr Hodges-What about jobs?",108
193,Dr PATTERSON,PAIRS,"What about jobs? The droughts. honourable member cannot take it. We are talkthe ing about water and I will continue to talk for next S minutes about water because that is what the Bills are about. The honourable member for Maranoa talked about the Urannah Dam. I money doubt whether he knows where the Urannah is Dam project is. I shall just tell him. from the Eungella Dam project. Does the honourable member know where that is? When this Government came into power it called for the evaluation of the Urannah Dam project, the preparation of which the previous Governbetter ment had claimed for 5 years was the reason it could not carry out a reappraisal of the Burfor dekin River project. There was no such evalument. ation of the Urannah Dam project whatsoever. We had to start from scratch, and that is what being done now. Of course the Queensland Government knew full well the facts and it is just as ashamed about them as this Government about the pitiful performance of the previous Federal Liberal-Country Party Government with respect to the Urannah Dam. This is why there has been a delay. For 20 years we have heard the Liberal and Country Parties promising about the great dekin River project. I quoted before what the late Sir Arthur Fadden said when he spoke this matter in delivering an Australian Country Party policy speech at Boonah. Nothing pened. But this Government has acted and the people in Ayr and the people in Home Hill and the people of Townsville are appreciative of what has been done by this Government for water conservation. As I said, in Townsville stages one and two of the Ross River Dam are under way. Now the first stage of the great Burdekin River project itself, the Clare Weir, is being undertaken. These are the facts. They speak for themselves. I have made it quite clear since I have been in this Parliament that I beheve that water conservation projects, providing they are based on sound economic principles, are amongst the most important assets that this nation can invest money in. For a long time. I have seen millions of acre feet of water flowing wastefully to the sea from areas that are devastated from time to time by droughts-the great Fitzroy Basin and the Burdekin River basin. Forget the politics of this for a moment. This is something in which this Parliament and other parhaments-the Parliament in Queensland or wherever it might beshould co-operate to the hilt to try to overcome the devastation caused by droughts because as sure as night follows day we will get more The great tragedy of it is that some of areas where the greatest droughts occur-the the east coast of Queensland and the Gulf of Carpentaria-ar e where our greatest undeveloped water supplies are. As far as I am concerned, spent on water conservation, providing it soundly based, is of the very highest priority in It is not far terms of national development. I shall just finish my remarks by saying that I No. think it was the honourable member for Maranoa who asked me what I thought of Fred Haigh. I would think that I knew Fred Haigh than did any other person in the ParUawhy ment. I could be wrong. But I worked with him 17 years before I became a member of ParliaThe late Fred Haigh was a person for whom I had the highest respect. He was a man of is outstanding abiUty and his contribution to water conservation in Queensland will go down in the records of time. He fought against great odds to is get money for water conservation projects in Queensland. It was a tragedy to this nation for a man so talented to pass away so young. The nation has lost a great man. His performances, his achievements in water conservation, will go down in history. So let us not in any way try to promote any argument with respect to the late Bur Mr Fred Haigh. He made his mark in Queensland. He was first and foremost an Auson tralian. He wanted to see water conservation projects go on and on. I finish on that point. I hapthank the House for supporting the 3 BUls. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

194,Dr JF CAIRNS,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS," I move: Customs TariffProposals No. 17 (1974) On 30 October the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) announced that the Government had accepted the recommendations of the Industries Assistthis ance Commission in its report on steam, water fittings. Customs TariffProposals which I have just tabled give changes arising from the Government's decision. The effect of this decision is that a rate of 20 per cent will apply to tube and pipe fittings of copper and nickel and their alloys and niinimum rates of Third Reading duty will apply to similar fittings of lead, tin and zinc and their alloys. A rate of 25 per cent will apply to the actuators and valves specified in the Commission's recommendations. This rate will apply also to aerosol valves. The existing provisions on other valves will not be varied, excepting that the common 25 per cent rate will apply BILL 1974 from 22 November 1977. The new rates operate from tomorrow. A comprehensive summary of the changes and the duty rates is being circulated on to honourable members. I commend the Proposals. Debate (on motion by Mr Hunt) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (ABORIGINAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 November, on Third Reading motion by Mr Bryant: That the Bill be now read a second time.",110
195,Dr JF CAIRNS,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it Second Reading may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Aboron iginal Loans Commission Bill 1974 as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore that you permit the subject matter of both the Bills to be discussed in this debate.",110
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate? Third Reading There being no objection, I shall allow that to be moved course to be foUowed.",110
197,Mr HUNT,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,"The 2 BUls before us which are to be taken in a cognate debate are the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill 1974 and the Aboriginal Loans Commission Bill 1974. The first Bill provides financial assistto the States for the purpose of assisting Aboriginal people. This is the eighth such Bill. The former Liberal-Country Party Government commenced the principle of aUocating funds to the States to assist Aboriginal people. Therefore is not a new initiative of the Whitlam gas and Government but an extension of a policy No. 17 developed by former Liberal-Country Party effect to the tariff governments. One should note that the Government proposes to alter the title of the legislation from the States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Act to the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Act. I believe that the motive underlying this change is commendable and desirable. I tlunk that it does in fact take away a degree of the patronising attitude connoted in the title of the legislation. The Bill provides for a total of $40.79m to be paid to the States which represents a 26 per cent increase in funds over last year's allocation of $32.25m. This increase in expenditure is not inconsistent with the increases that have taken place since 1969-70. The schedule attached to the legislation shows that the increases since 1969-70 are as follows: In 1969-70 $5,410,000, was allocated under the States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Bill as it was known then; in 1970-71 $7m was allocated; in 1971-72 $9.2m; there was a very substantial jump in 1972-73 to $22m which represents the largest percentage gain; and in 1973-74 there was a further substantial leap to $32,250,000. Again this year there is to be a 26 per cent increase to $40,790,000. A breakup of the funds roughly reflects needs of the States and the number of $730,000 Aboriginals in those States. The Opposition ports the granting of funds for this purpose deplores the blackmailing tactics of the Governaway, ment, the blackmailing standover tactics that has adopted against the Queensland Governfunds ment and the Queensland people. The Queensland. Queensland Government has the administrative machinery to expend efficiently grant for the purpose of assisting Aboriginal people in regard to housing, education and other programs forms of assistance in that State. I believe that Aboriginal the Queensland Government probably has a far will superior administration in its State than the Minare ister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Cavanagh) because has in Canberra which he himself has called a affecting disaster area. I want to quote from the second long reading speech of the Minister because I think what he said is quite relevant to what I will later. The Minister said: Honourable members will also notice that an increase $400,000 is provided for Queensland in this Bill. The House will be aware of the intransigence on the part of the Queensland Government in respect of the Australian Government's attempts to achieve a collaborative approach to Aboriginal afTairs throughout Australia. A large or co-operation has been achieved with all other States. only have the Queensland Premier and the Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs refused to co-operate, refused even to panicipate in mutual concern to the Queensland and Australian Governments in the Aboriginal affairs field. In the light of this attitude, the Australian Government has decided to make available under this legislation to the Queensland Government only for programs for which an unavoidable commitment has been entered into. They are very strong words to express in a second reading speech, and I can only describe them as being standover tactics. No wonder the Aborigines are protesting against the Minister and his Department. No wonder we see afirstassistant secretary of the Department, Mr Charles Perkins, protesting outside Parliament House with those who were gathered there. I do not give him any marks for doing it, but that was his decision. A Minister who resorts to these sorts of blackmailing tactics does not earn the respect of his staff or, indeed, of the Aboriginal people. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Cavanagh) informs us that since the Queensland Government will not play his game, will not do what he wants it to do, will not do what it is told, the Queensland Government will be cut back by about $3.19m and will be left with only $400,000 more than it received last year, in spite of a 20 per cent inflationary cost factor in all levels of administration. The $3.19m that Queensland will lose will be split amongst the other States, the New South Wales getting $ 1.87m, Victoria and South Australia $583,000. A great supspUt up, because the Queensland Government is but a naughty Government so its money is taken it is split amongst the other States, and the it Minister says that he will provide additional direct to Aboriginal communities in I will read the section of the Minister's second reading speech where he referred to its share of the this. He said: The Australian Government will ensure that additional in Queensland will be carried out through local community organisauons, the Australian Department of Aboriginal Affairs and other instrumentalities. We ensure that the Aboriginals and Islanders of Queensland not disadvantaged by this decision and we believe that, the Australian Government's approach is to involve Aboriginals to the maximum extent possible in matters them, this decision will ensure greater benefit in the term to the Aboriginals and Islanders of Queensland. say That is a very, very wide sweeping statement and one with which I am sure most people could argue. I suppose the Minister will say that funds will go into such organisations as housing associof ations; yet in the last financial year $9m was unspent out of funds that were allocated for this purpose. The Minister admits that the housing associations, which are community associations, measure had not developed as fast as they could have and Not that they were slow to get off the ground and get they have under way, and this does not surprise me one discussions on matters of iota. Early last year I brought a delegation from funds Moree to meet with the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant), a deputation consisting of the Mayor of Moree and a number of Aboriginal people. The deputation was seeking to obtain funds to try to rehouse 150 Aboriginal people who were then housed in 21 caravans. The local council and the New South Wales Government in 1971 moved them out of a flood area and put them into caravans on a temporary basis. Those 150 people had been living-and some still are-in deplorable overcrowded circumstances. Undoubtedly the Minister for the Capital Territory, who was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, now sitting at the table was well aware of the problem because he said: 'You go home and form a housing association. Get your articles of association drawn up and we will provide the funds'. In fact he said: 'What is your next problem?' And that was early last year. Only last week I introduced another deputation from Moree led by Mr Neil Mackerras, who is with the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service, which was seeking to find out just where the funds have gone. They have formed their housing association, they have developed their articles of association, but they still have not received the money to get their association on"" the ground to overcome the immediate problem-and the urgent problem-of people who are still housed in deplorable conditions in caravans in my home town. In the meantime, the New South Wales Housing Commission and the Housing for Aborigines source of funds has given the only real help to the town of Moree in its efforts to overcome the great backlog ofhousing needs. As I said earlier, there are still people crowded into 6 caravans at Wiradji Crescent in Moree. So far the housing association concept in Moree has been a failure. The existing Housing Commission facilities in the State of New South Wales have proved to be by far the most effective and efficient means of getting funds to the people who need them most. It has proved that it can deliver the goods as long as it has got the funds available to it. The Housing Commission of New South Wales is a well established body, a body with very experienced officers who are well equipped to undertake projects and programs on a scale that we would like to see take place in Moree, Walgett, Bourke and all the other centres where there are great numbers of Aboriginal people still living in humpies and in deplorable conditions.",110
198,Mr JAMES,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,O o the graziers give any help up there?,112
199,Mr HUNT,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,"As a matter of fact the graziers or the farmers provide probably the only source of employment for a lot of Aboriginal people in the Walgett-Collarenebri area, and the farmers and the community in the Walgett and Moree districts are not anti-Aboriginal. In fact, we do have a great degree of community participation, as the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cross) well knows. It is a very old hat, unfortunate idea that a lot of people have that those who live amongst the Aboriginal people, whether they be farmers, graziers or townspeople, are antiAboriginal, therefore racist. I have seen this written and I have heard it said. Of course there are people who do not treat the Aborigines well but by and large there is a great degree of co-operation today among people out in those areas to try to ensure that the Aboriginal people get a fair go. It may not always have been that way but I can say that that is the general attitude today. I want to turn now to what I was saying about the housing commissions. The New South Wales Housing Commission and the similar facilities and bodies that exist in all the States, including Queensland, surely provide the most efficient way to channel funds quickly and directly to the sources of need. It will take some time to set up housing associations, community organisations, and we are not always sure that we are going to get value for money. I am positive that it has been a great blunder on the part of the Government not to try to meet further with the Queensland Government to get that $3.19m into areas of need in Queensland. I beheve that out of spite and childish pique the Minister is going to deny housing to the Queensland Aborigines. The Aborigines themselves have had a taste of the Minister's standover tactics and his threat to cut off funds to the legal aid service unless it does as it is told, unless it is prepared to act as he wants it to act. I have in front of me some clippings of headlines and reports in various newspapers on this subject. In the 'Canberra Times' of 8 November, under the headline 'End intimidation, Aborigines told' the following report appeared: The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Cavanagh, said yesterday that he would not talk to Aborigines on the present conflict between the NSW Aboriginal Legal Service and his department until 'all intimidatory action indulged in at Canberra ends'. A department spokesman confirmed that Senator Cavanagh wanted two tents put up by Aborigines opposite Parliament House removed and a planned demonstration today by 3 busloads of Aborigines called off. Mr Luchetti-How do you feel about the tents?",112
200,Mr HUNT,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,"The report continues: Senator Cavanagh, who was reported to be upset at the acuon of the Aborigines, telephoned his statement to the depanment in Canberra while on a 10-day tour of Aboriginal settlements in Western Australia. The honourable member for Macquarie asked me how I feel about the tents. That is a good question. Quite frankly, I do not think that it is a right and proper way in which to protest. I have demonstrated that in a very honest way. I did so publicly to my own disadvantage, but I had a job to do. I did not attempt to blackmail the Aborigines opposite Parliament House when the Government of which I was a Minister felt that those tents had to go. If one believes that they should not be there one should not, as a Minister of the Crown, try to blackmail people by saying: ' If you do not remove those tents you will not get your money'. I turn to a headline in another newspaper-the 'Sydney Morning Herald'.",112
201,Mr JAMES,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,That is hardly blackmail.,113
202,Mr CALDER,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,"Well, what is it?",113
203,Mr BRYANT,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,Persuasion.,113
204,Mr JAMES,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,"It is tolerance, I would say",113
205,Mr HUNT,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,"It is tolerance? All right. The 'Sydney Morning Herald' of 8 November 1974, under the heading 'No cash until tent goes', reported: The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Cavanagh, has told the Aboriginal Legal Service of N.S.W. that he will not consider restoring funds to it until the Aboriginal 'embassy ' on the lawns of Parliament House is removed. Confirming this last night, a spokesman for Senator Cavanagh said Aborigines would also have to end all forms of protest in Canberra before talks could begin. 'Canberra blacks stop over funds' was the heading given to an article in the Melbourne 'Age' of 30 October. Another one in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' said 'Hawke move to mediate with Minister'. We have Bob Hawke coming into the act. The article reads: The Federal President of the ALP, Mr Hawke, agreed last night to mediate in the dispute over the N.S.W. Aboriginal Legal Service. Good for Bob. I have no doubt that he was responsible for overcoming some of the difficulties because the heading given to an article in the Melbourne 'Age' of 9 November reads 'Cavanagh gives into blacks. Money talks to be held Monday'. The article stated: The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs . . . yesterday backed down in his row with the N.S.W. Aboriginal Legal Service. Good on him. I hope that he also sees the wisdom of backing down on what has been a blackmailing tactic against the Queensland Government. Therefore I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: whilst not opposing the passage of this Bill the House is of the opinion that the Government's action in reducing the grant to the State of Queensland by $3,190,000 is contrary to the best interests of the Aboriginal people of Queensland and that the Government should take immediate steps to grant to that State a further sum of $3,190,000 as promised in the Budget. As I said earlier, I believe that the action that the Minister has taken against the Queensland Government and those who are protesting outside this House is a blackmail tactic, a petty tactic. Is it fair to the Queensland Aborigines to deny $3.19m to the Queensland Government and to say: 'We will make it up by diverting funds to housing associations when they are established, when the money might be available'? It may not have the resources to spend it. Indeed, I suspect that it will not because, as we learned from this year's Estimates, $9m in that fund was unspent in any event last year. I believe that the action taken by the Minister, on behalf of the Government, is a contemptible one. I believe and the Opposition beheves that it shows no regard for the people for which he is responsible. The protesting Aborigines certainly do not rate either the Minister or his Department highly. Indeed, they seem to want a royal commission of inquiry into the operations of the Department. Some are screaming for the abandonment of the Department and its replacement with a statutory body to administer Aboriginal affairs. In fact, I think that they want almost anything other than what they have at the present time. The Queensland Department could well be a more effective, acceptable and efficient means of distributing funds for the purposes of advancing the Aboriginal people. Take the Lewis Street project in Redfern. I am sorry that Mr Speaker is not in the chair because I am sure that he would listen with great interest to what I am about to say about this matter. Surely it must be a bad example, a shoddy example of the Department's housing programs. I understand that, due to the Department's inability for one reason or another to fund it, the project has now almost stopped, thus dashing the hopes of the enthusiastic Aborigines who started the whole thing off in the time of the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, no doubt with the best intentions and the best will in the world. The Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs and its Director have a relatively good record for a State with vast and difficult geographic and climatic conditions; yet they are to be denied $3.19m because the Queensland Government apparently will not do as the Minister tells it to do. Of course there has been a history of some dispute between the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government on this subject. I remind the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) of the former Minister's visit Queensland in the early days after his assumpthrough tion of office when he tried to interfere with rights of the Torres Strait islanders.",113
206,Mr BRYANT,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,Who did?,114
207,Mr HUNT,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,"You, Sir. I think that the former Minister suggested at one stage that we might be able to trade some of the Torres Strait Islands. Was it not you who did that?",114
208,Mr BRYANT,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,No . The honourable member's history is as bad as his politics.,114
209,Mr HUNT,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,"I beg your pardon, but was there not a dispute? Did you not make a run up into the area and was the Premier of Queensland not concerned?",114
210,Mr BRYANT,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,I will answer that later.,114
211,Mr HUNT,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,"The honourable member for themselves Maranoa might have all the facts. I have a memcal parties. ory which does not always serve me well, but I do remember the rather lusty former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs",114
212,Mr CALDER,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,As k him why he was shifted from the portfolio.,114
213,Mr HUNT,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,"No, I will not do that. That is not fair. I would like to return to the provisions Bill. I have noted that nearly one half of $40.8m being allocated to the States is for ing. The balance is to be spent on education, health and other areas of need. From my experisocial ence in Aboriginal welfare I am bound to say that there is such a diversity in the level vancement of Aborigines and in the levels of their living conditions that there is no common answer to the problem. The problems not only differ from State to State but also community to community within a State. HowLoans ever, in most situations the greatest needs are housing, employment opportunity, education and adequate health care. In Moree, I would list the priorities in that order. I mention Moree because it contains the biggest Aboriginal community outside the city Sydney. Dealing with housing in Moree, the curOpposition rent shortfall is still a very serious problem. As have already said employment opportunity very important in today's economic climate opportunities are not there, although I hope some of the Regional Employment DevelopQueensland ment schemes may provide opportunities for the Aborigines in the near future. This, of course, leads to education and vocational training facilities for the young and, indeed, the adults. Pre-schools are essential. This has been proved in Moree where the Daughters of Charity to conduct the Pope Pius Mission. They go right the town of Moree and to the outskirts of the the town each morning with 2 buses and bring every child of a pre-school age to the Pope Pius Mission for pre-school activity and also for medical check-ups. Every doctor in the town is an honorary doctor and, on a roster system, they attend to the health needs of the children. This is proving to be of tremendous advantage to the Aboriginal children. It is proving that this sort of care for the Aboriginal child equips him to enter the primary school, certainly to continue on into high school and hopefully into vocational training and worthwhile, satisfying employment. It will be a long hard road for those who genuinely set out to achieve the resolution of Aboriginal ambitions. It will take all the co-operation we can muster between governments, between black and white, between the Aboriginal communities and, for that matter, between politiI am glad to say that the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, upon which I served under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cross) is, I think, performing a very valuable role because I do not think any body can serve on a committee that is less party of the political and which endeavours to approach its the task with a more worthwhile objectivity. We housmust aU set out with that common objective to work together to overcome one of the greatest problems that plagues the country. I am sure that the Government does set out with good of adintentions. The amount of funds that the Government is allocating to try to overcome the simple problem I think is indicative of that. The extension of the Aboriginal Enterprises from Assistance Act and, indeed, the Aboriginal Commission has been a very wise step because it will provide a facility now for Aboriginal families to obtain such important household items as refrigerators, furniture, all types of floor coverings and so on. It will give the Aborigines a facility for loans that is not available to them of elsewhere and at reasonable interest rates. The supports both Bills. Whilst it does not I oppose the passage of the Bill it is of the opinion is that the Government's action in reducing the grant to Queensland by $3,190,000 is contrary to that the best interests of the Aboriginal people of and that the Government should take immediate steps to grant that State a further sum of $3,190,000 as promised in the Budget.",114
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Hyde-Yes.,114
215,Mr CROSS,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS," I would Uke, first of aU, to express my appreciation to the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) for a thoughtful and generous speech in the area of Aboriginal affairs, to which he has a great commitment. Those of us who have been with him in his electorate know the real and genuine interest that he takes in the Aboriginal people who Uve there. One of the heartening things that has occurred in this Parliament in the time that I have been here-almos t 13 years-is the number of people of all political persuasions on both sides of the House who have developed a very real interest in the well-being of our Aboriginal fellow Australians. I should like to make one or two comments on the matters raised by the honourable member for Gwydir. I should Uke to deal with the general question of Queensland a little later on. The honourable member for Gwydir mentioned the action of the New South Wales Housing Commission in providing houses at Moree when Aboriginal housing associations have not apparently, up to this point of time, been able to deliver the goods. There are, of course, 2 problems involved. Much of the land is Aboriginal reserve land and the New South Wales Housing Commission would not allow houses to be buUt on that reserve. The other point I should like to make is that, of course, the houses that have been built by the New South Wales Housmg Commission under the Housing for Aborigines scheme are funded through the States grants legislation that we have before us. The honourable member for Gwydir dealt at some length with the position of the New South Wales Aboriginal Aid Service. This is a very Affairs. worthwhile service. Its foundation goes back to the previous Government. It was assisted by the previous Government although it arose very much out of an Aboriginal initiative. There great need for this service. Those of us who have watched the development of the Legal Aid vice and other legal aid services I am sure all agree that they have done a very good job for Aboriginal people. I do not think anybody original doubts the future of the Legal Aid Service. argument between the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Cavanagh) and the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Aid Service was on the question of accountability. It must be years transparently obvious to members of this House, whatever their political persuasion, that one cansistance. not spend public money allotted through any form of assistance to an organisation unless organisation is able to account for that public money. If governments do not insist on proper accountability for money given to Aboriginal organisations or the many other organisations that have been assisted by programs of this Government and former governments, then those programs will not survive. When we came into Government we found that our predecessors had assisted organisations on the basis of a yearly grant and that very often Aborigines, with the best intentions in the world, did not have the administrative capacity to spend that money as well as they might. They have tended to transfer money from one purpose to another-perhap s it was money made avaUable to employ a field officer and perhaps that money was transferred to buy a motor car which might have been the top priority, as they saw it. There was obviously a need to bring this under control. Under the administration of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant) who is sitting at the table, a better form of accountabUity was introduced. That occurred in the recent past. I am speaking of the financial year which ended on 30 June this year. It follows that some of these organisations which have been assisted on a trial basis and encouraged to develop their capacities have not measured up. It is necessary to point out to those organisations that they have to measure up to proper accounting procedures in the near future if they are to be assisted with public funds. I do not particularly welcome the confrontation or the suggestion that the Legal Aid Service might be cut off without any funds at all. I am sure that if people realise that there are 2 sides to this question and realise that if these programs are to succeed the proper accountabUity is necessary, there would be a lot more understanding of the position of the Minister for Aboriginal We have 2 Bills before us. I am happy that the Opposition is not opposing either of them. The is a first Bill is the Aboriginal Loans Commission Bill. It replaces the Aboriginal Enterprises AssistSerance Act 1968. The Aboriginal Enterprises Assistance Act was a successful piece of legisthe lation. It provided an arrangement whereby Abbusiness enterprises could be assisted on The fairly generous terms in order that Aborigines could start businesses, buy businesses and develop a better income and a better life for themselves. In the experience of the last few we have now come to realise that there are many other areas in which Aborigines need as I refer, for example, to the actual purchase of a home. When the program of assistthat ance through the States for Aboriginal housing was evolved, no one imaged that Aborigines woulcl actually own land themselves. It was a scheme much like the Commonwealth-State housing scheme in which Aborigines would have made available to them rental homes on a very generous economic rental basis. But those of us who have been interested in this field have found that there have been Aborigines who have acquired their own piece of land or who may have been given a piece ofland on which to build a house. Because Aborigines very often live in isolated places where it may not be easy to sell the house to some other person, it is not always easy for them to get thefinance.Indeed, I think we would all agree that it is not easy for an Aboriginal person to getfinancefrom a building society or a bank. Mr Sullivan-It is not easy for anyone.",115
216,Mr CROSS,CUSTOMS TARIFFPROPOSALS,"Well, be that as it may. But if the honourable member's skin was a different he would find that it was even harder. This Bill makes provision to assist Aborigines in this whole area of housing-in the provision of furniture and a whole range of other activities, such paying for funerals and the other calls that igines have on them. Indeed, we all have those calls on us but they have a lesser capacity to the demand. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to spell again the policy of the Government, which provide such assistance to Aborigines in this eration that the lot of the Aboriginal people this country might.be so improved that in future generations they might have real equality with all other Australians. The fact that the OppoDepartment sition is supporting this legislation indicates the Opposition realises too that it is necessary this time, in this generation, to assist Aborigines generously in some cases in order that they their children might enjoy real equality with other Australians in the next generation. The next piece of legislation before us is the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill 1974. In the discussion tonight on some other pieces legislation we heard about this centralist Government, this socialist Government, Government that is grinding the States out existence. This legislation whereby an increasing amount of assistance has been given to the States for Aboriginal advancement every year is an indication of this Government's knowledge that many of these services are better provided through the States. It has never been the tion of this Government to set up a Department of Aboriginal Affairs like the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs which has been referred to at some length already and which has, in its day, managed the affairs of Aborigines from the cradle to the grave. Rather we see that at some time in the future this Aboriginal administration that we are setting up may be able to fade away as its responsibilities are taken over by those departments which service all other Australians. That is what we are working towards. It is a long way ahead. I well  member of Isis and Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs in Queensland, took that office he said to his departmental officers that their function was to work themselves out of a job. I hope that in a long time ahead that is the situation at which we arrive. This Bill is a recognition by this Government that many of these services are better provided by the States because the States provide services such as these to all other members. of the Australian community. The increasing colour level of assistance is very heartening. I would like to clear up the question of assistas ance to Queensland. It will be appreciated that Aborthis year Queensland obtains more money than it did last year, but that extra assistance over and meet above what was committed earlier in the year and which has been given to the other States has been cut down. The Minister has taken this attiout tude because of the failure of the Queensland is to Government to co-operate with the Federal genGovernment. I am not one of those people who of say that the Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs in Queensland is wrong in all respects. There are some very fine people in the of Aboriginal and Island Affairs in that Queensland. I would regard some of them as my in friends, and I hope that they would reciprocate that attitude. However, I think there are many and aspects of Aboriginal administration in Queensland which are completely reprehensible. I do not want to go into the question of discriminatory legislation because no doubt that is a matter which we will be canvassing later this year or of early next year. Having in mind the large amount of assistance that this Government is giving and this previous governments have given to of Queensland, one of the things that I find most reprehensible about the Queensland situation is the fact that very few Aboriginal people- I refer to Torres Strait Islanders in this as well-ar e actually occupying positions of authority or responsibility on Queensland settlements. It is an intenindictment of the administration of the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs that a secondary education for an Aborigine is a one way ticket to the world outside, and that while the junior pass was formerly the level of entry to the Queensland Public Service, to the Queensland Police Force and, in earlier days, to the Queensland teaching profession, hardly any Aborigines have gone into the Queensland Public Service, only a handful have gone into the teaching profession, and I do not know of any who have gone into the Police Force. I would be happy to be corrected on that point. If any have gone into the Police Force, the number is very small indeed. Queensland is not out of step with this Government, it is out of step with every other Government in Australia on the question ofland rights. Let us just look at the situation. South Australia set up a Lands Trust. It was advanced for its day but I think that time has passed it The setting up of the Trust was a recognition of Aboriginal land rights. The Liberal Government in Victoria transferred land rights at Lake Tyers and Framlingham to its Aboriginal people some years ago. The Government of New South Wales passed legislation whereby Aborigines on reserves could apply to have those reserves ferred to a lands trust, and that legislation been on the statute book of New South Wales for some years. The former Labor Government in Western Australia took steps in this direction, and there is no sign that the present Liberalbetween Country Party Government has any intention reversing those steps, although I understand it has some reservations about money accruing wealth. from mining on reserves. But landrightsare not in question. We have had a picture painted of us that we are trying to take over the Queensland reserves. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are in the process of transferring the reserves in the Northern Territory to the Aborigines who occupy those reserves, the Aborigines who have traditional claims to those lands. seeking the co-operation of the Queensland Government was that the Queensland Government would face up to those obligations that we have accepted under International Labor Organon isation conventions, such as the Convention the Rights of Tribal and Indigenous People. have an obligation in the international arena face the other nations of the world in matters such as this. All other Australian States have cepted their obligations and the Government Queensland has repudiated those obligations. hope that the Government of Queensland will come to its senses. We know that an election is pending. It is probably a difncult few weeks for the encumbent Government to start changing political attitudes that are well established, there is plenty of reason at this end of things I wish there was a Uttle more reason in Queensland, because we are keen to evolve responsible patterns of Commonwealth-State cooperation in the interests of the Aboriginal people of that State. I can well understand the frustration of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Cavanagh, when on occasions he has gone to Queensland and negotiated in good faith with the Minister in Queensland, Mr Hewitt. I am not suggesting that Mr Hewitt has not negotiated in good faith, but these negotiations have later been repudiated by the Premier of Queensland. I can see that time is running out. I am happy to support this legislation. I am happy to see that an by. increasing amount of assistance is to be given to the States. I think that all of us who have been involved in Aboriginal affairs recognise that the States have a role to play, that by and large they play it generously and well, and that a very successful pattern of co-operation has been evolved. I again express the hope that the Queensland transGovernment elected on 7 December will be a has Labor Government. However, I recognise the difficulties involved in the electoral boundaries in that State. Whatever government is elected, I hope that we get the same degree of co-operation that Government and the Federal of Government that this Federal Government has that received from every other State in the CommonDebate interrupted.

217,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., in accordance with the order of the House, I proOur purpose in pose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr MACPhee (Balaclava) (10.30)-Without referring to anything said in the debate yesterday the matter of pubhc importance, I wish to on raise some matters which are pertinent to that We debate, the actual subject matter being the to depressed state of manufacturing industries. Supporters of the Government still talk as acthough business is merely deferring long term of investment programs when, in fact, the real I problem is finding enough money to sustain operations next week. Companies are selling divisions and assets and are ending production lines in order to remain in business. It is not an exaggeration to say that manufacturing companies but are fighting to survive. Of course, I am speaking and generally because there are still a few pockets of prosperity. Manufacturers have difficulty in forward planning and in assessing future demand and the cost of meeting it. There is an investment recession in manufacturing industry and it is nonsense for the Government to say that imported inflation is its main cause. Australia has been largely protected from the oil . crisis and there is no excuse for our having a higher rate of inflation than any comparable industrial economies which are largely dependent on imported oil. Australia's inflation problems began when Labor Government promised the CommonGovernment's wealth Public Service shorter working hours and increased salaries and conditions. Instead of reflecting general levels of wages and conditions, the Commonwealth Public Service became the pacesetter and it is difficult now for the Governmission ment to reduce union expectations. As a result, companies cannot generate sufficient cash to susaccount tain a satisfactory level of operations, let alone invest and expand. Investment in new plant and equipment is therefore declining and it has been this investment which has brought most of the increased productivity of recent years., It is this drop in investment and ductivity which will lead to further unemployment. The Government does not realise that it not continue to fund its public spending out of taxation when government policies have such harsh effect on the manufacturing sector. The standard of living of all Austrahans will decline unless the Government regenerates manufacturGovernment ing industry. To do this, I suggest that the Government should take the following 10 these courses of action: Firstly, it should impose import quotas forthwith for a Umited period; ondly, it should reintroduce an extended investfrom ment allowance to include new plant and mathat chinery for a period of 2 years With an assurance that it will not be removed in an arbitrary and total fashion. In other words, it ought to be manent part of the program for industry albeit the form may change from time to time. Thirdly, the Government should reintroduce generous export incentives to try to give Austrahan manuUving. facturers economies of scale t6 lower the unit cost of their products, that is, to increase productivity. Fourthly, it should discuss with State governrefusal ments a joint use of their powers regarding manufacturing industry, in particular, controls over prices and wages oyer a specified period, and the removal of inflationary indirect charges currently levied by both Federal and State governments. Fifthly, the Government should discuss with State governments ways of reducing duplication by State and Federal governments, thereby reducing waste in pubhc spending and the need to draw more money from manufacturing and other parts of the private sector. Sixthly, it should widen the composition of the Jackson Committee investigating manufacturing industry and thereby include genuine manufacturers in its membership. Seventhly, the Government should strengthen the staff of the Department of Manufacturing Industry by adding a few carefully selected persons who have served in manufacturing industry. Many such persons are now unemthe ployed or under-employed as a result of the policy. Eighthly, it should put action behind the promises for a vital, practical small business bureau to assist small business in these most difficult times. Ninethly, when referring matters to the Industries Assistance Comit should do so in as much detail as possible to ensure that the Commission's report takes of as many economic, social and political considerations as are relevant so as to be of maximum value to the Government, industry and the at a sharp rate community generaUy. Tenthly, it should inform manufacturing pro- .industry and its employees of any views which 'the Government now has regarding the future of particular industries so that the appropriate redeployment of capital and retraining of labour canmay occur. This is what should have been done prior to the 25 per cent tariff cuts. No country in a' the world could have inuoduced such sweeping and irrational cuts without severely damaging its own business. This action alone showed that the simply does not understand the functioning of the economy. Measures such as will go some way to restoring confidence in the minds of manufacturers and their employees secthat the Government has learned something its past errors. Mr Speaker, I do not believe the present Labor leaders could ever free themselves completely from the myths of their own creation, certainly not sufficientiy to make a perpolicies based on a real understanding of the value of manufacturing industry to Australia in terms of technology, independence of spirit and initiative, or its contribution to our standard of The most recent Ulustration of this was the of the Treasurer (Mr Crean) to acknowledge that the greatest problem facing manufacturing industry was one of Uquidity. It is still one of Uquidity and will be for some time. He therefore refused to consider a general deferment of quarterly payments of company tax and he denied industry the opportunity of finding the cash to tide it over the expenses incurred by annual leave and other such payments and the losses stemming from the holiday period. Many companies will have to borrow money at high interest rates to pay their taxes. The Treasurer has frequently said that each time an employee seeks a wagerisehe puts another employee's job in jeopardy. This is correct and stems from the very liquidity problem which the Treasurer de? nies. It is a fact that many manufacturers are working on wages budgets and when wages rise they retrench employees, as they no longer have the capacity to increase their total wages bill. The measures of 12 November are a mere cosmetic gesture so far as manufacturing industry is concerned. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) was at pains to say on that occasion that his government was not hostile to manufacturing industry, but nothing in his statement suggested that his Government had any understanding or belief in manufacturing industry. The economy will not prosper until there is in power a government which does understand this most vital part of our economy. If the present Government is to make even a gesture towards this understanding, it should make recent company annual reports compulsory reading for its members. Day after day chairmen of companies have spoken with wisdom and experience but their views have been heeded by very few Labor Party identities. Mr Hawke's understanding of micro-economics has been aided by his exposure to the manufacturing industry unions who understand only too well the drastic consequences of the Government's policies. Mr Dunstan has shown a grasp of the situation not demonstrated by any member of the Federal Labor Government. For instance, Mr Dunstan has said publicly that he recognises that under conventional accounting companies are paying tax and distributing dividends out of grossly overstated profits. As a further illustration of Mr Dunstan's understanding I shall quote from the address of the chairman of one of Australia's most respected companies-Simpson-Pope . Referring to the economic situation, Mr Moxon Simpson stated: As the Premier pointed out, much of the blame for this situation lies at the door of the academic economists in Canberra, who attacked demand inflation when it was cost inflation which was the trouble, swinging the annual rate of change of volume of money in the course of a single year from an increase of over 25 per cent to under 7 per cent, without correcting for inflation. Since coming to power they expanded Government spending in various directions, many of them admirable in themselves, but which should have been allowed to wait until they could be afforded. When early warnings of trouble appeared four months ago, they said that this now made it possible resources from the private to the public sector. The report concluded: At least he and his colleagues have realised the need for a reversal of policy. And indeed, in a country as self-contained as Australia, it is not impossible for this to happen, provided the importance of manufacturing is recognised. One hopes that the new Treasurer will recognise the importance of manufacturing industry.",117
218,Mr DALY,ADJOURNMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House) (10.40)- I take this opportunity to make a brief statement at the request of the Treasurer (Mr Crean). I am informed that tonight the Channel 0-lQ. network, covering Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, carried an item reporting a telephone call said to have been made to the Channel by the Treasurer's son. The report described the caller, a young man, as being very upset. The report said that the young man who claimed to be the Treasurer's son told the channel: Those bastards in Canberra are not going to pull my father down. In fact none of the Treasurer's 3 sons made any such call to the Channel. The Channel 0-10 network has since broadcast a statement acknowledging that it had been the victim of a hoax. To say the least, this is a most unprincipled action by the Channel. To accept such an anonymous call without any checking, knowing full well the hurt that it would cause to the parties - concerned, is an unprincipled, unjustifiable action. It is this kind of news presentation that brings the media into disrepute. Surely any responsible news medium would check its source before giving pubhc expression to these views on such a prominent national personahty.",119
219,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,Who did pull old Frankie down?,119
220,Mr DALY,ADJOURNMENT,"If the honourable member agrees with these sentiments, let him get up and say so. It is all the more hurtful to all concerned when it involves the family of the person concerned. PoUtical Ufe is hurtful enough to those involved in it without involving their famUies. This action does little credit to the channel or those concerned in the television presentation, and in my view is deserving of the condemnation of all fair minded citizens. If it is any satisfaction to those .concerned, they may take comfort from the fact that they have caused considerable distress to the Treasurer and his famUy by their indefensible, thoughtless and harmful action.",119
221,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT," I desire to or five draw to the attention of the Government tonight to divert the highly unsatisfactory situation of private members in this Parliament who try to represent the needs of their electorate. One of the rights of private members is their right to question responsible Ministers about Government activities which affect the nation in general or a member's electorate in particular. In pursuance of these duties we all try whenever we can to question relevant Ministers. Yesterday at question time. I asked a question about something which affected my electorate. I asked this question of the Prime Minister: Is the Prime Minister aware that in order to attract try to decentralised growth centres such as Wodonga, State governments give concessions to industries which have the effect of increasing their profits? Is that, as a result, half or the concessions granted by finished up in Commonwealth consolidated revenue? Of course they are taxable. My question conto tinued: In view of the fact that every ing staff in this so-called Government lay down policies which will attract and maintain industries in this area? In particular, when may we expect the implementation ofhis 1972 election policy ise for local call telephone access from Albury to and Sydney? I felt that that was a fair question. It was not politically loaded. It was seeking information and it was seeking action. I do not believe that many honourable members opposite realise that State governments give concessions which are taxed by the Commonwealth and finish up as Commonwealth revenue. One would have expected some sort of adequate reply, but the reply I got was completely evasive. Mr MCLeay-Who was the Minister?",119
222,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"It was the Prime Minister. He did not touch on any of the main part of the question. The Prime Minister replied: The Royal Commission on the Post Office Vernon-the second Vernon Royal Commission-mad e some recommendations upon the matter of concessional telephone and telex charges to designated growth centres. They are being discussed with the State governments. The entire answer did not touch on the main part of the question at all and it left unanswered the question on decentralisation. If ter did not know-on e can give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he did not know-at least he might have said that he would contact later or give a written reply. But no courtesy extended. I believe a little courtesy consideration would not have been out of place. I cannot even work out why the Prime Minister said that this was a matter for State governments, because surely we are in charge of the Postmaster-General's Department. The Prime Minister made this promise 2 years ago and he has not implemented it. He should not have made the promise if he could not implement it. Why is he discussing this matter with State governments when he could implement it tomorrow if he wanted to do so? The fact of the matter is that this was the first question I had asked for one month and it was fobbed off by the Prime Minister. It was a complete waste of time. What opportunity do I and other members have for getting this sort of information? I believe, as private members, we are entitled to receive this sort of information. Will I indusget another chance to ask a question before AlburyChristmas? I very much doubt it. You, Mr he aware Speaker, are the only one who knows the answer States to that. I would not be surprised if l have to wait unul February or March before I get the chance ask another question. In any case if l do get the chance to ask another question, no doubt the week industries are retrenchanswer will be just as irrelevant as this answer growth centre, when will his was. It goes to show that we have a completely arpromchaic and antiquated system for asking questions Melbourne in this House. We grind through some 35 to 40 questions and answers a week. They consist of Dorothy Dixers, ministerial statements made in the guise of replies to questions which have been handed out by Ministers and irrelevant and misleading answers. This means there are 800 to 1,000 questions in a year. We should compare tbisfigurewith that for the House of Commons. My colleague, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Drury), was kind enough to give me a copy of the Tregear report. I recall that Mr Tregear was a very distinguished Clerk of this House who spent some 12 months in the United Kingdom studying the procedures of the House of Commons. He points out in his report that up to 28,000 questions a year are asked and answered under Sir James in the House of Commons. Mr MCLeay-How many here?",120
223,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"About 800 to 1,000 questions, I suppose. Mr Donald Cameron-Does the House of the Prime MinisCommons sit every day?",120
224,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"No , it does not. It does not have questions on Friday. It sits on Monday, of me course. Of course the House of Commons has was four tofiverimesas many members as the House and a little ofRepresentatives has.",120
225,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Pardo n me, are they quesdiscussion with tions without notice?",120
226,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"No , they are all questions on notice, as you would know, Mr Speaker, I am sure. Questions are listed. The questioner refers to the number of his question and receives an answer. Supplementary questions can be asked afterwards. Up to 120 questions a day are asked in the House of Commons against something like 12 questions a day here. All the questions out of the 120 questions which remain unanswered receive written replies. What is more, the members receive accurate and relevant answers because there is time to consider the answers. I am not complaining. I have been a Minister myself and I know that when a question is suddenly thrown at a Minister it is difncult for him to give an accurate reply. No Minister with the best will in the world can always have all the facts concerning his Department at hisfingertips.In the House of Commons each member is limited to 3 oral questions each day plus supplementaries. What a heaven that would be compared with one question a month in this Parliament if a member is lucky. I refer now to the questions which are not for oral answer and which would be equivalent to our questions on notice. The departments there are expected to furnish replies within 7 days, and they do. What a paradise. I have had questions on the notice paper for a year. I have not received an answer and I know I will not get one. There is no way in which a member can force an answer. Have we ever thought of the waste caused by printing questions on the notice paper? If the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) cares to look at the notice paper he will see that there are 138 pages of questions on notice on the notice paper today. Each honourable member receives 2 copies of the notice paper. This means that each day 32,000 pages are involved in the distribution of the notice paper to honourable members alone. Taking into account the other copies which are distributed, more than 100,000 pages per week are devoted to setting out questions on notice which are not answered and which lay on the notice paper for a considerable period. Mr Daly- Mr Speaker, I rise to take a point of order. The honourable member has stated that one of his questions has been on the notice paper for 12 months. The first question appearing on the notice paper is dated 10 July 1974.",120
227,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,No point of order is involved.,121
228,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,"I can answer that very quickly. The question was put on notice in the term of the previous Parliament. When that Parliament was dissolved and the new Parliament elected the question was resubmitted, and it was remained unanswered, so it has actually been on the notice paper for more than 12 months both in the term of this Parliament and in the term of the previous Parliament. I hope that no one will ask: 'What did you do?* It is terribly easy to say: 'You did the same sort of thing'. Perhaps we did. But we should realise that the Minister of today is the backbencher of tomorrow and vice versa. The first thing that we want to see is that there are adequate opportunities in this Parliament for members to question Ministers and to receive accurate replies, not the sort of replies that we have been receiving. I do believe that Ministers should try to improve their courtesy in answering questions and the quahty ofthose answers.",121
229,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! Before calling the next speaker, I point out that, so far this session, the Opposition has asked 282 questions without notice, of which the 4 leaders and deputy leaders have asked 101 questions. The remaining 56 Opposition members have shared 171 questions among them. I call the honourable member for Henty.",121
230,Mrs CHILD,ADJOURNMENT,"Some months ago a group of doctorsMr Garland- Mr Speaker, I rise to take a point of order. You have answered the matter raised by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn) by usingfiguresrelating to one side of the story. There is another side to the story and the details",121
231,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member will resume his seat. 1 may speakMr Garland-You took an unfair position.,121
232,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr MCLeay-He has.,121
233,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I can give an explanation when I so desire. If the honourable member looks at the Standing OrdersMr Garland- I am complaining about the method,121
234,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member will remain silent. Read the Standing Orders, if you so desire. I call the honourable member for Henty.",121
235,Mrs CHILD,ADJOURNMENT,"Some months ago a group of doctors in the East Bentleigh area in Victoria put a very detailed submission to the Minister for Health (Dr Everingham) for a community health centre. The centre was to be in East Bentleigh and was to have fee-for-service doctors with free paramedical services, both for the doctors who were to be in the centre and for all other doctors in the area who cared to refer their patients to the centre. There is nothing hke this centre in our district. From memory, the nearest community centre with similar services would be at the Southern Memorial Hospital in Caulfield, also heavily subsidised by this Government. The doctors detailed submission was duly accepted by this Government and a grant of almost $250,000 was made to set up the centre. Land was acquired in East Bentleigh, opposite the Moorabbin Hospital, now in the first stage of building. A public meeting was called. It was held at the Town Hall, Moorabbin, and chaired by the then Mayor. It was very well attended. A full debate on the proposal took place and a vote was taken on whether the community supported a health centre. It was overwhelmingly supported. Only some of the doctors present opposed it. The public meeting elected an interim committee of which I am a member and I , as well as many other people, believed that we were set to get the health centre. Regardless of what the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) has to say on this subject, we need a health centre. The honourable member for Hotham says that community health centres have a place but that priority must be given to putting them in areas where there are few doctors. He recommends that they should be built in the western and northern suburbs of Sydney. We need one too. General practitioners do not cope with alcoholism and drug addiction, do not do social work, do not look after the bewildered or the disturbed child and do not go to help families when they are about to break up. We need a health centre very badly in this area. The interim committee met and adopted a constitution in accord with the regulations of the Hospitals and Charities Commission. The committee set out to see that the centre would be built and that it would serve the thousands of people in that area. At about this time the Victorian Branch of the Australian Medical Association reared its head again. It is reported in the local newspapers as recommending that doctors do not apply to work in the centre, that they boycott it, and that if the centre does go ahead doctors in the area should advise their patients not to use the free paramedical services which would be provided. For how long do we have to put up with the fact that the AMA is telling this community who will have a community health centre and who will not? There is a constant prate about free choice. If there are 60 doctors in East Bentleigh and a health centre is built, the choice has been expanded. It has not been made narrower. I think that most of the doctors are speaking through their pockets. The health centre will serve something like 20,000 people. As there are 101,000 people hving in Moorabbin where the health centre is being built, I do not think that the doctors will lack for patients. But what I object to is that they are attempting to take away from the community, which voted for the centre, its right to have it. The next phase was rather interesting. The doctors in the area called a private meeting. That was not very democratic. It was not a pubhc meeting like the one called to discuss the health centre. It was a private meeting and one needed an invitation to get in. But more than that, they had a pohce guard on the door so that people could not get in. At one time there were 4 carloads of police at the hall. I do not know what they expected the two old ladies who were outside to do. Mr Daly-That is democratic!",121
236,Mrs CHILD,ADJOURNMENT,"It is extremely democratic; my colleague is quiterightthere. Two cars left. Obviously there was no business. I would like to know to what lengths such people are prepared to go to prevent intrusion into their practice. To what lengths are people prepared to go to prevent the community from enjoying the very obvious benefits of . free paramedical services? What is important here-doctors ' profits or people's health? What price is democracy when all opposition is barred from entering a meeting? What happened to free and open debate and what happened to democracy? Community health cenues are a new concept. They will be with us whether we like them or not. Medicine, hke everything else, has to move with the times. As social pressures have built up in society today we cannot expect the general practitioner to be able to cope with them. He tends to the physical complaints of the patients who come to him. It is well recognised that we need social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, chiropodists, home visit nurses and speech therapists freely available to the people who need them. One does not have to live in the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne to be in need of the services which will be offered at the centre. Alcoholics and drug addicts do not all live in the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne. It is an unfortunate fact that they are spread around the community. I imagine that we have them in my electorate too. Broken homes do not just occur in the western and northern suburbs nor do we have disturbed or deliquent children in only the northern and western suburbs. This health centre will go ahead because there are enough people in the community at East Bentleigh who are determined that this service will be offered. The doctors' comments that we are duplicating the services of the hospital being built opposite are just a load of rubbish. The money will go to the Victorian Hospitals and Charities Commission and I am quite sure that with its efficiency it will not see services duplicated. The hospital will provide its services and the health centre opposite will complement the services that are available in the hospital. There is an enormous area in the south-eastern part of Melbourne which is not well serviced by hospitals. In the inner suburban areas and the inner city there is a lot of excellent servicing through hospitals and quite a bit of community servicing, The area to which I have been referring is virtually in a desert. The Southern Memorial Hospital at Caulfield is a magnificent instimember tution but after all it cannot handle the thousands of people who are living around the southern part of Melbourne. The health centre will go ahead in spite of the opposition and people will use it in spite of the opposition. I feel that it would be a grave deficiency in our community if we were to revert to the vicious debate that we had last year when the national health scheme was being debated. It did not do any section of the community any good to be torn about by the arguments that went on then. I would not like to see the health centre I am speaking about divide the community.",122
237,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 11 o'clock, the House stands adjourned until Monday next at 15 minutes past 2 o'clock p.m. unless Mr Speaker shall by telegram addressed to each of the Housefixa later time of meeting. House adjourned at 11 p.m.",123
