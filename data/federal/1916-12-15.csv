1,Mr GROOM,STATE INTERFERENCE WIT H,"In view of t i e recent judgment of the High Court regarding the Queensland Government's embargo on the exportation of stock from the State, will the Prime Minister suggest to the Premiers, at'their Conference, th© advisability of an arrangement between them for the prevention of State interference with Inter-State trade?",4
2,Mr HUGHES,STATE INTERFERENCE WIT H,"As the trouble referred to arose out of the action of the Queensland Government, there is little hope of that State being a party to an arrangement which would prevent it from continuing its embargo on the exportation of stock, which, in my view, is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, and prejudicial to the welfare of the community.",4
3,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,STATE INTERFERENCE WIT H,"Did not the judgment of the High Court indicate, if it did not suggest, that the National Parliament could set matters right by legislation? If that is so, is the Prima Minister prepared to introduce such legislation ?",5
4,Mr HUGHES,STATE INTERFERENCE WIT H,"The High Court declared that the Queensland Act was a valid exercise of the powers of the Parliament"" of the Stat©, and, consequently, what was done under it was within the State's jurisdiction. NA OFFENDERS.",5
5,Mr WATKINS,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,I ask the Assistant Minister representing the Minister of fence whether anything has been done to mitigate sentences which have been imI posed on lads who have served Australian Imperial Force in Egypt and at ANZAC.

If he has received that information, he supply it to the Housej and, if not, will he endeavour to obtain it?",5
8,Mr HUGHES,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"I have not received any information on the subject, and I am any surplus. not aware that the Imperial Government has received a communication from the Central Powers, or that they have made any direct proposals for peace to it have read certain statements in the papers, aa to which I remind the honorthat able gentleman that during the recent conscription campaign the cablegrams which appeared in the press were freselling quently referred to as having Perhaps the cablegrams in which the peace proposals are mentioned may have been "" faked,"" as it was alleged, during the *eferendum campaign, others were. BUTTER INDUSTRY.",5
9,Mr TUDOR,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"I have here a letter from a firm of butter agents in Victoria, in which it is stated that, owing to the limited quantity of factory butter coming forward for local distribution, it willb e found impossible to supply the public with the best butter. Has the attention of the Minister heen drawn to this state of affairs, and will he have inquiries made into the complaint, so that the agreement entered into with the butter producers may be kept, and the people given butter at a fair price ?",5
10,Mr ARCHIBALD,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"If'the honourable member will give me the letter, I shall make an inquiry into the complaints contained in it. Various committees throughout the States are seeing that provision is made for adequately meeting the requireDements of the public in respect of butter, and limiting the exportation accordingly. f any irregularity has been committed, I in the shall have it investigated.",5
11,Mr MASSYGREENE,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"Will the Minister take particular care to see that requests speculators, such as that submitted the honourable member for Yarra, who to reap the difference between the a London parity and the Australian price of butter are not acceded to by his Depart? Will he also see that the influence which speculators could always bring to bear while the honourable member for Yarra was Minister for Trade and Customs is not allowed to interfere with the workMinister ing of the Department ?",5
12,Mr ARCHIBALD,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"I assure the honourable member that he need not be afraid It is will the intention of the Government to see that Australia is given a sufficient supply of butter, and to allow the exportation of",5
13,Mr MANIFOLD,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"Is it not a fact that, so far as Victoria is concerned at any rate, the understanding between the . I butter producers and the Government has newsbeen more than honourably observed, and more than the required percentage is being put on the market at the present time? Is not the "" p o o l "" every week the surplus to exporters, or to perbeen faked. sons who buy for export?",5
14,Mr ARCHIBALD,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"I wish it to be understood that I make no reflection on any one' connected with the butter industry. So far as I know, the arrangement is working satisfactorily. I do not wish, it to be thought that I have referred to speculators or to any one else connected with the industry in unfavorable terms. REPRESSION OF SEDITION. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the regulations which issued by the Government of New Zealand for the repression of sedition, and will right honourable gentleman consider the question:advisability of taking similar steps to protect the community of Australia from the activities of . disloyalists and sedition mongers ?",5
15,Mr HUGHES,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"The honourable member has handed me a newspaper paragraph, from which I gather the scope of the regulations referred to. I have given notice of my intention to introduce at the earliest possible moment a Bill to provide for the suppression of sedition. r SALE OF WOOL.",6
16,Mr SAMPSON,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,Can the Prime Minister assure the country that the small wool-growers will have direct representation on the Board of Control which has been instituted in connection with the wool deal?,6
17,Mr HUGHES,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"So far as I know, the interests of all wool-growers, small and large, are effectively safeguarded.",6
18,Mr SAMPSON,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"Will the small growers of wool be directly represented on the Board of Control? I represent a constituency in which there are many small wool-growers, and from all parts of it comes the statement that they desire such representation. Will the - Prime Minister assure the House that this direct representation will be given to them?",6
19,Mr HUGHES,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"I cannot give that assurance. All I can do is to give consideration to the request, and submit it to the Committee, which, I may say, is only an Advisory Committee, and does not control anything; there is no control vested in anybody but the Government. If the honourable member can make such representations to me as to show that any one's interest is not properly safeguarded at present I shall see that steps are taken to safeguard it . QUEENSLAND LIGHTHOUSES.",6
20,Mr GROOM,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"Can the Minister for Trade and Customs inform the House as to the progress made with lighthouses and lights on the North Queensland coast; what lighthouses are in contemplation during the financial year, and what is being done in the construction of steamers have been for lighthouse purposes?",6
21,Mr ARCHIBALD,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"The following is the the answer to the honourable member's 1. The following work has been carried, out:Queensland. Booby Island - The quarters at Booby Island have been renovated, and extensive repairs carried out. Goode Island - Thes e quarters have been thoroughly repaired and renovated. Grassy Hill - The quarters at Grassy Hill , Cooktown, have been repainted and repairs effected to the ceilings, and stumps of foundations renewed. New Construction Work - Ne w unattended lights have been erected at Clerke Island, Dhu Reef, and Coquet Island Reef. Pipon Island Beef has been converted from an attended light to an unattended light. The constructional work was re-commenced on the 27th May, and base of the foundations for Piper Island was completed on 31st August. Considerable difficulties were experienced on account of the reef being submerged at high water, thus necessitating tide work which, together with the unexpectedly bad weather, delayed progress. 2. New lighthouses proposed to be constructed, or partly constructed, during financial year 1916-17:Queensland. Albany Rock. Turtle Island. Cairncross Island. Hannibal Island. Piper Island (partly completed). Chapman Island. Tih Tih Reef. Heath Reef. Breaksea Spit Lightship nearly completed. Proudfoot Shoal Lightship commenced. Western Australia. 14-mile Point. ' Escape Island. Tasmania. Cape Forestier. West Point-completed . Northern Territory. > Cape Don-nearin g completion. Buoys- , Marsh Shoal. Henry Ellis Reef. Cape Vernon. Roper Island. - Howard Knoll . Cape Keith. 3. The Department has chartered, for a term of two years, the s.s. Lady Loch from the Victorian Government, and has purchased the s.s. Karuah for the work in North Queensland. The Department also purchased the s.s. Governor Alusyravc from the South Australian Government for Western Australian work. Owing to the war, difficulty has been experienced in getting now vessels built in Australia, but it is hoped that arrangements may shortly be made for the construction of one steamer. PRICES OF PRODUCE .",6
22,Mr SINCLAIR,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,"Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Price Fixin g Commissioners in the States are fixing prices for f.o.b. sales of export produce-butter , for instance?",7
23,Mr HUGHES,SENTENCES ON MILITAR Y,Not to my knowledge; but I shall make inquiries. NA COCKATOO ISLAND .,7
24,Mr MASSYGREENE,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,"Has the attention of the Minister for the Navy been drawn to a letter in the Sydney Morning Herald, from which the following is an extract: I was in the Domain this afternoon, and I heard a young man, who says he is employed at the works on Cockatoo Island, deliver an address from the I.W.W. platform. This young man boasted that he was "" going slow,"" and was doing as little work as he possibly could do. He also boasted that all, or nearly all , the men engaged at these works belonged to the "" go slow "" brigade. He further stated that he had been the means of persuading five boys in a shearing shed in Queensland to practice the ""go slow"" policy. He made other similar statements. If the Minister's attention has been drawn to the matter, what steps have been taken by the Department to ascertain how many of the men employed at Cockatoo are connected, directly or in directly, with the Industrial Workers of the World, and if there are such men employed there, what is it proposed to do in regard to them?",7
25,Mr HUGHES,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,"I have not seen the statement referred to. I think, however, that the gentleman who heard this young man in the Domain on the particular Sunday must he a stranger to Sydney, because he could have heard similar sentiments any Sunday he chose to go there. The extract sets forth part of a gospelnot a gospel of glad tidings, but still a gospel, which is preached with much energy by some people. I do not know that any of those persons who preach that gospel are employed at Cockatoo Island, but my colleague, the Minister for the Navy, may be able to give some direct information on that subject. The Government, however, do not approve or endorse the policy-w e are not adherents or followers of that gospel, indeed we are implacably opposed to it , and we propose, as far as it lies within the power of man, to quench it as its source.",7
26,Mr JENSEN,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,"A copy of the statement that has been read was sent to me from Sydney. I referred it to the manager at Cockatoo Island, and ascertained who the person was who made the statement. He was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, and, on my order, he was immediately dismissed. WORLD. PRICEOF COPPER.",7
27,Mr FENTON,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,H as the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the fact that the price of copper has reached £161 10s. per ton? What are the Government doing to regulate the price to the copper users of Australia?,7
28,Mr HUGHES,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,"I have not noticed that the price of copper has gone up to that figure; but if it has, I am not r e sponsible. As to the rest, I shall look into the matter, though I do not know what I can do. On the one hand, I am asked to see that the producer gets full value for his produce, and, on the other hand, I am told that he must in no circumstances be allowed to do so. The position is very difficult. I am asked to see that the farmer gets full value for his produce, and also that the workman shall have full value for his labour. I am asked by producers generally to see that Australia's "" end is kept up,"" and that we get good prices for our products abroad; and then I am asked to keep the price of copper down. I shall endeavour to do all these things.",7
29,Mr FENTON,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,"H a v in g regard to the fact that copper is now three times the price at which it was quoted in pre-war times, and that a large quantity of that copper is being used in the manufacture of small arms ammunition and other munitions in Australia, will the Prime Minister endeavour to give some relief in connection with the purchase of that copper for the manufacture of munitions of war ?",7
30,Mr HUGHES,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,"I must have the question in black and white, so that I can see whither it leads me. When we are dealing with a commodity, the price of which is fixed in the markets of the world, and the local consumption of which is infinitesimal compared with the oversea business, one must hesitate a good deal before he attempts to depress the local price of the raw material below the world's price. Of course, I» shall see that the local price is not inflated beyond the London parity, but there must be some very good and sufficient reason before we endeavour to depress it below that parity. We do not attempt that in connection with any other commodity. For instance, we are selling wheat now at 4s. 9d. f.o.b., and 4s. 9d. for local consumption. The same condition applies to products generally. ARSENAL.",8
31,Mr ATKINSON,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,"Can the Minister for Trade and Customs inform the House generally at what stage the proceedings are in' connection with the proposed arsenal? Is it the Government's intention to go on with the work now, or are they going to take the wiser course of postponing it for further advice?",8
32,Mr BAMFORD,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,"A few days ago the Treasurer stated that a report on the question was now being prepared by an expert, and nothing will be done until that report is presented. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",8
33,Mr HUGHES,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,"I desire to make a 'personal explanation in reference to a statement which appears in the Argus of this morning, and which arises out of the question asked by the honourable member for Illawarra yesterday. In that newspaper I am. reported to have said that the three amounts mentioned-£7 3 6s. 8d., £206 5s., and £81 18s. 2d - were all paid by me into the Patriotic Fund, and that the total amount was £361 9s. lOd. What I did say was that the total payment by me was £319 2s., and I ought to have said that it was made, not into the Patriotic Fund, but into the Repatriation Fund. I now desire to add one word, in order to explain what became of the difference between £319 and £361, £42 7s. 10d., representing the deductions from Ministers' salaries for payment to the Honorary Minister and Whips-Sena tor Gardiner, Senator Russell, Senator Ready, and the Honourable member for Maranoa was paid to Senator Russell for distribution amongst these gentlemen. COMPULSORY SERVICE: PROSECUTIONS. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I have received a letter from Mr T. Docking, of the North-West Coast, Tasmania, in reference to the imprisonment of his' son for failing to enrol under the Enlistment Proclamation. Mr Docking saysMy son was sentenced to one month's imprisonment for failing to enroll under the War Proclamation Act. The case was heard em parte",8
34,Mr SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,I trust that the honourable member is not going to read a long letter. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The letter is very short.,8
35,Mr SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,"Thoug h it may he permissible for'an honourable member to read a letter at length, it is not desirable; and I think the case might be put without reading the whole. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The request made by Mr Docking is that his son shall be released in order to help on the farm. He points out that the crops are late on account of the heavy rains, and that he was depending on the assistance of his son under the difficult circumstances. This young man is suffering imprisonment, although the referendum was decided in the negative, and I wish to know whether the Minister will do something in the case.",8
36,Mr LAIRD SMITH,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,I have not seen the letter; but I shall be glad to bring the matter under the notice of the Minister for Defence. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.,8
37,Mr TUDOR,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF TH E,"I rise to make a personal explanation in regard to a statement contained in an Age sub-leader concerning my resignation from the Ministry. In the Senate, Senator Russell stated that in letters sent on the 12th September he and I were asked by the labour bodies to resign. The fact is well known to at least four members of the present Ministry that I intimated my intention to resign a month before the date of that letter. Senator Russell knew that. - The Age endeavours to make it appear that my resignation was on account of the receipt of that letter. I received no such letter, and my intention was well known to Ministers. I did not make it known to any outsiders u n t i l I had written to the Prime Minister, but he knows that I notified him as to the course of action I proposed to take. The Age is doing me an injustice in saying that I resigned in obedience to an instruction, when, as a matter of fact, my mind had been made up long before any such letter as that mentioned by Senator Russell was written. NA  .General taken cognisance of the fact that various trade unions are passing; resolutions in favour of the Industrial Workers of the World, and that some of them are reflecting on the justice of the Court which tried certain men ? Is he aware also that some of the unions are assisting financially to obtain redress of what is claimed to be the grievances of those In dustrial Workers of the World?",8
38,Mr HUGHES,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE,"I have noticed the fact mentioned by the honourable member, but, as I have already stated, the Government propose to introduce before we adjourn for the holidays a measure dealing with the Industrial Workers of the World. Honourable members will see whether the Bill deals with the phase of the question raised by the honourable member for Echuca, but I prefer not to express any opinion in anticipation of the measure. PEACE PROPOSALS.",9
39,Mr HIGGS,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE,"Shoul d it prove that, the cablegrams concerning ,peace proposals by Germany have not been faked, will the Prime Minister ask that Australia shall be consulted before any peace terms are agreed to? - Mr HUGHES - If it should be proved already paid? that there is some foundation for the allegation that Germany has made an offer of peace terms, when those peace terms have been considered by the British Government, and an opinion has been expressed upon them, I shall be very glad to lay them .before honourable members so that the House may express its views. I have expressly refrained from saying more in connection with this matter than that, in my opinion, no peace will be satisfactory that does not place the countries which have been invaded, outraged, and destroyed back where they were, with an indemnity sufficiently large to re-establish their industries and rebuild their ruined cities, and, in addition, insure that this international criminal, that has outraged the world, is prevented from ever again doing so.",9
40,Mr HIGGS,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE,That is not an answer to my question. WOO LCLIP .,9
41,Mr RODGERS,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE,"The Prime Minister has announced the sale of the Australian wool clip to the Imperial Government at 15Jd. per pound for greasy wool. Is WORLD. Australia to ' get the same benefit as New Zealand, with which an arrangement has been made that when the requirements of the Imperial authorities have been supplied the balance of the clip will be sold in England, the I m perial Government taking all risk that it will produce '15Jd., and any price realized for the residuum in excess of that sum to be divided equally between the Imperial Government and New Zealand?",9
42,Mr HUGHES,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE,"As I understand it , the' arrangement between the Imperial Government and New Zealand is that all wool used for governmental purposes is to be paid for at the rate of 15£d. per pound greasy. The residue, if any, is to be sold in the market, and the extra price is to be shared equally between the I m perial Government and New ZealandThe same arrangement, of course,- exists with Australia. If the balance is sold for a higher price than 15^d., half the excess will go to the grower and half - to the British Government.",9
43,Dr CARTYSALMON,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE,"Will the Prime Minister consider the position of those who purchased small quantities of this year's clip, mainly from small farmers, and endeavour to give them some relief on account of the price they' have",9
44,Mr HUGHES,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE,"I ,had hoped to be able to see the Chairman of the Committee on this and cognate matters raised yesterday, but I regret that I was unable to do so. However, I shall endeavour to see that relief is granted to the small men who are likely to suffer, because the normal channels through which they have obtained financial relief in the past have been closed.

45,Mr KELLY,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Works consult with his colleagues with a view to making a statement to the House before the holiday adjournment as to whether any locomotives have been purchased or ordered for the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway, in addition to those recommended by the Engineer-in-Chief ?",10
46,Mr SPENCE,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE,I shall be glad to consult with the Minister for Works on the matter. S.S. MCTROUYA.,10

51,Mr SINCLAIR,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE,"Will the Postmaster General say whether there has been any alteration made in the method of computsurer, upon noticeing the amount paid to allowance postmasters in country districts, and whether any consideration has been given to the fact that these officers have to perform in the matter of paying pensions, separation allowances, and allotment money for the Defence Department ?",10
52,Mr WEBSTER,INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE,"There has been no alteration to the formula upon which the payment is made to allowance officers except that where additional duties are imposed on them for military services, or otherwise, they are paid proportionately in accordance with th© work performed.

Whatever I said the in that regard would have been looked up and used by the press against me, because on the matter of conscription the conscriptionists had practically the whole of the press of Australia hacking them up, and six out of seven Governments, and six out of seven Oppositions in Australia. It is said that honourable members from distant States sliould have the opportunity of getwrong. ing to their States, but I would like to know how much those honourable did during the previous recruiting campaign.",11

65,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"In m y opinion, they should be here. We should all be here. If half the energy that was put into conscription campaign had been put'into the recruiting campaign, recruiting would have been infinitely more successful. Many men have gone on the platform during ing the 'referendum campaign and made great protestations as to whom they sent to the front ; but they d id not send them. As I have heard it put, we have not sent any men from Australia, for those who have gone away have gone gation after all. voluntarily. It was said of the chairman of an anti-conscriptionist meeting at Castlemaine, at which I spoke, that he was an anti-conscriptionist because he was afraid that his son would have to go, whereas his son had already gone, and his wife, who' was also an anti-conscripsatisfactory. tionist, had eight brothers who had gone, two of them to meet their death and third to be reported as missing. Some cluded. people who howled "" Conscription "" made all sorts of excuses when their sons were called up under the proclamation.

75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I am beginning to think that there is something in the alle- .,12
76,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"No . What I did say was that if conscriptionists and anti-conscriptionists alike had thrown themselves with equal energy into the recruiting campaign the result would have been more That statement will be found reported in the issue of the Age on a the day that the recruiting tour conI trust that the Government will agree to the request made by the Senate, and that we shall be afforded an opportunity to deal with other legislation that awaits attention. It is absolutely impossible for us before the Christmas adjournment to dispose of the measures foreshadowed of by the Prime Minister last night. I am as anxious as is any honourable member that certain Bills should be dealt with. I , have been very anxious for some - time the Tariff, for instance, should be disposed of ; but that cannot be done before Christmas. Then there is the position of the iron industry to be considered. The Leader of the Liberal party referred to the importance of that industry a few the days ago. The bounty on steel and iron terminates, I think, on the 31st instant. I do not know whether the Government propose to continue the bounty, but if it be correct, as reported recently in the that the Newcastle works alone expect this year to turn out about 150,000 tons of steel, that means that we should have to pay something like £250,000 by way of bounty on the production of that factory alone, apart from the iron and' steel produced at Lithgow. I do not think the Government are prepared in the present circumstances to provide so large a sum for that purpose. We have a right, however, to deal fairly with the iron industry, which has been encouraged a system different from that adopted for the encouragement- of other The report of the Inter-State with regard to the iron industry is probably the best that it has issued. We cannot deal with all the legislation shadowed by the Prime Minister night as necessary to be disposed of before Christmas. \",12
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,We can deal with it . What the honourable member means to say is that he will not deal with it .,13
78,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I do not mean that. Take the iron industry. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It can with quite distinctly.,13
79,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"But not in five minutes. Then, again, the interests affected by the Tariff are too far-reaching to be hurriedly disposed of.",13
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The T a r if f can be dealt with, in a certain way, before Christmas.",13
81,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The urgency of that and other measures is another reason why we should f all in with the request made by the Senate, and refuse to grant more than two months' Supply.",13
82,Mr SAMPSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Is the honourable member in favour of surrendering to the Senate the rights of this House.,13
83,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"In connection with the consideration of the T a r if f in 1902, the right honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Parkes advocated that the Senate should have the right to amend such a taxation measure. If the right honourable member for Parramatta now says that we shall surrender our rights to the Senate by yielding to this request, I shall have much pleasure in quoting from Hansard what he said on that occasion.",13
84,Mr BAMFORD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The honourable member knows that the Government gave way on that occasion because the T a r if f had to be passed within two years.,13
85,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"This Bill must also be dealt with at once. This is the day on which the fortnightly payments to public servants should be made, so that there is infinitely more reason for dealing'expeditiously with this Supply Bill than there was for so dealing with the Tariff Bill in\ 1902.",13
86,Mr SAMPSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Was it not expressly declared that the action of the House under in regard f o the Senate's requests with respect to the 1902 Tariff should not be industries. treated as a precedent? Commission Mr TUDOR - That is often done. The Government will not lose anything by agreeing to this request. fore- Mr Webster - The country wil l lose last recruits.,13
87,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The Postmaster-General, who can find time to conduct proceedings before a Royal Commission, should be able to find time for the approaching recruiting campaign. The great majority of members of this Parliament were able to take an active part in the .conscription campaign, although we be dealt did not adjourn u n t i l about the 29th September, and th© vote was taken a month later. Surely it is equally important that we should all take an interest in the forthcoming recruiting campaign, which cannot be got under way u n t i l well after the Christmas holidays. I have already seen the officer who is to be in charge of the. recruiting arrangements in my electorate.",13
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Whic h shows the selfishness of what the honourable member is proposing. He lives in his electorate.,13
89,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,No electorate is more than a week's-journey from this House.,13
90,Mr BAMFOED,COMPULSORY SERVICE,There are very few honourable members who desire to come back in February.,13
91,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"We have a right to be in attendance here to do the work of the country. We were told in the press the other day that we ar© now to hav© responsible government - If the present Administration is a sample of responsible government, then I can only say that we have never before had such a thing in th© . Commonwealth. Hardl y one member of the Government party is sure of re-election. I like the Treasurer's chance, and that is only an even-money chance, but a man who was making a book would be prepared to lay 100 to 1 that some members of the Government party will not be re-elected. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I think the Committee should agree to this request. Th© re-, cruiting campaign will lose nothing by such action on our part. Both the Government and the Liberal party have admitted that the question of conscription is now out of the way, so that honourable members should be able to work unitedly in the recruiting campaign, and do their very best to secure more volunteers.",13
92,Mr HUGHES,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"West'Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.41]. - The honourable member for Yarra did not deal with the Deluge, but he touched on almost every other subject. He passed very lightly over the fact that this House is very jealous of its privileges, and that the Senate, which has made this request to us to cut down Supply from three to two months, is thereby seeking to take out of the hands of this branch of the Legislature the control of the purse that properly belongs to it . If the question is solely one as to whether we should remain here to do our duty, I am bound to say I see no reason why we should adjourn over the Christmas holidays. Either certain measures are urgent or they are not. If they are urgent, there is no reason why we should adjourn except over Sunday and Christmas Day. One would imagine, after hearing the honourable member for Yarra's speech on the urgency of the iron bounty that unless it was dealt with forthwith dreadful things would happen. Notwithstanding the urgency of that matter, however, he contemplates that we should engage for at least a month in a recruiting campaign. I take my stand on the position that this House has to determine how the moneys of the people shall be spent. It has also to determine the length of Supply necessary for the purposes of the Government. It determined by an overwhelming majority that three months' Supply was necessary.",14
93,Mr THOMAS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,There was no division; the House was unanimous.,14
94,Mr HUGHES,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"There was such an overwhelming majority in this House in favour of granting the Government three months' Supply that the honourable member for Yarra and his followers were not. prepared to challenge us. No argument is put forward in support of this request except that we ought to go on with some work. I am prepared to go on with work every day in the week except Sunday, but like an offer I once made to cut down all salaries to 10s. a day, it is quite clear that such a proposal does not evoke any enthusiasm. I do not think that any Government would live long that ventured to ask Parliament to sit six days a week. If Parliament did sit six days a week the sessions would be short, which would be a salutary reform. I am prepared to fix a date for the re-assembling of Parliament which will enable us io deal with the Tariff and the iron bounty, both of which must either be passed practically without discussion, or must take five or six months to discuss. The alternatives are to legalize what has been done, or to thresh out the subjects at length. If the iron bounty is unsuitable, let it run out at the end of the year. If not, let us consider it under the new conditions. The iron industry is in a better position now than it was when the bounty was granted. If we accept two months' supply, Parliament will have to re-assemble in the last week of January, or in the first week of February, and it is desirable, for the sake of the recruiting campaign, that we shall adjourn u n t i l , say, the third week in February.",14
95,Mr RODGERS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,That campaign cannot be started in the wheat districts for a month to come.,14
96,Mr HUGHES,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Nothin g can be done u n t i l after the holidays, and then a full month will be needed to start the campaign. We ought not to contemplate reassembling before the thir d week in February, or the first week in March. That should be a satisfactory arrangement for all parties. It would give sufficient time for the recruiting campaign, in which all parties can earnestly co-operate. On reassembling, we shall have time to deal with the matters that have been mentioned. No case can be made out for the unprecedented attempt of the Senate to take the control of the public purse from this House, a control which it should never surrender, and the circumstances do not warrant the granting of a lesser supply than that for which we have asked. Mr HIGGS . (Capricornia) [11.51] - I do not, and I am sure the Committee does not, regard the request of the Senate as unprecedented. That body is quite within its rights in asking us to provide for two months' instead of for three months' Supply. Y e t the Prime Minister has exalted its request into a refusal to grant Supply, and into an attempt to take from this House the control of the purse. Is not that'an exaggeration? The Senate frequently has had reason to complain that vast proposals forexpenditure, passed in this House only too speedily, have been sent to it without sufficient time being allowed for their proper consideration.",14
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I understand that this Supply Bill was discussed in the Senate for a much longer time than was given to any of the Supply Bills introduced by the honourable member.,15
98,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The Leader of the Liberal party, who is the strong supporter of the present Government",15
99,Mr WISE,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The honourable member's objection to him is that he is not a strong supporter of the House of Tudor.,15
100,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"No doubt the Leader of the Liberal party will say that the last Government, just prior to the 30th June last, was able to pass expenditure, amounting to millions of pounds, in a few minutes; but the reason why the Estimates for last year were not considered at an earlier date was that the Prime Minister was away in England for a considerable part of the year. He had in tended to be away for four months only, and with our consent remained away for seven months. If the Prime Minister is willing that Parliament shall re-assemble in the third week in February, two months' Supply will be ample. That will carry the Treasurer to the 15th February, after which date he can provide for expenditure out of the Treasurer's Advance. In his interim financial statement the honourable gentleman said that on taking charge of the Treasury he found that his predecessor had authorized the expenditure since the 1st J u l y of the whole amount of his advance £1,700,000.  £5S,000 to that.",15
101,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The honourable member gave a table showing the amounts provided in the Supply Bill paid for i previous year from loan funds, authority being taken from the Treasurer's A d vance for the expenditure of £1,020,000. If the Government get three months' supply they will be able to remain in recess until the end of A p r i l . What is the reason for the anxiety of the Prime M in ister and his right-hand supporter to pass the Tariff without discussion before the Christmas adjournment?",15
102,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,There is collusion between these two Free Traders.,15
103,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Bot h are extreme Free Traders, having no sympathy - with the Protectionist doctrine.",15
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,And the honourable member is a Protectionist I . W . W . He won't work.,15
105,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I ask for your protection, Mr Chairman, against the attempt of the Leader of the Liberal party to associate me with the Industrial Workers of the World. He said that I stood for the protection of the Industrial Workers of the World .",15
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I did not. I said that the honourable member was a Protectionist I . W . W .,15
107,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"That is a horse of the same colour. The political intrigues of the honourable member and of the Prime Minister are with a view to the defamation of the political party to which I belong. Will you, Mr Chairman, allow him to defame my political character?",15
108,The CHAIRMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I do 'not regard what the honourable member for Parramatta has said as defaming the honourable member.,15
109,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I hope that the electors will take the same view of his words. Do the right honourable member and the Prime Minister desire to get three months' Supply, so that they may carry on u n t i l the end of A p r i l , and then spring an election on the country, in the meantime governing by regulation ? The Senate has reason for objecting to this procedure. Has not the Prime Minister stated that he declines to recognise tlieir disallowance of regulations, and that he will continue of to pass regulations, and put them into operation during the recess? The Senate has as much right as the House of Representatives to supervise the public expenditure. Why was the Senate constituted as it is, with six representatives from each n the State, although in some States the population is quite out of proportion to that of large States like New South Wales and Victoria ? Why is it that Tasmania has six representatives in the Senate, while New South Wales, with a very much larger population, has only the same number? The reason is that if the Senate had not such representation it would be a very easy matter for the honourable member for Barrier and other representatives of New South Wales, together with representatives of Victoria, to vote away money as they liked, quite ignoring the interests of the smaller States. ",15
110,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"On democratic lines. It is of no use our "" putting our heads in the saud "" in regard to this matter.",16
111,Mr THOMAS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,You are not of a system of that kind ?,16
112,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am not in favour of the representatives of New South Wales and Victoria combining to vote the public moneys raised by taxation and otherwise, solely in the interests of the two larger States. I do not think the honourable member for Barrier would consider that a democratic procedure. We know that in the various State Parliaments the representatives of the larger constituencies would spend all the money in those constituencies if the people out-back had not the representation they now enjoy. many country constituencies the number of people and voters is, perhaps, half that to be found in those of the large cities. You, Mr Chairman, as a country member, know that the reason the public do not accept what appears to be a logical and reasonable proposal, namely, one vote one value, is that if the larger populated electorates in and about .the big cities had as much voting power as have the people in the country districts, the latter could not possibly get fair play in the Houses qf Parliament.",16
113,Mr THOMAS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Then the Victorian system in the State Parliament is right.,16
114,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"No , it is not. The honourable member is exaggerating mostunduly.",16
115,Mr SAMPSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Is that the States right corner over there?,16

117,Dr CABTY SALMON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Wit h tions !,16
118,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"W it h qualifications, I am a States righter. I believe in in creasing the number of States; indeed, in my opinion, Australia will never be well governed until the number of States is increased.",16
119,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,And the abolished.,16
120,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"No , I would not say that. The Senate is entitled to supervise the expenditure on the various services of the Commonwealth, and the request that we shall be satisfied with two months' Supply does not mean for a moment that another place is attempting to interfere with the control of the public purse. Senators have, I imagine, a desire to discuss items of expenditure as they ought to be discussed. informed in this morning's papers that £30,000 per annum is expended on the censors. If the Prime Minister could get the censors to devote themselves to their in favour proper duties-namely , the dealing with the information that it is proposed to publish from a military point of view, and not from the point of view of political necessity-the cost might be cut down by £15,000.",16
121,The CHAIRMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I think the honourable member is going beyond the scope of the question.,16
122,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am pointing out items which the Senate may wish to discuss, and which they will not have an opportunity to discuss if we give Supply enabling the In Government to carry on to the end of A p r i l. If three months' Supply be granted it would take us to the 15th March, and the Treasurer's Advance of £1,700,000, to be recouped, w i ll be there for the further use of the Government. :",16

It would be impossible to run a party if each mem-, ber were to do, as the honourable member for Barrier is apparently doing this morning, when he takes on himself the duty of defending his Leader in his own way. I venture to say that if the Prune Minister will indicate to Mr Speaker that he desires the House to be called together not later than 21st February, he will have very little difficulty in getting what he asks.",17

Therefore, I hope that the "" Emperor of the West "" will not bring any pressure bear on the Leader of the Liberal party to alter his views in regard to the early meeting of Parliament.

141,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Franklin) [12.14]. - I 'should not have spoken but for interjection of the honourable member for Wimmera, and some remarks made by the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Wimmera asked whether i was proper that this House should surrender its rights by allowing the Senate to suggest amendments in this Bill . The Prime Minister went further, and said that the action of the Senate was taking the control of business away from this House-that in this House, and in this House only, was vested the power of the purse. I say quite freely that if a vote were taken on that issue I should be in favour of the Senate retaining - the powers unquestionably granted to it by the Constitution. Under our party system this House has dealt with the powers of the Senate entirely as it suited the Government of the day. I remember that, during the term of the late Government, the Prime Minister said that the Senate must not be allowed to take control of the business of this House; but the we know that for the whole of one session the Opposition in the Senate did take the control out of the hands of the Government.",17
142,Mr THOMAS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Did the Opposition take control of Supply?,17
143,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I shall deal that question. During the reign of the Cook Government the majority then sitting in Opposition in the Senate took the control of the business out of the hands of the Government at every sitting. Mx. SAMPSON - That was with in the,17
144,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"D a y after day only the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, as soon as the first Order of the was called upon, moved that order 5 or 6 should take precedence of the others, thus the Opposition had control of the business at every sitting. In regard to Supply, the question of the power ofto the Senate to deal with money Bills was debated at the Federal Conventions perhaps at greater length than any other The delegates to the conferences were mostly men from the State Parliaments, and the framers of the Constitution had in mind the past actions of the Legislative Councils, which are elected on a more restricted franchise. Therefore, instead of giving to the Senate, which the is elected on the same franchise as the House of Representatives, the same power to deal with money Bills as is possessed hy the Legislative Councils, they gave it t the power to suggest amendments and to reject measures. There is not one constitutional writer who does not point out strongly that when a legislative body is given power to suggest and reject, it has practically most of the powers contained in the right to make amendments. Therefore, it is improper for this House to say that the Senate, in exercising the functions vested in it by the Constitution, is infringing the rights of this Chamber. I cannot imagine a more dangerous practice than that, in order to get an immediate party advantage, the rights of the second Chamber should be interfered with. Each Chamber is complete in its own orbit, and the Senate is merely exercising powers which have been conferred upon it under our Constitution. Therefore I advise the Government to accept the amendment. I believe that another place is in earnest.",17

153,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The Senate has a right to return the suggestion, and, according to every constitutional authority, the Senate, having the power to suggest and reject, has powers, excepting in the actual making of amendments, co-equal with those of this Chamber. Honourable members must recollect that we are not now dealing with a Chamber elected on a restricted franchise. It has the widest franchise of any legislative body in the world, a franchise which is wider than that of this Chamber, because we represent only portions of our States, whilst the Senate is elected by the total population of each State. If the Senate stands to its amendment, this House must either accept the suggestion or we must take the responsibility of losing the Supply Bill and bringing about a dissolution.",18

Such a thing is not w'ithin the range of practicability; therefore, unless some special arrangement is made, the lif e of this House, too, must expire about the third week in May.

One question in particular should be. dealt with before Parliament is dissolved, and that is the repatriation of our soldiers. as a member of the War Committee, I say that this matter has been delayed too long. There has been a responsibility from the Federal Government to the Central War Council, which has transferred the responsibility to the State War Councils. I believe that expected the State W a r Councils and trustees have done acertain amount of must be fought tooth and nail. very good work, but no honourable member can say that the scheme for the repatrialine tion of returned soldiers is in a satisfacmonsense tory position.

There is a clear disi n tinction between the request of the Senate, which is simply asking that Supply be reduced by one month, and the attitude it would be taking up if it should to supply the money that is necessary to carry on the government of the two country. Even had the latter course been adopted I would have been inclined to say that the Senate was perfectly justithe fied, because when there was a proposal to in this Chamber to reduce Supply by £1,000,000 I expressed the opinion, - which I express again in regard to the Senate's requests, that the proposed reduction was altogether too modest. months' Supply in our circumstances is a thing utterly inconsistent with respon, sible government. We have the position in this House that thirteen members out of seventy-five are dependent on the Opposition for support to get even, their Supply Bills through. We have a Government who are dependent on their political opponents for their very existence.",19
167,Mr WISE,COMPULSORY SERVICE,That is how the Labour party first got into office.,20

Future students of political economy and methods of government will wonder how it is that a party of thirteen could carry on the government of Australia with so many honourable members in opposition to them in both Houses. One wonders why Ministers choose to carry on in the circumstances. Perhaps it is their, love of office; or, perhaps, their opinion of their particular ability, distinction to that of other honourable members, to carry government of the country, is such that they think no other Government could be found of equal merit and ability. They are not compelled to accept the requests made by the Senate, or to accept Supply from this House, unless they are prepared to stick to office will y - n ill y ,' so long as they can get sufficient Supply with which' to carry on. i am opposed to granting them Supply, because I am not prepared to continue them in office for a single day.

175,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"In the exercise of its legitimate rights the Senate has refused to pass certain regulations.

I ask hi m not to proceed on those lines, because to do so is to commit a distinct breach of the rules of the House.",20
185,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,My second reason for not agreeing to the giving of Supply is the misuse of the public money that has taken place. ,21

189,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"It is quite wrong to say that I supported the last Government in regard to the censorship. unfortunately for the Government, a perfectly free critic of its action with regard to the censorship. The mere fact that money is squandered in carrying on such an institution proves that the present Government, or any other Government that would use public moneys for such a purpose at such a time as this, is not worthy of the confidence of the House, and should not be allowed to carry on the administration. According to 'the Treasurer it is necessary that honourable members should have a lengthy recess so that they may be able to tak© an active part in the recruiting campaign. always taken an active part in recruiting, and I hop© to continue to do so. I have written to the Director-General of Recruiting stating that I will assist in recruiting to the utmost of mypowers. My position is perfectly clear and plain. But who imagines for a moment that it is necessary for the success of recruiting that seventy-five members of the Hous© of Representatives and thirty-six Senators should be able to tour their electorates? Th© recruiting campaign that was carried on so vigorously previously, and which was so successful, was carried on largely without the assistance of honourable members.",21
190,Mr WISE,COMPULSORY SERVICE,That is not so. The services of honourable members were largely availed of.,21
191,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"A very small proportion of honourable members took part in the campaign. I had invitations in the early stages of the campaign, but later on it became in Queensland so strongly a matter of advocating conscription that it was found necessary to drop me; consequently I was not asked to take further part in recruiting meetings. But now the Prim© Minister coolly suggests, and the Director-General of Recruiting (asks that I should join in a recruiting campaign with men who do not want me, and who have - opposed me politically. Right from the beginning of the war they have not wanted me to act with them, and I do not wish to act with them, but I am quite willing to go on with reI t has cruiting. Having tried to k ill recruiting by means of their conscription proposals, they now desire to force us, whether we like it or. not, into a recruiting campaign. The present proposals with regard to a recruiting campaign are intended for purely political purposes, and not for the honest purposes of war. I was,",21
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,A dirty imputation !,21
193,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I say quite clearly that the Prime Minister's recruiting proposal and that of the Minister for Defence with regard to the formation of reserve battalions, creating new military institutions and organizations, are for political purposes, and nothing else. When the Prime Minister returned from England, with the great name that he had made for himself, and all the glory and praise that attached to his magnificent work there I have",21
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,On account of which the Labour party threw their hats in the air and hailed him as a demigod.,21
195,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I do not desire to retract one word that was said regarding the work done in England by the Prime Minister. Not by one word would I reduce the credit that is due to him for the work that he did there. I hav© always recognised that he served Australia re^ markably well by reason of many of th© things he did at Home, although I am somewhat doubtful as to some of th© utterances he made there.",21
196,Mr WISE,COMPULSORY SERVICE,There are no cheers fro m the honourable member's party.,21
197,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I have never said a word against what the Prime Minister did while at Home, but I shall have something to say about what he did out here.",22
198,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I have in this House supported some of the sentiments expressed concerning the Prime Minister's work in England. I did not agree with some of his Imperialistic utterances, nor do I agree now with those utterances.",22
199,Mr SAMPSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Does not the honourable member regard Australia as a part of the Empire ?,22
200,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Yes ; but that is quite a different matter. deviated in the slightest from the attitude that I took up at the beginning of this war. My utterances in this House are on record in Hansard, and my statements outside, so far as they have been reported, may be turned up.",22
201,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The honourable member's utterances since he has been on this side of the House have not been so temperate as before.,22
202,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"They were fairly strong when I sat on the Government side of the House. If the Prime Minister, when he returned from England with the glory and the reputation he had gained there, had thrown himself into the recruiting campaign with all the energy, ability, and vigour with which he threw himself into the preparation for conscription and the conscription campaign, there would have been a very different result. All the ill-feeling that has been engendered in the community would have been avoided, and he would have saved the community an expenditure of £80,000 on the conscription campaign, which would have been better spent upon a recruiting effort. It was wholly and solely because of his desire to secure a particular personal victory that he took this stand. Now that he has spoilt the recruiting movement, and made the very suggestion of recruiting almost repulsive to the people because of his conduct and utterances during the conscription campaign, he desires to throw upon us the responsibility of dragging him out of the hole in which he has placed himself. I refuse to help him, and I am going to refuse to give him Supply or the opportunity to carry on the government of the country. I understand that two months' Supply will carry the Government on t ill the middle of February.",22
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,How . would the honourable member like his wages to be held over on pay-day ?,22
204,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,There is no holding over of the wages of public servants.,22
205,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Yes ; they should have been paid today.,22
206,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The i r pay will be due today, and it can be handed over. The necessary cheques are probably ready to pay them.",22
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,But they cannot be issued today unless this Bill is passed.,22
208,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The Government need have no hesitation in proceeding I have not with the payment of the Public Service, because we are offering to give them two months' Supply. We are not holding up Supply or obstructing the Government in any way. I wish we were obstructing them. If the Leader of the Liberal party would join with us we should have the Government out of office in half-an-hour.",22
209,Mr WISE,COMPULSORY SERVICE,And the honourable member and his party would not keep the Liberal pai'ty in office afterwards.,22

211,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The two months' Supply which we are offering the Government will carry them over January, and a further grant of Supply to pay the services of the country would be required by the 15th February next. If the Government are honestly prepared to meet the circumstances of the case-if their desire is to carry on the work of the country-surel y an adjournment for two months should be quite sufficient for all purposes. I have a suspicion that there is at the back of the minds of the Government an ulterior motive in refusing to take less than three months' Supply.",22

213,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"My motive is to get r i d of the Government. That is what I am here for. If the Government meets the House again in February I am prepared to come to an arrangement with the Liberal party or with any other party in the House to dissolve both Houses of Parliament, so that we may go to the country.

I am equally certain that the Liberal party are in no hurry for an election. The Labour party alone can comfortably anticipate an election. We have gone through similar experiences, and have had every confidence in the people. We are so ready to go to the people and to ask them to decide between us that we would hail with delight any opportunity that would allow the country to. decide whether the present Government, the Liberal party, or the official Labour party should again be intrusted with the administration, of the affairs of the Commonwealth - honourable",22

216,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,It started with Ananias thousands of years ago.,23
217,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I bow to the honourable member for Wentworth's superior knowledge so far as that is concerned; he ought to know. The experience of the Labour party, as the honourable member for Barrier ought to know, is not confined to that gained in this House. The Government can only carry on with the assistance of the Liberal party, and that party must take the responsibility of keeping a discredited Administration in power. It must shoulder the responsibility of keeping in power a party of thirteen in this House, and it must accept that responsibility, not only here, but before the country. Liberal party have any doubt as to our feelings, I can say for myself that whenever during the currency of this session they are prepared to oust the Government I shall be willing to assist them to do so. So long as they continue to support the Government, however, so long must they carry the burden of doing so, and it is an increasing burden which they must carry at the next election. I should like to know whether the support which the Liberal party is giving the Government in its demand for three months' [357] Supply is part of an arrangement come to as a result of a meeting held last night between the Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Parramatta, the honourable member for Balaclava, and the honourable member for Flinders. It would be most interesting to know what was the result of that conference.",23
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I had no meeting whatever last night with either the honourable member for Balaclava or the honourable member for Flinders.,23
219,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The right honourable member is careful not to carry his reply to its conclusion. I made the statement that a consultation took place yesterday between the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Liberal party, the member for Balaclava, and the honourable member for Flinders.",23

224,Unknown,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,23
225,Mr HUGHES,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [2.15] Early in the sitting, I stated that three months' Supply is needed for public purI f the poses, and to enable the House to adjourn for a period sufficiently long to allow honourable members to take part in the recruiting campaign, after which Parliament must assemble to deal with certain legislation, of which legislation the Tariff may be instanced as a matter of importance and of some urgency. Since then I have seen the Director of Recruiting, who has told me that he proposes to launch his recruiting scheme formally on the 2nd January. I take it that every honourable member wishes to do what he can to make voluntary recruiting a success. Nearly a month's .Supply will have been expended' before the recruiting campaign can be commenced,, and honourable members will not have an opportunity to do justiceto the cause unless they are allowed freedom from, their parliamentary duties for a period sufficiently long to allow themto get round their respective States or electorates. It is necessary, in order to deal with legislation of which I have spoken, and to allow that oversight of the war whici. is desirable, that we should meet at as early a date as possible, consistent with the requirements of the recruiting campaign, and the Government, therefore, proposes to call Parliament together again not later than 28th February, allowing the President and Mr Speaker to summon it still earlier should occasion arise. date we shall have barely fifteen days Supply in hand. Were w© to get only two months' Supply, we should have to meet again on the 28th January, and that would not enable any of us to take an effective part in the recruiting campaign.",23

Surely at a time like this everything should be subordinated to the prosecution of the war.",24
227,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I rise to order. It has been the practice, although not the written law, for the presiding officer' to recognise leaders of parties, and I ask, therefore, Mr Chairman, if you deliberately ignored the Leader of the Australian Labour party when you refrained just now from looking towards him, and called one of the rank and file of the Liberal party.",24
228,The CHAIRMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The r e is no noint of order. I have never attempted to ignore the leader of any party. The honourable member for Wannon, who had secured the call before the luncheon adjournment, gave way to allow the Prime Minister to make a statement, and that statement having been made, he was in possession of the Chair again.",24
229,Mr RODGERS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The Prime Minister has made it clear that the granting of three months' Supply is necessary in order that the country mav engage in a recruiting campaign.

230,The CHAIRMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Will the Leader of the Opposition be seated? I may be blamable for having allowed too much latitude, but if the present laxity continues, I must take severe measures to compel conformity with the rules. I ask leaders of parties to set a good example.",24

On the 29th November, the Leader of the Liberal party objected to me moving a no-confiOn that dence motion from a chair which he said was the recognised seat of the Leader of the Liberal Opposition.

233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"[Havin g removed to the Opposition side of the chamber] - I very much, regret that you should have thought it necessary, Mr Chairman, to address to me the remarks that you have just made. I was merely bending over the chair of Ministers to ask them a question. I should like to know wherein my offence lay.",24
234,The CHAIRMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"It is an offence under the Standing Orders for an honourable member, unless he is walking into or out of the chamber, to remain un- . seated. The conversation that was proceeding made it difficult for the Chair to hear the speaker. I have no wish to interfere with private conversations, but when they are in a tone 'which prevents me from hearing distinctly, they are disorderly.",24
235,Mr RODGERS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Althoug h I am prepared to take part in the recruiting campaign, and to do my best to gain recruits, I fear that my success may be small. I have taken part in two appeals for volunteers, with satisfactory results. Then came the falling off in voluntary enlistments, and the proposal of the Govern- (ment to substitute compulsion for the voluntary system. Of that I approved. I . told my constituents. that - I had lost f a it h in. the voluntary system, and stood for compulsion. Now I shall have to tell them that I stand for the voluntary system. The Prime Minister, after his ret u r n from the Old Country, told the House and the country that the Governmerit was of the opinion that the voluntary system had failed to meet the need for reinforcements. The Government proposals for conscription having failed, we are forced to revert to a system which, if it was a failure when the Prime Minister spoke as such, must . be still more failure now, the enlistments having fallen off to the extent of two-thirds. I believe the burden of making a success of this campaign to rest mainly on the Labour Opposition, who declared themselves utterly opposed to compulsion, and in favour of the voluntary system.",24
236,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Whic h you killed !,25
237,Mr RODGERS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The honourable member cannot say I killed it , because, in the part I took in the campaign, I do not think I antagonized one single man. Personally, I have no hopes that the voluntary system will give us the necessary reinforcements, and I predict that, in a few weeks, all the men now in camp will be on the water, and practically very few recruits will take their places. We shall then find ourselves with a costly war organization, suggestive of a huge industrial factory, with everybody on the pay-sheet, and full steam up, but no raw material. For all this the country will have to foot the bill, and, at the same time, we shall have no reinforcements. I am not personally keen on the proposal put before the country as a war policy, either as a means of raising men or of getting money. We shall not get reinforcements unless the Opposition Labour party can assure us that they are sufficiently in touch with their constituents to make it certain that the voluntary system can be resuscitated and produce the numbers. I have taken opportunities presented to consult residents of parts of my constituency-of consulting recruiting sergeants and others who ought to know the facts, and I find that some parts of the district have done splendidly-so closely have they been combed out that not an eligible man is left. And yet we are now asked to go back with an indiscriminate appeal, and allow public men to be made cock-shies of in their attempt to do a job that has already been declared to be a failure. There cannot be any one, from the Prime Minister downwards, who in his heart believes that the proposed scheme will give us the necessary reinforcements.  native. [357]- 2",25
238,Mr RODGERS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Then we are at a "" dead-end,"" and we must adopt some other course of action. Not more than a fortnight ago it was declared throughout the world that Germany was organizing on a mammoth scale her manhood of it power, munitions, and so for t h , and that a she was about to deliver a staggering blow such as humanity had never before experienced. What was our answer to that? - a referendum under which the vote was "" No . "" This casts an obligation on somebody, arid that somebody is represented by those responsible for the "" No "" vote; on them is cast the responsibility of making the proposed campaign a success. I , of course, shall do all I can, but I cannot believe the scheme will succeed . To the Mother Country, on whom most of the burden of the war rests, we owe a greater duty than that of reverting to a system which has proved a failure. I really think that we might call a truce in politics. Let us put aside all our political differences, and agree unanimously as to the attitude we shall adopt in the prosecution of the war. This of all times is the time when the Empire should be one united people. I suggest that the Prime Minister, with the consent of Parliament-if not the present Prime Minister, some other oneshould take the initiative in inviting the Mother Country to call a council of the Empire. A post-war conference to divide the spoils has been suggested, but now is the time when all the brains and strength of the Empire should be utilized in bringing this war to an end. Let all the Dominions-Australia , New Zealand, Canada, .South Africa , India-mee t in conference in the Mother Country and decide upon uniform action throughout the Empire. How long can an Empire be maintained on the principle that one portion only should be compelled to do the fighting? How long would the German colonies, if they were available to the Kaiser, be permitted to remain outside the war? There is no doubt that they would be thoroughly marshalled; and it is to the discredit of this Chamber that' we here should have reached an - absolute deadend. I am not satisfied, and I cannot pretend to be satisfied, with the present situation. As to a recruiting campaign, we do not stand in the same position that we did when we made the previous appeal. , At that time there had been no great division; bu t the result of the referendum has, rightly or wrongly, divided the community into two hostile camps, with a harvest of political bickerings, bad taste, and much bad judgment on both sides. I am perfectly satisfied that on the side which advocated conscription bad errors of judgment were made. One of the errors, from the point of view of the success of the movement, was the calling up of the men beforehand by proclamation, thus showing every family in Australia the effect that conscription going to have. Then, again, very bad taste in judgment was shown by some in the manner in which they conducted campaign, pointing their fingers, as they did, at the very section of the people to whom we were appealing for support. never thought that the Bill, passed this Chamber, would be used in this way; and we know what in the administration of section 9. person with a name suggestive' of enemy nationality was practically marked as a disloyal person, and his vote was put on one side, with a view to, later on, asking him to explain to a Court. that in this country - there dreds of men with such names sons have enlisted, and them have given up for the Empire. Of course, there may be amongst them some few who are disloyal; but, in order to get at these, it was sought to brand every person whose name suggested a foreign or enemy connection. was a huge blunder; and yet we are now asked to go to these people, whom we have practically insulted, and ask them for their sons. Too much has been done to disturb the harmony and good feeling which prevailed when the last campaign was. undertaken; think that we can have a united again until the members of the Labour Opposition, the members of the Labour Government, and the members of the Liberal party are prepared hatchet. So far as the tion and control of the country^ is concerned, I look on the present as a mere transitory condition of affairs. Under the circumstances, it is the duty of this National Parliament to unite in the prosecution of the war, or a party should be placed in power which can, by its own weight and numbers, meet the in a better way than it is being met at present, and thus show that we are prepared to stand with the Mother until victory has been won.

During the last week or two I have listened to very many statements to was .the effect that recruiting has been a failure, and that we are not getting the number of reinforcements necessary to the keep up the strength of the divisions at the front. It appears to me that very little consideration is given by honourable I members to facts, and that, to a large when it extent, the public are being misled. We hear men speak as though we had an happened unlimited number of men to draw from .

The recruiting, at the beginning, and I do not was 12,000 out of an available 600,000, Australia and, notwithstanding all the men who have gone, we have never had less than 6,000 recruits per month.",26

We have to remember that all sorts of men were placed in the camps at great expense under the recent proclamation. In situation one case, a young fellow of twenty-two, who had been an invalid from birth, and never able to work, was called in , and; Country because of this, his father, who was a town clerk, and had been secretary to all the patriotic committees, resigned all his tions. Again, a man with a cork foot wa3 called up, along with another who had previously been six months in bed with rheumatism. W hy not tell us how many of those who went into camp made applimonthly cation for service abroad ? It is stated on fairly reliable authority, that of men who were in camp only one man i four was eligible to pass the test for active service abroad, plainly showing that men who were not capable of passing the test were put in wholesale. Ministers are constantly placing before the country the statement that we need 16,500 men a to month to make up the reinforcements f an army of 100,000 men. That is exactly one-sixth of that number.",26
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Are you arguing against recruiting, or what are you doing",27
246,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am not arguing against recruiting, but telling the t r u I shall be out on the platform to ask recruits, but the right honourable gentlemonth. man is damning the whole movement by a month. telling the people that they have to find more recruits than they can possibly raise.",27
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"You will go recruiting, and tell the people that it is not needed.",27
248,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,When I am on the platform I will do just as well as the t i g h t honourable gentleman will do.,27
249,Mr GREGORY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,That is very doubtful .,27
250,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"It is not very doubtful , and those who know me best are aware of that fact. I propose to analyze the position, and it is time that it done. If 16,500 men a month are rean quired to reinforce an army of 100,000 men, that is a sixth of the total number. Suppose that Great Britain were to put 1,500,000 men at the front. On the same basis of reinforcing she would have to send 250,000 men each month. So that in unreasonable. a year she would have to send 3,000,000 men as reinforcements. There you would have 4,500,000 men absorbed in a year ",27
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,""" To m m y - r o t ! """,27
252,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"It is not tommyto rot, and the right honourable gentleman only knows that it is not.",27
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I know quite the contrary.,27
254,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am putting forwhen ward facts, which the members of the Liberal Opposition cannot controvert. If we shall do well. posiwe in Australia are expected to"" send 16,500 men a month as reinforcements the sooner we realise that it cannot be done the better. I said on the platform that if it is necessary to send so many men we cannot keep up the supply. I take it that the message which the Prime the Minister received from the Council of n War to the effect that we should not use the fifth division for reinforcements at present, practically meant that, in their opinion, it was not necessary. That is my reading of the message. What I am arguing now is that it is not necessary have a sixth for reinforcements. Othero r wise, the nations supplying men in the - same proportion could not carry on the war for more than fifteen or sixteen months with the men at their disposal. ? They have gone on for over two years. It is a simple sum in arithmetic. I am always tired of hearing honourable members t h . say that recruiting is a failure because for we are getting 6,000 or 8,000 men a We have not had less than 6,000  3,000 this month.",27
255,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The month is not completed yet. My honourable friend, if he likes to refer to the record, will find that recruiting f e ll off considerably in December of last year, and revived after the Christmas season was over.",27
256,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,They do not lose men in the same proportion every month of the year.,27
257,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I do not say that was they do - What I say is that we have not unlimited number of men at our disposal to select from, and we cannot expect to keep up the same number of recruits month after month if the war is protracted for five or six years. How is it possible to do so? The suggestion is I rose this afternoon to put plain facts before - the House and the country. It is all very well for an honourable member to say that I am against recruiting. I am in favour of recruiting. I shall take the platform and do my best get recruits. Honourable members are in j u r i ng the very result which they desire to bring about by constantly reiterating that recruiting is a failure, because we are not getting 16,500 a month the men are not available to be got. If we get from 6,000 to 8,000 a month Our casualties up to the present time have not exceeded an average of 5,000 a month. The best thing which could possibly have been done was to adhere to the voluntary system. ' I told the boys that compulsion, if adopted, would set up a line 'of demarcation, the worse thing that could happen, and they indicated by their votes that they took m at view. I have sat here day after day and listened to statements which are not correct. Recruiting, I repeat, will not be a failure because we do not get 16,500 men a month. Every honourable member ought to do his best to help recruiting as far as possible. I believe that if we get 6,000 or 7,000, or S,000 men a month, it will be sufficient to reinforce our army at the front, and that we shall-be able to do our part in the future as we have done in the past.",27
258,Mr STTJMM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Lilley) [2.52] - Wit h reference to a remark which the honourable member for Wannon made in con-. damnation of section 9 of the M i l it a r y Service Referendum Act, I wish to say at the outset that the responsibility for that, provision rests on this House alone. It cannot be passed on to any one else. From my own observations I know that nativeborn Australians of foreign descent were subjected to a humiliation which I did not believe was possible in a British State. I am as satisfied, sir, as I am that you are sitting in the chair, or that I am standing here, that these natives are as loyal to Australia as, I was almost going to say, their persecutor, the Prime Minister. Another thing is that they have a greater, affection for their native land than he seems to have had for his native land. They have no> desire, to leave Australia unless they are driven out of it by persecution, the Prime Minister, so far as we know the record of his career, took an early opportunity of leaving his native land when he was able to strike out for himself. I repeat that these Australian natives are loyal to Australia by and large, and by Australia. I mean the Commonwealth as an integral part of the British Empire. I have no respect for a man who has one kind of loyalty for Australia and other kind of loyalty for ""the Empire. Australia and the Empire stand or fall together in this great conflict. I said that on the platform when I spoke in favour of conscription. "" Quoting the words of a great English writer and preacher, I said- A man who realizes he is a member of a State, be he Socialist or not, is a debtor to it , and is bound by principles of the strictest justice to render it service. . . . When you accept the benefits provided you by the' Statebenefits of personal immunity, of comfort, of culture, of justice, and of freedom-yo u are morally bound in return to help the State when, for instance, she is waging a just war and she calls upon you to rally to her flag and to fight for her honour. That seems to me a very fair and comprehensive statement of the duty that every man who considers himself an Australian ought to render to Australia and the Empire. My original intention was to vote against the motion of the Treasurer. But, since I have heard the pledge of the Prime Minister- a pledge in which, I understand, he binds himself to call Parliament together not later than the 28th February my opinion has changed - I will vote for the proposal of the Treasurer. I think that we are bound, in honour, to re-assemble at the earliest pos sible moment. We have heard a great deal, and we hear a great deal every day, in condemnation of striking and the going-slow movement. Why , sir, we are the greatest offenders of the lot. How many sittings of Parliament have we held during the last twelve months ? From the 12th November, 1915, u n t i l 29th November, 1916, we had twenty sittings. Out of 320 working days, we have been on strike 300 days. We valued our services, and remunerated ourselves, at the rate of £ 3 0 per sitting per member, and what services have we given to the country for the money ? We met when we were called together, passed a few Supply Bills, read the States the usual lecture whereas about the necessity for economy, and then separated. It was because I fel t it was time we should put a stop to that sort of thing for the sake of our reputation as the Federal Parliament, that I would have been prepared to vote against such a long recess as I think the request for three months' Supply indicated. We have come to this position now-that we have a number of most important questions unsettled. Has it not been made clear an- to us-wa s it not made clear to us yesterday and the day before-that the scheme for the repatriation of soldiers is not in the condition in which it should be? Again, we have the matter of the T a r if f , ' for the delay in passing which honorablft members in the Corner are responsible-as we Liberals are certainly not responsible. The Prim© Minister told ns that, if by any mischance the House were dissolved without the' Tariff being passed, chaos would result, and I have not the slightest doubt that it was a literal statement of fact.",28
259,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"We would £4,000,000.",29
260,Mr STTJMM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Not only During this discussion we have heardi n factj we have heard day after dayabout jbhe necessity of building up industries. The Tariff was introduced, as I understand, as a Protective Tariff. How can honourable members expect any man to engage in a new industry under ; the Tariff when they withhold their apFranklin, proval of it ? I am sorry to say that am not very sanguine as to the results which will come from the new recruiting campaign, because I think that it has already been damned with faint praise by the Prime Minister. He told usI think it will be conceded that it is sible to raise the troops asked for by the Army War Council under voluntary enlistment. As already said, it seems hopeless to that we can by voluntary enlistment raise 16,500 men per month. In another place, we had a leading ber sayingI have no great enthusiasm for posal. As a matter of fact, it is not a new scheme at all, though it bears a new name. There is nothing fresh in the proposal itself except that there are to be a few paid officials. Again, a leading honourable member in this House referred to it as a "" miserable substitute.""",29
261,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,As the honourable member for Wannon did just now.,29
262,Mr STUMM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"No . I know that the honourable member for Wannon is heart and soul in favour of voluntary enlistment. I had the privilege of being with him in Victoria during one campaign, and of having read the speeches he has made, and we know also something of the risks he has actually run. A wide political gulf separates me from the members of the Labour opposition, but I hope they will give me credit. for sincerity in expressing my views, as I give credit to them. Never in the campaign did I deliver a speech in which I did not point out that conscription was a great question that we should argue without heat, and that we should remember that after it was decided we should have tolive together in peace, and do our best to meet the great problems that are facing us. In the approaching recruiting campaign we may not get the results we should like, but it is our duty to do our best. For my own part, I shall assist with all the power that in me lies, and I hope lose' that we shall succeed beyond our expectations. that. Mr HANNAN (Fawkner) [ 3 . 2 ] - I desire to state my reasons for objecting to the Government being granted three new months' Supply. I am not at all i m pressed by the argument that in refusing to grant Supply for three months we are refusing Supply altogether. The statement made by the honourable member for when dealing with the contenI tion that if members of this Chamber conceded the right of the Senate to restrict the powers of the Government in money matters, they would be practically surrendering the rights of the people's Parliament, cannot be challenged. It has not posbeen argued that because in other systems -. . of government there is a marked distincexpect tion between the powers of the two branches of the Legislature in respect of finance, that distinction applies with the memsame force to this Parliament. ; Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON - It is laid this new prodown in the Constitution.",29
263,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The honourable member for Franklin showed clearly that the Constitution confers upon the Senate the right to suggest amendments, and in the exercise of that power they, have rejected the Government's proposals and offered a suggestion. Their action does not mean a refusal of Supply to carry on the work of the Commonwealth. It merely places a restriction upon the Government to the extent of one month. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I do not think the Senate has refused the Government's* proposals. If the Senate had done so, we could not consider the matter now.",29
264,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The Senate has not refused, but has made a suggestion, and in doing so is perfectly within its rights. There are several reasons why I am opposed to a lengthy adjournment of this Parliament. We know that there must be an election for the Senate some time in May of next year. The people would not approve of the Government taking the responsibility of mating preparations for the election of eighteen senators in May"", and three or four months later sending members of this House to the country.",29
265,Mr GKEGOBY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,We may go to the country earlier.,30
266,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"There is that probability. But there must be an election for the Senate in May next unless the life of the retiring half of the Senate is extended, which can only be done by the consent of the whole Parliament.",30
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The Inter-State Labour Conference agreed to an extension of the life of the Senate, did it not?",30
268,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The resolution agreed to by the Inter-State Conference was that the life of the Senate should be extended in order to allow both Chambers to go before the country .simultaneously. An early dissolution of Parliament is something which perhaps we cannot avoid, and honourable members are entitled to some information as to the intentions of the Government. Prime Minister made a v statement in which he tried to convey to the House and the people the impression that the Government had not considered the dissolution of Parliament. I am not prepared to accept that statement. I believe that the question has received the most serious consideration by the Government.",30
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Is it quite polite to tell a man that you will not take his word ?,30
270,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I have a fair recollection of the honourable member for Parramatta making a speech recently, not on what I said, but on the construction he placed upon what I had said. If the Prime Minister has not given' any consideration to the possibility of the dissolution of this House and the Senate, he is the only man in either Chamber who has not done so. We have heard a great deal from the Prime Minister about a secret junta, and the operations of the Industrial Workers of the World. asked a question the other day as to a secret junta that has met within this building, and which seems to be working out a course of events for the near future. I mentioned the Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Parramatta, the honourable member for Flinders, and the honourable member for Balaclava as the four members of that secret junta, and I believe those gentlemen have given most serious consideration to the possibility of an appeal to the people in the very near future. In my opinion, the leaders of the Liberal party would be sitting on the Treasury benches today as Ministers of a Fusion party if it were not for the fact that a Fusion before the appeal to the' people would mean their certain death as a political'party. But, whilst no Fusion has been formed yet, there is an understanding between the Leader of the Government and the leading members of the Liberal party that when the appeal is made to the people, supporters of the Go-' vernmcnt shall not oppose candidates of the Liberal party in certain electorates, and the Liberal party shall not oppose Government candidates, and that if the two parties are successful at the polls, a Fusion Government will come into existence.  tion the honourable member has. The Mr HANNAN - If the Government and the Liberal party secure a majority ai the polls a Fusion Government will be formed immediately after the elections.",30
271,Mr BAMEOBD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,How do these things leak out ?,30
272,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Libera l members, in their political old age, would not allow themselves to be kept out of office when they have the power to get into office, unless they had an object in view. The object which I believe they have in view is to insure the success of their party when the appeal is made to the people. They know from the experience of the previous Fusion party that to go before the electors as a Fusion would be to court certain defeat. That is my prediction of forthcoming events, and it is built upon very sound foundations. But I notice that the annport given to 'the Government by Liberal members is not quite so unanimous as it was prior to the meeting of the Liberal party in this building a few evenI ings ago. Of course, I know that any admission by the Prime Minister to the rank and file of his supporters that this arrangement was to be carried into operation after the elections would create a great deal of discord, and I am ready to admit ' that Ministers, and the private members who support the Government, haye not been-given that information by the Prime Minister. Who are the gentlemen who possess this information? They are the members of that secret junta to which I have previously referred, namely, the Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Parramatta, and the honourable members for Flinders and Balaclava.  right honourable member for Swan.",30
273,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Yes , possibly because they thought he might be too formidable a rival.  of Australia yet.",31
274,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The right honourable, member may be ambitious in that respect, and if there was an election for the position of Prime Minister members of the Liberal party, believe that the great services he has rendered to Australia in the past would receive a great deal of consideration. may offer a further prediction. Providing the Fusion come back in sufficient strength, we shall see a Ministry comprising the Right Honourable W . M . Hughes as Prime Minister, the Right Honourable (probably Sir) Joseph Cook as Minister for Defence, Sir William Irvin e as Attorney General, and the Honourable W m . W at t as Treasurer. .  member for Richmond, who is such a f a it hf u l barracker, come in ?",31
275,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The other portfolios would be distributed among the lesser Lights.,31
276,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,What is all this about ?,31
277,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am simply amending the proposition of the honourable member. Several honourable members ing, The - CHAIRMAN - A d v a n t a g e being taken of my action in. allowing far more latitude than I should have given. We have now a departure from debate, nothing but continual conversation going on all round the chamber. I ask honourable members to keep strictly to the motion.",31
278,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I am reminded that I should have made provision for the honourable member for Eden-Monaro.,31
279,The CHAIRMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Order !,31
280,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I wish to make a few remarks in regard to the recruiting campaign. We are told that the principal objection that the Government have to the position that is now being raised-the reduction of supplies-is that honourable members will not have an opportunity of taking part in this campaign.,31
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,How much more time are you going to waste?,31
282,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"On a point of order, is the right honourable member for Parramatta in order in accusing the honourable member for Fawkner of wasting time ?",31
283,The CHAIRMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I ""did not hear what the right honourable member for Parramatta said, but that is entirely the fault of honourable members, who have become so disorderly that it is impossible among for the Chair to hear what has been said. II ask honourable members to respect the Chair, and be more silent.",31
284,Dr MALONEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"On a point of order, if I an honourable member, through no fault pf his own, is attacked by another honourable member, does he lose the protection of the Chair because the Chairman has not heard the words used ? The right honourable member for Parramatta told the honourable member for Fawkner plainly that he was wasting time, and I think that he should be called upon to withdraw those words.",31
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I withdraw theni, and, at the same time, I take the point of order that the range that this debate has taken is out of order. The only question that this Committee should consider is the difference between the two Houses: whether we-should agree to the request made by the Senate or not. The grievance part of this debate is over. I believe that, if the authorities are looked up, it will be found that the only matter that can be considered at this stage is the difinterjectference between the two Houses. Therefore, it is not in order for the honourable is member for Fawkner to range over the whole gamut of political topics. The debate should be as to whether there should be Supply for two or three months.",31
286,The CHAIRMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The point raised by the r i g h t honourable member must be sustained. I stated just now, and I repeat that honourable members have abused the latitude that I allowed them, but now that my attention has been drawn to my neglect in this respect, I shall confine them to the question before the Chair.  would like to know how long it is since the honourable member for Parramatta has been elected Chairman of Committees ? Are you still Chairman, 'Or are you not, Mr Chanter?",31
287,The CHAIRMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"That is no point - of order; it is a reflection on the Chair, and I ask the honourable member to withdraw it .  upon the Chair.",32
288,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I regret the incident which led to the right honourable member for Parramatta rising to this point of order. I am quite in accord with the attitude of the Senate. The Prime Minister did not claim that the Senate is wrong in making its request; but if honourable members have got away from the question of the Senate refusing to accept the proposals of the Government, and have traversed other ground, it is .only because the Prime Minister and other honourable members during the discussion have been permitted to say whateverthey chose on the matter. Mr. JOSEPH , COOK - It was all order.",32
289,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"No doubt the reason why the Prime Minister has taken no exception to the action of the Senate is because, on a previous occasion when the righ t honourable member for Parramatta was Prime Minister, and received a great deal of opposition from the Senate, to every proposal that he sent up to the other place, the actions of the members of that House were directed to a large extent by the present Prime Minister, who was then a member of the Australian .Labour party. sidered that the Senate were perfectly justified in puttin g every obstruction in the way of the Cook Government's giving effect to its proposals.",32
290,Mr GREENE,COMPULSORY SERVICE,They never refused Supply..,32
291,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The members of the Labour party have a minority"" in this House, but they have a majority in another place, and, rather than close up Parliament, they believe that they are perfectly in order in utilizing the power they possess in the Senate to compel the Government to come back here even, in the second week of January if we thought it necessary. We aTe of the same opinion as senators, that there has been too much, legislation by regulation, and the only way in which the representatives of the 0 people in this House can prohibit that fnrm of legislation is to see that both Houses of Parliament are sitting.",32
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The honourable-member supported regulations issued by the Government for two solid years.,32
293,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"As a member sitting behind the Government, I voted for certain portions of the War Precautions Act which gave the Government certain, powers during a time of national emergency ; but at the time the Prime Minister gave a promise to the members of this> Parliament, and even to the honourable member for Elinders, that the great, powers that we were giving the Government would never be abused. I remember the honourable member - for Flinders,, who - does not claim to be a Democrat as we understand a Democrat outside, even admitted that he was quite aware of all the sacrifices that had been made by hisforefathers to obtain the liberty which we enjoy in this country, and which he would not like to see 'filched from the people by regulations made - through this Parliament conferring any particularout of power on the members of a Government. Members of the Labour party opposed certain clauses of the W a r PrecautionsB ill . To-day we feel that the Government have abused the confidence that . Parliament placed in their hands by theissue of regulations under those provisions. If the Government obtain the Supply asked for in the Bill before us, it will"" practically permit them to close up Parliament almost to within a few weeks of the election for senators, i I am not prepared to place that degree of trustH e and others conin the hands of the Prime Minister. I believe he would prefer'to go on legislating by regulation rather than that Parliament should meet, and that his actions and those of his colleagues should thus be open to the criticism of members. I wish to emphasize the point that I , for one, refuse to subscribe to the view that, in taking up this stand, we are throwing ' away the rights and privileges of this House. I endorse all that has been said' by the honourable member for Franklin, -' who pointed out that the custom to which 1 reference has been made was one that had grown up in other countries where-' one Chamber was elected on a democratic franchise, while the other was re- : turned on a property vote. That does not apply to the Parliament of the Commonwealth.",32
294,The CHAIRMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Order ! The h o n orable member's time has expired.,32
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Parramatta) [3.32] - The statements made by the honourable member for Fawkner are very useful. They mean that the honourable member, and, I take it, those who are acting with him, are prepared to punish any one in order that they may punish the Government. It matters nothing to them that the public servants of the Commonwealth have not received their last fortnight's pay.",33
296,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,We are not preventing - their payment.,33
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"There is no their money to pay them with today, and the Corner party declines to let them their money.",33
298,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,That is not true.,33
299,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Is that interthey jection in order? The . CHAIRMAN - The honourable member must withdraw it.,33
300,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"In deference to you, sir, I do so.",33
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The position is that this is the 15th of December, that the wages of our public. servants were really due yesterday.",33
302,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,They can have two months' pay whenever they like.,33
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"It is very for Fawkner. good of this little dictator to say that they can have two months' pay. .The public servants of the Commonwealth will be very much obliged to him for his condescension in saying, in the greatness of his power, and out of his high and mightiness, "" I will condescend to the Government a little so that the public servants may receive their wages some day after they are due."" The honourable member for Fawkner was very frank in are telling the public servants try that he does not care how they suffer as long as he can get a dirty one into the Government.",33
304,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,That was not his stateferred ment.,33
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"That is the attitude clear and unmistakable of the Australian Labour party when they are prepared to take any step that will pel the Government to adopt a certain place. course, even if it involves the deferment of the payment of our public servants. The honourable member for Fawkner, for one, is prepared to do that.",33
306,Mr HANNAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,That is not so.,33
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am sure the Public Service will be extremely obliged for his consideration and generosity to them. It is time this cant ceased. It is time the public servants of the Commonwealth knew of the humbug that is practised on them by these men of the Australian Labour party, who are supposed particularly to have them in their care. They have imposed on the Public Service all along. It is time the Service opened their eyes to see who are their real friends in this Chamber and who are blocking pay for nothing more than a political dodge. We are obliged to the honorhave able member for Fawkner and other members of his party who have made it all too plain that they do not care how punish the public servants of Australia so long as by doing so they can punish-this Government. Whatever we may do in the matter of our political fighting, we ought, at any rate, to pay the salaries of the Public Service promptly as they fall due. It is not too much that and these men get. Do not keep them days out of their money, while you indulge in .your political squabbling and suffer no deprivation yourselves. That is the position in a nutshell, as disclosed by the very frank, candid, and simple member  that secret meeting last night.",33
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Le t me now address myself to the Leader of the Great give Australian Labour party. The members of that party have accommodated themselves with a further adjective. It was the ""Australian Labour party,"" but we told today that it is "" the Great Ausof this countralian Labour party.""",33
309,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Who used that adjective?,33
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The ex-Treasurer, who, I believe, would have prea position other than that which he is now occupying. If honourable members in the Opposition corner are going to speak of secrets, we might as well talk of them. It seems to be becoming the rule comnow to disclose everything that takes",33

312,Mr ANSTEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"On the point of order, I should like to urge, sir, that there is no necessity for the Leader of the Liberal party to address himself to the question. He is well within his rights in addressing, himself to any question, however impertinent it may be. to the subject before the Committee.",34
313,The CHAIRMAN,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The right honourable member was not in order.,34
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am afraid that I was a little out of order. It is lucky for the Great Australian Labour party that the point was raised, for I was just on the doorstep of their Caucus. I had my eyes, metaphorically speaking, on the key-hole.",34
315,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The right honourable member is wasting time.,34
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am going to waste a little more time by supplying a few figures to the Committee. I find that these financial and constitutional purists of the Australian Labour party put through a number of Supply Bills last year. On 2Sth June, 1915, they put through one for £S,611,000; on 2nd Octo ber, 1915, they put through one for £16,195,000; on the 15th November, 1915, they passed one for £7,250,000; and next day they put one through for £16,250,000. In the last six months of 1915 these honourable members-wh o now say with great pomp and ceremony, "" You can have two months' Supply at any time you like""-put through Supply Bills representing a total of £4S,250,000. These are the men who now object to give the Government, in order that the Public Service salaries may be paid when they are due, Supply to the extent of two or three millions. These are the men who, when on the other side, governed hy Supply Bills all the year round, and made it impossible for us to review the Estimates. They made it impossible for this Parliament to secure the slightest control over the finances. These are the men who, now that they sit in the Opposition corner, tell the Government that they can have two months' Supply at any time they like-bu t no more. I should like to say, further, that only a couple of years ago Mr Fisher, another Leader of their party, when in office, asked this House for five months' Supply, and got it. On 14th December, 1914, he asked for five months' supply, amounting to £10,316,000, for the ordinary civil administration of the country, and he got it without any protest from these honourable members.",34
317,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Did . the right honourable member protest ?,34
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I did.,34
319,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,But Mr Fisher had a majority behind him.,34
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"My honourable friend did not protest, except, perhaps, hy firing off a few of those empty squibs of his, with which every one has become familiar. I wish, further, to place on record the fact that only last financial year the honourable member for Capricornia, who says today that he will consent to a grant of two months' Supply, put through a Supply Bill for five months. That was one of his last acts. It was the rule with these honourable members, when on the other side of the House, to obtain five months' Supply at a time. Now that they are sitting in the Opposition corner a demand for three months' Supply is an offence ranking as high as the heavens in their eyes. Oh for a little more consist7 ency in financial matters!",34
321,Mr ANSTEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Bourke) [3.44] - The right honourable member for Parramatta said that he rose only to place a few facts on record, and I should like to make a slight addition to them. The right honourable member professes to be very anxious for the well-being of public servants. So am I . Poor civil servants! They are going to be deprived of their pay. Let us object to that-if only for political purposes. I declare that I am anxious that they all shall get their pay. Who is preventing them from getting it? No one. But I recognise that there may be an election shortly, and how convenient it will be for me to be able to say, "" I supported the granting of Supply to give public servants their salaries "" ! I am not going to be left in the lurch in this matter. I say, "" Pay the civil servants."" Give the Government three months', six months', or whatever amount of Supply may be needed to pay the public servants. I remember that last year passages were taken from Hansard to prove that, on certain questions, my attitude was so-and-so. Let this speech be taken from Hansard, so that it may be known that I have demanded six months', twelve months', or any amount of Supply that you like, for the sake of the civil servants. I demand that these starving and destitute persons-ho w well that phrase will read if taken from Hansard to be used at the next election! '-be paid. I demand it in the name of my constituency, and in the name of my country.",34

I demand not only that what was owing to the public servants last week shall be paid them next week, but alsb that that which would otherwise be owing to elections them next month shall be paid to them before it becomes due. It shall not possible for any man to take this speech out of Hansard and quote it against Is there anything that I have said so that does not demonstrate that I am the friend of the civil servants, and that in no way allied with those who would refuse to vote Supply to enable them to be paid ? I stand alongside the honourable member for Parramatta in this. Let me now deal with some of his other facts. He told us that the members of the Ausbook. tralian Labour party, when they were on the Ministerial side of the Chamber, voted for five months' Supply, covering an expenditure of £16,000,000.",35
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Of £48,000,000 .",35
325,Mr ANSTEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"What would it have mattered had the sum been £148,000,000 The circumstances were entirely different. In politics there is no consistency, and there are no principles-onl y interests. Everything that is done, and everything that is said in Parliament, is based personal interest. We are all prone to this mental prostitution. The prostitution of women in the streets by night has counterpart in the prostitution of the mentality of representatives of the people in Parliament assembled. Everything depends upon the side on which one sits, and on the support that he is giving. Were I sitting on the Ministerial side, and in possession of a portfolio, is anything that I am now opposing that would not be supporting, or anything that I am supporting that I would not be opopposed posing ? A f t e r all, for what are we here The idea is that we are here assembled serve the interests of the country; but are really here to get jobs. Having got one job, we try for a better one. What greater objection can we have against Ministry than that it exists, and what greater hope can we have in life than that it may be shifted ? If we have any desire or ambition, if we look forward to serving our country, it is only in the hope that God will give us a portfolio in the immediate future. If we are behind a Government, we support it . What, last year, we could see no evil in , today we can see no good in . Why should we? The honourable member for Parramatta ex"" Oh, blessed consistency ! "" How . he has condemned us I How his pure soul has revolted at our conduct! to He is the embodiment of sanctity and purity. We are to be held up at the next as the villains of the piece. But the members of the Opposition are supbe porting those whom a few months ago they denounced. Let me place a few facts on me. record which may be of use-becaus e no far one knows what the future may bring forth . We can rest assured that, should I am it serve the interests of the honourable member for Parramatta, he will do exactly what we are doing today. He will follow our example, if it suits his book.",35
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I have not got a,35
327,Mr ANSTEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Not now, perhaps; but the honourable member may have one. Should circumstances change, he will carefully expunge his past record. No one .will be able to explain his position more readily than he. A f t e r all, the art ? of the politician is to explain away everything that may be regarded as misconduct - Let the people forget it if they can. Should some confounded nuisance heckle you at a public meeting, by pointing out on that what you are saying today does not agree with what you said the day before, it is the duty of the astute politician to its assert that what he is saying today is in accordance with what he said yesterday. Although his conduct today may be an absolute contradiction of that of last year, he must be able to show that it is consistent with every thing that he ever did, and with everything that he ever will do. there ; Consistency must always be our watchI word. Those who are with us are the honest and consistent men; those who are to us are all that is bad. In the ? varying grouping of the political kaleidoto scope, we sit sometimes side by side and we sometimes opposite each other; but always and ever must we be ready to explain that the clean, decent politicians are those who a agree with us, and the bitter enemies of the country those who are opposed to us. Patriots are those who belong to our party; 'traitors are patriots who are not of our opinions. I do not desire to'occupy more time. The statements of the honourable member for Parramatta were so excellent, so absolutely calculated to influence public opinion at the next election, that his speech forced me to say to myself, "" I must get a b it in , too."" Therefore, I have taken this opportunity to display my feverish anxiety for letting the civil servants have their money, whatever the exigencies of the situation may compel m© to do a few moments later.

[4.3] - I m o v e Spence, W. G. That this Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will observe that the taxation proposed under the Bill is much less than that introduced by^the ex-TreaWise, G. H . surer, and also less than that indicated by myself some little time ago. In making my financial statement, I based my calculations on rates double those which are set for t h in the Bill , but, in the light NOES. of information as to the results of similar legislation in the States, a substantia] reduction has been made. In levying taxation of this kind, we are in a very different position from that of the Parliament in England. There the rates apply uniformly to the whole of the United Kingdom, but, with our six States, the Commonwealth rates PAIRS. must to some extent be governed by the conditions-which obtain at the passing of the Bill . H a d this measure been introduced earlier, it is quite possible that the rates would have been vhigher, but several of the States have levied taxation on entertainments, and we - must have regard to the actual position as it presents itself today. In Western Australia the taxation amounts to I d . on the 3d. adopted. ticket, 2d. on the Is. ticket, the rate rising until it amounts to Is. 9d. on the 10s. Sd. ticket. In Tasmania and South Australia the tax is - Jd. on the 3d. and on the 6d. ticket, and it rises by halfpence u n t i l it reaches 10^d. on the 10s. 6d. ticket. Under the Bill ail 3d. tickets are exempt, and the rate rises in stages from J^d. on the 6d. ticket. We have to take the State taxation and the proposed Commonwealth taxation together in order to arrive at what is a safe impost to levy. We had to consider the fact that the people would pay both State and Commonwealth taxation, and we have reduced the tax, as at first proposed, from 2d. to I d . on the Is. ticket, and from Is. 9d. to 10^d. on the 10s. 6d. ticket. H a d the original proposals been adhered to, I am afraid the taxation would have proved so burdensome as to endanger the revenue. In France and Belgium a levy of 10 per cent, is made on ""the gross receipts; in Russia it is 5 per cent., and in It a l y up to 40 per cent.; and, in addition, there are in operation advertisement taxes on all bills exhibited. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - What revenue will the proposed taxation produce ?  £400,000 .",35
328,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"You told us that ' in France the tax is imposed on a percentage basis. What will be the average percentage here?  the Commonwealth will amount to 8 per cent., but when the State taxation is added, it will amount to 16 per cent, on the price of the ticket.  making the tax a percentage on the whole of the takings?  tion to close up a number of these shows, the honourable, member's suggestion would very quickly accomplish the object. There is no doubt that this taxation will be passed on fo the public.",37
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Thos e interested in the entertainments say .that this is not so, but that the taxation wil l r u in them.  mate of revenue from this taxation was £1,000,000 for the half-year - That estivent mate, however, was based on figures on a newspaper statement, which, on further inquiry through the High Commissioner, was found to be altogether erroneous, and, as I 'say, I do not anticipate to receive more than £400,000 . This is a simple proposition, clearly set for t h in the Bill , and I do not think it is .necessary to say more.",37
330,Mr GROOM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"What does the Treasurer estimate the' tax .on the 6d. ticket' will return ?  6d. ticket were removed, we might as well abandon the measure. It is estimated that the revenue given up by exv empting the 3d. ticket amounts to £70j000. I have cut the proposed taxation down as far .as possible, and I do not intend to go any further in that direction. I have had a number of interviews with people interested, and I know the position exactly.",37
331,Mr MAHONY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Pictur e combines, evidently !  views with all sorts of entertainers. The Bill is a very mild proposition, indeed, - compared with that introduced by the ex-Treasurer. I may say that I have cut my estimated revenue down from £700,000 to £400,000 , .and if I were to go any further the Bill would not be worth bothering about. than Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [4.14] - What do the Government intend to do with the Bill? Are we going on with it today, or not?  waiting for the Senate. Mr JOSE PH COOK - We have now arrived at the ordinary hour for the adjournment on Friday, but we were given to understand' that we were going on with business, not only today, but also tomorrow. If there is business to be done, I will stay here to do it ; but I do not wish to remain here if we are not to do business.  sage hack from the Senate shortly.",37
332,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am a f r a id the Speaker will ' not allow us to wait for that. I have not much to say about the proposed tax. The Treasurer says that he wants the money, and"" it is fair that he should get it . I say frankly, that I am disposed to vote ""for this Bill for one reason alone, and that is - to' prethe States from jumping this for m of taxation, as they undoubtedly will if the Commonwealth does not step in early. In Western Australia and South Australia a tax on amusements has already been imposed; but, strange to say, the great State of New South Wales has not been so nimble in this respect as it customarily is. Why Mr Holman has not mopped up this little bit of revenue I do not know. He has been slower off the mark than usual; but I am quite certain that his predatory eye is on this form of taxation, and if this Parliament does not impose it he will. Therefore, as we need the money for the war, the Treasurer is quite right in imposing this tax at the present time. I hope that our action will not be followed by the States with a doublebanking tax. . It is time that doublebanking ceased, and cease it must before long., The rates to be charged will he a matter for consideration in Committee, but it is clear that there is a consensus of opinion on the part of the people who conduct amusements throughout the Commonwealth that a tax on 6d. tickets will be to them ruinous. It seems that picture shows particularly cater, to a large extent for families, and, I am told, that the effect of the tax will be that people, instead of attending picture shows twice weekly, as they do now, will attend only once a week, and the consequences will be disastrous to those who conduct these shows. The proprietors tell me that they do not object to taxation, hut only to its being imposed in such a way as to cut into the family rates, as a tax commencing on the 6d. tickets has a tendency to do.",37
333,Mr EINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Le t us start on the Is. tickets and stiffen the rates.,38
334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I think that the rate on tickets above Is. is stiff enough. I do not anticipate much objection to the Bill. Honourable members are fully seized of the necessity for gathering revenue in any legitimate way for the purpose of financing the war. Taxation is not welcomed by anybody. It is a burden to be borne, and sometimes a grievous one indeed. But these are the days of sacrifice and deprivation, and all those things that minister to war finance and efficiency. The Treasurer stated that he has gone as far as he possibly can in cutting down the rates.  bedrock.",38
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"What is the estimated return from this tax as compared with the estimate from the tax proposed by the honourable gentleman's predecessor ?  pected to reap £1,400,000, and I estimate a revenue of £400,000 at the outside.",38
336,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,It is evident that the Treasurer has sliced down the tax already by about 200 per cent. That is indeed a very severe cut. All I wish to say is that if the Treasurer can see his way to make a slight modification in regard to the tax on 6d. tickets such a concession would be very welcome.  on 3d. tickets altogether.,38
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I shall not press the honourable member unduly, but I commend this suggestion to his notice and consideration.",38
338,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Yarra) [4.22] - It may be thought by some honourable members that I was a member of the Government which first proposed this tax on amusements, but the fact is that I resigned from the Government before this tax on amusements was considered. I deliberately re-frained from attending a Cabinet meeting at which the financial position was to be discussed, oh the day on which I resigned. If the Government impose a tax of i d . on 6d. tickets, the people who manage these shows will probably raise the price by selling a 6d. ticket for 7d., or, possibly, two tickets for Is. Id. In some way they will recoup themselves. Mr Mc WILLIAMS - The managers who are petitioning against the tax say that they cannot do that.",38
339,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Some - of them are doing fairly well; hut others are experiencing difficulties. The honourable member for Parramatta was quite right in saying that if this Parliament does not impose this tax, the States will. They have already, taken that step in Western Australia, South Australia,, and Tasmania. That is the only reason that induces me to support the proposal. Even the tax on the higher-priced tickets will have a harsh effect. In Melbourne, and, I believe, in other cities of Australia, there are, in normal times, football clubs which have a great many members, who pay 5s. for a season ticket admitting to matches on the club ground, and to certain other matches on other grounds. Some of the cricket clubs issue season tickets for £1 Is., and the Melbourne Cricket Club charges £2 2s. The clubs would be required to pay to the Commonwealth a proportion of their receipts from that source. They are not run for profit, and many of them have huge overdrafts. They will be hard enough hit by the taxation on gate receipts, without the Government interfering with the revenue from their membership tickets.",38
340,Mr GROOM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,That question will arise . when we are dealing with the Assessment Bill.,39
341,Mr TTJDOE,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am anxious to know what exemptions are to be allowed. The money made by the clubs is spent in beautifying their grounds, which, in most cases, are utilized in the best possible way. I appeal i to the Treasurer not to tax tickets of a less value than Is., and I am 1 not in favour of increasing the rate on the higher-priced tickets, because, unless certain exemptions are allowed, the tax will work great hardship. When the original Bill was discussed in the press, I understood that for every person who entered a place of amusement, even on a complimentary ticket, the management would be required to pay taxation. . It is well known that many picture shows, and other places of amusement, give compli-! men tary tickets for the privilege of advertising in.shop windows; and it would be unfair to tax such tickets, when the proprietor of the show is not gaining any advantage.",39
342,Mr BAMFOED,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The proprietors the advantage of free advertising in the shop windows.,39
343,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"That is so; but tickets are given for a number of other reasons. Recently honourable members received complimentary tickets for a performance of a certain play in Melbourne, and I understand that the proprietors would have had to pay a tax on every one of those tickets. I repeat that the only thing which actuates me in voting for this taxation, oven on Is. tickets, is that the States will invade this field if we do not occupy it. The Commonwealth expenditure is greater than that of the States. State Premiers in conference claimed that they had been forced to meet extra expenditure on account of the war. They have had to incur not Id . of extra expenditure on that account, and they have had increased revenue from the Railway Departments, and from other sources on account of the Defence Department's operations. I should like the Treasurer to strike out the tax on 6d. tickets, because that would be an impost on the amusements of the poor. I do not intend to argue the question as to whether picture shows are good or bad, or whether it would not be better for the people to adopt some other form of amusement.",39
344,Mr SAMPSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"If we exempt 6d. tickets, we exempt the picture shows entirely.",39
345,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,No .  6d. tickets we exempt the football clubs. ' Mr TUDOR - They ought to be exempted.  too?,39
346,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,No .  the payment.,39
347,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,They do not charge.  not be required to pay any taxation.,39
348,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I shall vote against any tax on 6d. tickets, and I trust that the Treasurer will reconsider the other rates. We have been told that we should pass the Tariff practically in one line - I should object to that being done. In normal times this little measure for the taxation of amusements would not get get through the House under a week; and I fail to see why we should he asked to pass in one line a Tariff with which the whole industry of the Commonwealth is bound up, and under which the Government collect revenue to the amount of £16,000,000 or £17,000,000. Honourable members realise that, on account of the extraordinary circumstances in which we find ourselves, we must devise means of getting extra money, and as the States may invade this field of taxation, the Government intend to forestall them. Mr FINLAYSON. (Brisbane) [4.30]. - I have already expressed my opinion The upon the question of taxing 6d. tickets, so that my remarks upon the Bill will be very few. The Treasurer has claimed that an elimination of the tax on 6d. tickets will practically defeat the Bill by depriving it of its revenue-producing power; but that is just an argument that one could use against the imposition of the tax on these tickets, because it is evident'that the Treasurer is going to draw the major portion of the revenue from an entertainments tax from those people who are unable to pay more than 6d. for their amusements.  cut down the tax until there is hardly anything left.",39
349,Mr EINXAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,'The Treasurer is going to draw the major portion of the tax from the people who can least afford to pay it.  from them.,40
350,Mr EINXAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"My chief objection to the Bill before us is that, instead of placing the tax "" hot and strong"" on people who can afford to pay 3s., 4s., 5s., or 10s. for their amusements, we are to draw the revenue from people who can afford to pay only 6d. In the Arbitration Court the justice, in his awards, has always allowed a small proportion per week in the ordinary expenditure of the home for entertainments and amusements. I do not think that the Treasurer desires to penalize the poor people of the community. This taxation should be imposed in order to reach the people who, at a time like this, can afford to spend pounds on entertainments.  to a man and his wife. They will not begrudge it.",40
351,Mr EINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,They will hegrudge it. The people who can most afford to pay are those who are going to escape by the system of taxation proposed.,40
352,Mr GROOM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Is the honourable member dealing with picture shows only? Does he include football matches in his reference to 6d. tickets ? «,40
353,Mr EINXAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am talking generally. The tax will apply, not only to picture shows, but also to a large number of other entertainments. I may as well' advise the Treasurer that I intend to move an amendment in Committee to the effect that the tax shall not be imposed on the charge for admission to athletic, philanthropic, or patriotic entertainments.",40
354,Mr GROOM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"""Would that amendment include football matches?",40
355,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Certainly . Football matches and cricket'matches are run in the interest of the health and welfareof our community. They are not run to make a private profit.,40
356,Mr GROOM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,How can the honourable member say that a big football match is run for the health of the community?,40
357,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Athletic s are a distinct item in the health of a community. The more we encourage men totrain for athletic sports, the better men they are. What has made our troops sobrave and so capable in their operationsin Europe? If it was true of old that the battle-fields of Europe were won on the playing fields of Eton, it is just as true today. Then in regard to philanthropic entertainments, they are not run for private profit. The community gets the benefit of them. They are run merely for social purposes.",40
358,Mr ATKINSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The Bill may contain some exemptions in regard to the churches and philanthropic entertainments.,40
359,Mr FINXAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"So far as I can see, it contains no exemptions. The Same remarks apply to patriotic entertainments. The Bill is brought down for the purpose of imposing a tax for war purposes; but people who are already subscribing to patriotic entertainments 1 should be exempt from these irritating little pettifogging means of getting revenue. The Leader of the Liberal party is correct in saying that the Government must have money, but surely there are some more reasonable means of getting it than by this miserable, shallow method. We are dabbling about in the shallows when we ought, to launch out into thedeep, where we can let down the nets of financial administration for a big draught, and not for a little dribble such as this, tax will produce.  turned by the tax?",40

The proprietors, in the case of the larger shows, will the agents for the Treasurer, and in they will collect the tax from the public.  exemption of £ 5 0 ?",41
367,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Because it is impossible to expect the proprietors of these small shows to charge 7d. or 6^d. instead of 6d. They will have to fix their price at 6d., and pay the taxation out of earnings. For this reason the smaller shows and entertainments should be protected to the extent of £ 5 0 on the gross weekly takings.'  philanthropic and patriotic entertainthe ments would be eliminated.",41
368,Mr FINLAYSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"As I have already suggested, patriotic entertainments should bo omitted, because their takings do amount to £ 5 0 per week unless a big patriotic show is being held. If the Treasurer can see his way to ' eliminate the taxation on 6d. tickets, and exempt the takings of smaller shows up to £ week, increasing the rate on the highermaycome priced tickets as much as he chooses order to raise asimilar amount of reso. venue, he will have the House with him. Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON (Lang) the [4.39] - To the Treasurer credit must given for having gone very carefully this question since it was first mentioned in the House, and for having reduced rates by practically one-half of those posed by his predecessor. At the same time, he would be well advised to to suggestions that ar© mad© in Committee for further emendations of his present proposal in the direction of conThe general public who pay the charges for admission will be called upon to pay this tax, and the probability is that in the case of families their attendance at picture shows and theatres will be considerably reduced. If that condition of affairs is brought about as a result of the tax, exempt the Treasurer's estimate of revenue may not be realized when the actual tax comes l be to be collected. I have received several telegrams and communications from picture-show proprietors, some of them in a small way of business. They strongly rethe proposal to .tax the. 6d. tickets, and I am assured that several picture theatres will have to be closed down, parl be ticularly the smaller proprietary shows. not It is well known that, during the latter period of the war, a large be number of picture shows have already turn closed down, while others are not doing a profitable business. The system of taxing tickets is not the best. If a system of taxing the profits of all entertainments were substituted, it would be more equitable, because, in many cases, profits ar© not made, and in some cases losses are incurred, and if the tax should fal l on the proprietors of the shows, it would not be on actual income clear of expenses, but upon expenses, on which the proprietors are already but-of pocket, or which already cover only liabilities. To that extent, the tax would have to be added to the losses already incurred. If taxation is carried in its present form , I am informed that many of the theatrical companies that visit Western Australia and some of the other States, where there not is already an amusement tax in operation, will have to abandon their future visits. I quite agree that tickets for football matches should be taxed for war need's, and I can understand that the Trea5 0 a surer is anxious to get what revenue from this source. He can do so in in Committee by making provision to do It will , perhaps,.relieve the burden of taxation in some other direction, where families of workers will feel the pinch. be Another suggestion that I have to make into to the Treasurer is that an alteration should be made on theatre tickets over a the value of 6s. I am not much concerned proabout the effectof the war tax on the higher-priced tickets, because those who listen can afford to pay those prices for their amusement can afford to pay a tax. It will fall on the public. There is room for further consideration of the rate of taxation on the lower priced tickets. The Treasurer's main purpose in introducing this measure is to get revenue from these sources - If , however, the effect of his tax will be to close up a number of these places of amusement, which are paying only a very small percentage over working expenses, it will largely defeat its object. When the Bill goes into Committee I hope the Treasurer will be prepared to receive reasonable suggestions for its improvement; I have every sympathy with his desire t d obtain as much revenue as he can, but I think he will 'be equally as anxious as I am that the revenue to be obtained in this way shall not entail undue hardship on those who will be called upon to pay it .",41
369,Mr RILEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,South Sydney) [4.47] - I hope that when we go into Committee the Treasurer will be prepared to accept an amendment exempting 6d. tickets from this tax. ,42
370,Mr RILEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I shall support such an amendment..  tickets ?,42
371,Mr RILEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Because many places of amusement, charging 6d. for admission, are run on a bare percentage over expenses.  of families who pay Is. for admission to these places of amusement?",42
372,Mr RILEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Thos e who do so can afford to pay a little more by way of this tax.  3d. tickets from taxation, so that the places of amusement to which the honourable member has referred will reap that advantage.",42
373,Mr RILEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The cheapest places of amusement now charge 6d., and they are attended only by the poorest sections of the community. The Commonwealth derives a large revenue from the duties on spirits and narcotics, and it seems to me that this tax on the lowerpriced tickets is something in the nature of double banking the taxation of these people. I have no sympathy with the proprietors of some theatres, who should be prepared to contribute to the revenue in this way. They engage the cheapest artists, bringing them out here under contract and refuse to employ Australian artists.",42
374,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The r e ought to be an import duty on those artists.,42
375,Mr RILEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I agree with the honourable member. Quite a number of the ordinary theatres are making a handsome profit, and people who can afford to pay 3s., 4s., and 5s. for a seat in those places of amusement should be able to bear this taxation. I hope, however, that I shall have an opportunity to record my vote against the imposition of a tax upon 6d. tickets. In my district there are a large number of 6d. picture theatres, which are attended for the most part by children, who are taken there by their parents. I am speaking in no spirit of hostility to the Treasurer. I urge, as a matter of justice, that we should exempt from this tax those who are compelled to go to the cheapest shows in the country.",42
376,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Wentworth) [4.50] The Treasurer has, I think, been wise in granting the concessions he has already made. The tax as originally proposed by his predecessor, the honourable member for Capricornia, was one under which, standat - 6d. ing by itself, the public might still have continued to enter Australian amusement enterprises at the additional charges. But superimposed upon the taxation which the States have already brought in , the original Bill would have been more than a fair thing. The Bill now before us practically brings the scheme into line with the English provision in this regard. I should like to give my view as to why some such tax as this is fair in time of war. In time of war a country necessarily lives very largely upon its credit. That credit is sometimes, as in the case of Australia, drawn upon in the form of a very much enlarged paper circulation. Employment in non-productive enterprises is largely fostered upon the pledge of the country's resources and future activities, with the result that, in time of war, there is generally among a whole host of people a large overplus of what appears to be, and what is for the moment, cash. These people have very often more to spend-in England this is extremely marked, and here in some cases it is also noticeable-and , as all people of a non-saving disposition, having money in their pockets will do, they will naturally go out and try to get the best they can out of life. We have at present closed one form of recreation. In this community, as in nearly all British communities, owing to laxity on the part of the municipal authorities, a number of men in poorer districts have, unfortunately, come to regard the public-house as their club. It is a lamentable fact. The municipalities should have avoided it by creating places of healthy amusement and recreation. Those places, however, have not been provided for in either Australia or Great Britain , and in the great majority of cases men have looked to hotels as affording a sort of meeting ground. Those places are now closed, with the result that theatres and amusement houses generally may be expected to do far better than they have done before, proportionately to the existing resources that remain in the Commonwealth. I do not wish to say one word that will add to the difficulties"" of the smaller picture-theatre proprietors. The Treasurer has done his best to meet their position by cutting off what would have been a most serious impost for them-the tax on 3d. tickets, which was proposed by his predecessor.",42
377,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,There are picture shows in country districts.,43
378,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,And none in the suburbs now.,43
379,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The r e were such places of amusement in the suburbs.,43
380,Mr EILEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,They have all put up the price to 6d.,43
381,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,What additional charge have they been called upon to bear that they should have found it necessary to increase the price from 3d. to 6d. ?,43
382,Mr RILEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,They said that they could not carry on under the old rate.,43
383,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,In this country it does not matter to a man whether he pays 3d. or 6d. for a seat as long as he gets a good one. It is because of that spirit that picture-theatre proprietors have been able to put up the price of admission to 6d.,43
384,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,This makes a .difference in the case of family tickets admitting four or five children.,43
385,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I agree that it does. It might be possible to meet the case of children.  not know what 3d. means to a man who has to battle along and keep five youngsters on fifty "" bob "" a week.",43
386,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I have just remarked that there is something in the point raised by the honourable member for Yarra, and that we might get over the difficulty of the tax in regard to children's tickets. But when one is dealing with a Bill at short notice, one must be a little careful about accepting the protestations of those who are going to be affected by it . I have been watching with some interest during the last few days the intense activity of the persons to be taxed, and' the influence it has had upon honourable members.  ing something on telegrams.",43
387,Mr RILEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,No . one has interviewed me on the subject.,43
388,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I venture to say that there is not a member of this House who has not received half-a-dozen telegrams, and not one, but a dozen written communications.",43
389,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I have received no telegram, but have been forwarded two typewritten communications.",43
390,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I have received one telegram and one type-written communication.,43
391,Mr ANSTEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,What influence would no 3d. that have on an honourable member without a free ticket?,43
392,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I have received a whole host of communications on the subject. They fill a small file. I am bound to say that, on looking through the more authoritative, I see such blemishes that my complete faith is somewhat shaken. I have received from a big picture proprietary, which also conducts an ordinary theatrical undertaking, a long typewritten statement of the points against tha amusement tax. In that statement my preliminary argument is discounted by a protest against the loss which these institutions have had to bear owing to the present war. In the case of that particular company",43
393,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,What company is it?,43
394,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am speaking of J . C. Williamson Limited. I happen to know a very little about that company's financial affairs. I know as much about them as its balance-sheets, filed in the Titles Office, will disclose. The information they give is not very generous, but such as it is I will give it to honourable members, so that they may have it side by side with the protestation that such firms find the war a heart-breaking and bankrupting load. I have been to the Titles Office here, and I find that this company provides,, not a statement of profit and loss, but merely a general balance-sheet, with only three entries on each side of the account. On the one side, under assets, they have the items of cash in hand, rents, deposits in advance, and sundry debtors' deposits; account balances, payments in vance, investments, incomplete tours, &c. The assets of this company, as given by themselves, are as f o l l o w : - In 1911 they were £329,229; in 1912 they were£362,893, showing an increase of about £33,664; in 1913 they had increased to £397,039-a n increase of £34,146. 1914-w e are now coming to the war period-the y increased from £397,039 to £464,155. That was an increase of £67,116 in the first war year. that was a war year throughout-this company's assets, as given by itself, in creased'from £464,155 to £514,136!",43
395,Mr SHARPE,COMPULSORY SERVICE,They do not employ Australian artists.,44
396,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I am making no attack on the firm, either in regard to the employment of artists or in any other respect. I am giving the bald figures as supplied by them under the law, and contrasting them with the statement in the circulars with which all honourable members have been inundated during the last few days. It is true that the liabilities of this firm, as shown in its ""balance-sheet, have increased from £29,000 in 1911 to £214,000 in 1915, although the subscribed capital remains constant. But we do not know what is included in these liabilities, and, therefore, we must not be too much impressed by this increase. The fact remains that the assets have increased,, since the war started, from about £400,000 to £514,000. I venture to say that the reason for that increase is the very large circulation of paper money that took place during the first, year or eighteen months of the war, and it is only fair to remember that that will not be felt so much in the future. But any one who keeps his eyes open must be well aware that, so far, the war has been of advantage to the big places of entertainment and amusement. Under these circumstances, I cannot see why the persons connected with these places should not be asked to bear some share of this taxation. I suggest that the Treasurer might consider the exemption of children's tickets, but if he concedes a general exemption of 6d. tickets, the next proposal will be to exempt Is. tickets, and so on, right up to 7s. 6d. tickets. The agitation was, first of all, for the exemption of the 3d. tickets sold in the suburban picture houses, and it seemed to me rather hard that those tickets should be ad- taxed. But I have found on inquiry that in most cases the charge in the suburban theatres has been raised from 3d. to 6d. without regard to the proposed tax. The simplest thing for the House to do is to trust the Treasurer in this matter, and support any proposition that the honourable In gentleman may think absolutely necessary in the interests of the revenue.  In 1915- multitude of counsellors there may be talk, but I question whether there is wisdom. I am glad that the'Treasurer's proposals in this matter are more reasonable than those of his predecessor, but I hope that he will see fit to exempt from taxation the 6d. tickets of admission sold at picture theatres. The abandonment of the proposal to tax 3d. tickets was a concession to the residents in the cities, for I have yet to learn that any number of country picture shows issue 3d. tickets. Therefore, if the 6d. ticket is not exempted from taxation, the country resident will be treated invidiously, because, while a town dweller can get the benefits of a picture show, whatever they may be, for -3d., without paying taxation, the countryman will have to pay 6d. and a tax as well.. On the ground of consistency, city and"" country dwellers should be treated alike in this matter. According to the figures that have been sent to me, six million 6d. tickets are sold annually in Australia, and a tax of ^d. would produce only £12,500. I am willing to support the taxing of 6d. tickets of admission to football matches, because, although I am an. enthusiastic advocate of football, having been an old Rugger player, I have yet to learn that the game is of any athletic value to those who sit in .safety and comf o r t watching the players. The country picture show, however, is a quasi-educational institution. It has been pointed out that the proposed tax on 6d. pictureshow tickets will strain the resources of men with large families. But why should those in the country who have large families have to pay not only twice as much for admission as the townsmen pay, but this tax as well ? If an amendment is moved to abolish the taxation of 6d. picture-show tickets, I shall vote for it .",44
397,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Maribyrnong) [5.10]. - Surely the Treasurer is convinced by the representations which have been made to him from both sides that it would be wise to concede something, in regard to the tax on 6d. tickets. If he proves unrelenting, he will find that the majority is. against his proposal. He made the confession that if he exempted 6d. tickets, he would lose practically the bulk of the revenue expected from this tax.  asks me to exempt one class of ticket, and another asks for another exemption, so that were I to make concessions to all there would be no revenue at all.",45
398,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"That is another matter. In this country the picture show is the working man's entertainment. Before picture shows came into existence, it was rarely that the workers could attend places of amusement. But now father, mother, and children often go at least once a week. Thus the taxation of 6d. tickets would mean a good deal to a man with a family. The proprietors of picture shows will not continue to sell these tickets for 6d., nor will they deal in halfpennies, and raise the price to 6^d.; they will make the price 7d.  any such increase must come to the Commonwealth.",45
399,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I should be glad to hear that the honourable member has been able to devise means to prevent the passing on of taxation. To-day, the bulk of the taxes are passed on.  passed on.",45
400,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"- I am glad to have that admission, because some are saying that it is the rich that pay for this, that, and the other, and that it is the wealthy who are bearing the burden of the war. Last year the honourable member for Balaclava showed very plainly that taxation is passed on u n t i l it gets down to the unskilled worker, or labouring man. It is only a few of the primary producers who cannot pass on taxation. most part, the taxes on city properties mean increased rentals. Thus taxation is being continually heaped on the shoulders of those least able to bear it , and it is time that Parliament devised a scheme to prevent this. Under the proposal of the Treasurer, the picture show ticket for which 6d. is now charged wil l cost 7d.",45
401,Mr GROOM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,In that case the tax on it will be I d .,45
402,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"We l l , let us consider the position of a family paying between 5d. and 6d. for its tickets. In the case of a poor man, with three children, who visits a picture show once a week, the proposed taxation means an impost of 23s. 6d. per annum.  is forgetting that both States and Commonwealth are levying amusement taxes.",45
403,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"That makes the position still worse. I think that enough has been said to show that there is very little hope of passing this measure as presented to us, because-and I say this with no idea of any threat-the members of another place know full well that the masses are already overlaid with taxation, and will reject this part of the Bill. In the course of the discussion, the honourable member for Brisbane has asked whether charitable and philanthropic institutions will be exempt. ",45
404,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I point out that the word "" philanthropic"" is a wide one, and may embrace religious bodies, but it may not, and it is possible that, in Committee, it wil l be necessary to have an amendment in this connection. If the States show a desire to resort to this k in d of taxation they may do so"", but it will not be tolerated. It might be possible for the. Commonwealth to confine their efforts to tickets - of Is. and higher values, and in this way consideris always able revenue might be obtained. I am in formed that the Victoria. Racing Club, which is a fairly wealthy sporting corporation, has, ever since the beginning of the war, devoted its profits to one or other of the patriotic funds, and I should like to know whether race meetings held under such conditions are provided for under the Bill. However that may be, I protest against the imposition of this tax on tickets which are generally bought by thepoorer sections of the community. Whether the entertainment proprietors and For the picture-show promoters are wealthy or not,_ it is absolutely certain that this tax will be passed on to the public; at any rate, I know that the picture-show proprietors have a union, or association, the membership conditions of which are quite as ex-' acting as those of the Employers Federation or any other similar organization. T hop© that the Treasurer will listen to advice that has been given to him from both sides of the House, and will see the poorer people are .not called upon raise the bulk of the revenue expected under this measure.",45
405,Mr MCWILLIAM S,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Franklin) [5.23]. - If the Treasurer accepts all the advice on his picture-show ticket. offered to him, there will be very little revenue from-this taxation. I , in common with other honourable members, have received a good many petitions from amusement proprietors and promoters, who contend that the taxation must paid entirely by them, because it is imposof sible to pass it on. It is a familiar ment in connection with fiscal duties that, no matter what the tax is, the consuming by charging 7d. public is called upon to pay it . It is held by many, however, that the amuseprietor ments of the people form a of taxation, than do the necessities of the people. It has been suggested that racing clubs and all philanthropic and religious entertainments shall be exempt. Then have heard the old story about the battles of the Empire being won on the school playing fields, and it is urged that footare ball matches and athletic sports-including, I suppose, the stadiums-shal l also escape this taxation. My own opinion is that, in the interests of clean sport, would be a good thing to reduce the profits of football clubs. If one feature more than another is capable of demoralizing sport here, it is the element of professionposed alism introduced into the football clubs. Under the conditions to which I refer, players are laid open to offers from 'bookapply makers; indeed, it is quite usual to hear, in connection with some event of the kind, that "" So-and-so is playing stiff; he must have been got at!"" Do we not know that all the large football clubs, in Victoria, at any rate, keep a certain number of fessional players. It would be better, in the interests of sport, if associations had not at their command such large sums with which to' pay prois minent players. Representatives of minent football clubs, when visiting Tasone mania, have been quite eager to obtain the services of any player of promise they came across.",46
406,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,That has not been so since the war.,46
407,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"7-Quite so. At any rate, in a time of necessity like this, is it suggested that those who can afford to pay high prices for amusements and poses. the sports at the stadiums and the football grounds cannot afford to contribute somethat thing, at least, to the necessities of a to country fighting for its very life? One cannot help thinking that there is a good deal of cant in the argument that the working man is unable to pay this tax I do not wish to impose any more taxation than is necessary on the working man, but I cannot help regarding all the talk about his being compelled to deprive himself be and his family of amusement by reason 1 a tax of $d. on a 6d. ticket, as so much argu- ""fudge."" I cannot think that the show proprietor will be able to pass the tax on",46
408,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The amusement procannot pay the tax unless he rebetter subject ceives the money.,46
409,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I speak on good authority when I say that I do not know a better speculation today than a we small picture show in some of the suburbs. There are shows of the kind which earning 20 per cent., and we must not - forget that this tax. will mean a revenue of £400,000 or £500,000. However, as I have already said, if the exemptions that it have been suggested are made, the tax will be scarcely worth levying. Accordingto information that is available to us, I believe that every penny of the prorevenue will be required; and the conclusion is forced upon us that, in the immediate future, it will be necessary to the pruning-knife with no uncertain hand, if we are to make ends meet. The only way to do that is to provide additional money, or cut down to a great extent the normal expenditure. Unfortunately, very much saying cannot he promade in the actual war expenditure. If much this were not a time of war, I should these unhesitatingly oppose the imposition of such taxation as this. My own opinion that it is not a tax which should be prointroduced hy the Commonwealth, hut 1 which ought to be left to the States.",46
410,Mr RILEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The States have not to ^ meet war expenditure.,46
411,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,That is so; and it is only the necessities of the case that make the House entertain the proposal. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The States pretend that the taxation is for war pur,46
412,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"W h e r e the taxation has been imposed in some of the States, it has been to meet absolute local necessities. The estimated revenue placed before us by the ex-Treasurer has been reduced by nearly one-half; and, as I said before, if the Treasurer accepts the suggestions that have been made this afternoon, it will not be worth going on with the Bill .  nents of the measure desire.",47
413,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I believe that the Treasurer requires the money, and I will support the tax in the form in which he has proposed it , not because I believe that it is a tax which in normal conditions should be levied by the Federal Parliament, but because in this time of national emergency every penny is required by the Government.",47
414,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Melbourne Ports) [5.31] - The Treasurer struck' the nail on the head when he said that if further exemptions were to be made we might as well throw aside the tax altogether. In my opinion, that is what should be done. I never dreamt that any Federal Treasurer would get a dragnet out to catch tadpoles. Every person interested in supplying amusements to the public pays the same taxation as everybody else, but now the Government propose to place upon those people a special tax. What is the reason for doing that? If the 6d. ticket is increased to 7d., the proprietor will not lose anything by reason of this tax being imposed; the burden will f all upon those people who can only afford cheap entertainments. Do honourable members realise that this proposal means the levying of additional taxation to the extent of 8^ per cent, upon an industry that is already subject to all other taxes ?  only half as heavy as that to which the honourable member agreed.",47
415,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"That incorrect, because I was opposed to the amusement tax from the time it was first mentioned. I regard it as a foolish proposal. What have the people engaged in catering for public amusement they should be subjected to this special increase of taxation 1",47
416,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The trouble is that this is to be a duplication of taxation already in existence in three States.,47
417,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"That is another aspect of the matter. But I ask again, What have the proprietors of amusement shows done that the Federal Parliament should say to them, "" You, who supply amusement to those who in the community get very little joy in life, shall pay an extra 8£ per cent, in tax at i o n ""? In regard to the taxation of sporting clubs, if the Government expect to get any revenue from cricket and football clubs, they will be disappointed, because the clubs have no income that can be taxed. s Since the outbreak of war, I have received . more letters from such bodies asking for assistance than ever before. We have heard it said that there'is no sport in thousands of people sitting on hard seats to watch a few others at play. My answer tp that statement is that the men who .sat on those hard seats were the same men as made history at Gallipoli. Before the war Victoria was the home of football, and bigger crowds were attracted to matches in Melbourne than in any other portion of Australia, but during the last season so little was heard of the game that notone person in a hundred could answer an inquiry as to what club won the premiership.",47
418,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Before the war the reverse was the case.,47
419,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Exactly . Sunday school teachers, brewers, members of Parliament, in fact everybody, could say who were the football premiers of Victoria. To-day practically no football is played. The Treasurer has said that if the clubs have no revenue they wil l not be taxed. The fact is that the clubs are keeping the game alive to the best of their ability, but every one of them has an overdraft, and yet the Government ask them to surrender per cent, of any money they do receive. A lot has been said about the money made by those connected with these clubs. I guarantee that any honourable tax members who have occupied the position of secretary or president to football clubs have found their pockets constantly depleted. I have not known any football statement is official who has not had to pay money out of his own pocket on account of his association with the sport. In regard to the payment of the players, the public want the best sport they can get, and men who done that go into training and run the risk of in juries on the football field say they have a right to be paid*but today there is not a professional player in Victoria, and there is no justification for the allegations about the lazy loafers who are said to be living on the game in this State. Mr ARCHIBALD.,-The clubs are running' picture shows now.",47
420,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,They are resorting to every method imaginable to obtain money to keep them in existence. every suburb in my electorate the ladies have been asked to form themselves into committees and conduct bazaars in order to raise money to pay off the overdrafts incurredj by the football and cricket club committees during the first year of the war. Yet the Government sets upon them as bodies which have money galore.  charge ?,48
421,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Of course they do. But the Government are proposing to tax a section of people who are not able to pay their way. If the Government must tax somebody, let them select these who have funds to be taxed. If the clubs are to lose per cent, of their small receipts,' there will be no football next year. If honourable members desire to stop football and cricket, let them say so. I have heard f ootball clubs attacked at times, and with some justification; but, whilst there may be some frequenters of football matches who are not desirable, a great proportion of them follow that form of amusement because they like it . I have not attended a boxing match for the last twenty-five years, but it is quite possible that the Government may get a fair amount of revenue from the stadia. In this case, however, the tax will not be upon6d. tickets, but will be collected from people who pay big prices for their entertainment. Reverting to the picture shows, it will be found that many of them do not make 8 | per cent, profit. Plenty of the picture-theatre proprietors make only a bare living. West's picture theatre, one of the oldest established and best conducted in Melbourne, and at which there is an orchestra - the music of which alone is worth the price of admission, is open only once a week now. At Hoyt's picture show the public are well catered for, but anybody seeing the sparse audience on an ordinary week night will realise that the receipts could not pay for the evening's entertainment. The proprietors depend upon, the Saturday night and holiday receipts for their profits, and no business carried on under those conditions can afford to pay a tax of 8^ per cent, over and above all the other taxes. I doubt if any of them have made 8 | per cent, on the money they have invested. If this is another subterfuge to compel the closing down of these places of entertainments and forcing the employees to enlist, let the Government say so, but if the tax is only for the purpose of raising reIn venue, it is preposterous. The result will be that the weaker concerns must go to the wall. I admit that thepicture-show business has been overbuilt in Melbiurne, and I think that the Treasurer should have prevented the erection of some of the picture theatres which have come into existence here and elsewhere during the last two years. It may be said that these' people will lose their money when the slump comes, but what is the sense of allowing them to do that? In every suburb of every city, there are churches, lodges, associations, and suchlike institutions, which appoint committees to run social functions, and the "" n i m b le b o b "" is usually the charge for all the entertainments they promote. The Government say that they will take I d . for every Is. paid on these little social functions. Is the proposal worthy of a Commonwealth Parliament? Does the Treasurer really think that this is a statesmanlike attempt to get taxation ? It is said that the tax works very well in Great Britain . I do not know whether that is the case - We often get information that is not correct. There are other media of enjoyment in the district that I represent, and if the picture shows are closed, it will simply mean giving a greater opportunity to those who have the custom to raise their prices. It is useless to k ill one form of occupation in order to enhance the profits of another. Teetotallers thought that they were going to stop the selling of drink when they closed some of the public-houses, but the only effect of their action was to give an additional value to certain other licences, some of which ought not to be in existence. They consider that drinking is a vicej but surely there is no vice in picture shows and amusements? We have heard about the four small boys who bought a revolver, and bailed up an old woman in her shop. This case has been, cited as a dreadful example of the effect of pictures on. the young mind, but we heard the same thing in regard to the dreadful effect of Deadwood Dick yarns.. If this sort of thing could not be attributed to picture shows it would be attributed to something else. Who can say that the picture show-the most popular form of amusement today-ha s no educational value? Each night there is usually one picture of educational value. People can travel all over the world hy means of picture shows. These pictures do not generally please the young people, hut, at the same time, something of value is instilled into their minds. Instructive pictures are often shown of different forms of industries. I admit that some pictures may not be educational, but, at any rate, they are very interesting and very enjoyable. Some of the dramas may be very suggestive, but they are not more .so tfian those produced on the stage, or those we see in every-day life. The innocent mind cannot understand them, and they do no harm to those children who are old enough to have the depth of feeling to understand them. If the Government, will hot withdraw the Bill , I hope that they will see their way clear to change the incidence of the tax. I give notice now that I shall move aji amendment in Committee to delete lines 13 and 16, and substitute the words "" one shilling . . . one penny."" I may be told"" that the price of the Is. ticket may be reduced to l i d . in order to escape the tax, but provision can be made to prevent that being done. I think that the Is. ticket is really the lowest that should be taxed, and that a I d . tax on it will be ample. Some people hold that there should be no enjoyment when the war is on, and that we should be in sackcloth and ashes; but the boys at the front are not in sackcloth and ashes; they enjoy themselves. I listened to the remarks of the honourable member for Hume. party to wnich I belong believe that, m the interests of the community, the Government should pay for the amusements that go through the country in order to give people ""in isolated portions of our continent an opportunity of seeing some life instead of having their lives restricted. It is the duty of the Government or the municipal bodies to do this. When I first stood for the municipal council in Port Melbourne, and talked upon that subject, they said to me, "" J i m, old chap, come down off that platform. That talk is no good7' For fifteen years we talked of playgrounds for the children, and we have them today. Amusements are like telephones. The more amusements and telephones that are provided for the people in the country districts, the better' will their conditions be, and I say that instead of restricting their enjoyment, the Government should drop the Bill , or not impose a tax on less than Is. tickets.",48
422,Mr HIGGS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Capricornia) [5.54] I am sorry that the Treasurer has seen fit to alter the Bill , and cut down thetax by one-half. It was part of a scheme - it may be a rough-and-ready one-for raising money for the purposes of paying the war expenses. It seems to me that the Treasurer has forgotten that fact. We are so far away from the sound of the guns that we are apt to forget that there is a war in progress. We forget that our expenditure has increased since the pre-war period from £25,000,000 to £40,000,000,- and from £40,000,000 to £70,000,000, while it is expected that this financial year there will be an expenditure of over £100,000,000, which means that a very large interest bill will have to be paid on the money that is borrowed. W© must get revenue from somewhere. I venture to say that there has been no agitation on the part of th© general public against this entertainments tax. The agitation has come mainly from the showmen who fear- I think wrongly-that they will have to bear the tax. In the United Kingdom, where they have i m posed an amusements tax, the public generally have paid it cheerfully. Many people who go to a theatre during the war feel a little uncomfortable. While they are sitting there enjoying themselves the vision of the battle-fields of Europe will obtrude itself from time to time. I suggest that they would feel more comfortThe able if they were paying an amusement tax which they knew was imposed for war purposes. The point is: What is to be the scheme of taxation to raise the necessary revenue to meet th© war expenditure ? Are we to continue borrowing money without making any attempt to pay our way as we go along ? I am sorry that the Treasurer has seen fit to come down, first, with a proposal that will mean that the general public will pay the tax. The entertainments tax was part of a scheme. The Treasurer knows that it was proposed to bring down the Wartime Profits Bill first.  knows why we did not bring down that measure. The entertainments tax will not apply until the Bill is passed, but the war-time profits tax can be collected for this year although we do not pass th© Bill this year.",49

429,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Does not the honourable member think the rates are still exces think that under existing circumstances they are fair. We have in this community who are spoken of as persons of means, and others who are referred to as the poor of the land. The argument has been set up, ostensibly in the interests of the the poor of the land, that the tax on 6d. tickets should be abandoned. A fte r some I have come to the concluthe sion that in Australia the people who memare well off are those who have denied themselves over and over again practically every enjoyment of life in order There are than in this community thousands who are among those known as the poor, and who occupy that position because whatever they have in excess of the money necessary to provide for acProtual every-day requirements is spent on amusement. Too much money, I believe, is spent i h that direction. As the honourable member for Capricornia has very properly observed, if the people will have these amusements at a time when I some of the very best of the young manhood of Australia are sacrificing their life's blood, they will feel a measure of satisfaction in contributing in this way some small'quota towards the cost of the war. There may be something in the abpoint raised by the honourable member for Maribyrnong that as the result of the of Jd. on 6d. tickets, the people will We I should take steps to guard against that. a I visited a show while travelling through but Canada, and discovered that there was a tax upon amusements in the Dominion.

I believe he will see that the right and proper thing is done. am going to support the Treasurer in imposing this impost, believing that in the interests of the community it is good to let those who spend all their surplus money on amusements see that it is not to be expended without some small - contribution to those war expenses which are inevitable, and which every section is being called upon to bear. As to the fear expressed by the honourable member for Capricornia that the other taxation measures which have heen foreshadowed will not be brought down in time, I am satisfied, from what I have heard, that they will find a place on our statute-book, and that this Bill will form just as much a part of the complete whole as it did when the honourable member himself thought of introducing it .",51
431,Dr MALONEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Melbourne) [6.7] I do not know whetlier I ought to compliment the Government on the courage they display in introducing a Bill of this kind. Every mother who, as the result of this tax, has to pay an additional halfpenny for the admission of herself and each of her children to a picture show will not bless the Administration responsible for it . It seems to be playing it a little low down to tax the amusements of those whom we know as the poor. I have seen most of the countries of the world, and must confess that I have seen on a film better views of a country than I was able to obtain whilst visiting it . That may be readily accounted for, having regard to the large sums of money that film makers are prepared to expend in obtaining the very finest pictures of the scenery, as well as the manufactures, of many lands. I have seen the carnivals at Nice and have known them to be splendidly depicted on the picture screens - Mountain and river scenery of various countries is also shown to perfection. Holding as I do the view that educational establishments should be wholly free, I should have been glad if the Government had come down with a proposal to exempt 6d. tickets for picture theatres, provided that the proprietors would undertake to show every day a film depicting the scenery or the manufactures of a country. Such pictures must have an educational effect on the community. t h I should have preferred to see no tax at all of this kind, but if in a moment of generosity we had said that we would not tax amusements I am afraid that the I needy State Treasurers would have availed themselves of this means of raising money. In Victoria betting tickets are already taxed, and to my mind taxed very unfairly. Surely the Government are not seeking to tax "" the last shilling?"" Seventy per cent, of our young men have volunteered to go to the front , so that if the promise made by Mr Fisher that Australia would if necessary give its last man and its last shilling to the successful prosecution of the war is to be kept, 70 per cent, of the last shilling ought already to be in the coffers of the Treasury. No Ministry, however, would dare to bring in a tax amounting to 70 per cent. The greater portion of this amusement tax will f all upon the relatives of those who have gone to the front to fight for the whole community - I am not blaming the present Government; I am not seeking to specially criticise them, because as a matter of fact I made up my mind to speak as I am now doing when this taxation was announced by the ex-Treasurer. I thank the Treasurer for having reduced the tax originally proposed. I would suggest that he go further and exempt 6d. tickets from taxation. Let him start with the shilling tickets. I can endorse all that has been said by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports as to picture shows being largely patronized by the young and as to the proprietors of such establishments having to depend in many cases wholly and solely upon a Saturday night's ' ' house'' to pay expenses. The returns from a holiday night show may provide a profit, but the profits of picture theatre owners today are not what they have been. I resent the actions of the "" w o w s e r "" element, who have no regard for the pleasures of others, and who seem to think that all pleasure should be found within the narrow limits of the churches. All churches are not attractive, because many of their teachers, instead of following the example of the lowly Carpenter, are forming an aristocracy of religion and are so causing many to decline to go to church. I was almost expecting the honourable member for Echuca to in sist upon a tax being levied on the "" threepenny b it "" collected in the churches. Such a proposal I would have considered to be quite consistent with his long political career.  temptible.",51

I was merely showing why many people remained poor.",52

I would be with him ; if he moved to tax the Lord Mayors' banquets, as well as other large dinner parties, I would support him. The Director-General for Recruiting has already approved of a suggestion I have made that free moving pictures should be utilized in connection with the recruiting campaign. My desire is that those who attend recruiting meetings should see some of the terrible things that only pictures can show-that they should be given an opportunity to see how countries have been devastated; and how in jury has been done to life and, in a lesser degree, to property during this war. Our party does not value property as it values life. Our ideals are based upon the view of Ruskin, that "" life is the only wealth."" I should like to see those words written in diamond points in every State school - This Parliament idealized this view of life by granting the people a glorious franchise, and we should not limi t the amusements of our women and children, the majority of whom are related to men at the front. I hope that the cinematograph will be taken more into the schools, and that history will be taught by the impressions conveyed from the eye to the brain. When an amusing picture is shown on the screen, the theatre is filled with that sweetest sound on earth--the rippling laughter of the children. I never hear it without feeling myself a better man; and those who think that the human heart cannot be touched by pictures have only to look round when a sad play is being shown to see the handkerchiefs raised surreptitiously in the darkened hall. W it h very few exceptions, the pictures that are shown are uplifting , educating the world, and making it better. As to the theatre, some people ask why not tax the higher-priced seats. There might be more reason for that; but I would point out that many theatre tickets are given away as passes to admit to the stalls and dress circle, and it would not be fair to tax the management on tickets from which they get no monetary return. It might be possible, however, to provide that only tickets that were paid for should be taxed. 'As for football and cricket, they are games which keep up the physique of the race. When we become a wise nation, we shall do more for physical culture. Men like Sandow have helped more in the physical regeneration of the race than all the doctors. Under the proposal of the Treasurer, however, tickets to admit to exhibitions of jiu-jitsu, wrestling, and boxing would be taxed. I warn those who are prepared to give complete support to this proposal that every man and woman who has to pay the taxes will remember the Government that imposes them when- I hope in the early future-w e have an election.  tertainment tax in South Australia for some - time, and I have heard no complaints about it .",52
434,Dr MALONEY,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"That may be so; but I could prove to the honourable member, by taking him down Bourke-street, that there will be great complaints about this tax. There are, of course, men of the "" w o w s e r "" type who never patronize amusements, and who may be in favour of taxing entertainments, and there are has others who think that the higher-priced seats should be taxed. In Committee I shall be only too glad to support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.",52
435,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Richmond) [6.20] For - a considerable time past I have felt that one of the fairest taxes is a tax on entertainments, and I think that I was one of the first in this House to suggest the imposition of such taxation for the period of the war. It is not that I take exception to persons going to places of - - entertainment in war time, because, probably, rational amusement has its good effects.; but it must' be remembered that - entertainments, are paid for with surplus cash, after the ordinary demands of life have been met. Very few in our community spend money on amusements before paying their butchers and bakers. To my mind, the whole question is, what is the fairest way in which to frame this tax? Where shall we begin, and where shall we end? I think that those who patronize places of amusement realise that money'must be found to meet the - extra demands of the war, and will not ' seriously oppose this taxation. In my - opinion, those who are controlling the public amusements through the film agencies have engineered much of the opposition to the Bill. No doubt every other honourable member, like myself, has received large numbers of letters, telegrams, and other comunications, all - couched in the same language, and springing from the same source.",52
436,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I have not read any of it. My trouble is that it.is proposed to increase the taxation of those, who are already overtaxed.",53
437,Mr GREENE,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The taxation is very heavy, hut it will probably be worse before the war is over. What we must endeavour to do is to avoid, as far as possible, increasing the ordinary expenses - of living. The money spent on amusements is something possessed over and above what is needed to purchase necessaries; it is surplus cash. Whether the tax should be imposed on 6d. tickets is a question that can be, discussed in Committee. There is something to be said for not taxing such tickets. Seeing that the 3d. ticket, which is the minimum city - charge, is not taxed, and that the minimum country charge is 6d., it might be reasonable to exempt the minimum - country charge in the same way as the minimum city charge is exempted. have not definitely made up my mind as to the point at which taxation should start, but I think the Treasurer has done right in proposing this form of taxation, and I hope that the Bill will pass within a reasonable time, and that those who have to pay this tax, the amusement patrons, will cheerfully acquiesce in it.",53

We in Australia are faced with the fact that money has to he raised in. order to carry on the war satisfactorily. We know that the expenditure is not likely to decrease, but rather to increase; and we have also the example of the British Government, who have raised part of their revenue by the means now proposed.

442,Mr BURCHELL,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"On one occasion a number of people I know went to one of the principal music halls in London, and they had to pay as much as Is. 6d. on the iOs. charged for admission. This is purely a tax on the amusements of the people; and I think it is only fair that those who are prepared to go to any form of entertainment at such a time as this should subscribe specially to the cost of the war. I may mention incidentally, that in England and in Canada people at entertainments have to pay for their programmes, though we know that this I does not obtain in Australia. We are asked to consider the man of small means. I have as great a desire as any one to look after the person who is not in receipt of a big salary; but I think the taxes proposed by this Bill are perfectly legitimate and fair. If honourable members were to visit some of the other Dominions, they would find that there is not only a tax on the prices of admission to entertainments, but that the postage rates have been in creased by a special war surcharge.",53

It is in these small ways that the Dominions have had to raise money as their share of the war expenditure. It is time that we, as members of this Parliament, realized that, in carrying such legislation into effect, we are not alone; but that through- out the Empire this and other forms of small taxation are in operation. lieve that when the whole of the taxation proposals of the Government are before us, it will be seen that there is a fair and true adjustment; that, although this is the first individual measure introduced by the Treasurer, it will be found, before he has finished with his other legislation which is now before the Chamber, that every class in the community will be called upon to bear their proper share. I rose merely to say that, in my opinion, the Treasurer will be wise if he is steadfast in regard to the measure before us, and does not give way in the manner that has been suggested. Along with other honourable members, I have been inundated with letters from representatives of cinema shows; and, having read them, I am convinced that no cogent argument is advanced why this taxation should not be imposed.  very refreshing to hear the honourable member for Fremantle advocating extra taxation, and giving as his principal reason the fact that similar taxation is i m posed in England, Canada, and elsewhere. Is there any reason why Australia should follow the example of the older countries? The Treasurer could find other means of raising money without taxing the amusements of the children of those men, who, in a few weeks' time, will be asked to go to the front-wh o will be asked to sacrifice their homes, wives, families, and even their lives. There are gentlemen in the Chamber, however, who desire to tax the Let us kiddies' amusements; for, if this Bill will interfere with any, it will interfere with the wives and children of the poorer classes.

In Committee I shall vote proposed tax 'on 6d. tickets, because 1 know that this tax, if imposed, would be a great hardship on the poorer 7,000 classes, particularly on the wives and children of the men at the front , who f cannot afford to pay more than the existQuestion resolved in the affirmative.

463,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Melbourne Ports) farmer. We [8.14] - I move That the wordsnot less than fivepence and not exceeding sixpence-Jd. ; exceeding sixpence and not exceeding one shilling-Id. , be left out, and that the following words be land tax inserted in lieu thereof :Not less than elevenpence-Id . The effect of the amendment will be to too. provide that l i d . shall be the lowest charge on which a tax may be collected. The tax of I d . will make the total charge The very fact that 6d. is charged in our community is a proof that that is value the largest amount which amusement caterers can obtain from the mass of the In the theatre there is no price lower Is., showing again that 6d. is as much as these people can charge, because they cater for those who cannot afford to pay it more. It may he claimed that if people decannot afford to pay more, they should go less frequently to these places of enretertainment, bu t it ill-becomes any one to advance that argument in a community late Gowhere those who have the money can afford to pay for their entertainment. It is very evident to me that those who are running these shows will not be able to my pay the tax, and that they will have to We pass it on, because, if they are called upon to pay the tax, it will mean '8£ per cent, on their takings. Is there any section of the community that would not raise Cain if in one fell swoop extra taxation to the extent of 8^ per cent, were imposed on it ? No one can say that those who are engaged in the entertainment line of business are not taxed in the same way as those who are following other lines of business. If an additional 8£ per cent, taxation were imposed on the great landowners of Australia, who are already taxed so heavily, their profits would not be covered by that percentagei n a large number of oases. If an additional 8$ per cent, income tax were imposed, I can imagine the squeal there would be. Then why should these people be asked to pay another 8^ per cent. ? But they must do so or pass.on the tax"". If they pass it on, each 6d. ticket will cost an additional I d . The Bill is so arranged as to prevent the tax being passed on in that way,/ but I believe that it w i ll really mean, not a deduction of i i . on every 6d. received, but the addition of I d . to every 6d. paid for the entertainment provided. People who - can afford to pay only a small sum for their pleasure will have to pay more for it . The cost of their furniture, their food, and their rent has increased-that is why they seek the-cheapest form of pleasurehut now the cost of their amusement is to be increased. The tax will mean either that the people will pay more for that cheap amusement, for which alone they can afford to pay, or the men who have put their money into the amusement line of business will be ruined. The only effect will be the cutting down of those shows which are struggling, and the throwing out of employment of a very large number of people. In the electorate of Melbourne Ports there must be 120 people employed in picture shows. If these 6d. tickets are taxed as is proposed in the B four-fifths of the picture theatres will have to close, and each locality will be restricted to one show. Even if we do not consider the case of those who will lose their employment, let us consider '-he ca.se of those who have spent their money in putting up large buildings. We cannot - get away from the fact that the lads who have gone to the front , were those who patronized these shows; therefore, the owners of these buildings have suffered by the absence of these youths, just the same as other traders in the poorer districts have suffered through the loss of custom. A f t e r Monday one can go any night to a picture theatre and wonder [358]- 2 why so much light is burnt for the very poor attendance. The attendances are lighter than the lights themselves. A f t e r Monday night it is hardly worth opening the show until the following Saturday night. The tax on 6d. tickets will not bring in the anticipated revenue. People attend the picture shows because they have facilities for doing so. If the theatres close to their homes are closed, and they have to go farther afield to see the pictures, they will stay at home or devote their attention to some other object. I leave the question of country districts to other honourable members. The attendance at the picture shows will certainly be reduoed. The Treasurer expects this particular section of the tax to bring in about £100,000 a year. '  90,000,000 'people go to these places in Australia each year, I cannot believe it .",56
464,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The figures are not extraordinary. There are families who go regularly once or twice a week. Formerly there used to be a lot of dancing, but dancing has been replaced by attendance at picture shows. The billiard-rooms have been emptied in the same way. If picture shows are not beneficial, I would like to know what they are.  the honourable member to picture shows.",57
465,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The honourable member brings me back to the question of football and cricket matches. He is willing that they should pay the tax. I suppose that the clubs do not make any charge in his district, but as far as Melbourne is concerned, the attendance at football matches is n i l . Every football club has an overdraft. There is not ill , much money in sport today. U p to three years ago any honourable member of this House who knew nothing about football would always know when Carlton and South Melbourne were playing off for the premiership. Has any honourable member heard anything about football .for the last two years ?",57
466,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,That state of affairs is not singular to Victoria.,57
467,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"No , it applies all over the Commonwealth. I am endeavouring to show that it is useless to expect any revenue from football matches. The application of this tax to cricket and football clubs would close them down. They cannot afford to pay it .",57
468,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,What will the members of the clubs then do?,58
469,Mr MATHEWS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Le t me answer the honourable member's question by putting another question to him. What becomes of the men who usedto spend their earnings in the hotels? I would rather see our young men taking part in, or watching, a football match than hanging about hotels or playing "" two-up."" could never understand why boys should be fined for playing "" two-up,"" while I could go to a club and play bridge! There will be no revenue derived from the application of this taxation to .cricket and football clubs. There was not a senior football club playing in my district last year; but the few clubs in the metropolitan area that are still playing will be compelled to shut down if this tax is applied to them. Although I have always been keenly interested in football, I could not mention the name of one club that has played in my electorate during the last two years', or the name of a club that has carried off the premiership. Since the war, interest in these matches has declined; but I hope to see a revival of it when the war is over and our boys come back. If the Government desire it, let them impose a tax on Is. tickets for admission to cricket and football matches; but they ought not to attempt to deprive the clubs of the little revenue they are at present earning. A good sports ground is well worth having in any district; but the revenue which the clubs are at present earning is not sufficient to maintain theii grounds. Are we to say that there shall be no football and no racing? If we decide to take 8£ per cent, of the little money that the sporting clubs in the metropolitan area are now receiving, we might as well close them up at once.",58
470,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,HindmarshMinister for Trade and Customs) [8.40]. - I hope that the Committee will pass the clause as it stands. The painful picture which has been drawn of the wretched poverty existing in our metropolitan areas is one to which I do not subscribe. Some honourable members would have us believe that the people' are too poor to be able to pay a tax of a *d. on every 6d. charged for admission to a place of amusement. I do not share that view. It is only a day or two ago that an honourable member referred in this House to the tremendous increase in the Customs returns from wearing apparel and jewellery; but a stranger listeningto the debate this evening would imagine that Victoria was one of the most poverty stricken places on the face of the earth. No sensible man will say that this form of taxation is an ideal one; but it must I not be forgotten that there is a war in progress.  which justifies this taxation.,58
471,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Quite so. It isdifficult for honourable members of the Australian Labour party to realise that a war is on. Such a thought never enterstheir minds, as is proved over and over again by their speeches in the House and outside of it.",58
472,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"That is ""bunkum.""",58
473,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Whether we like it or not, we have to build up our Consolidated Revenue Eund, and we must build it up hy means of this and other forms of taxation. I hope that the war will soon come to an end, and that we- ;> shall have peace, not on the terms talked of just now, but on such a basis that the Power which has been a menace to the nations of the earth will be smashed. That may necessitate a further increase of taxation. No sensible man would approve of this method of raising revenue in normal times, but it is necessary to meet a special emergency. A good deal of clap-trap has been indulged in with regard to the effect of this tax upon the friends and relatives of soldiers at the front. I do not believe that there is an Australian soldier who will object to this tax when he knows that it is part of a scheme for building up the Consolidated Revenue Pund, out of which we have to provide for war pensions and the needs of relatives of his fallen comrades. There has also been much talk as to the poverty of the people. Had my honourable friends been in Melbourne thirty or thirty-five years ago, when there was a lower standard of living, they might have seen evidences of a certain amount of poverty, more especially had they watched the girls going to the factories in the early morning and returning home at night. That was the position in every State capital. But it is not the position today. It is untrue to say that our work people are poverty-stricken. One has only to look at our working classes, and especially at our women folk, and to note the way that they dress, to satisfy oneself that this talk of poverty amongst the workers is all claptrap, and is resorted to only in the hope of winning votes. The great mass of the working people have too much common sense to be misled in this way.",58
474,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,They are bearing the whole load of taxation.,59
475,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,I do not think they are.  into the Savings Banks than ever they did before.,59
476,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,That is so. One of the boasts of the Labour party has been that we shifted a large amount of taxation from the backs of the poorer classes to a section of the community that was able to bear it . It is monstrous to say that our taxation is borne only by the workers. There are other sections of the community who have to bear the major portion of our war taxation. The cost of the war comes largely out of the revenue obtained from the income tax and the land tax.,59
477,Mr FENTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Who pays those taxes 1,59
478,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,A r e they paid by the working classes ?,59
479,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,They are passed on to them. ',59
480,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"E very man in the community who is engaged in useful and necessary work is a worker, whether he be employed as the manager of a big station, the superintendent of a factory, or as a mechanic. In that sense the workers do bear the taxation of the country. But if my honourable friend means to refer only to mechanics and labourers as bearing the taxation of the Commonwealth, I do not agree with him. It is popular, I know, to talk like that, and such an attitude has many attractions for honourable members of the Corner party. Coming back to the proposal to tax entertainment tickets, I should have liked to see a tax of £d. put on many of the 3d. tickets issued in connection with picture shows. In Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and probably in Perth and in Brisbane, picture shows are open from 11 in the-morning u n t i l 11 at night, the prices'of admission being 3d. and 6d. Is it the children of working men, or poor people, that you find in those places of entertainment all through the day? Certainly not. Those who can afford to ' patronize such entertainments in the daytime might well pay a tax of I d . on the 3d. tickets. I know something of the world in which I live; I do not look at things over the fence. If I wish to learn the condition of the workers, I do not study blue books; I go to where their wives shop, and study their shopping, and thus get a better idea of their conditions than I could by any amount of reading, or by listening to liars who had some political purpose to serve. I know, ol course, that there are many other picture shows which are patronized largely by children. It was because of them that the Government determined not to tax 3d. tickets.",59
481,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"In the country, children have to pay 6d. Why should those shows be taxed ?",59
482,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"In mostplaces children are admitted for half-price. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports complained that cricket and football have been knocked on the head, and that the world is a very dismal place nowa-days, but, apparently, he would like ut to spend our time wandering through churchyard's crying. We have been told that the picture-show proprietors are losing money. Possibly they are, where the management is bad, but we are accustomed to hear persons declare thai they are losing money in their businesses, and then to see them retiring with a competence.

487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"So far as I am aware, it is. There is a precedent for a Government agreeing to the requests of the Senate, but that has not been done without a declaratory resolution claiming our constitutional rights and privileges in connection with money Bills. The serious thing about the present position is that no such motion has been proposed. Our rights have been allowed to go by the board. The matter is not one to be treated lightly. H a d the circumstances been different, the Prime Minister would not have dreamt of treating it as he is doing.",60

489,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I believe the Prime Minister consults me as much, perhaps, as he did my honourable friend, the difference being that my honourable friend was one of his colleagues and I am not. I have only to say that whatever the Prime Minister did to my honourable friend, the latter stuck to him until he could not stick to him any longer-until his constituents told him to get out. He not only stuck to the Prime Minister, but stuck to him silently.",60

493,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Ver y well, we shall close that incident. I am very much afraid that we cannot close the other in cident in quite the same way, though I wish we could.

I think that, at least, ought to be said. I do not know, but my honourable friends in the Corner seem to be "" crowing "" over this thing. They evidently deem themselves to have achieved a great triumph. L et it be understood , that those honourable gentlemen, when the Empire is at war, would precipitate a crisis, and endanger the whole Government of the country, on a question ,of whether Supply shall be granted for two or for three months. , It is another in stance of the way in which they set their own party advantage above all the great issues that are being decided in this war. I wish to enter my protest against the way in which it has been done; and at the same time.

Now, he said what was not a fact, namely, that I stuck to the Prime M in ister, and never said a word about a vital question before the country. Part of that is true. I stuck to the Prime Minister long as I could, for the reason that wished to prevent a split in the Labour party-that was one reason-and because of my horror of conscription. Honourable members wil l recollect that when I saw the tide turning, as it was turning during the last week of the campaign in favour of "" Yes,"" because of the dirty nature of the campaign, and the malicious and vile things that were being said, I announced to the public that if conscription were carried I would have to leave the Goin vernment, because I did not believe i the policy, and would not remain a ber of the Administration which had to frame the law.",61

I have to deal with circumstances as they exist. I have, already received.dozens of telegrams from various parts of the country, on behalf of public servants and others who look to the public Treasury for their salaries and means of livelihood, pointing out that those salaries have not been paid. The Government had to choose between making provision for the payment of the salaries, or, in the midst of the gravest crisis that has ever convulsed the civilized world, engaging in a political or constitutional struggle over On 7th the powers of the two Houses.

514,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Hunter) [9.17] From the point of view of equity, I think the Treasurer should accept the amendment. The Bill , as drafted, is not equitable in the burden it proposes to place upon the people who will be required to pay this tax.  than the previous Bill .",62
515,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I cannot be I am charged with having favoured the previous Bill , because I have always advocated that there should be one tax only, namely, a tax on incomes. If the Treasurer's proposal is adopted, picture shows in the capital cities and other large centres of the Commonwealth will escape this taxation entirely, because the people who attend those shows and pay 3d. will not be affected by the Bill . But in the country the minimum charge for probably an inferior show is 6d. The people who have to pay that 6d. are of the same class as those who pay 3d. in the city, but because of the advantages which the latter enjoy, they are to be-immune from paying any contribution towards the prosecution of the war so far as this tax is concerned, whilst the country people, who are called upon to bear the lion's share of every burden, must pay a tax of Ad. on every 6d. ticket. It is useless to say that the tax will be paid by the picture show proprietors. We know that those shows will require to increase their charges.",62
516,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,O r reduce their staffs.,62
517,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The shows are run with minimum staffs, which cannot possibly be reduced. In effect, the people in the country are to be, asked to pay 7d. to see an inferior picture show, whilst those living in the city may see a show of the very best class for 3d. As a matter of equity, is a tax of this kind right? If revenue is to be raised for war purposes by the taxation of the poorer classes the taxation should be at least equitably distributed. Country people are at work on their farms from Monday t ill Saturday night, and their only pleasure is a picture show on Saturday night. They are to be taxed, whilst people with daily access to entertainments at a cheaper iprice are to escape taxation. Again, if three State Parliaments are levying taxes on entertainments, is it fair that the people who live in those States should have to bear duplicate taxation. This means that people in certain States of Australia will be required to pay double the tax that is imposed on the people of other States.  of the Bill .",62
518,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,No . But there is a fault in the Bill when it proposes to tax country people and allow the city people to escape.  member desire me to restore the tax on 3d. tickets?,62
519,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"No ; I do not approve at all of the tax on the cheaper tickets. Most of the shows that are charging 6d. in country districts are barely able to pay their way, but they struggle along in the hope that times will improve. It has been urged that this tax will be unfair in regard to sporting clubs. Cricket is a national game, which I am sorry to say is gradually dying out. It should be fostered, but today attendances at cricket matches are so small that if 6d. is charged at the gates the clubs are not able to get sufficient revenue to pay a caretaker.' Ye t the clubs are to he asked to pay an additional penny. The effect will be, not to encourage the national game, but to help to extinguish it . Recreation should not be taxed on the 6d. charge for .admission. There may be some justification for a tax on the higher charges. People who can afford to pay from 3s. to 10s. 6d. for an evening's entertainment can probably bear a little more taxation than the Treasurer has proposed.",63
520,Mr TUDOR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The cricket clubs charge a guinea for a season's ticket, and they will be required to pay taxation on that revenue.",63
521,Mr CHARLTON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Revenu e from that source should not be taxed at all, because most of the persons who buy season tickets do so as a form of donation to a particular sport. In view of ""the fact that only about £100,000 is involved, the Treasurer would do well to consider whether he cannot remove the tax from the cheaper tickets, and perhaps by increasing the rates on the higher-priced tickets he will get more money from people who are well able to pay it , and not inflict any injustice on the country population.  cannot support the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to the full extent of his amendment, but I am anxious to place the country citizen on the same basis as the city citizen. As the Treasurer has already decided that the 3d. ticket shall be exempt from taxation,"" and in view of the fact that there are no 3d. picture shows in the country, I desire that some consideration shall be extended to those who do not enjoy nearly such great conveniences and opportunities as do the townhonorable folk. Picture shows are practically the only amusements available to country people, and the lowest charge for them is 6d.",63
522,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"The 3d. shows in the city are the continuous pictures. For the evening entertainments the charges are higher.  the country there is no hope of seeing a picture show for 3d. The consequence is that we find in the cities persons who take advantage of 3d. shows. The Bill creates an invidious distinction between city people and country people. It is a further discouragement to settlement in the country districts, and greater encouragement to flocking to the cities which we so much deplore. So far as football and cricket matches are concerned, I give way to no man in saying that this sort of sport should be encouraged; but I do not think that the taxation of those who pay to look on at these games is going to have a very bad effect bn them as sports. I urge the Treasurer to consider the position from the point of view of the man in the country. He expects to derive £100,000 from the tax on the 6d. tickets. I beg leave to differ from him, if he is looking to the picture shows for the whole of this £100,000.  is not taking into consideration the fact that, if the tax on the 6d. ticket is removed, the whole of the revenue to be derived from the half rates on the Is. shows will be lost.  me to the conclusion that the 6d. rate is paid by 6,000,000 people in Australia once in each year. That is information supplied to me by the people who are running picture shows.",63

The truth may lie somewhere between the two sets of figures; but my information, which comes from those who are running the shows, leads me to anticipate that the revenue derivable from who pay 6d. to visit picture shows w be £12,500 per annum, on the basis of it 6,000,000 halfpennies. I am prepared to believe that the people who have supplied me with these figures are not likely overstate the case. I do not think would w i l full y understate it to any extent. I can only believe that the surer's figures do not apply picture shows, and that he expects to get some revenue from other 6d. sources. am sorry that I cannot go as far as honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who seeks to exempt all amusements that charge 6d. In order not to embarrass the Treasurer, I . cannot go as far honourable member would like to go; but, statement. in justice to country people, I wish to limit the operation of the exemption that draw it . he proposes to picture shows, thus putting the man in the country on a parity with the city man, whose lowest price has exempted by the Treasurer. quently, I propose to add to the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports-if we reach that pointthe words "" This exemption applies only to picture shows.""",63

I can afford to pay any price that is put on as the result of this taxation; but five years ago, before I came to this House, when I was working for 8s. 6d. per day, as the biggest section of our community are doing today, I could not afford to pay it .",64

On the other, hand , 1 there are many who would like to go to these places, but are too mean to do so, and would even deny their wives and children the pleasure of going to them, because it might cost them a couple of shillings. That is one of my principal objections to this form of taxation. It is class taxation. It is taxing a section of the the community who believe in having in some form of social enjoyment. The Government would have done far better if pity they had devised some other method of raising revenue. We are told that the But I satisfied that it cannot be imposed without bringing about an alteration in some direction or other. It may be used as justification for about a reduction in the cost of production, either in the shape of cheaper film3 or in the shape of putting on pooreT a dramas. If a reduction is not brought about in this way, some method will be devised of curtailing expenses by dispensing - with the services of a number of hands engaged either before the curtain, or in the orchestra, or on the stage. There are methods by which those who are conducting tlieir businesses may attempt to carry on, and at the same time make a reasonable profit. In another way, so far as the drama is concerned, the play may be staged in such a way as not to be up to the standard which we expect in dramas and musical comedies. It can be said to the credit of our theatrical managers that whether i the comedy, musical comedy, or drama, the standard of entertainment produced hy them is not surpassed in any other part of the world. The prices charged for admission also .compare favourably with those prevailing in the Old ""World. visitors to Great .Britain have assured me that, on the average, the prices charged for admission to theatres in Australia are lower than those which have to be paid there. It may be that an honourable member can point to a, particular firm which, in his opinion, is making exorbitant profits, but even if that be so, it is no justi- ference. fication for the imposition of a tax of this kind upon theatrical and picture-show proprietors generally. This tax may mean absolute ruination to their business concerns. ""We have other means of reaching any firm that is making exorbitant profits.",64

To-day he has a large foundry in Melbourne, and also a foundry in Perth and Queensland. Would the honourable member impose upon that man a special form of taxation because of the extension of his assets?",65

Employers may be ulti-; mately compelled .to retrench. And what took place under the old system of retrenchment? The first to go out were the employees. Their wages were first of all reduced. If that were not found sufiicient, the next step was to reduce the cost of the article being produced, either by making it of inferior material or in some other way. That would be the system followed in all classes of business including the theatrical profession.

It is perfectly obvious that in the altered circumstances it will be utterly impossible for members of Parliament to accept positions as chairmen of the recruiting committees in their various electorates, and it will be sary for the Government to other arrangement by means of which these offices may be filled. For my part, I had already arranged to go to my constituency with a view to getting the - organization together. That would have f.o.b. occupied me during the best part of Janulike. ary. A f t e r that, I had hoped that I would he able to devote five or , and to the furtherance of the campaign. But in the circumstances with which I am now faced I shall be obliged to leave my electorate in the last week of January, and it will be impossible for me to do BILL. what I had contemplated, because I would have no sooner, completed the arrangefor ments than I would have to hand them over to somebody else. It will be far better, therefore, that other persons should and take control of the movement from its in ception. As honourable members in the corner, together with their associates in the Senate, have prevented us from doing our part in this campaign, it will be better for the Government to reconsider the for scheme with a view to making other ar",71
578,Mr SINCLAIR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Moreton) [10.57] Last week I asked the Prime Minister if the Commissioners for price fixing in the various States had been authorized to fix the prices for - exportable produce which is sold f.o.b. The right honourable gentleman told me that he would look into the matter and let me have a reply at the earliest possible date. I repeated my question this morning, and was again assured that he would look into the matter. I replied, by way of an interADJOURNMENT. jection, that he had told me that he would do that a week ago. In to-night's Herald notice that I am reported as having in terjected that the Prices Commissioner in this State had promised me that he was going to do that. I based my question OD a statement by Mr Ackaman, the New South Wales Commissioner, who was reported to have said that he would see that no f.o.b. sales were made above the New I wish to askSouth Wales parity.",71
579,Mr HUGHES,COMPULSORY SERVICE,Has the honourable memthe ber any particular commodity in his,71
580,Mr SINCLAIR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I have any exportthis able produce in my mind, such as butter or cheese, the price of which is not fixed. The price of wheat and wool have already necesbeen fixed under arrangement with the arrive at some Imperial Government.",71
581,Mr HUGHES,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The honourable member's own criticism is directed to c.i.f. sales.,71
582,Mr SINCLAIR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"No . it is directed to sales principally, but ' c . i . f . , if you",71
583,Mr HUGHES,COMPULSORY SERVICE,What commodity is sold six weeks f.o.b. besides wheat and meat?,71
584,Mr SINCLAIR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"But t e r , bacon, and cheese. . Mr HUGHES - Who are the buyers'?",72
585,Mr SINCLAIR,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"T l i e London agents. I wish to remove the impression that the Victorian Prices Commissioner told me within the past week that he was looking into, this matter. I have no desire to be accused of stating what is untrue. It was the Prime Minister who promised to look into the matter, and apparently he has not done so. I hope, however, that he will do so, and that he will see that no restrictions are placed on the surplus produce which we are allowed to ship abroad, and that we are able to get the world's parity for such surplus.",72
586,Mr SAMPSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Wimmera) [11.1] - I wish to emphasize the situation put by the honourable member for Richmond, and to ask the Prime Minister to reconsider the necessity for some revision of the recruiting scheme. In the wheat-growing areas of Victoria it will be impossible to start that scheme u n t i l early in February. It is a late season in nearly all the wheat areas of Australia, and it would be useless to attempt to organize within those districts with a view to getting recruits earlier than the first or second week in February. As this - Parliament is to be called togetherearly in February, it will be impossible for. honourable members to take that part in the recruiting campaign which they had contemplated owing to the action of those who desire to k ill recruiting in Victoria.",72
587,Mr HAMPSON,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Bendigo) [11.3] - In view of the complaints which have just been made, it is well that the country should clearly understand that what has happened in this Parliament will not prevent honourable members from participating in the recruiting campaign. The Prime Minister stated that that campaign would start on the 2nd January, and Supply has been granted to 1st c February. We have heard a lot of talk about men who are prepared to make great sacrifices, about a crisis in the history of the nation, and yet, as soon as these men have an opportunity of devoting five weeks to recruiting they immediately endeavour to throw the onus for their , neglect upon the party to which I belong. This circumstance only serves to show the hollowness of their plea. taken in another place was intended to prevent the government of the country being conducted by means of regulations. The excuse that honourable members will be prevented fro m undertaking a recruiting campaign is so much fudge.",72
588,Mr GROOM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Darling Downs) [11.5]. - The honourable member for Bendigo has done an injustice to honourable members whoprotested this evening. They never said that they would not undertake recruiting. What they did say, and it is true, was that the action that hasobeen taken must .make it much more difficult for Federal members to devote the whole of their time and energy for a proper period to the work of recruiting.",72
589,Mr BUBCHELL,COMPULSORY SERVICE,To act as chairmen of committees ?,72
590,Mr GROOM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Yes . There are some of us who are on a central committee as well as a local committee. Having to come down to Melbourne in the first week in February, it will be much more difficult for many members of this Parliament to carry out this work of recruiting. It is all very well for the honourable member for Bendigo to speak as he has done, or for any honourable member . representing what might be called a pocket-handkerchief State SO' far as area is concerned. It is possible to cover Victoria in a few days because of the concentration of the population. It is quite a different matter to deal with such States as Western Australia and Queensland. It takes as much time to cover one electorate as it would take to cover the whole of the State of Victoria. What chance has Mr Speaker in the four weeks at his disposal to go, as I am sure he desires to do, throughout his constituency in connection with the recruiting movement ? It should 'be borne in mind also that in Queensland we have a wet season during January and February, and after an itinerary has been prepared three weeks ahead, an honourable member may be blocked in that State by the .wet season. I believe that honourable members on both sides during the short period that will now be at their disposal, will do the best they can to make the recruiting scheme a success. I ' rose chiefly to protest against the gross injustice of the imputation of the honorThe action able member for Bendigo. I wish to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to one important matter. I asked him this morning if he would bring under the notice of the State Premiers the necessity for something being done in view of the decision of the High Court with respect to Inter-State trade. I have here several letters from pastoralists, agents, and others, pointing out the severe hardship imposed upon them in Queensland owing to the action of the State Government in putting an embargo upon the removal of stocks from that State. There is not the .slightest doubt thab the effect of the embargo has been to increase the cost of living in other States, whilsb ab the same time doing a rank injustice to growers and producers in Queensland. One gentleman writes in this way on the subjectIn common with other agents on the Queensland and New South Wales borders, our trade is absolutely at a standstill, and it will ultimately mean that a great number will be out of employment unless the Federal Government takes steps to remove the injustice. It is not only unjust to traders, buti t is alsounjust to. the public in other States, who are being compelled to pay high prices for their meat through the Queensland Government prohibiting the export of stock from' Queensland into other States. We are quite aware that whilst the war' is ou a great amount of legislation must remain in abeyance, but surely the living of the people in the States must be attended to, and if business people are to pay heavy income tax, and war tax, &c, they must be given an opportunity to do business, otherwise not only will the traders themselves suffer, but ultimately the various Governments. ' As the Prime Minister pointed out very properly this morning, the decision of the High Court has practically enabled the State Governments to set aside the provisions of the Constitution. The prohibition against individuals remains still as strong as ever,. and the decision of the High Court thab State Governments have the power of acquisition for public purposes is a proper distinction, because the Stabe Governments are sovereign bodies, and they must have the power bo acquire goods for Governmenb purposes. not the use, bub abuse, of the power thab people are complaining of.",72
591,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMPULSORY SERVICE,The Queensland stock embargo has doubled the price of meab in Soubh Australia.,73
592,Mr GROOM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I quibe believe that. Ib is really operating as a sorb of exporb tax. As regards cabbie, the Government are charging 10s. per head for every beasb that is baken across bheQueensland Border inbo Soubh Australia. In that way they are levying, in . effect, Inter-State Customs duties. Ib is the same wibh sheep passing from Queensland into New South Wales. The fact is that the Government, exercising governmental capacity, are doing something which p r i vate citizens would not be allowed to do.",73
593,Mr HUGHES,COMPULSORY SERVICE,What can be done?,73
594,Mr GROOM,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"Late r on, I shall suggest something to the Prime Minister. I have been asked whether the .Commonwealth Government are taking any steps to take over the control of meat for I m perial purposes. At the present time, the Queensland Government are securing meat for Imperial purposes under an I m perial Act. When asked whether the -.Federal Government contemplate doing the same thing, I have replied to telegrams I have received that, so - far, I know of no such intention on the part of the Federal Government. I am a f r a i d that the Premiers' Conference has concluded ; but I would ask the Prime Minister to make some representations to the Queensland Government on the subject. So far as they are honestly and legitimately acquiring meat for Imperial purposes, no one in Australia can take exception to their action. But where these powers are being exercised, not for that purpose, hut for local purposes of one kind and another, that is neither fair nor legitimate in the interests of Australia as a whole. That is the aspect of the matter that needs inquiry. I do not expect the Prime Miniater to be able to give me an answer bo my question at once; but I ask him to take the matter into careful consideration, and see whether some communication cannot be made to the Queensland Government, with a view to securing justice for all persons engaged in legitimate trade between Queensland and New South Wales, without doing anything that would be detrimental to the Ib is supply of meat for Imperial purposes.",73
595,Mr BURNS,COMPULSORY SERVICE,"I l l a w a r r a ) [11.14] - I wish to ask. the Prime Minister a ques1 tion. I desire to know how many men are still in gaol for not reporting themselves under the proclamation calling up men for m i l it a ry service. Question resolved in the affirmative. , House adjourned at 11.15 p.m.",73
