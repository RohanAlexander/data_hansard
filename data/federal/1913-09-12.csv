3,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I wish to know from the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs if he is yet in a position to inform the House when trucks are likely to be available to allow plate-laying to proceed at the Kalgoorlie end of the Transcontinental railway!,12
4,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member will place the question on the notice paper, I shall, I hope, be able to give him a definite reply on Tuesday. Trucks are now coming forward, and a sufficient number have been shipped to Port Augusta to enable the plate-laying to be started shortly at that end. They are to come forward at the rate of three a week, and if the supply is kept up ib should enable us to collect enough waggons within a fortnight or three weeks to start plate laying at the Kalgoorlie end. PERSONAL EXPLANATION . AUDITOR-GENERAL'S KEPORT.",12
5,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I wish to make a personal explanation. Last night I attributed a certain statement to the Prime Minister. As I have the Hansard proof of the discussion, I will read exactly what took place.",12
6,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I will tell the Treasurer. The Prime Minister has attended different meetings in the country, and has told his hearers that the public accounts have not been properly audited.",12
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I never said any such thing in my life.,12
8,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then the honourable gentleman must fight the matter out with his organ, the Argus.",12
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Indeed , I will not. The statement does not appear in the organ either. The honourable member twists everything.",13
10,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have not the statement here,13
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And the honourable member cannot find it, either. Later, the honourable member for Gwydir referred to the same subject. He said, speaking of the P r i m e Minister The honourable gentleman tried to make the honourable member for Kennedy appear to be something other than he really is, and quoted from the report of the Auditor-General, but he did not touch the charge levelled against him, that he has publicly stated that there has been no proper audit of public accounts.",13
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have repeatedly denied that I said that, and I ask whether an honorauie member must not, under the rules of debate, accept the denial, and cease from repeating the statement? What led me to make my statement was the report in the Melbourne Argus of a speech delivered by the Prime Minister at Seymour on the 3rd May last. headed - MR. COOK AT SEYMOUR. FEDERAL FINANCE. REPLY TO MR . FISHER. In it the P r i m e Minister was m saySince Mr Fisher had been in power the Auditor-General had complained that he could obtain the Treasurer's accounts in time for audit to be of any real value. That meant since Mr Fisher had come into power, there an expert report on the question. had not been any proper national audit of the national accounts. . I leave it to the Prime Minister to explain that away.",13
13,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The quotation has nailed site? down the charge all right.,13
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is no nailing down. I say that my statement was correct; that I have never said that there was no proper audit by the Auditorwe General. To say that would be to respent. flect, nob on the honourable member for Wide Bay, but on the Auditor-General.",13
15,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is my combeen plaint. Mr JOSE PH COOK - What I have said I say again now. It is this, that during the last three years the Auditorunfair General's report has been laid on the table of the House at a time when it has been absolutely valueless for purposes of cussion.",13
16,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,That has happened on every occasion. [44]- 2 SMALL - P OX OUTBREAK .,13
17,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In view of the grave danger caused by the small-pox epidemic in Sydney and its treatment, I ask the Prime Minister if he will give the honourable member for Gwydir a day on which to discuss his very important motion dealing with the subject ?",13
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I recognise the great importance of the motion, but the Goverument at present is unable to afford any honourable member a day for anything at all. NAVAL BASES. COCKBURN SOUND AND WESTER N PORT.",13
19,Mr FRAZEB,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is the Prime Minister in a position to inform the House when the report on the different sites suggested for the shore necessities of the naval base at Cockburn Sound is likely to be presented to the House? When will the It was Government be able to say what site will be adopted for shore purposes?,13
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not quite f o l low the question.,13
21,Mr FRAZEB,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Nearl y all the men a d j to engaged on shore work at Cockburn Sound have been dismissed, but some provision must be made on shore for a dockyard. never There is at present a dispute as to the his site which should be selected. The Prime that Minister has stated that he would obtain In the meantime, work on the site chosen by the ex-Minister of Defence has been stopped. Is work to be resumed on that site, or is it proposed to choose another",13
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A huge amount of money will have to be spent at Cockburn Sound in the development of the naval base there; I suppose that before are finished millions will have been This Government is of the opinion that the suggestion of the Naval Boardnot the suggestion of the Treasurer as has most unfairly stated by the ex-Minister of Defence-is a proper one: that expert opinion should be obtained before the huge outlay is begun. While on my feet, I wish to say that a more unjust and statement than that contained in the telegram sent yesterday to Western Australia by the ex-Minister of Defence dishas not been made. It introduced party politics with a vengeance into the consideration of defence matters. Honourable gentlemen opposite are always asking that defence matters be kept high above party politics, but every day they try to make party capital out of them.",13
23,Mr TUDOH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is this*an answer to the question 1,14

25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I wish to say to my friends opposite that if this is the treatment I am to receive when I rise to answer questions, I shall nob answer auy more, good or bad. I am not here to be baited aud bullied as lionorable members have been baiting and bullying me lately. I say plainly that if honourable members opposite do not behave better they will get no answers from me, good or bad. Several honourable members ing,",14
26,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Day after day this sort of thing happens at the beginning' of the sitting. I repeatedly call for order, and immediately afterwards a number of honourable members interject. This conduct is nob in keeping with the dignity of Parliament. We must maintain the Standing Orders if we are to do any business and keep our proceedings decorous and dignified.",14
27,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should like to know from the Prime Minister whether the work at Western Port naval base is proceeding at the same rate as it was prior to the present Government coming into power; and, if so, when the honourable gentleman anticipates the place will be ready to receive some of the large vessels that are coming here ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I am not able to answer a question like that now. If the honourable member will put the question on paper, I shall be glad to get him the information. The bases everywhere are developing as rapidly as possible, consistently with economy and efficiency.",14
28,Mr FBAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"When the Prime M in ister was asked when he was likely to be in possession of this expert information he replied that the Government were acting on the advice of the Naval Board, which was in the direction of obtaining the best expert opinion before proceeding with the work. That is hardly an answer to my question as to whether the Prime Minister can mention an approximate date when the information will be obThe tained and the work proceeded with .",14
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not able to say. I am sure that the honourable member, on reflection, will see that the question is not a reasonable one. How can we tell ? How could an expert himself tell u n t i l he has inquired ?",14
30,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is the expert at work yet?,14
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He is not here, or he would be at work; we have not got him yet.",14
32,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is it intended to import an expert?,14
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes ; that is the intention-the best expert available anywhere.,14

The expert is not yeb appointed. We are endeavouring to find an expert, and the moment we can give the information to honourable members we shall d'o so. I hope it will be soon. PRIMEMINISTER ' S SPEEC HA T DANDENONG.",14
35,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At a meeting at Dandenong the other night the Prime Minister said that, owing to the late period at which the resignation of the late Government was handed in , the present Government had been compelled to make certain financial arrangements.",14
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I did not say any such thing.,14
37,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have not the exact words of the Prime Minister before me, but they had reference to the payment of the wages of the public servants, and he said he would have to introduce an indemnity Bill to cover, I presume, the expenditure then made under that head. I should like to know from the honourable gentleman whether it is necessary to introduce such a Bill , aud what is the nature of it?",14

58,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable ber is expressing his own opinion. I am not prepared to express any opinion on that point.

The result is that the scheme has failed owing to the action of honourable members themselves in not allowing it to be properly worked.

One of two things must be Either the Bill should refer to the previous June twelve months, or it should that provide that the amount spent in July shall not be more than one-twelfth of the expenditure covered by the Appropriation Acb.

In the of June, obviously, more money is expended than in any other month of the year, because a large number of accounts are paid in June which are not paid in e l l any other month. The Treasurer sends out an intimation that all the accounts that havefcobe paid during the financial year must be paid before the end of June. He is naturally anxious that that should be done in order that on the 1st of .July he may be i u a position to send a ll the statements .to the Auditor-General. Coni n June more money will be expended than in any other month. If , therefore, we specify that the amount paid in July shall not be greater than the expenditure in the previous June twelve months, we have no more control over the expenditure than to the extent of the expenditure of the month of the the year when the largest amount of money is paid out of the Treasury. Suppose, instance, that we provided in this Bill that this condition should apply to previous June twelve months. larger amount of money .could, spend uuder that provision, be spent by ' the than it is the intention of Parand liament to grant. Personally, however, give I do not think there is much in that point, because I do not tliink that any Government would be anxious to spend in the month of July more money than is usually spent per month.",19
116,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Bill as it stands would enable a Government to keep Parliament shut for four or five months.,20
117,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,No ; it would only allow a Government to keep Parliament shut during the month of July.,20
118,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not at all. As long as they had supplies they could keep Parliament shut.,20
119,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If we could provide in this Bill that only expenditure to the extent of one-twelfth of the amount covered by the previous Appropriation Act could be incurred without Parliamentary sanction, that, I think, would meet the wishes of the honourable member for West Sydney.

Honourable members upon this side of the chamber will have great difficulties offering a suggestion of any description if he continues to display such heat, and fco lose himself in his well worked-up in - bad idea. dignation. The first provisions of this Bill are designed only to convenience the Treasury. It has never been suggested, even by the Ministry, that the Treasurer should be given a blank cheque for the month of July in any year. The measure is intended fco prevent our public officials in particular from being subjected to inconvenience, and for that reason-if be inconvenient to call Parliament tofor gether during the first week in July-i seeks to empower the Treasury to meet the ordinary current expenditure. There is no desire, I am sure, upon either side of the House that, under fchis Bill , Government should be given a blank cheque for the month of July. suggest that the Treasurer wishes to take undue advantage of the power which he will enjoy if the clause be passed in its present form. But we know that opinions of Treasurers change. ferent Governments may occupy the Treacalled sury bench. I have a vivid recollecister tion of the action of certain State vernments a month or two before this Parliament was inaugurated. Parliaments, to their everlasting disgrace, did something in a financial directhat statement? tion in the belief fchafc they were imposing penalties on this Parliament, when, as a matter of fact, they were only i flicting in j u r y on themselves. we have instances of Governments in tlieir dying moments having been guilty of political immorality of the deepest dye. The question therefore arises as to whether we are justified in giving to any Treasurer - not necessarily to the right honorhonorable gentleman who now fills that ofiice-r a blank cheque for the month of July in any year, even though a general election may not have taken place, so I that he may spend whatever he pleases. That is what the Bill amounts to. Ifc is also intended to overcome a difficulty which presents itself in the J u l y followThat difficulty arises because our Electoral Act provides that new senators cannot take their seats until the 1st July following their election. n these circumstances, there is no justihas fication for giving a blank cheque.",21

If they summon Parliament to meet during the first ten days of July they know perfectly well the that they can get a Supply Bill passed through this House in a couple of hours I do not at the very most, unless they have beeu guilty of some flagrant act which justifies special criticism. The necessity for the Bill arises from the fact that Parliament the was not called together this year before Dif - the 9th July, although it might hcve been together earlier. The Prime M in himself practically voiced that Goopinion when he said that the Government had had to resort to some strataThose gem to pay the public salaries.",21
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,What is wrong with,21
140,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Simpl y that the Government did not have to resort to a n - stratagem. Apparently the fact that the Similarly, statement is not correct does not present itself to the Prime Minister. No stratagem was resorted to. We had the definitestatement from the Treasurer yesterday.",21
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The member is doing it very well.,22
142,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We had from the Treasurer yesterday a statement , that neither he nor the Department had resorted 'to the stratagem that the Prime Ministjer said they had resorted to. Every day we find Ministers differing diametrically in their statements. The Bill , as it stands, will permit the Treasurer of the day to spend in the month of July an amount equal to that which was spent during the previous June. Now it may happen that the ordinary circumstance's of government have justified an excessive expenditure in June. This may arise from the desire of the Ministry to clear up the accounts before the close of the financial year. That, however, is not the practice of the State Governments. They frequently say, in regard to many accounts, "" Q h ! let them stand over t ill next year."" It depends entirely upon the state of their balance-sheet. We may congratulate ourselves that thab is not the practice with Commonwealth Governments. They are accustomed to sending oufc special requests with a view to expediting the payment of all accounts due before 'the close of the financial year. The ordinary circumstances of government justify an excessive expenditure in the month of June. But that is no reason why in July, and without knowledge of Parliament,' without any supervision and criticism, the Treasurer should be given a blank cheque to do in that month what it was. essential and proper to do in June.",22
143,Sir JQHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Tlia t is included in the amendment as it is now, so that it is of no use for the honourable member to talk about it. The amount is now limited to a twelfth of the aggregate appropriations for the previous year.",22
144,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Treasurer now proposes his amendment as follows: And the expenditure shall be in accordance with the Appropriation Act for the previous year, and the aggregate amount to be expended shall not exceed one-twelfth of the total amount of the appropriations for the previous year.",22

147,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It ought to be put the Committee. You have no right to move an amendment. honourable Mr ROBERTS - There is another feature which presents itself to me as - being foreign to the real intention of the Bill . Again it must be emphasized that the real intention is to tide over a temporary difficulty in the early part of July, and to provide i u particular that public salaries shall not be in any way interfered with ; but under this provision we find that the Treasurer can indulge in expenditure of au aggregate character. The use of the word "" aggregate "" will permit of a manijjulafcioii of the expenditure. Ifc will permit, for instance, of the raising of salaries, and that ought uot to be permitted without a criticism on the Estimates.",22
148,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is it not compulsory thab salaries can only be raised by Parliamentary vote?,22
149,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Not here. In ordinary circumstances increases of salaries are detailed in the Estimates, and honourable members know precisely what is going on, but the inclusion' of the word ""aggregate"" in the amendment-and it is not proposed at present to cub it outwill mean that i u ""July the Treasurer, if he so desired, could increase salaries in various directions, and once they had been increased, it would be a very difficult matter for honourable members to fairl y criticise them or to have any check upon what he was doing. The amendment will permit of the transposition of sums from one heading to another headiug. Sums might have been voted in the Appropriation Ac.fc of the previous year for a specific purpose and not expended for that purpose. The amendment will permit of the Treasurer, in July, when there would be no criti cism, of taking a nun from under one heading and expending it under another heading quite without the knowledge of Parliament. I do n'ot think-quite apart, from party politics- that that is the in tention or even the desire. The object of the Bill is fco tide over a temporary, difficulty which might possibly arise after an election. We ought not in the circumstances to give any Treasurer such a wide the power. Ifc might be the good fortune of some honourable member on this side to be occupying the Treasury bench in the course of a year, or two years, or five, years. This measure will be on the to. statute-book for all time, and whoever is Treasurer may be able to' take advantage of this provision:.",22
150,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,How could you provide against it ?,23
151,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"So far as this point is concerned, by deleting the word "" aggregate."" Although it will not be specific, clearly the intention of the whole amendment will be that the expenditure i u July should be strictly in accordance with the appropriations for the previous year under their several headings.",23
152,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Suppos e that they vary during the twelve mouths, what then?",23
153,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,". 1 know that the expenditure varies. Some votes are not expended; other votes are exceeded in various directions. That is permitted regularly; it is an acknowledged thing. But we do not want to specifically give the Treasurer power to do things of that description i u July, when we have no control over hirn. I will give an instance. It might be that a Government was defeated afc a general election. The standard of honour in Governments differs. Indeed, the circumstances in their opinion might really justify them in retaining their positions, eveu though defeated at the polls. Notwithstanding that defeat, under this Bill they would have the power to manipulate- I do not use the word offensively-the expenditure during July. They would have the power to increase salaries quite out of proportion.",23
154,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,You are the Bill?,23
155,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,No .,23
156,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If not, my provision will meefc the case.",23
157,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Treasurer ought not to make these assertions. Because I desire the Bill to be in what I conscientiously believe to be a reasonable form is no justification for him saying that I am agaiusb ib. There is a difference between giving the Treasurer liberty to do a thing and giving him licence to do a thing. It is possible, I say, that a Government might be defeated ab the polls. Ministers might retain their positions, as they would have the power to do, and under this Bill indulge in an increase of salaries, of whioh perhaps their successors might not approve. They might indulge in a form of expenditure which would not be acceptable to their successors, but which nevertheless they would be committed to by a defeated Government. Let us retaiu the measure, as was the original in tention. Let us put it in such a form as that any ordinary inconvenience because of the inability to spend one penny in July shall be met, so that the Treasurer, whoever he might be, could tide over the inconvenience. But do not let us, i u this apparently simple measure, give a defeated Government the power to expend money. Do not let us give any Government the power to do what they like with the finances of the country for four to six weeks without the slightest control by Parliament, and to do things with which it might subsequently disagree, but which it would have to condone or permit. _ Mr ARCHIBALD - Mr Chairman",23

164,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Hindmarsh) [11.49] - There is a phase of this question which I think is lost sight of by the Committee. I want to make a strong appeal to honourable members on the other side, because the view I am about to put is not a party one. The position, V take it, is that under the amendment any Goverument would be entitled to tide over the financial requirements of the Commonwealth during J u l y . There is no difference of opinion, I think, on the absolute necessity of an arrangement character being made in order to tide over the requirements of the Commonwealth during the month of July lowing a general election. That, I take it, is the reason why ""this Bill is introduced. I suggest the desirability of confining the provision to years in which a general election is held. I hope that the Treasurer will not think that in making this suggestion I reflect on him, or on the Government with which he is associated. I am sure that he would act as honourably and straightforwardly as any Treasurer that we have had, or are likely to have, and no offence is intended. what may happen if we allow the provision to apply to every year? not, in effect, mean the deferring of the meeting of Parliament until I think it is not desirable to pass a law practically saying that Parliament not meet until August. There may be a great deal to be said, in of the proposal in relation dinary circumstances, but we have in power a which should be brought to book as early as possible. Such a might advise the Governor General prorogue Parliament in November, if it could put off the calling of Parliament again until would be free of control for eight months. Is that desirable? We should be careful not to fetter our successors. told that a future Parliament it chose, repeal the Act. That is so, but while we have the right to legislate to meet the requirements of the day, we ought not to fetter our successors. I see the need for a provision of this kind, so far as the July following a general election is concerned, but, as to other any difficulties could be provided for beforehand. For instance, two months' Supply was granted in advance for the financial year 1911-12, because it was known that Ministers and members would not be able to return from England the Coronation proceedings until late in the year, and it was thought not to inconvenience the Treasury by the late assembling of Parliament would be necessary. We hope that it may be many years before another Coronation takes place. Exigencies of State may require the presence of in Loudon, or other circumstances make it impossible to call Parliament toiler. Archibald. of this gether t ill late in the year. But these things w i ll be known of in advance, and provision should be made in respect to fol- them. Our present duty is to preserve the absolute freedom of honourable members in the criticism and control of finance, and we should not give up any of our powers. I understand that the Treasurer thinks that the provision would be useless if it were made to apply only to the July following a general election, but I should like to hear his reasons for that opinion. I do uot say that the provision would be abused by fchis Government, and it would not have But been abused by the last Government, but it might be abused by some future GoWill it vernment. Party feeling now runs high, and may run yet liigher in the future, August? because parties are so evenly balanced, and the issues between them are of such shall vital importance. This makes it desirable that we should not give by favour Statute the power to defer the meeting to or- of Parliament u n t i l August in each year. might A six mouths' recess is, in my opinion, Government ample, and, in many cases, too much. Parliament is the mouthpiece of the Government people, or, as Sir George Reid has said, to the whispering gallery of the Commonand wealth. Here every grievance can be together voiced, and Ministers can be challenged August it on their every act. Possibly Governments do not like that, and the front Opposition bench may not always feel it I may be convenient, but members generally should could, if see that our powers of criticism are uot curtailed. I do not think that it is necessary to make provision for the Julys following penal dissolutions and elections.",23
165,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Capricornia) [12.0] There are one or two aspects of the case to which I should like to draw particular Julys, abtention. When we on this side offer any opinions about a clause, the Prime Minister charges us with obstruction; but what is happening now is a proof that the criticism oh this side is of a beneficial character. We have reason to complain after of the Prime Minister and other members of the Government going to Dandenongj desirable Kyneton, and throughout the Commonwealth, addressing luncheon parties which and assemblies for banquets, and thus wasting valuable time which ought to be given to the consideration of the proposals they submit to this Ministers Chamber. The Treasurer, when he in may troduced this measure the other day said, "" We are not troubled about the matter; there is the Bill , and if you do not care to pass it you need not."" That, if the honourable gentleman wili allow me to say so, was a pretence.",24
166,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I did not say it .,25
167,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the gentleman wish me to hunt up,25

169,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am sure it will be remembered that the honourable gentleman said, "" Well, there is the Bill , and the Government are not particular about it , "" and he wished us to pass it that day without discussion. Because we did not pass it i u one day the Prime Minister goes throughout the country talking about obstruction on the part of the Opposition. A f t e r the discussion that took place, however, the Government have brought down an amendment. I do not know who is responsible, but that amendment is very badly constructed, and, as the ex-Attorney-General has said, is not at all clear. We are unable to say whether the words "" June preceding "" mean June in the year when this Act is to be operative, or the previous June mentioned in the first line of the proposed amendment. Although the Treasurer declared the amendment to be perfectly clear, he realized, after hearing speakers on this side, that it was badly drawn. Is that the way in which a Government should do business ] Where are the lawyers on the Government side that they cannot come together and d r a f t a simple clause ? I am wondering whether the expressed desire on the part of the Government to have business done has anything in the nature of seriousness about it , or whether the Treasurer has not brought down the Bill in this imperfect form in order to give rise to prolonged discussion.",25

181,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Capricornia) [12.21] What is desirable in a clause is clarity, and I suggest to the draftsman that he consults the Queensland Criminal Code, drawn up by Sir Samuel Griffith, a Statute which is a model of concise expression. I do not like the idea of thia proposal to give the Treasurer a free run of the Consolidated Revenue for a whole month without consulting the members of this House. Does the Treasurer desire a long recess? If not, I see no reason for this proposal. There is no disadvantage in the existing method of procedure, except that the debate on that important question, the Address-in-Reply, might be interrupted for an hour or two while the Government gefc a Supply Bill through. The Treasurer tells us he requires the time to ponder over the figures and prepare his Budget Speech. We know that, year after year, when in Opposition, the present Treasurer baited the Treasurer of the day with requests to be informed when the Budget would be brought down; it was a standing grievance with the right honourable gentleman; but we do not hear much about it now-month s are passing by and the right honourable gentleman thinks his Budget will be delivered in a week or two. Probably the object of this amendment is to enable the Government to prorogue the House in November, and continue the recess until the following August. It only shows how necessary it was for the framers of our Constitution to insert the provision making it compulsory to call Parliament together at least once a year.",25
182,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I cannot connect the .honourable member's remarks with the amendment.,26
183,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is cogent argument. As things are now, the Government must meet' the House in July or get into trouble with the Public Service.",26
184,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Do I understand you to say that this is an attempt to get behind the Constitution?,26
185,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; but I can see in it a desire to secure a long recess. I do not think the Treasurer's idea of gaining time to prepare his Budget Speech for delivery early in the session is sufficient reason for passing such an extraordinary amendment of the A u d it Acb. The right honourable gentleman has expressed his willingness to amend his amendment by providing that the expenditure in July shall not exceed one-twelfth of the ordinary annual expenditure. He went on to say his turn. that this was "" neither here nor there,"" but that is what he says about every proposition. As an old politician, he thinks that is the best way of allaying the fears of the Opposition. His remark reminds me of the statement of the Prime Minister, "" Oh, anything will do; all that you want is something near it or approaching the mark."" Fancy Statutes being framed on that principle. Notwithstanding all our watchfulness, nearly every Act of Parliament is so framed that, as it is said, "" you can drive a coach and four through it."" When exercising our utmost in genuity and devoting all our powers of observation aud thought to the framing of a clause in the most concise and clear way, are we to accept anything that the Treasurer cares to throw at us? The right honourable gentleman, forgetting his part for the moment, said that we could uot have this provision applying only in a year i u which a general election, took place. A m I righ t in surmising that he wants more time in which to prepare his Budget speech ? Why does he desire fchafc this provision shall apply to the month of July in each year ?",26
186,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Wage s have to be paid on the second of the month. How can the Treasurer pay them if he has no money at his disposal ?,26
187,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That seems to be a good reason, but is there any objection to our meeting in June - We know that the Treasurer is a heaven-born financier, and is uot likely to do anything wrong, but that does not relieve us of the responsibilit y of providing for the day when an awful fate shall f all upon the present Government and a new Administration take office. If honourable members think it wise to permit the Treasurer of the day to expend one-twelfth of the annual appropriation in the month of July of each year, I do not want to raise any unnecessary objection.",26
188,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that is a fair compromise.,26
189,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have great respect for the honourable member's opinion, and shall therefore withdraw my opposition, although not without some misgiving.",26

192,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Prime Minister remembers when he consistently got in,26
193,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And a good many turns. I rise to state that I support this provision, the need for which has quite recently been exemplified. After the last general election we did not meet until 9th July, and had it not been for the desire of honourable members on this side of the House to expedite business, the debate on the Supply Bill might have lieen continued until after the 15th or 16th July, when payments were due. thing might happen at any time. I trust, however, that the Treasurer will see fit to strike out of this Bill all reference to a Tender Board. The creation of such a Board should he provided for in a separate Bill . I think the proposal that the appropriation in July shall not exceed one-twelfth of the appropriation for the preceding twelve mouths is a fair compromise, and I intend to support it .",26
194,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Swan-Trea surer) [12.36] - I propose to move that the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" The amount expended in the month of June preceding,"" and in serting i u lieu thereof the words "" Onetwelfth of the total amount of such appropriation for the whole of the previous year.""

196,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then they can carry on until the 7th July.,27
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,It would depend upon the date at which the week would begin. It might be that they could only carry on u n t i l the 2nd July.,27
198,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We met this year on the 9th July, and passed a Supply Bill. That could have been held over for two or three days if necessary. I understand that a number of commitments now involve weekly payments, and that being so, Parliament need not be called together u n t i l the 9th July, and under this Bill . it would not need fco be called together until the 9th August. If we could have an assurance that Parliament would be called together in the first week of July the Address-in-Reply could be got out of the way, and financial proposals brought down in August under this measure.",27

200,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I admit that, but does the Treasurer not see that the difficulty the Bill is intended to meet could only arise immediately after a general election 1 Ordinarily, it would not adthe vance us a solitary step towards a soluA t the time of Parliaa general election half the number of senators go to the country at the same time as the members of the House of Suppose the election takes place in May, it would be unreasonable to expect that the meeting of Parliameut should take place at a date now which would enable the attendance of A f t e r a general election Parliament cannot meet before the 1st July, aud that is whafc makes it necessary to provide for Supply for an extra month. The point I wish to make is that we have no guarantee that after this Bill is passed the Government of the be a day will call Parliament together earlier than has been the practice in the past. Except in the case of the first meeting of a Parliament after a general election to the difficulty might be overcome even without this Bill. if . Parliament were to adjourn in September, and meet about the middle of May. That would allow the debate on the Address-in-Reply to be got out of the way in three weeks, the time usually occupied by the debate in this Parliament, and the Government could bring down Supplies and their financial proposals in accordance with the ordinary procedure. The Treasurer now proposes that the expenditure for July shall be one-twelfth of the total appropriated for the previous financial year.",27

The point that I wish to have settled, and about which the Treasurer has given no clear explanation, is why this Bill has been brought down all in its present shape 1 The ouly excuse offered for it is that last session and year it was found necessary to bring down a Supply Bill during the course of the previous financial year. debate on the Address-in-Reply. There is a general impression that it is not spectable to interrupt the Address-inTreasurer to spend. Reply debate with other business. the Bill , even as amended, will afford the Government of the day an excuse for not calling Parliament together u n t i l a month or six weeks after the termination of financial year. There has been an idea amongst a number of honourable memberssince the Federal Parliament was established that our sittings have been toolong, especially when they lasted from the beginning of June or the 1st July to the end of the year. I know that a number' of honourable members opposite are desirous that Parliament should not sit morethan four or five months in the year.

213,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I rise to a point of order. Last evening some doubt was expressed to whether clause 3 does not contain provision which is beyond the order of leave. Since you, sir, ruled that the clause was in order, a perfectly clear statement has been made by the A torney-General that, under it , the Governknow it . ment can establish a Supply and Tender Board. In other words, they wil l be to bring into existence an entirely new set of officers, who will have to be paid. They will have it in their power to create a new Department. When the Attorneyand General was making this statement. I served that, at first, he did not feel called upon fco express an opinion, bufc afterThe wards he appeared to realise that ib only just to the Committee that he should give us his vicw of the matter, which was that under this provision the Government «an create a Supply and Tender Board. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member misunderstood my hesitation. said it had always been the intention the Government to use this provision for the purpose of establishing a Tender Board. My hesitation was caused by a doubt as to whether the use of cert a in words was sufficient.",29
214,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I wil l not attribute the hesitation fco any have doubt as fco the wisdom of concealing his views on this question for party purposes. I must say that he was quite candid. The Prime Minister backed up his statement by saying that he had already mentioned that it was the intention of the Governto appoint a Supply and Tender,29
215,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Wbe n did he say that?,29
216,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Almos t immediately after the Attorney-General had stated his opinion. He made the declaration in his usual loud tone of voice. I am sure that honourable members will see the very great necessity for confining a Bill of this attention character to the order of leave. When the House grants the Treasurer permission to bring in a Bill to amend the A u d it agreed Act the measure should be confined to audit matters.,29
217,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,This is a very long speech.,29

How can it be urged that the creation of a Supply and Tender Board, the renting of an office in which its members may discharge their duties, the payment of salaries and expendiobture connected with this new Department has anything to do with an A u d it Act?

I agree with thia Bill in the main. I agree that the provision which is now taken exception tr> should be enacted, but I coutend that fchis is not a measure in which to empower the Government by regulation tointroduce legislation of a very d o u b t f ul kind.

The CHAIRMAN - The 'honourable member is not discussing the motion before the Chair.",30
236,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The ruling practically is that a provision for that purpose is admissible in a Bill of this kind. I i r my judgment a provision to inaugurate a Supply and Tender Board is foreign to the object of the Bill , and sliould nob be allowed to pass. If the ruling is upheld by the Committee, I can easily conceive that Ministers will include in every measure a provision for something to be done by regulation which might prove highly injurious to the community.

244,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The objection your ruling , sir, is self-evident. Every honourable member on this side has pointed out to the Treasurer the error of his ways in taking power in an A u d i Bill to establish a Supply and Tender Board. H a d he taken the advice was tendered from this side, this delay would have been saved, bufc, through that usual stubbornness which characterizes him, and which he mistakes for tact or diplomacy, we have beeu driven into extreme position of having to. move dissent from the ruling of the Chairman. believe that the Chairman is absolutely wrpng, ancl I hope that the Committee will vote for the motion.",31
245,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It seems to me that honourable members, haying a ppor case, have to resort to the old expedient of blaming the other side. They are asserting that this provision is contrary to the A u d it Act . But the A u d it Act is more than an Act to provide for auditing. In it a good many more provisions refer to the Treasurer and to the management of the public accounts than to the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General is mentioned only a honourable few times, but almost every second provision says something about what the Treasurer shall or shall not do.",31
246,Mr ROBEBTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"T O facilitate audit. The Sir JOHN FOBBEST - We know, of course, that the Auditor-General audits all expenditure, but sections 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36 all refer to the powers of the Treasurer. There is a misconception as to the scope of the A u d it Act. In some countries provisions similar to those contained in our A u d it Act have been put into Acts given different titles. The New Zealand Act which corresponds to our A u d it Act is called I the Public Bevenues Acfc, and the English Act is called the Exchequer and A u d it Acfc. Our A u d it Act has far more to do with the way in which the Treasurer musfc manage the finances than order with the Auditor-General's powers. The Auditor-General has the fullest powers it i regard to the examination of accounts aud the reporting to Parliament on all matters in connection with expenditure. honourable His powers are large, and his responsibilities great; bufc there are more provisions in the Act governing Treasury administration and the management of the finances than there are governing the Auditor-General. to Mr BAMFORD - Has the Auditor General in any other country had placed in his hands the purchasing of stores?",31
247,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,-The clause under t discussion will not place in the hands of the Auditor-General the purchasing of which stores. It will not give him any more nor any less power than he has now.,31
248,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,A department is to be created under the Auditor-General.,31
249,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Nothin g of the the sort. The honourable gentleman seems to think that we cannot establish Tender I Boards under regulation, but if he looks up section 139 of the Victorian Act, No. 1133, he will find therein power to make regula^ tions i u regard to stores andtransport.. That section provides that there shall be a Tender Board; it says what officers shall constitute the Board, and gives instructions for controlling the ordering and supplying of stores. The only object of the clause under discussion is to give the Treasurer more power by law over the purchase and control of stores than he has at the present time. Every Department is now almost a law to itself in regard to this matter, or it can be. The Treasury may give directions and make requests, but it cannot legally bind the other Departments as to the methods of purchasing stores. The object of the clause is to enable us to frame regulations having the force of law, which will be binding on everybody in the Public Service. This is not a party matter, nor does it concern this Government more than any other. The proposal is made wholly in the public in terest, and there is nothing in the clause inconsistent with the A u d it Act . The full title of that Act is- An Act to make provision for the collection and payment of the Public Moneys, the Audit of the Public Accounts, and the Protection and Recovery of Public Property, and for other purposes. In Victoria, the power we seek is given by the Public Service Act ; b ut I submit that it is. better provided for by a provision in the A u d it Act . I understand thoroughly that honourable members opposite find it convenient to prolong the discussion, but I should like to know where the honourable member for M a r ibyrnong, who is a good friend of mine, gets all the knowledge that he seems to possess on every subject. The Government cannot give much more time to this Bill.",31
250,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is sure to get it through if he talks in that way.,32
251,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If we cannot get it through, the responsibility will lie with the Opposition.",32
252,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I appeal to the Treasurer not to shelter himself behind the vague words "" other purposes"" in the title of the A u d it Act. He will find the same words in the title of the Immigration Bestriction Act and of the Pacific Islands Labourers Act . The last-named Act is an Act to provide for the regulation, restriction, and prohibition of the introduction of labourers from the Pacific Islands, and for other purposes. But there are no other purposes set out in the preamble. The Minister's argument is a subterfuge, and the Government would be well-advised to agree to the suggestion of the Opposition, and make a separate measure of clause 3 of the Bill . We on this side have expressed a desire for the creation of a Tender Board. I think that such a board should have been created years ago.",32
253,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,You will not let it through.,32
254,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We would assist the Government to do it , if they would provide for it by a separate measure. We do not know whether the proposed board is to be a departmental board, or how it is to be created, nor do we know for what purposes it is to be created. We have no information regarding the matter. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The House would have complete control in dealing with the Estimates.",32
255,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But surely the creation of the board should be provided for by a separate Bill instead of by an amendment of the A u d it Act . If the Treasurer will introduce a separate Bill for the purpose, I shall give him all the assistance I can to pa3S it .",32
256,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Referenc e has been made to the Tender Board; and it is rather extraordinary that this morning I signed five acceptances of tenders that had been recommended by the Tender Board for the State of Victoria.,32

258,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We could in each Department have two or three officers appointed to act as a Tender Board, but it would be better to have one Tender Board of trained men for the whole of the Departments.",32
259,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is no objection to that.,32
260,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The only objection raised is that such a Tender Board should be provided for by this Bill .,32
261,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Postmaster General is out of order in discussing the clause on the motion before us.,32
262,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is quite true that certain heads in the various Departments including the Postal Department, are constituted a body to examine tenders before they are submitted to the departmental secretary, and, subsequently, to the Minister for approval. In the case of mechanical supplies the examination is made by the Chief Mechanical Engineer, the Chief Electrical Engineer, or the Engiueer in the State of Victoria; but that is not the issue involved in the possibilities of the proposal before the Committee. The question is whether there shall be created under this clause an independent body, such' as the Inter-State Commission is, with a staff of officers, whose duty it shall be to supervise the tenders for the whole of the Departments.",32
263,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The member is not discussing the point of order.,33
264,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am pointing out discrepancy between what the Postmaster General rightly submits is now within the power of the Postal Department and the proposal in the clause.,33
265,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I ruled the Postmaster-General out of order.,33
266,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"With the member for Capricornia, I admit that it would be possible, by some stretch of the imagination, to cram such a provision as is proposed into an A u d it Bill , although it is uot technically an audit matter. Such a proposal, if submitted, ought to be presented in a separate measure.",33
267,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I understand that this new Department will be under the control of the Auditor-General.,33
268,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,No ; Treasurer.,33
269,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But this proposal is made in an A u d it Bill . The Auditor General, I understand, is regarded as supreme over all Departments.",33
270,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Perhaps the honourable member will say that the Auditortroduced General is above the Treasurer ?,33
271,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Well , he is, seeing that he has to supervise the Treasurer's actions, and report to Parliament should anything be amiss. That is why Auditor-General should be kept separate and distinct from every Department.",33
272,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"So he will duties will not be touched at all. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The Auditor General is above the Treasurer, just as the auditor for a public company is above the directors.",33
273,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I disagree with the torney-General on his definition of auditor's duty. It would be fa r better, as in the case of Victoria, to have Tender Board under the Public Service Commissioner instead of Auditor-General.",33
274,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Ordinar y business knowledge and experience show us that it is out of place to create a Tender Board by means of an A u d it Bill .,33
275,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Committee is now discussing the ruling of the Chair.,33
276,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"My desire, Mr Chairman, is that this provision should be ruled out of order; and I am pointing out that the examination and supervision of tenders has nothing to do with the Auditorhonorable General. All that the Auditor-General should have to do is to supervise the accounts. the Sir JOHN FORREST - That is all he has fco do. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The proposed Tender Board will hot be under the Auditor-General's Department.",33
277,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then , why do we find this proposal in the Bill before us? W it h all honourable due respect to the Attorney-General, I think the Tender Board ought to be placed under the control of the Treasurer, who has to pay the bills. If there is any officer who ought to be free from any connection with commercial transactions, it is the Auditor-General, upon whom Parliament and the people rely for the proper supervision of the accounts.",33
278,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,We all agree to that. under the,33

280,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are not going to put him in that position.,33
281,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then , what is the use of this Bill? The Treasurer, when he in the Bill , did hot understand it , and he does not seem to understand it yet. I do not think, Mr Chairman, that you will be long in coming to the conclusion that the clause is beyond the order of the leave; and, if you do so, you will be displaying an amount of common sense t h at does not always characterize the decisions ; his of Chairmen in the Parliaments of the country. Motion negatived.",33
282,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney) [2.55] As tliere seems to be a conflict of opinion regarding the intentions of the Treasurer, At - we should be informed as to what use the an right honourable gentleman proposes to make of the power conferred by clause 3. a The honourable member for Kalgoorlie haa pointed out that the Treasurer may create under the an independent Department, with powers, a little less than those of the Inter-State* Commission. I do nob go as far as to say that, but I can conceive the building up of a Department witli great powers and a stall disproportionately large to the functions it will have to perform. We should sanction the creation of some body that will be independent, and 'have the authority to determine the suitability of supplies and tenders for stores and material required by the Commonwealth, and if the Treasurer will only tell us exactly his intention as to the power he wishes to gefc, much misunderstanding will disappear.",33
283,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Swan-Trea surer) [2.57] - The present system of purchase and control pf stores is not under regulations having the force of law. The object of obtaining the authority in clause 3 is to make regulations that will have the force of law, so that the Auditor-General's powers under section 41 of the Audit Act will have full play, which I hesitate in saying fchey have at present. Purchases are made all over Australia by different Departments under instructions, but these instructions are not as binding as regulations. The practice has been to utilize the Tender Boards in the different States, and I do not think there is need to rush into appoint other Tender Boards so soon as we gefc this power, because we can utilize the Boards that exist in the different States and their regulations. We owe a debt of gratitude to the different States for allowing the Commonwealth to use their machinery and regulations. When a State Tender Board calls for tenders at the beginning of the year on a long list of hundreds of items the Commonwealth is included, and we have the option of taking our goods from the contractors afc the prices they have submitted to the State Tender Board.",34
284,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the General have the power to say what prices should be paid 1,34
285,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Auditor General has nothing to do with the purchases. He comes in afterwards.,34
286,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Are the members of these Tender Boards to be necessarily officers of the Auditor-General's Department?,34
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . These Tender Boards cost very little. In Victoria, for instance, the heads of the various Departments compose the Tender Board.",34
288,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the Auditor General have the right to say whether the purchase is a good or bad one ?,34
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , but he can afterwards express his opinion for the information of the House. It is his duty to report whether thefinancesof the public have been properly husbanded. I do not think there is much limit as to what the Auditor-General may do in criticising public accounts and reporting to Parliament. Sometimes Ministers are afc variance with the Auditor-General, but that does not prevent him making his report to Parliament. These regulations, having the force of law, will be binding on the Departments.",34
290,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Fro m which Department does the Treasurer contemplate getting the members of the Board?,34
291,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I hope we shall not have Tender Boards for some time. VVe are now utilizing the Tender Boards of the States, and we can do it for many a day yet, but meanwhile the regulations will have the force of law, and under section 41 of the Audit Acfc they will come underfchepurview of the Auditor-General, which is not now the case. This provision is necessary, not in the interests of any Government, bufc in the interests of economy, and to secure a proper system and legal control over these matters.",34
292,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Are you going to appoint a Board ?,34
293,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have no intention of doing so.,34
294,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then , what is the use offchisclause?",34
295,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The power will be there if we need it. I have no intention of recommending the appointment of a Board, but we need regulations under Statute which will be binding on everyAuditorbody, and under which the Auditor General will be able to act in making his report to Parliament.",34
296,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney) [3.4] At one time during the right honourable gentleman's explanation I thought we could see the matter clearly, but I am again in trouble, owing to his admission that there is no need for hurrying this measure, seeing that we will not require a Tender Board for some time to .come. In this Bill we have two clauses, one of which cannot be availed of until next July, whilefcheTreasurer hopes the other will not be put into operation for a long while; yet only the other day we were violently accused by the Prime Minister of obstructing necessary legislation. We learn now that there is to be not one Tender Board, but many. I can understand that one Tender Board would be of no service. If something is required in Perth we can conceive the utter in ability of a Minister in Melbourne expressing a reasonable and measured opinion concerning it . The right honourable gentleman possibly contemplates boards being appointed in the various States. To that I have no objection, but I ask honourable members to consider for a moment that the door will thus be opened to all sorts of possibilities. Here are boards whose functions are extremely vague, and the sphere of whose operations is obscure and apparently unlimited. What they are to do, and why they are to do it , we are not told, but we are led to understand very clearly that the Treasurer does not want them to do anything at all for quite a long time. In the circumstances I think we might fairl y ask him to withdraw this part of the Bill until the need should arise for the creation of a body of this kind. So much for that point. The other point, as to which I am afraid the right honourable gentleman did not permit himself that measure of perspicacious utterance which it certainly requires-the question as to where the persons who are to constitute these Tender Boards are to come from-w e should have more information. The Treasurer says that they are not to come from the Auditor-General's Department. from what Department are they to be selected, or are they to be persons now outside the Public Service ? As I said on a previous occasion, I have no objection to the right honourable gentleman constituting ,a departmental board when and how he likes. All that we ask is that there shall be some responsible and independent authority to review the actions of these Tender Boards, just as the actions of all other officers are reviewed. That was the point made .bj' the honourable member for East Sydney. The Treasurer knows that if he wishes to create such boards he - does not require an Act of Parliament to enable liim to .do so. I am utterly at a loss to understand why he is taking the power under this Bill to create a Supply and Tender Board, which, he admits is not to be recruited from the .staff of the Auditor-General. The Auditor General himself is not to .bo the head of this Department, but is to have the power to review its actions. When we ask who are to constitute the board, whether they are to come from the Department of Home Affairs or from some other Department, we are not told.",34
297,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We do not know ourselves yet. They will bedepartmental officers. The selection will be something like that made under the Victorian law, a copy of which I hand to the honourable member.",35
298,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This copy which the right honourable member has handed to me shows that the Victorian Supply and Tender Board comprises, amongst others, the Secretary of Public Works, the Inspector General of Public Works, and the In spector-General for the Insane-a n oflicer whose most appropriate appearance in this connection seems to mark a new era in the debate. There has been hitherto an air of confusion, doubt, and difficulty about it , which is most regrettable, and the reason for which was not quite clear; but we now learn that the Victorian Government, wiser than ourselves, have provided that the Inspector-General for the Insane shall be one of the officers charged with the important duties in connection with a Supply and Tender Board.",35
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Look at the last officer named in the list,35
300,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Secretary for Neglected Children! This is, indeed, a refreshing sight. Politics in these days are essentially vev/y dull, and the Then prospects before us are not calculated to rouse us to much jubilation. I should welcome with almost a transport of delight the possibilities for opera bouffe and unadulterated humour afforded by a board of this kind in which the Inspector General for the Insane's vagaries are, so to speak, counterbalanced by the efforts of the Secretary for Neglected Children to see that nothing was done that ought to be done. There are on the Victorian Board a number of other gentlemen,-some of whose functions bear a very sinister appearance. One of these is the Inspector General of Penal Establishments. This is introducing into the discussion a note against which I protest, aud the Attorney-General, as the representative of the law, should be called upon to rise in his place, not as a matter of privilege, bufc by way of personal explanation. After all, returning to the point afc issue, I should be perfectly satisfied if the right honourable gentleman would indicate more - clearly than he has done exactly how he intends to apply this system to the requirements of the Commonwealth. U n less he does so I must vote against this clause, and I am comforted in my determination to do so by the admission of the 'Treasurer that the matter is not at all urgent. I join with him in the hope that it never will be. Mr W . H . IRVINE (Flinders-Attor ney-General) [3.13] - I do not understand at all the apprehension of honourable members opposite. In the first place, the Government have power to establish Tender Boards without the authority of an Acfc of Parliament, and, as a matter - of fact, every Government exercises that power.  refers only to departmental boards. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is so. No Commonwealth Government has yet established separate departmental Tender Boards, because there happen to be in the - States boards which perform for us the necessary functions, and perform them very well. If it were necessary, however, to appoint Federal Tender Boards in any of the Departments we should not hesitate to do so, and it would not be necessary to ask the authority of Parliament to do so. Honourable members may ask whafc is the connection between Tender Boards and the particular power here sought to make regulations. nexion is that when we have this power to make regulations we can impose an additional safeguard by conferring upon - the Tender Boards which now exist, and are used by us, a certain authority. We :may say that the Auditor-General shall not pass accounts in respect of stores unless, first of all, the sanction of the Tender Board for their purchase has been obtained.",35
301,Mr ARTHUR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is it the intention - create a new board ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - It is not. was attempting to-explain the legal tion. The object is not to create new boards, but to invest decisions of Tender Boards, if they are appointed, with authority which will bind the Auditorthing General.",36
302,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is it proposed to give him the power of appointment? Mr W . H . IRVINE - No . The only control the Auditor-General now has the purchase of stores is to insist that purchase, for instance, on behalf of the Defence Department, is provided for by a vote in the Appropriation Acfc. If it is he must pass it . The Defence Department may find it very useful and necessary to have a board to control the purchase of stores. I am not quite certain whether at present the Defence Department have a Tender Board of their own.",36
303,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They have a special officer to supervise contracts and tenders. Mr W . H . IRVINE - J u s t so. The only effect of this provision will be that the Governor-in-Council may, if he thinks fit, make a regulation that no expenditure shall be authorized for the purchase of stores for the Defence Department unless it has first received the sanction of the Defence Tender Board. If such a regulation is made, then the Auditor-General cannot pass the account for such stores until that condition has been complied with. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [3.17] - I do not object very much to the appointment of a Tender Board. But I think it is not wise to put a Tender Board in the way of a business man. I am surprised that the right honourable member for Swan, whom I knew in the West many years ago, should make such a proposal. In those days he would have regarded a Tender Board as in the way.",36
304,Sir JOHNFORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I had a good majority in those days. The con- Mr KING O'MALLEY - Whil e a Department is waiting upon a Tender Board a necessary purchase of stores may bo delayed. I would much prefer the appointment of a good business man to take charge of all purchases for a Department. I think' fchafc a Tender Board would be more or less useless to expedite.,36
305,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Adelaide) [3.20] As we proceed the position becomes more complicated, because of the diametrically to opposite opinions expressed by different members of the Government. During the I election campaign one or two members of posithe Government or their followers suggested the appointment of a Supply and Tender Board, inferring at the time that an such a board was necessary because someindistinct and indefinable had apparently happened.",36
306,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Not "" had happened,"" but "" might happen.""",36
307,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; the implication over was that something had happened, and a that safeguards were necessary. Apparently, because of these references, the Treasurer submits i u this Bill a clause under which it will be possible to establish a Supply and Tender Board. The Prime Minister, in discussing the preliminary stages of the measure, asserted that it was the intention of the Governmeut to establish such a board. Attorney-General yesterday, when unacquainted with what was in the mind of the Treasurer, also asserted that it was the intention to establish the board. few moments ago, presumably after consultation with his colleagues, he stated that that is not intended. Before the Attorney-General spoke, the Treasurer informed the Committee that it was not the intention of the Government to establish such a board at present; that he did not want it ; and that it was intended to continue the practice at present prevailing. Is it any wonder, in view of these differences of opinion, that honourable members on this side should display a little apprehension as to what really is the intention of the M in istry? Is this clause merely inserted to make good the bogy utterances from election platforms, or in order that the Government may take advantage . of it ? A f t e r listening to the Prime Minister, would appear that the Government propose to take advantage of it ; but, after listening to the Treasurer, it is clear that they do not intend to take advantage of it. The Attorney-General merely comes in to explain the legal position, according to the brief he holds at the moment. The whole thing is very characteristic of the "" y e s - n o"" attitude of the Government party in politics.",36
308,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is dragging us all into it uow.,37
309,Mr BOBEBTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member for Henty is one of the humble followers of the Ministry.,37
310,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not too humble.,37
311,Mr BOBEBTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"-The honourable member may not be humble when on a Henty platform, but here he is as humble as Uriah Heep, and has to obey the Whip and come to heel when he hears the orders of the Ministry. We have a right to be apprehensive and to ask for information, in view of the contradictory statements made from the other side. I believe that if the discussion continued for another half-hour the Treasurer would make a further statement contradicting all that he has previously said. We on this side of the House are practically becoming dentists. We are extracting, occasionally and with pain to the person from whom it is extracted, little bits of in formation. The Treasurer has divulged something of what is in his mind. This The afternoon he distinctly contradicted what he said yesterday, and for the thir d time in forty-eight hours has made a statement diametrically opposed to one made A by the Prime Minister on precisely the same subject. I regret very much that the Treasurer has forced into an A u d it Bill a subject that is entirely foreign to it. I wish to make it clear that in the first place we have no objection to an ordinary amendment of the A u d it Act . We have no objection to the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board to safeguard the public interests. But we do raise an objection to a Tender Board being established under a mere regulation made under an Act entirely foreign to the subject. It was asserted that the title of the A u d it Act had relation to the matter under discussion. The title of the principal Act is "" An Act to make provision for the collection and payment of public moneys."" Will any honourable it member contend for a moment that the purchase of stores has any relation whatever to the collection and payment of public moneys.",37
312,Sir BOBERT BEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,If c has fco the payment of money.,37
313,Mr BOBEBTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The purchase of stores has nothing to do with the payment of money. My honourable friend may purchase goods, but it may be the misfortune of some other member of his family to have to pay for them.",37
314,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,It al l comes out of the main hatch.,37
315,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think that my honourable friend is on this subject sadly afc sea. Instead of being on deck and understanding what has been going o n, he has been down in the cabin. Otherwise he would know that the clause under discussion has no real relation to the subject of audit. A section in the principal Acfc provides for the auditing of public moneys. Has the Auditor-General anything to do with the purchase of goods? The Auditor and the purchaser should be entirely separate persons, so that the auditor may be free to investigate and criticise the work of the purchaser. The protection and recovery of public property is also provided for in the principal Act . The clause under discussion relates to the control of public property. I shall not debate the subject any longer. The Treasurer is taking advantage of the fact that the House is about to adjourn to force through a measure containing a clause entirely foreign to the rest of the Bill . He is forcing it through by virtue of his large majority. I remind honourable members opposite that it may happen before much time has elapsed that the two parties in this House will change places. If in the course of a month or two after a dissolution the Treasurer finds himself on this side of the House, what will he say if we take advantage of this clause? Of course, I know that the Prime Minister shrinks from the idea of a dissolution. I do not grudge him the promotion he has secured, but he knows perfectly well what the result of a dissolution will be. If as a consequence of an appeal to the country we change places in this House, and those who are now on this side take advantage of this particular clause to frame a regulation i u respect of a Supply and Tender Board, and the purchase of stores, I am satisfied that the Treasurer, to the very utmost of his capacity, will denounce us as he has done in the past, and will say that we are practically making laws by regulation, aud doing so when Parliament is not in session.

321,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I did not say that they had not.

There are one or two provisions in the measure which we knew it would contain-for in stance, fchere is the proposal to restore the postal vote. But there are quite a number of new points in it which come upon me as a complete surprise. The proposal fco institute a check upon voting seems to me a most reactionary one. Before I discuss the Bill I desire to hear that provision explained. The Honorary Minister may have some data to support it , and, if so, I wish to have an opportunity to digest that data.

Candidly, I am opposed to the postal vote, but not under all circumstances and every circumstance. I am not opposed to electoral reform.

338,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,l i e is thinking of Ash Wednesday.,39
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,And you are of the thinking of Black Wednesday.,39
340,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It should bs obvious We to all honourable members that the meaWe sure is one which ought to be passed as early as possible. It is always possible that my honourable friends may call a full gathering on some occasion when the Government are one supporter short, and conwe may have to go to our masters.",39
341,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why not to-night?,39
342,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that our honourable friends would disappear through the doors of the chamber rather than that I such an nwful thing should happen. All I do ask is that they shall treat the measure as non-contentious and non-party. 1,39
343,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,How long have you been,39
344,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am very young at the game, I admit. This is essentially a ill for consideration in Committee. If my honourable friends object to any clauses, to and call them controversial, such as the provisions relating to the postal vote and the liberty of the press, they can contest tbem just as valorously in Committee as opon the motion for second reading.",39
345,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I would refer all disclauses to the Inter-State Commission.,39
346,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"""Why does my honourable friend tap himself on the chest when he talks of the Inter-State Commission?",39
347,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"O r fo the High Court, or to the Senate.",39
348,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Governmeut take will we the view that we must try to do some business i u this House. We were A f t e r the second reading of the Bill is moved on Tuesday, we hope that honourable members will have paid sufficient attention to it in the meantime to be able to go straight on.",39
349,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yarra) [3.46] - The Honorary Minister has distributed today a reprint of the Electoral Act, showing the proposed amendments in block and erased type, which, of course, is a very commendable proceeding. Regarding the provisions for voting by post, I would like to know from the honourable gentleman, by interjection, or even in his second-reading speech, or from a Minister who has not spoken, whether those provisions vary from the repealed provisions. It is most important, I think, to have that information. I have not had time to compare the clauses in this Bill with the former provisions for postal voting. Eight or a dozen provisions appear to have been taken en bloc from some Act. I want to know whether they arc the same as our original provisions, or whether any alterations in the text have been made. Information on that subject will help honourable members on this side and facilitate discussion.",40
350,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Gwydir) [3.47] The Honorary Minister has told us that we have nearly four clays in which to digest a subject about which he knows very little. Does he mean to suggest that in the two days we shall be travelling by train we must study this measure? Does he mean to suggest that wo must give up our Sabbath to that work? Are the Government so depraved in their conception of their duty, not only to the people of this country, but to the Higher Power, as to force honourable members to study matters of this kind on the sacred day of the week? The suggestion of the Acting Leader of the Opposition, that the debate should be adjourned after the Minister has concluded his second-reading speecli, is one which, I tliink, the Prime Minister would be very wise in adopting. There are considerations which, if extended to honourable members on this side, will be returned with interest, but if the Honorary Minister, who makes these sneers and jibes, and ridicules men who are old enough to be his father, and more enlightened than probably his father ever was, is to prevail, such conduct will be returned with interest, with a certainty. I advise this young stripling opposite to take a little advice, and not start to dictate and dominate the House, when he rises up in his supercilious and superior way to indicate what should be done.",40
351,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am glad to hear you castigating him. I can do no good with him.,40
352,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know that my honourable friend cannot, as he will find out as he goes along; he will discover that his colleague belongs to the worse specimens that this country has produced. This morning I received from the Prime Minister a reply to a question regarding the escapees from the quarantine station at Manly. I have to complain about the nature of the reply. It was to the effect that five men had escaped from the quarantine area; that they were not in a highly contagious condition; in fact, that they were convalescent, and, therefore, there was no danger to the community. All authorities that I know of have laid it down that the most contagious stage of this disease is that of convalescence. Por the gentleman who is at the head of a big Department of this kind, and who is responsible for the whole of the business in connection with the scare in Sydney today, to send such a reply to this House, as though we were a lot of school children, is so much bluff, unworthy of an oflicer of a Department. Further, if his statement is correct, and these persons were wholly convalescent, they had no right to be in the quarantine area. They should have been discharged if they were what he calls wholly convalescent. On the other hand, the newspapers of Sydney, with scare headings, reported the escape of the men from the quarantine station, and stated that they wore mixing with the people of Manly, and had the disease in a contagious form. That is absolutely contrary to the statement of Dr Cumpston. The newspapers used the incident, as they have been doing from the beginning of the epidemic, to scare people into being vaccinated. It is a scandalous thing that every little point that can be taken with regard to the position of small-pox patients is used by the newspapers of this country to drive people into a worse condition than small-pox it self would bring about. In his reply to a question on a matter of great importance to the people of New Soutb Wales, Dr Cumpston docs not indicate that he has a comprehension of the responsibilities of his office, or, if that is not so, that he has the knowledge which - should be possessed by u man who is administering a Department of that kind - sufficiently to w in the confidence of the people. I clo not wish to further dwell o n the matter, because I understand that the Prime Minister is prepared to give me an opportunity, as soon as he can, to - discuss it . That being so, I clo not want to sacrifice that liberality on his part. He realizes the importance of the matter. It is of primary importance to the people in this country that we should know wliether the action of the Government is warranted by the experience of other countries, ancl by the knowledge of the highest autliorities. I u my judgment the Government are making a serious blunder, and spreading the disease day by day, as has been done in epidemic after epidemic, by vaccination. By scaring people day by day into being vaccinated the newspapers are doing nothing more or less than continuing the epidemic, which is practically the outcome of vaccination. We had evidence of that through the press when the Health Officer said that the disease was only attacking people in a very mild form , but that it was very probable that in a few days, or a week or two, it would appear in a malignant form . That statement has not been borne out by the course of events. The fact that weeks and weeks have gone by without any very serious cases having been reported, and without any deaths having occurred, only bears out fny statement as to the experience of all other countries during an epidemic, and that is that it is suicidal to introduce wholesale vaccination, because it spreads the very disease it is i tended to check. This is going on right along the line, and the Minister in charge of the Department evidently takes no notice of it . Where is he now? What cares he for the loss incurred by the people of today! What cares he for the r u in which is staring them in the face, in many cases by reason-of the loss of business and the paralyzing of industry! What cares he about the lives which are being sacrificed day by day by vaccination and the effects of it !",40
353,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,He is in Sydney DOW.,41
354,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , but he has not been in Sydney all the time. To a Minister who is in charge of a Department of State like this, when the lives of the people are at stake, which is the more important? The business interests of the community are also at stake. It is not his place to be away from the scene of action. He should be there, watching closely every move, to see if he can bring relief to these people who have been scared by the action of the Government, which had no warrant or justification, but must be regarded as a calamity such as I hope will never occur again in the administration of the affairs of this country. The newspapers are making capital out of the disease, and are doing more in j u r y by what they publish in the city of Sydney than could be done in any other way. They have done everything to inculcate a haunting fear of small-pox, with a view to driving the people to vaccination. Everything that can be put forward to bring about wholesale vaccination has been published, but nothing to enlighten the people as to the folly of it is given publicity, although the newspapers profess to be the great public educators, and the guides of the people. For the in formation of these persons, who could sit, I presume, afc the side of the grave laughing, in their ghoulish delight, at the tears shed by the relatives of those who have been called away by the effects of vaccination, I shall produce in this Chamber, not' theory, bufc practical exjserience, and the judgment of men in every part of the world of far liigher - standing than Dr Cumpston, proving that the action of the Government is suicidal, and destructive of the besfc interests of Australia, being calcun - lated fco spread the disease which it is asserted they are trying to stop. I suggest to the Prime Minister that when I again ask a question i u this House, he will intimate to his officers that questions are asked seriously, with a view to getting information, and that members are not to be treated as children. We have no right to be told that a small-pox convalescent is not a contagious subject, because it is well known in connection with all scrofulous diseases such as measles, scarlet fever, small-pox, and the like, that those who are in the convalescent stage are most likely to spread the disease.",41
355,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Barrier) [3.58] - I draw the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to a matter that has already been brought before the House by me once or twice, and upon which I have asked questions, the giving for political purposes of £ 5 0 0 by Mr Herbert Brookes to the honourable member fbr Perth. The lionorable member for Perth has admitted that he received that inoney, and that it was received for political purposes; but he said that he did not know exactly the date when it was received. I should be glad if my banking account were in such a state that I could not remember exactly when I had received a sum like £ 5 0 0 . However, the honourable member for Bourke stated in this House that it was on the 26th A p r i l that the cheque was given. I raise no objection to the giving of the cheque, because I think that persons should be allowed to devote money for political purposes in aid of whatever party they may be associated with. But T bring the matter under the attention of the Minister of Homo Affairs because the Electoral Acfc provides that an account must be given of any money sent for political purposes to any organization. I have asked whether the Home Affairs Department has received an account of how this inoney was spent, and have been informed that the Department has no information about it . The honourable' member for Perth was good enough to say that Mr Brookes informed him that I could go to liis office, and see a statement of how the money was spent, but that is not my business. The matter would have been no concern of mine, but for the fact that section 172 of the Electoral Act says that a statement showing how much money is spenfc must be sent to the Chief Electoral Officer. As the money left Melbourne on the 26i.li A p r i l , it was inoney spenfc in connection with the elections, and I ask the Prime Minister to ascertain whether steps have been taken to see if the Act has been complied with. When I asked a similar question some .time ago, the honourable gentleman said that he was not a detective. I do not ask him to be a detective, bufc it is hia business to see that administration entrusted to him is properly performed. During the electoral campaign, we heard a great deal about the need for pure administration, and about the need for purity of elections. I ask, therefore, whether an attempt will be made by the Chief Electoral Officer to give effect to the provisions of the electoral law in respect to the donation to which I have referred. Mr HIGGS '(Capricornia) [ 4 . 3 ] - I ask the Prime Minister to give consideration to our hours of sitting. He expects to get through a programme of legislation, a considerable portion of which means the utter destruction of legislation for which we on this side have been fighting for all our lives. When his measures are introduced, they will meet with the keenest opposition. During this week, we have been kept here every night u n t i l nearly midnight, bufc I submit that, in the interests of the honourable gentleman's physical condition, as well as for the sake of the health of other lionorable members, our proceedings should close by half-past ten. It is not merely the hours that we sit here that have to be taken into account; the time occupied in attending to our voluminous correspondence musfc also be reckoned in . I have to answer letters from all parts of a constituency which is larger than Victoria. The Prime Minister can do a fair thing to the country and to himself only by setting apart a certain number of hours each day for the discussion of public business. He should not try to wear down his opponents physically. Such attempts only meet with retaliation and reprisals, and that we do not want. We want a fair fight, and should be permitted to get to our homes at a reasonable hour at night. If the honourable gentleman will consult the lists of the first Parliament, he will find that there are about eight of the original senators and about a dozeu or fifteen of the original members of the House of Representatives left. We have both had a long time in politics, and, apparently, the people do not wish us to retire. Possibly we would not retire if we were asked to, and there is no reason why our exit should be hurried by asking us to sifc here u n t i l midnight.",42
356,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Maribyrnong) [4.5] In the Age of today there is a report of a speech delivered by Mr Herbert Brookes last night at a social function tendered to the defeated candidate for Bourke. The report is as follows: Mr Herbert Brookes, president of the People's Liberal party, in the course of a brief address complimenting Mr Robb on the splendid fight he had put up at the election, said he had a personal statement to make. On three occasion's during last week it was. said in the House of Representatives that he had been responsible passing on a certain sum of money to a member in another State. He wished to say that this absolutely true. He was proud of it, nnd hoped to be uble to do it again. He hardly understood why such a disturbance had been raised in the House over the matter, when the secretary of the Political Labour League in Sydney admitted that a straight-out payment was made for political purposes. But how had Mr Anstey received this information? Apparently the whole of Australia was ridden with a nefarious system of spies. This was not playing the game. At that social gathering a member of the Government, Senator MCColl, was present; but I do not know whether or not, as the report of his speech is exceptionally brief, he complimented Mr Brookes on the financial efforts he had made to assist his Liberal brethren. However that may be, Mr Brookes made a very definite statement; and, as the honourable member for Barrier has said, the Electoral Act requires all persons and associations to send in returns as to political expenditure at election times. That section of the Act the Government do not propose to amend, and we may take it that they approve of it . The request made by the honourable member for Barrier is a very modest one, and Mr . Brookes practically invites investigation.",42
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,What does the honourable member wish me to do? What sort of investigation has it to be?,43
358,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I should say that a statement like that of Mr Brookes should be investigated.,43
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,To do what? Mr THOM A3 - To see how the money was spent.,43
360,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is all we are asking. We do not suggest that the Government should go out on a heresy hunt, or, like sleuthhounds, pursue some particular individual, but merely that they carry out an Act of Parliament.",43
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs). [4.101 - I see that the honourable member for Gwydir has left the chamber, so that I need not refer to the matter of the small-pox outbreak.",43
362,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What about my question as to voting by post? . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - My recollection is that the clauses are substantially the same, though I do not bind myself to that statement. As to the honourable member for Capricornia, I do not know whether I shall be accused of bribery and corruption, but I have a very fine motor [45] car, and on Tuesday next I shall be quite for willing to send the honourable member away 150 miles, and make him so comwas fortable that his health need give us no further concern.",43
363,Mr HIOGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That will not do; I do not desire a holiday, and only complain of the late sittings.",43
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As to the second reading of the Electoral Bill , I shall see how we shape on Tuesday, and do what is reasonable.",43
365,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The request is a very fair one in the case of a big Bill like this.,43
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is a mistake to suppose that it is a big Bill .,43
367,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is so big that the press suggest that we are to have a double diesolution in connection with it .,43
368,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,What does the honourable member himself think on that point f,43
369,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think there will be no double dissolution on the Bill .,43
370,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then the honourable member destroys his own comment and complaint. As to the action of Mr . Herbert Brookes, what amazes me is the moderation of the amount.",43
371,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Prime Minister is accustomed to dealing in big figures?,43
372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; but my honourable friends opposite are accustomed to talking in big figures. If they referred to the £50,000 which is supposed to be floating about, I could understand their making some complaint; but this is a paltry £500.",43
373,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is not the amount; the objection would be the same if it were £10.,43
374,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,If the honourable member expects me to follow this £500 to Western Australia,43
375,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I expect the Prime Minister to see that the Act of Parliament is carried out.,43
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member expects me to follow this £500 to Western Australia, and deal with it in detail in a return",43
377,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is provided by Act of Parliament that Mr Brookes shall do that.,43
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not think it is so provided in the Act.,43
379,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,As k the Attorney-General. We shall do ao on Tuesday.,43
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member has any complaint to make in regard to this matter, and will put it .in writing, I shall have it thoroughly investigated.",44
381,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall do no such thing. I have drawn attention to it, and we shall see whether the Prime Minister will administer the Act or not. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.15 p.m.",44
