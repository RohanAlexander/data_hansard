1,Mr HUNT,MOTIONS, I seek leave to move a motion of censure against the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Leave not granted.,19
2,Mr HUNT,MOTIONS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Flinders from moving the following motion forthwith: That this House censures the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency for: (1) misleading the Parliament of Australia. In particular by claiming that the Leader of the Opposition recently amended Coalition policy regarding the use of taxpayers' funds for purchase of foreign carbon credits; (2) misleading the Parliament by asserting that there was such a change when the original policy released on 2 February 2010 has a heading in bold blue font on page 14, ""Direct Action in Australia, not Overseas, "" and when that heading is followed by the express clear and absolute statement: (a) ""Labor's emissions trading scheme relies extensive purchase of overseas CO2 emissions abatement to meet the 5 per cent emissions reduction target. This delivers no local environment benefit in Australia. In contrast, the Coalition's approach ensures that all abatement activity supported by the Emissions Reduction Fund to achieve the 5 per cent emissions reduction target will occur in Australiadelivering environmental benefits here rather than overseas."" (3). misleading the public about the effective carbon price in China. In particular by overstating the effective price in China by 1,000% on multiple occasions including 3 February 2011, 16 February 2011 and 9 March 2011 when the Minister's own department had found a figure 1/10 of that as early as 6 October 2010. This minister has deliberately misled the parliament and it is part of a pattern of dishonesty and disrespect that the Australian people and parliament",19
3,Mr Albanese,MOTIONS,"Mr Speaker, I rise to raise a point of order with regard to when a serious allegation is made as to a misleading of parliament. I seek your guidance with regard to the normal practice for raising it at the earliest opportunity. My understanding is that what the member for Flinders is moving here in the parliament relates to statements made by the minister during question time yesterday, during which time the member for Flinders was in the chamber and raised no objections to any of the statements. ",19
4,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"I will take up as much time as I like, Manager of Opposition Business. There is no point of order. The member for Flinders, as I understand it-I do not have his suspension motion before mehas talked about misleading. His first remarks in support of the suspension motion were to talk about deliberate misleading. He will be very careful: this is a suspension motion.",19
5,Mr HUNT,MOTIONS,We need to suspend standing on orders to call this minister to account for misleading the parliament. The reason that is the case is that the minister has had before him for 18 months the coalition,19

9,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,The time allotted for the debate has expired. NA Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2011 First Reading NOES Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading,21
10,Ms MACKLIN,BILLS,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (09:28): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill makes minor amendments to certain governance and business arrangements for portfolio bodies under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005. At present, several statutory positions established under that act are referred to by the term 'general manager'-that is, the heads of Indigenous Business Australia, the Indigenous Land Corporation, Aboriginal Hostels Limited and the Torres Strait Regional Authority. However, the roles undertaken by occupants of those positions have changed in nature since the positions were created. The term 'general manager' will be changed to 'chief executive officer' as a better reflection of the responsibilities and expectations of these agency heads. The change will bring these agencies into line with the majority of other Commonwealth statutory authorities and companies, whose agency heads have the title of chief executive officer. This includes, for instance, the Australia Council for the Arts, Screen Australia, the Australian Film, Television and Radio School and the Australian Sports Commission. The chief executive officer title is a more appropriate term for agencies that have a board of directors-as each of these agencies do-and meets the general expectation that a chief executive officer is more senior than a general manager. We expect that this change will help the boards of these agencies to attract a higher calibre of candidate for agency head positions. A further minor amendment will remove a redundant reference to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for two discontinued Aboriginal Hostels Limited schemes-the Community Support Hostel Grant Scheme and the Student Rent Subsidy Scheme. These schemes have not existed for a number of years, so the reference to them is no longer appropriate. The provision for handling of information held by Indigenous Business Australia is also being amended. The narrow focus of this provision has, in the past, prevented information from being disclosed to agencies with responsibility for overseeing Commonwealth administrative practicessuch as the Ombudsman and the Privacy Commissioner. It has also prevented information being given to Commonwealth agencies working in joint initiatives with Indigenous Business Australia, and state and territory agencies seeking to work more closely with Indigenous Business Australia to achieve better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities. The amended provision aims to overcome these difficulties-but only with the continued appropriate protection of sensitive information. The relationship of confidence between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the agencies established for their benefit is an important public interest that we need to preserve. The new provision is also consistent with established information-handling arrangements, such as in the family assistance law and the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010, that protect information while still permitting the proper work of the Commonwealth and its agencies. Lastly, the bill amends the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Act 2009 in relation to the power to appoint a person to act as the Executive Director of Township Leasing or the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services. At present, the power to make these acting appointments must be exercised by the minister personally, with no capacity to delegate the power. It will now be possible for the minister to delegate the power under each act to the secretary or a deputy secretary of the department, without the need for the minister to make acting appointments personally. Appointments can then be made when there is a vacancy in the office, including any period when the executive director or coordinator-general is absent from duty or from Australia, or when the executive director or coordinator-general is, for any reason, unable to perform the duties of the office. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment (Deer) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Dr Mike Kelly. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (09:34): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment Bill (Deer) 2011 amends the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Act 1998 to increase the maximum allowable levy rate cap on the National Residue Survey, NRS, component of the deer slaughter levy from 4c to 10.5c per kilogram of carcass weight. The Deer Industry Association of Australia has requested on behalf of the deer industry to reapportion the deer slaughter levy due to a significant production decline over the last 10 years, which has reduced the funds raised through the levy. The industry proposes to reapportion the levy to increase the NRS component from 4c to 6c per kilogram and decrease the research and development, R&D, component from 4c to 2c per kilogram. To meet this request, a change to legislation is required as the act currently caps the NRS component at 4c per kilogram. The deer industry requires the NRS component of the levy to be increased to 6c per kilogram to ensure it generates sufficient levy funds to maintain a viable residue monitoring program. Australia requires a residue monitoring program for European Union market access, and with approximately 85 per cent of all venison produced in Australia principally exported to the European Union, it is a key market for the industry. Decreasing the R&D component of the levy to 2c per kilogram is not expected to have an impact on the industry's future R&D projects. This has been confirmed by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. The industry undertook an extensive period of consultation and the decision to reapportion the levy was put to a vote in March 2011, where approximately 97 per cent of valid responses from deer producers supported this change. The government has endorsed this recommendation from industry. The government has decided to increase the NRS levy rate cap in the act from 4c to 10.5c per kilogram at this time to cover the industry's proposal and allow for future increases that the industry may seek without the need to further amend the act. Following the passage of this bill, the government intends to put forward amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (National Residue Survey Levies) Regulations 1998 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Regulations 1999 to give effect to the levy reapportionment proposal from industry; that is, to increase the NRS component to 6c and decrease the R&D component to 2c. The measures introduced in this bill and the subsequent amendments to relevant regulations will enable the deer industry to fund a viable residue monitoring program, maintaining access to key export markets-a positive result for both deer producers and their local communities. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Business Names Registration Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bradbury. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",21
11,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Business Names Registration Bill 2011 is part of a package of bills. The package comprises:  The Business Names Registration Bill 2011;  The Business Names Registration (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011; and  The Business Names Registration (Fees) Bill 2011. These bills, along with subordinate legislation, will create a national business names registration system. Currently businesses need to register their names in each state and territory in which they trade. Each jurisdiction has its own processes and fees. The proposed national registration system, to be administered by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, ASIC, will mean businesses pay one fee to register nationally, using an online application process. The idea of having uniform national business names registration laws across Australia has been around for a long time. As the result of an agreement among all Attorneys-General, uniform business names registration laws were put in place in all jurisdictions in 1962-63. Unfortunately there was no mechanism put in place to maintain uniformity, nor to prevent multiple registrations of the same name across Australia. In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, agreed that the Commonwealth would assume responsibility for the registration of business names. This reform proposal was one of 27 regulatory reforms forming part of the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy. An Intergovernmental Agreement for Business Names was signed on 2 July 2009 by the Commonwealth, the states and the territories. The national business names registration system, combined with a number of other related initiatives such as the National Australian Business Licence and Information Service and the Australian Business Account, are estimated to provide benefits of $1.5 billion over eight years to business, government and consumers. The Commonwealth has no power to regulate all business names registrations in Australia; therefore the establishment of a national business names registration system and the legislation which underpins it relies on a referral of constitutional powers from the states to the Commonwealth. The states therefore must enact referral legislation to give effect to the national registration system, and the Commonwealth legislation is drafted in such a way that the national system cannot commence if any state does not refer or adopt the legislation. The business names registration legislation package will set up a new national business names register, to be operated by ASIC. Any entity carrying on a business in Australia using a name other than its own will be required to register with ASIC. This will enable the identification of the entity behind a business name. The national registration system will assist new businesses by providing a joint online application for an Australian Business Number, ABN, and national business name, two of the most common registrations undertaken by those starting a new business. Combining these two common start-up registrations in a single online process will make it simpler to start a new business. Under the new system, businesses will only need to complete a single online application, and pay a single fee, to register business name nationally. This will mean, for most businesses, reduced registration costs and a simpler process, especially for businesses that trade in more than one state or territory. At present, a business operating in every state and territory faces a cost of more than $1,000 to register a business name for three years. Under the national registration system, businesses will only pay one fee, which will be in the order of $70 to register for three years. An optional $30 fee will apply for a one-year registration. To assist with identification of the entity behind a business name, the national registration system mandates an ABN for any new business name registration. Currently all state and territory business name registers allocate a business name number. The allocation of such a number will no longer take place under a national system. The register will enable any party-be they a consumer or another business-to ascertain who the entity is behind a business name. The register will prevent identical business names in the states and territories being registered in the future. It will also prevent the registration of otherwise undesirable names such as names that are misleading to consumers, or offensive. The national register will also provide national rules to apply in relation to the use of business names when a person is disqualified from carrying on business. Consistent with trademark law, registering a business name under this legislation will not give rise to any proprietary rights over that name. Existing businesses will not need to do anything when the national registration system commences. Their existing state and territory business name registrations will a automatically be transferred into the new national business name register. People who are thinking of starting new businesses will be able to apply to register their national business names online, at any time, and in most cases will receive confirmation of registration immediately. Applicants will be able to follow a link to Australian trademark and domain name searches, which may be important to them in choosing their business names. The new national registration system will commence after all states refer business names powers to the Commonwealth, or adopt the Commonwealth legislation. It is envisaged that states will have completed this process by March 2012, and the national registration system will commence by the end of May 2012. Extensive consultation was undertaken to reach agreement among the Commonwealth, states and territories on the structure of the proposed national registration system and the legislation which will establish it. Extensive public consultation was also undertaken, including two rounds of public consultation on the draft legislation. Full details are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned. Business Names Registration (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bradbury. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",24
12,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Business Names Registration (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011 is part of a package of bills. The total package will, along with subordinate legislation, create a national business names registration system. Existing businesses will not need to do anything when the new national business name service commences. Their existing state and territory business registrations will automatically transferred into the new national business name register. Where there are identical business names currently registered in different jurisdictions, the proposed arrangements under the legislation will not require existing businesses to spend money on reissuing stationery or replacing signage. These businesses will be able to keep their existing business name; however, a distinguishing mark will be placed on the business name register, allowing specific businesses operating in different jurisdictions to be identified. My comments in relation to the Business Names Registration Bill 2011 also apply to this bill. Debate adjourned. Business Names Registration (Fees) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bradbury. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
13,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Business Names Registration (Fees) Bill 2011 is part of a package of bills. The total package will, along with subordinate legislation, create a national business names registration system. The fees bill is a taxing measure which will impose the fees for registering business names in the new national registration system. At present, a business operating in every state and territory faces a cost of more than name $1,000 to register a business name for three be years. Under the national system, businesses will only pay one fee, which will be in the order of $70 to register for three years. An optional $30 fee will apply for a one-year registration. My comments in relation to the Business Names Registration Bill 2011 also apply to this bill. Debate adjourned. NA Treaties Committee Report Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (09:48): On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee's report entitled Report 118: Treaties tabled on 23 March and 11 May 2011, incorporating a dissenting report and additional comments. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted. Mr KELVIN THOMSON: I thank the House. Report 118 contains the committee's views on two treaties: the Protocol on Investment to the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement and the Resolution MPEC.189(60) Amendments to the Annex of the Protocol of 1978 Relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL). Australia's economic relationship with New Zealand is conducted within the framework of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement, colloquially known ANZCERTA. It covers all trans-Tasman trade in goods and services and is the principal instrument for the elimination of trade barriers between the two nations. The protocol on investment will raise the threshold below which New Zealand investors in Australia require investigation by the Foreign Investment Review Board from a 15 per cent or more share of an Australian entity worth at least $231 million to an investment of $1.005 billion. For Australian investors in New Zealand, the threshold below which they will not be subject to investigation has increased from NZ$100 million to NZ$477 million. Both countries have retained the entitlement to review foreign investment originating in the other signatory and sensitive areas, such as urban residential and commercial property investment; media, telecommunications, transport; defence related industries; uranium investments in Australia; and farming, waterfront or sensitive land investment in New Zealand. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says that the protocol on investment is in the national interest because it will remove or reduce investment barriers; bring the treatment of New Zealand investors under Australia's foreign investment regime, in line with that granted to United States investors under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement; and maintain Australia's Trade capacity to screen New Zealand investment proposals that are large or involve sensitive sectors that raise national interest concerns. While the majority of the committee supported ratification of the protocol on investment, the report contains a dissent in relation to this treaty. The dissenting report from the members for Murray and Mallee is thoughtful, and I hope the government gives Trade it proper consideration in thinking about as future foreign investment policy. The truth is that many Australians are concerned about foreign investment, and the evidence to the committee about the Foreign Investment Review Board's handling of foreign investment does not do much to allay those concerns. In 10 years, the FIRB has knocked back just two foreign investment proposals: the Shell bid for Woodside and the Singapore stock exchange bid for the Australian Stock Exchange. The FIRB says that it will reject proposals that are not in the national interest. But, when you ask Treasury whether foreign investment is in the national interest, you are told that it is. If you ask, 'Are there any circumstances in which it might not be in the national interest?' all you get is a shrug of the shoulders. The second treaty considered in this report is the Resolution MEPC 189(60) amendments to MARPOL. This treaty is a multilateral treaty regulating marine pollution. amendments add a new chapter 9 to MARPOL dealing with the use and transport of heavy fuel oil in Antarctic seas. The new chapter will prohibit the bulk transportation and use as fuel of heavy oils, bitumen and tar and their emulsions unless they are aboard vessels securing the safety of ships or in a search and rescue operation, and ships owned and operated by governments such as naval vessels, auxiliaries and research vessels. The Australian Antarctic Division administers the Australian Antarctic Territory and is the major Australian presence in the Antarctic. The division strongly supports the measures introduced under the resolution. Nevertheless, implementation of the resolution will have some operational and budgetary implications for its work. Given Australia's leadership in marine environment protection, it is worth noting that the research vessel chartered by the division, the RSV Aurora Australis, already uses light fuel and is therefore compliant with the treaty. Australia's stations in the Antarctic are also compliant. The division also contracts Russian flagged vessels to provide logistic support for its Australian Arctic program. These vessels are large, specialised, icestrengthened cargo vessels, unfortunately, operate on intermediate fuel oil which will be banned under the treaty. However, the division has advised the committee that the fleet of ice-strengthened cargo vessels is nearing 30 years old, which is the usual end of a ship's life. The division expects to see a changeover in this fleet to modern, compliant vessels in the next five years. The committee is concerned that a large proportion of vessels operating in Antarctic waters will be exempt from the prohibition on the basis that they are operated by The governments. We believe the Australian Maritime Safety Authority should monitor the number of exempt ships carrying heavy oils in the region to see whether the provisions of the exemption need tightening. I commend the report to the House.",26
14,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES," by leave I thank our very able chairman, the member for Wills, for his reference to this dissenting report that I and the member for Forrest have attached to the Protocol on Investment in the Australian-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement-ANZCERTA. This treaty was originally tabled on 11 May 2011. We are not, and certainly I am not, against the business of foreign investment in Australia-not at all. What we are concerned about is anything which further diminishes the transparency or scrutiny of any foreign investment proposal, and we are certainly concerned when this is done, as it appears to be, as a cost-cutting measure. This protocol does not in fact harmonise current anomalies or increase scrutiny of investment proposals by foreign private parties between Australia and New Zealand. As I said, it diminishes scrutiny and increases the disparities which already exist between the investment potentials in Australia and New Zealand for private companies and citizens. While it presumes to which, be doing more, the new ANZCERTA investment protocol only focuses on significantly increasing the dollar thresholds that trigger screening in either country. The actual business of this protocol is to make sure that New Zealand enjoys the same treatment as our preferred trading partner, the United States of America, when it comes to investment protocols. With this protocol, New Zealand investors would see the threshold for the scrutiny of their proposals raised from 15 per cent of A$231 million for general investment, A$5 million for Australian heritage properties or A$50 million for commercial properties to the one all-encompassing trigger of 15 per cent of A$1.005 billion in assets for any investment by a New Zealand corporation or business. Australians, on the other hand, would see the investment-screening threshold raised from 25 per cent of New Zealand's NZ$100 million to 25 per cent of NZ$477 million. The New Zealand Overseas Investment Office would retain its current 'sensitive assets' criteria, so in effect this protocol does not at all give a level playing field to the two countries' investment. The argument for that is that New Zealand has a much smaller economy and investment by Australians in New Zealand is, at this point in time, substantially greater than the reverse. I have to say, however, that the protocol does not address different percentages of investment triggering scrutiny or the levels of proposed investment triggering screening. Neither does it deal with the different definitions of so called 'sensitive assets' in New Zealand, which include rural land over five hectares and any waterfront property, or Australia's prescribed 'sensitive areas', which include media, telecommunications, transport, defence related industries and uranium but not rural land or waterfront land. Those disparities would continue under this new so-called 'harmonising protocol'. As well, New Zealand citizen investors are given a special visa category which exempts them from Australia's residential property investment conditions. However, the same does not occur for Australian citizen investors in New Zealand. They will continue to be restricted by certain criteria, for example, in regard to water frontage and farmland over five hectares. The New Zealand OIO also charges a significant application fee of some NZ$12,000. Australia does not charge anything at all. This is another anomaly which has not been considered. New Zealand Treasury has calculated the protocol as proposed would substantially reduce the current costs for investment in business assets by around two-thirds. But it would appear that this will largely come from Australian businesses less frequently triggering the New Zealand OIO application fees, and fewer New Zealand investors triggering the Australian thresholds. Therefore, this saving comes at a cost of less scrutiny and transparency for either country. It cannot be seen as a savings carrying a benefit of increased efficiency or effectiveness or ensuring the national interests of both countries are preserved. Australia accepted the conditions of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement for screening of non-government investment in Australia by US corporations or businesses. This is now the standard to be offered to New Zealand as the equivalent of USA preferred status. However, that Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement hardly had generous conditions for Australia and it was not reciprocated nor harmonised with the United States criteria. The USA, for example, has no formal dollar threshold triggering screening of private investment but instead requires voluntary notification of any proposed investment which may trigger national security sensitivities. It seems we still have not learned much then about equal or reciprocal bilateral trade arrangements or increasing transparency and accountability. In particular, article 8, the senior management and board of directors section of the new protocol, provides that neither party may restrict the nationality or residence of the senior management or board members of an enterprise of that party who plans to invest. We are concerned that such an arrangement could lead to a diminishing of Australia's national interest if board members or senior management are not resident in either country and do not have Australian or New Zealand nationality but still get to enjoy the preferential investmentscreening treatment. In summary, the only new obligation imposed by this new protocol on investment to the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement is the requirement that Australia substantially increases the thresholds before screening of New Zealand private sector investment proposals occurs. Fees charged are not harmonised and special considerations are not aligned. Given the growing public disquiet about the lack of transparency and accounting for foreign investment in Australia, especially for farming land and manufacturing, now is not the time to simply raise the bar to save costs by triggering less scrutiny, assessment of national interest and accountability. In fact, I believe we need to urgently review our non-government foreign investment triggers for scrutiny and our definition of 'national interest', in particular to include consideration of Australian food production capacity. Because of those points, we cannot support this protocol. National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all words after ""That"" be omitted view to substituting the following words: ""the House decline to give the bill a second reading until provisions establishing the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, including its functions and responsibilities, are presented to the House for its consideration.",28
15,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES," I had only 30 seconds last night. I will continue on the substance of the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 and the range of amendments that are emerging not only from me but also from the coalition and the government, which has some substantial amendments. I am not opposed to establishing a national health performance authority as a concept. I think it is an important contribution to national health and hospital reform that this House and Australia have been chasing now for at the very least three years. To have in concept form a body to monitor the performance of all aspects of that health and hospital system is a sensible and much needed part of the oversight and scrutiny in regard to the health reform agenda on behalf of Australian taxpayers. However, having said that, we are seeing before our eyes now some changes with regard to what was introduced in this parliament under the guise of the Health Performance Authority and now, with substantial government amendments, some substantial changes to the concept that was introduced, arguably even to the point where BILLS we could build a case that it is a separate bill altogether in structure. The amendments are so substantial in the way they change this from what started out as a national performance authority to what is now a gaggle of states authority. The command and control really is residing once again back in the hands of the states and territories. Back in 2008, when we started this journey, really largely the point of the exercise was to find a with a way for the Commonwealth to directly fund that resource and give the local health district networks or their equivalents around Australia much greater command, control and autonomy on the ground. That was the model when this bill was introduced in the House in the last session. The principle still stood and health and hospital reform generally was looking to still be on track. I urge every member and anyone listening to this debate to focus not necessarily on the bill itself but on the 29 government amendments to their own legislation that they put before the House several months ago. The concern is in those amendments and how much has been given with regard to state clawback and the use of COAG as a Trojan Horse on behalf of the states once again wanting to get command and control of a system that they considered was under threat through what was, and hopefully still is, a very good and important reform for Australia in tidying up and essentially nationalising our health and hospital system in Australia. In relation to the amendments before the House, the coalition's second reading amendment will be the first we will deal with. It states the coalition's desire for the House to decline to give the bill a second reading until: (1) provisions establishing the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, including its and responsibilities, are presented to the House for its consideration … I can understand the coalition's desire to want all of the health and hospital reform brought in globo and have us deal with it all at once. I hope that is the desire. From my reading of this, I think the link is tenuous at best to the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. Health and hospital reform in some form is happening in a range of bills and my reading of this second reading amendment is that it is the continuation of the policy of wanting to be slow and difficult on all policy if not in control of the government benches. So I will not be supporting the second reading amendment from the coalition. With regard to the in-detail stage, I will be putting forward an amendment concerning the reporting requirements of the health reform agenda and the National Health Performance Authority. This was put to the House committee that looked at this issue with regard to how the authority reports: does it report directly to the minister or should it also have some obligations to report to parliament? My perspective-and I am pleased that the House committee also supported these considerations-is that the authority should have responsibility to report as soon as practicable to the parliament so that reporting is not part of a game by the executive to release bad news the day before Christmas or to get up to any other tricks that everyone in this place knows can get played when governments are behaving badly. The authority should have some tight time frames for reporting and some clear and specific obligations for reporting to parliament and therefore to all of the 150 members and indirectly to 150 communities around Australia. I am hopeful of support for the amendment. I think that it is a small but important reflection on the role and status functions that parliament itself plays in the transparency process that delivers better policy outcomes for all of us. There will also be a batch of 29 amendments that the government is introducing to their own legislation. It is here that I have most concern, and I will speak again in the in-detail stage. This is really where the dumbing down of this legislation is taking place, in my view. As I said at the start, whilst we are regarding these amendments as being an inch better than where we were before, we are still a mile short of where we could or should have been with health reform and the agenda that has been going on for the last three years. That is where the disappointment lies, in the lost opportunity of reform and allowing a performance authority, unfettered, with independence, to truly assess data from all states and territories of all hospitals regardless of who the direct authority is, so that we can get some direct benchmarking and some clear direction on who is or is not performing in health and hospital services today. In my view, the amendments that the government is introducing are tying the hands of the performance authority and really making it subservient to the states' authority. That has been a big part of the problem to date that I thought the reform agenda was trying to resolve, and in the whole negotiation of trying to get all the states and territories on board there has actually been a compromise too far. I understand that negotiation and compromise have their place but I do not think that the balance has been struck. I think that compromise with the states has really given command and control back to the state and territory authorities to potentially continue to behave in an inefficient and less than value-for-money way than we desire. I think I heard another speaker talk about the performance authority as a consequence being a 'toothless tiger'. I hope that is not the case and that is why I will continue to support the substance of the bill, because we have inched forward slightly. But I do think that it is a neutered tiger. I think that through this process it has lost a lot of its authority truly assess the performance of health and hospital services across the board in Australia on behalf of Australian people with data that is given to the parliament and to the people without fear or favour, without any washing by any states or territories, without any tricks or political games with talk of various turnarounds of work schedules or how early the documents have to be given to state and territory health ministers so that they can get their guns loaded in response and without the use of COAG as the body to really hide a Trojan Horse for this reemergence of state and territory command and control. I am very uncomfortable with those government amendments and will not be supporting those when it comes down to the in-detail stage. I hope-and I flag and I warn-that this whole exercise is different from the recently signed health and hospital reform agreement documents and that this is not symptomatic of what is to come through legislation. I hope there is not going to be a range of legislation that sees the states claw back control three years after the beginning of a very good and very important reform agenda. In 2008, in the previous parliament when the government was a majority government, I was still a very strong advocate for the importance of this reform. The then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, sat in the tea room of a local hospital, the Port Macquarie Base Hospital, and talked at length with the medical staff at the hospital and listened closely to discussion on the importance of the principles of the two Es-efficiency and equity. That is all I and communities such as mine have sought through this process, namely, efficiency being rewarded in the system and equity. Those services performing over and above should be rewarded. Currently in the funding models they are not, so that inefficiency, in many to ways, gets rewarded. The resource distribution model controlled by the states does not deliver equity, particularly to rural and remote communities and to high-growth areas. Both are traditionally behind equity in the delivery of resources and funding. The National Rural Health Alliance put a figure of $1 billion a year based on a failed model of the states resource distribution formulas not making it to where, on the state's own funding formulas, it should. a disgrace. It is one of the great failures Australian public policy at the moment and it is the fundamental reason that reform is so important and that we need to be eyeballing the states rather than being subservient to them. What I am seeing in these amendments that have come through whilst this bill is before the House is in my view too much compromise with those that are too much to blame for the problem-the very reason that we are reforming. So I would hope this is not the first of many. I hope this is a one-off where, for a whole range of reasons that I am probably not aware of, the states got a great big win through the range of amendments that have come in and Australian taxpayers as a consequence in my view got a great big loss. I would hope that in upcoming legislation attached to the health and hospital reform agenda we do see the Commonwealth actually stepping up and sticking true to the reform agenda was in 2008-that is, to start to have a Commonwealth funding authority working directly with local command and control. It is a sensible concept; let's deliver it.",30
16,Ms ROXON,COMMITTEES," I would like to thank the very many members who have spoken on this bill from both sides of the House. It would be fair to say from listening to the contributions that people feel very strongly about making sure that our hospitals can deliver for local communities. The member for Lyne, the final speaker on the bill, is a very passionate advocate for making sure that his local community is well looked after. I can indicate to the member for Lyne that the government will be supporting his amendment when the opportunity comes for that. However, I do need to indicate to him It is and to the House that we fundamentally of disagree with his assessment of what the amendments mean. I will be addressing that in more detail when I move those amendments. Let me go to the summing-up and deal with those issues first and then for the convenience of the House I might mention that we intend to move the amendments together as a group. The National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 establishes a key element of the Australian government's health reform agenda. (Quorum formed) I am sure that members are delighted to be here to know that the National Health Performance Authority will act as a watchdog over the performance of both public and private hospitals, local hospital networks and Medicare Locals. It will regularly report comparative information on the performance of these bodies and give the public information in respect of consistently poor what performance. Performance monitoring will support the improvement in healthcare delivery, safety and quality by all of these services. Poor performance will be identified to allow for remediation and superior performance will be identified to allow for the dissemination of best practice approaches. The establishment of the authority is a key part of the health reform agreement signed by all states and territories this month. We then introduced the legislation into this House in order to meet the time frames of the February COAG meeting but also were open to consider amendments which might be suggested from the states, the committee inquiry in this place or the Senate committee inquiry. State and territory health ministers agreed to the detail of the legislation and how it will interact with their health systems at a meeting of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council on 7 June. Amendments to reflect the detail of this agreement were distributed by the government in the last session of parliament.",33
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES, Would those members who are still standing out of their place and having little discussions either do that outside or resume their place in the chamber.,34
18,Ms ROXON,COMMITTEES,"I will be moving amendments in the committee stage of the bill. These also reflect amendments suggested by the Senate committee inquiry. The amendments will bring about a firm partnership between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in their endeavour to deliver better healthcare services to all Australians. The amendments to the bill will enshrine the independence of the authority giving it the ability to appoint its own chief executive officer as well as the power to remove that person in the case of poor performance or misconduct. Amendments will also foster greater cooperation with the states through consultation on the authority's strategic plan, consultation about reports of poor performance and the designation of local hospital networks. This shows that the government is committed to work with all jurisdictions on health reform and deliver an outcome that will put more information in the hands of Australian patients. I thank those members who have made constructive contributions to this debate. However, unfortunately, a number of members of the opposition have used their time to simply complain and criticise rather than to outline any plans they would use to deliver improvements to the health system. They have been consistently silent on their vision, except for a policy to wreak havoc on and cut health services. It is a fact that this bill delivers on reforms that the Leader of the Opposition once talked about but never had the capacity to deliver. On 9 May 2008 he said the Howard government: … would have empowered the public by requiring the states to publish detailed information about the specific performance of hospitals. ……… In return for continued funding increases, each state would have been required to provide detailed quarterly reports on the precise number and type of services delivered at each public hospital and to provide detailed quarterly reports on adverse events at each hospital. So, while the opposition has an 'oppose everything' strategy, by not supporting this bill they will be opposing something that their leader himself once called foralthough did not achieve in 11½ years. We are now seeing the opposition, having no ideas of its own, continuing to play the easy game of trying to frustrate the government's significant reforms. This was highlighted earlier this year when the shadow minister took a similar approach in regard to the bill to establish the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, a body originally established, temporarily, by the Leader of the Opposition. Now we have had a bill before the House for some months, scrutinised and endorsed by committees in both the House and the Senate, and the best the opposition can come up with is saying that we should sit on it and not establish this important watchdog agency. The shadow minister clearly knows that this agency is a key part of the health reform agenda and that this legislation has been endorsed by all the states and territories, including three Liberal states. He also clearly knows that this agency will have a watchdog role in scrutinising the performance of health services, whereas the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority will have a completely different role, an important technical and financial role, in determining the official price for hospital services. Rather than trying to wreck every bill, it might be worth the opposition's time to develop at least one health policy of its own. Our government is determined to pursue the tough reforms, particularly when they involve more transparency for the Australian public. Standing on the shoulders of My School, My Hospitals and the work of the National Health Performance Authority, this agency will deliver for Australians unprecedented levels comparable information. It will also be a watchdog to detect poor performance in our public and private hospitals and primary care sector. I thank members for their contributions, my officials for their hard work and the states for their cooperation with these reforms. Question put: That the amendment be agreed to. The House divided.

(2) An appointment under subitem (1) is to be made by written instrument. (3) Anything done by or in relation to a person purporting to act under an appointment under subitem (1) is not invalid merely because: (a) the occasion for the appointment had not arisen; or (b) there was a defect or irregularity in connection with the appointment; or (c) the appointment had ceased to have effect; or (d) the occasion to act had not arisen or had ceased. Note: For more about acting appointments, see sections 20 and 33A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. (4) If a person is acting as the Performance to each Authority CEO in accordance with an appointment under subitem (1), the Performance Authority must not appoint anyone, under subsection 94(1) of the National Health Reform Act 2011, to act as the Performance Authority CEO. (5) If, immediately before the end of the 6-month period beginning at the commencement of this item, a person is acting as the Performance Authority CEO in accordance with an appointment under subitem (1), the appointment is terminated at the end of that 6-month period. (6) Subitem (5) does not prevent the person from being appointed by the Performance Authority, under subsection 94(1) of the National Health Reform Act 2011, to act as the Performance Authority CEO after the end of that 6-month period. As mentioned in my summing-up speech, these amendments take into account the resolution of a meeting of health ministers that was held on 7 June which supported in principle this legislation with these amendments. It is very important to note that these amendments give the National Health Performance Authority the power to appoint and dismiss its own CEO; set mechanisms for notification of poor performance to states and territories, local hospital networks and hospitals; deal with the definition of public hospitals and local hospital networks; consult the states on the strategic plan; allow for disclosure of information to state ministers; and deal with the act's functions. It is not right, as the member for Lyne and on occasions the opposition have put it, that these changes give the states power to do what they want in hospitals. Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill, amendments, will introduce the most rigorous performance measures that have ever existed in Australia's history for our hospital system. That is of course why the states fought hard to make sure that the detail was practical. As systems managers of our hospital system, they would be aware of and responsible for the fixing of problems within our hospital system-something I would think all members would be keen to support. These amendments have, by the nature of the process for getting agreement through a COAG arrangement, been subject to extensive consultation with my state and territory colleagues. They also address issues that were raised through the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearing. These amendments will ensure that the act has the support and cooperation of state governments so that the authority can properly undertake its role as a watchdog of public hospital, local hospital network, private hospital and Medicare Locals performance. By addressing these amendments we will achieve what has long been wished for in the Australian health system: independent, hospital-by-hospital reporting performance. I cannot think of anything that is a better indicator of how we will improve performance year after year after year than making sure that we have an independent system which assesses the performance of each hospital and allows us to make sure that those that are underperforming improve and those that are doing well can be copied around the country. I am very proud of these amendments and the bill as a whole. I think it is a historic part of our agreement, and I think the view that the states and territories might occasionally like to have put in the media that they had a big win on this just is not supported by the evidence of what is in this bill and these amendments. I commend with these these amendments to the House.",36
21,Mr DUTTON,NOES," Since I last contributed to this debate on the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill, significant developments have taken place. The most significant development is that the states have completely and utterly won out in this debate against the Commonwealth. I want the House to understand-and I am going to ask the Minister for Health and Ageing some questions in a moment but I think the Australian public has seen it for what it is that what has taken place here is that the Prime Minister was desperate to claim to the public that she had had a win. This Prime Minister was desperate over the break to try and flick the switch away from the carbon tax and she was wanting to say to the Australian people that on health reform the Commonwealth was able to strike a deal. Let us look at the circumstances under which the Commonwealth has been able to strike this deal, and some of it has been discussed in the contribution of the member for Lyne. Essentially, the government has agreed to continue business as usual in Australia's 750 public hospitals in return for of the agreement of the states-in particular, the states that held out, namely, Western Australia and, to a lesser extent, Victoria. It has meant a huge bucket of money. The states have got a huge amount of money and there are 29 amendments to this legislation to try and accommodate the capitulation of the Commonwealth to the states. So the Commonwealth again has got itself into a financial bind where this incompetent federal government has said to the state premiers, 'To get a signature on the paper we will do whatever it takes.' Could you imagine negotiating any sort of business contract in the real world on this basis? Go to BHP and say, 'We are desperate to do a deal with you and, whatever condition you put in the contract, know that we will sign it.' That is basically what has happened here. This government is desperate and on its knees, and it cannot manage money. In trying to give the public the perception that some sort of grand health deal has been done, the Commonwealth has sold out not only this government but also future governments. Future legislators in this place will be bound to this incompetent and lazy deal. It is not good for parliament, it is not good for the Australian people and, most importantly and it is not good for the doctors and nurses that work in public hospitals or, indeed, the patients who access the services. I think it is right that this minister is condemned yet again for the latest failing in the so-called health reform debate. I might say as part of this contribution I welcomed some of the words from the member for Lyne, who I think has a genuine interest in the area of health reform. The sincerity stops, I am afraid to say, where the member for Lyne-in spite of having made all of those statements before: that this legislation; that basically the Rudd vision that he was tied up to, quite willingly, has now been abandoned; that the states have won out; and that we are going to have business as usual at a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer-is still going to support this legislation. I think it is disappointing because, as I said, I think he does have a genuine belief in wanting to reform our health system-as we all do. But we are not going to get that if we end up with the government's own legislation being amended 29 times before the bill has even passed the parliament. Just to put that into context: this is a government that has had to amend its own bill in 29 different areas. Basically, it completely undermines the intent of the original bill. The intent of the original bill was to vest certain powers in the Commonwealth so that we could drive efficiency, productivity and changes in the hospitals, which are owned and managed by the state governments. The member for Lyne has said, 'I'm going to oppose these amendments because I think they weaken the original bill'. He is not going to oppose them, knowing that the other Independents will support his position so that ultimately the amendments would go down. The member for Lyne has decided ultimately to support the bill, which I think undermines credibility in this debate. I think that it has to be put on the record, because I suspect that the member for Lyne would not oppose these amendments if the member for Lyne knew that he could possibly defeat them. In this debate people should really put their cards on the table, because this is bad that legislation. The member for Lyne, who, as I said, does have a genuine interest in health reform, acknowledges that this is just the latest example of a failure to deliver on health reform in this country. I would like to ask the minister: can this minister point to is bad anywhere in this legislation where the Commonwealth has the final say in relation to any aspect of the bill before the House?",40
22,Mr OAKESHOTT,NOES," I will talk specifically about the amendments, but I cannot let the somewhat obsessed commentary on my sincerity go without a response. I am here participating in this debate with sincerity for the right outcomes, as I hope all members of this chamber are.",41
23,Mr Dutton,NOES,"Well, vote against the bill!",41
24,Mr OAKESHOTT,NOES,"If you listened closely to what I said: I said that with regard to the substance of the bill I think it is an inch further than where we were before, but it is a mile short of where we could be. In language that is as simple as I can possibly make it, it is a step forward but it is a lost opportunity for where we could be. If you think that fails a sincerity test then I think that is a disappointment that reflects poorly on you, sir, the member for Dickson, in your running commentary in a partisan way.",41
25,Mr Dutton,NOES,Why don't you hold out and get a better deal?,42
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES, Order! The member for Dickson was heard in silence. He will extend the same courtesy.,42
27,Mr OAKESHOTT,NOES,"And in response to the interjection as to why I am running a commentary on the member for Dickson, it is in response to his running commentary on me. I would not have commented otherwise. With regard to the amendments before the House: I think they are a watering down of where we could be. In fact, I like the substance of the legislation and the bill that was originally put before the House. That is the bill I want to support, not reject, as the member for Dickson seems confused about. I want to support a National Health Performance Authority that is unfettered in its business in the way it works through the various hospital and health providers and reports accordingly for good or for bad. I understand administrative principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, particularly in relation to individuals who work within the public sector-in fact, for all Australian citizens. I think that principle does not stand as much for state bodies that may feel aggrieved if there is a poor performance report around a particular hospital. These amendments seem all about what I consider to be the weak argument of procedural unfairness that has been run by the states in an effort to try to get some buyin with regard to command and control back within the health and hospital reform agenda. I will quote some examples. Amendment (4) to section 62: (4) If the report indicates poor performance by: (a) a local hospital network in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory; or (b) a public hospital in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory; Then there is this process where a copy of the draft of the report has to be given to the state or health minister; there has to be an invitation to the state and to the health minister to give the performance authority written comments about the draft report within 30 days; and there has to be regard to any of these comments. If we are serious about an unfettered performance authority and genuine independence, and with reliable data-and I accept COAG reform, and MCClintock and crew have been talking about poor data within many systems and the timeliness of that data-do not buy the argument that there is procedural unfairness, that the states seem to be treated unfairly if under the performance authority rules of engagement a particular hospital is found with poor performance. Based on the unfettered powers that they may have, I do not accept procedural unfairness to the state. Yes, I think we have to protect individualshospital managers and any of the health workforce-but as far as the states are concerned, I think they should cop it and they should do what they can to improve whatever the performance authority publicly releases either to the parliament or to any other body.",42
28,Mr Dutton,NOES,"Well, move that amendment!",42
29,Mr OAKESHOTT,NOES,"I am going against these amendments, member for Dickson. I cannot understand your confusion with regard to how explicit I have been. I support the original legislation before the parliament. I do not support these.",42
30,Mr Dutton,NOES,Move an amendment to strengthen it up!,43
31,Mr OAKESHOTT,NOES,"I do not support these. I do not want to amend them; I do not support them. I do not understand your confusion or your interjections, sir. You will get the right to speak again, and hopefully you can explain yourself. I also have a problem with the states having input into the work plan of the performance authority. This should be the equivalent of an integrity body that has its own work program, not one that has the states or the Commonwealth directly inputting into that work program.",43
32,Ms ROXON,NOES," I am happy to take all of the comments. This is consideration in detail. I am happy to take any objections, questions and queries that people have and deal with them all at once. I do not think that it will serve the House that well for us to prolong this if there are not new issues to discuss. I think we need to bring some of the detailed information back to the focus of the House, and I can pick up the points that the member for Lyne is making and some that the shadow minister is making. I think people are confusing things and alleging things about the original bill that was put forward. At the time that it was put forward we clearly stated that there were still to be negotiations with the states and territories and that amendments would be moved; we said that on day one. We also acknowledged that there was a lot of interest and that there would be inquiries in both the House and the Senate, and we understood that that might lead to some changes. That is the sort of open policymaking that people ask for from governments. Yes, you could do it differently-you could have an exposure draft; you could do some negotiations firstbut ultimately the parliament enables this process, and we have been pretty up-front about it. So I do not think there is anything peculiar in the way that the member for Dickson seems to be suggesting-that, because there are a lot of amendments, that is somehow a bad reflection on the process. I think it actually shows that the process, as we indicated from the beginning, has worked quite well. But where the confusion seems to come in is that these amendments are being seen as a removal of Commonwealth power when actually what this legislation is establishing is an independent body. It is not a body that is going to be controlled by the Commonwealth. It is not a body where we are asking for final control. It is a body where we are saying that we should remove from the political agenda an assessment of performance hospital by hospital. A vast number of those 29 amendments make clear that it will be more independent from the Commonwealth than the original draft. It is not moving from the Commonwealth to the states but moving from the Commonwealth-for example, the minister having the ability to employ and dismiss the CEO-to giving the board the power to do that. I think that that actually increases the assertion that we have made from the beginning that this is an independent body. It makes it even clearer that we are serious about it being an independent role. The example that the member for Lyne raised, which is a significant one, goes to some practical objections that the states and territories had about when they are the ones that are required to help improve a hospital facility if it is found to be lacking in performance, which is the very thing that the member raised at the end. What I want them to do if there is a performance problem is get on with fixing it. They asked that they have the opportunity, in a very short time, first check that the data is correct-and unfortunately in health this has been a problem that has dogged the system, so I think it is not an unreasonable request from people who want to make sure data is correct-and second to be able to get on straight away with fixing a problem while this process of reporting continues. From my perspective, for the patient that is a good thing. It means that the states are asking for that information to be given to them early so that they can respond and fix performance problems early and so that for patients we have things picked up more quickly. I can understand that people might have some scepticism. There has been a fair bit of history in a lot of parts of the country where there is not always confidence that the states have done what they ought to in particular areas. What the Commonwealth is interested in doing with our reforms-and this legislation is a big part of it-is making much clearer the lines of responsibility of who does what, who fixes what, how we know when something needs to be fixed and how we make sure the performance is publicly available to people. And we will be. I know as the health minister that every member in this House, if their hospital is found not to be performing properly by this Health Performance Authority, will be in here asking me about what else can be done to fix it. That is how this sort of reporting drives improvements in the system. So I do not accept the criticisms that are made. I do understand that a number of them are made totally in good faith, but this is a huge leap. It is not an inch further from where we were; it is a huge leap from where we were. I am sure that, over coming years and in the future, people will watch how the performance authority works and may well seek to improve it even further in the future.",43
33,Mr OAKESHOTT,NOES," I will to be brief and will just clarify any perception of confusion. I accept the minister's argument that this is the movement from the Commonwealth to an independent authority and not necessarily an ongoing running battle between the Commonwealth and the states, but I would also put on the record, Minister, that I know independence and this is not independence. That is the concern specifically about the amendments. I refer you to the policy principles of COAG at proposed section 66A, where it is COAG itself that is giving written policy principles to the performance authority about the performance of the performance authority's functions. COAG, if I read it correctly, will be a gathering of health ministers, state and federal, and therefore it remains a part of the political process. Likewise, with the similar issues around amendment (26) in regard to who decides the work plan of the performance authority, it is by agreement, as I understand it and read it, between the state and federal health ministers. That is arguably much more a political decision than an independent one. So I fully back the concept of an independent performance authority with unfettered powers alongside an audit office, an ombudsman and inspectors-general of defence or taxation. If we are serious about establishing an independent body, it needs to be unfettered and to be genuinely removed from the political process. These 29 amendments are the political process using its claws, and particularly the states, to work against what is a very good concept as part of the health reform agenda. So no confusion, just disappointment. Maybe it is a reality of negotiations in a federated system that once again the Commonwealth takes a bullet as a consequence of having to negotiate with states. But I, as the local member representing my people in the federal parliament, in what I consider the 'common wealth' parliament, should not accept this incursion from the states once again. In 2008, it was finding ways to get around state command and control which was one of the fundamental reasons we were doing what we were doing.",44
34,Mr DUTTON,NOES," welcome some of the comments in the Minister for Health and Ageing's previous contribution, but I think they go further to underscore the fact that this is a terrible for the Commonwealth. As we mentioned before, when Kevin Rudd won the 2007 election the promise was that hospitals would be federally funded but locally run. As a principle, that is admirable. As the member for Lyne has commented on a number of occasions, that would have been a better and more desirable outcome. But the more we look in detail at these amendments the more we see the way in which the Commonwealth has capitulated. Far from being a federal takeover or a greater concentration of funding power to try to drive changes, this has been a takeover in reverse. The states have effectively usurped the Commonwealth's power in relation to this bill and, I suspect, many others that we will see before the parliament. I asked the minister a very specific question about in what area the Commonwealth might have a final say. The minister tried to fob that off saying that this was an independent authority, but if you look at the government's original intent in relation to this authority certain appointments were made by the minister, by the Commonwealth, and certain obligations were imposed on the authority by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's intent was very clearly to try to drive this performance authority so that we could see better outcomes in our public hospitals. It is abundantly clear-and it should be clear to all Australians-that this is yet another demonstration of a bad government in action. This is a government that has locked this nation's healthcare future in mediocrity. This is a situation that is of the Prime Minister's own making. In a way I feel for the current health minister because not only was she gazumped by Prime Minister I Rudd but also she has been completely sidelined by this Prime Minister. It is humiliating for a minister, particularly for a cabinet minister, when that cabinet minister deal is put to the side because he or she has no capacity to deliver the outcome that the Prime Minister desires. I think that is part of what has happened here. The minister cannot come before this House with a serious and sincere look on her face and say that this is what she intended out of this process. There is no final say for the Commonwealth, as there was in the original draft of the legislation, because the states have their fingerprints all over this bill. We can have a debate about federalism and the role of the states in the health system. That debate will no doubt take place in coming years, as it has in previous years. But people should be under no illusion that this does anything to end the blame game, to fix public hospitals, to improve standards. You only have to look at the detail. There is no financial penalty. I asked the minister what happens in a situation of proven by incompetence or demonstrated poor clinical outcomes in a public hospital continuing under this process. What power does the Commonwealth have, without having to consult the states or territories, to deliver some sort of financial penalty on the states? What sorts of powers does that extend to? I know that sometimes, particularly given 29 amendments have been moved, some of the detail gets brushed over. But there is a benefit in putting on the record what some of these amendments entail. I only have a short time, but I intend to detail a couple which serve to underscore our argument that this is a bad deal. Amendment (2) goes to amend section 5. It provides a definition of public hospitals, which is fine, and adds these words: If a facility is situated in a State, Capital Territory or the Northern Territoryit is hard to imagine where a facility could otherwise be situated; so a public hospital anywhere in the countrythe Minister must not specify the facility in such an instrument without the written agreement of the State/Territory Health Minister of the State or Territory, as the case may be. Ask yourself why the Commonwealth did not see fit to put those words into the original legislation, but does now. As I said, it goes to this federal government having completely given up on any reform. They were desperate to do a deal that they have surrendered everything that was going to provide capacity to improve our public hospitals which is what the Australian public demand. I have some other amendments which I will go to shortly, but I ask the minister to address directly those issues so that I can have a response to that particular question. (Time expired)",45
35,Ms ROXON,NOES," This is not a Q and A session. This is a debate on the amendments. If the shadow minister wants to tell the House his other concerns, I am happy to listen to them and respond to them when he has done so.",46
36,Mr DUTTON,NOES," The Minister for Health and Ageing is having difficulty. My question went in particular to what financial penalty the Commonwealth could impose without consultation with the states and territories if there has been proven clinical failure, demonstrated incompetence or a failure of management at a particular hospital. If we saw, for argument's sake, the premature birth of a baby in a public hospital toilet outside an emergency waiting room, what could the minister do under this legislation that she cannot do now? They are important questions and they go specifically the Australian to the amendments. It is not for the minister to try to usurp the process of this parliament. The minister has to provide detailed responses. That is what the minister is obliged to do. Minister, what could you do if that happened in a public hospital today that you could not do under the previous arrangements without the aid of this legislation? I have further contributions to make. Ms Plibersek: Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your advice on whether this is a Q and A session or Senate estimates, or whether we are now dealing with the amendments to the legislation.",46
37,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES, My response is that the House is considering the bill in detail. Are there any further speakers on the question that the amendments be agreed to?,46
38,Ms ROXON,NOES," I am comfortable with providing comment on amendments if members want to raise questions on it. I am not going to allow this parliament to descend into a rambling Q and A from a shadow minister who has not asked me a question in question time for two years and is asking a question about something which is actually not the remit of this bill. He wants to know if there are financial penalties. This bill does not deal with financial arrangements between the states and territories. This bill and the amendments deal with the reporting of poor performance. He might want to ask, if there is that poor performance, what other sorts of financial impacts are there? But he cannot turn this debate into a general Q and A session when he cannot get through his own tactics people a question in question time and has not bothered to ask me a question about health or health reform for two years in question time. He cannot now come in here and try to use this for a rambling discussion about a whole range of other things. What we have before us is a detailed bill which is a fundamental change to the way that performance is going to be reported about our hospitals. It is going to provide much more information to the public and it is going to have a much more rigorous assessment process so that states and territories are not able to have poor data in an even worse scenario, have it somehow presented in a way which is fraudulent, as unfortunately we have seen with a couple of reported cases in various hospitals across country. No state or territory wants that to happen either, so this is now a process, and, with the amendments, is an agreed procedure between the states and the territories. I am very comfortable that it gives the new independent authority far-reaching power to do things that have never been done in our federation before. I accept that there are people in this House, and the member for Lyne is clearly one of them, who think that they are good steps but would like it to go even further. I accept that there are people who have that view, and I would imagine that there are people in that category whoonce this bill is passed, if it is passed, once the authority is set up-will be campaigners who will see what it delivers and will want to argue for further change into the future. But that is different to coming the federal opposition is doing, and having a general spray about every issue that they are frustrated about not being able to raise elsewhere and expecting me to enter into a debate with them about it. There are other forums of this House. Bring on a matter of public importance. Do some work yourself and move an amendment, rather than interjecting that the member for Lyne should move one if he feels strongly about this. Where are yours on that, if you think this is such an important issue? Let us actually use the parliament for what is intended. We are clearly going to have to agree to disagree. We get an opportunity to vote on these amendments. I understood, when I came into the House and asked the shadow minister if he was voting for these amendments, that he said or, yes. Now he has a whiff that the member for Lyne is not, so the opposition have changed their minds and now are not voting for the amendments. This is the sort of the policymaking that the federal opposition are into. They are not actually reading the bill. They are not making a decision about whether this is good or bad policy. They are looking at the politics. They think that if they have got one Independent they will be able to knock off this bill and that might be an embarrassment to the government, so they will jump on it. None of this is to do with any desire that the shadow minister has for hospitals to improve their services across the country. I am very confident that this bill, if enacted, will deliver fundamental change to the way we report hospital performance across the and country. It is on that basis that I commend the bill to the House, and I think that if the shadow minister does not have anything to say that is relevant to this debate then we should put the question that these in here, as amendments be agreed to.",46
39,Mr DUTTON,NOES," Just to clarify a couple of facts in this debate, I have been asking questions on health in this place. I have asked them of the Prime Minister over the course of the last two years because we cannot get a straight answer out of this health minister. We moved an amendment in relation to this bill only a few minutes ago. am not sure if the minister recalls that debate and, in fact, that vote. If it rings a bell, Minister, we did move an amendment, which the government, of course, did not support. I want the minister to provide in detail some response, as is required in this debate by any standard. The minister put before that essentially I wanted answers but then provided no answer. This is a performance authority, yes, but if there is not performance, what is the penalty? Is there a financial penalty that is imposed? Is money withheld? Can you demand from a state health minister particular outcomes at particular hospitals? What happens, Minister, if we see a tragic situation occur in a public hospital in a month's time after this legislation receives royal assent? How does that differ from your response today? What is the purpose of this legislation if you cannot direct change in our public hospitals? What is the purpose, if you have surrendered every aspect of responsibility that the Commonwealth wanted from this piece of legislation and you have provided that to the state and territory ministers? What has all of this debate been about over the course of the last three or four years, where the Labor Party have said that they want to fix public hospitals? That is a promise that has long been abandoned. Can the minister answer the question? If performance does not improve-in fact, if it deteriorates-in a public hospital somewhere in the country, what can she do as a result of this legislation? These are basic questions that the minister continues to refuse to answer. If people can look to this government and see any sincerity in what it is they are proposing by this legislation then I think the minister needs to get to her feet now and answer these reasonable questions so that we can at least have some faith that I we are moving forwards and not backwards.",47
40,Ms ROXON,NOES," I think we are going to be in for a very long and unedifying toing and froing, because I am answering the shadow minister's question by explaining to him that this piece of legislation does not deal with financial penalties to the states. It did not when we introduced it into the House and it does not with the amendments that are moved today. This is a fundamental misunderstanding by the shadow minister of the purpose of performance reporting. The purpose of performance reporting is not solely to be able to deal with one isolated, tragic incident that might occur in a particular hospital. We all know that the reality of people being unwell and presenting at hospitals can have tragic consequences. This is about moving beyond one isolated, tragic circumstance and looking at how we actually lift the standard across the board, across hospital services and across each and every hospital in the country. This sets up a system that enables us to provide information that is collected at arm's length and rigorously checked and therefore can be held up to the states, as systems managers order the local hospital networks to say: 'This is your performance. Look how it compares to everybody else's. You need to lift your game, and we will give you resources to do this and we'll do a whole range of other things.' The shadow minister for health cannot come in here and ignore every other part of the health reform bill and use this as an opportunity to have a general spray at the government. I know he does not agree with a whole range of things. Frankly, I am a little bit surprised to hear him say that he is now a big advocate of the reforms that were proposed by Prime Minister Rudd, because I seem to remember him and his leader in here ranting and raving, opposing them. Now that an agreement has been struck with every state and territory leader-which is different from but maintains the fundamentals that were put forward by Prime Minister Ruddthey are now actually advocates for that. Those opposite have no idea what sort of health policy they would adopt if they were in government. They did not take any policy to the last election and they are not formulating any that they are making clear here. Whilst I am happy to answer genuine questions about matters that relate to this bill and the amendments, it is not an opportunity to raise each and every other issue. I cannot be clearer in answering the question: this bill and these amendments do not go to any financial arrangements between the states and the Commonwealth.",48
41,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES, The question is that the amendments be agreed to. I hope the minister and the shadow minister have something new to contribute; that would be helpful.,49
42,Mr DUTTON,NOES," If we could see something new in this debate that provided us with some promise, some hope-even a slight glimmer-we would be happy, let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson. I think what the Minister for Health and Ageing has just done is bell the cat on what a failure this bill is. If members of the Australian public read this bill, the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011, they would look at the words 'National Health Performance Authority' and presumably, like me, think it was about the performance of our public hospitals and an authority that would improve that performance. But what the minister has basically just said is that what they are doing-again, in true Labor style-is creating yet another health bureaucracy. This was the great failing of the state Labor premiers: every time they received more money in Health, they did not put it into doctors, nurses or beds; they put it into new bureaucracies. The fact is that this is what is happening at a federal level. This is a new bureaucracy, a toothless tiger. It is going to gather statistics and look at poor performance and, in the end, do nothing about it. That is, I think, the best way to sum up this government's approach not just to health but to the whole running of government. This government has lurched from one policy disaster to the next, and now that dangerous disease has infected the health portfolio. This is a government that promised to increase performance, but at every turn-and we see the evidence in black and white in these 29 amendments-we see that they are not going to do anything more than give additional and overriding powers to the state premiers. I want to take the House to government amendment (7), which abolishes or strikes out the previous section, which had additional provisions about reports. Basically, there is a whole section that has been rewritten. Subsection (6) of the amendment reads: If the report indicates poor performance by: (a) a local hospital network in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory; or (b) a public hospital in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory; then, at least 15 days before completing the preparation of the report, the Performance Authority must give a copy of the final draft of the report to the manager of the network or hospital. But listen to this: The manager of the network or hospital is not entitled to give the Performance Authority any comments about the final draft. The government have gone completely insane with their proposed 29 amendments. This amendment takes away any meaningful capacity, once they have identified a poor performance, to do anything about it. That is why even the No. 1 ticket holder for this government, our friend the member for Lyne, says that this is a watering-down, this is bad policy and these amendments make bad policy worse. I think this is an opportunity for the member for Lyne and others to vote against these bad amendments. We will be voting against this bill because we believe that these amendments make a bad bill worse. Ms Roxon interjecting",49
43,Mr DUTTON,NOES,"That is the problem that this minister has. She has absolutely no capacity to deliver what is said publicly. There are other amendments which are worthy of noting, but in many parts they basically go towards withdrawing the minister's own capacity. I take the House to amendment (11), which alters section 93 of the bill. Subsection (1) says: The Performance Authority CEO is to be appointed by the Minister. That is in the bill in its original form. In the amendment, 'minister' has been struck out, with the performance authority CEO now to be appointed by the performance authority. Subsection (3) says: Before appointing a person as the Performance Authority CEO, the Minister must consult the Performance Authority. The minister, who has carriage of policy in this area, under the original bill had the power to make the appointment and was required to consult the performance authority on that. Otherwise, the minister was not overwhelmed with considerations; she just had to consult them. But government amendment (12) strikes out the words 'the minister must consult the performance authority' and inserts in its place the words: Performance Authority must consult the Minister. The minister does not have final say. The minister can provide some sort of feedback or response, like she is some sort of subservient public servant providing advice to a minister. The relationship has been flipped and it completely undermines this process. (Time expired)",50
44,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES," The question is that the amendments be agreed to. All those of that opinion say aye, to the contrary no. I think the ayes have it. Dr Southcott: Mr Deputy Speaker, I was on my feet.",50
45,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"No, you were not. Dr Southcott: I am on my feet.",50
46,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Yes, but I have put the question. I think the ayes have it. Is a division required?",50
47,Mr Baldwin,NOES,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I will seek to dissent from your ruling. Clearly, the member was on his feet seeking the call.",50
48,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The member was not on his feet seeking the call so I put the question.,50
49,Mr Baldwin,NOES,Then I will seek to dissent from your ruling.,50
50,Mr Dutton,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence, if it would help the course of the debate, I think in the circumstances it is reasonable to hear from the shadow parliamentary secretary for health in a succinct way and this is the process. That would preclude other courses.",50
51,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I understand the spirit in which that is offered. The fact is that the member for Boothby was sitting down. I therefore called for the division. For a member to rise after a division having been called, they are not entitled to get the call and to speak. Dr Southcott: Mr Deputy Speaker, we have not gone into a division. We are in the consideration in detail stage. We are still discussing the bill and the minister had had no chance to respond to the issues raised by the shadow minister. Ms Roxon: Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order, if I might contribute here, it would be a very unusual process and it is no doubt provoked by the toing and froing. I do not think it is in the House's interest for to be a dissent from a Speaker's ruling. I am comfortableMr Dutton interjecting Ms Roxon: If you would actually listen to what I am about to say, it might be helpful. For once, it will take two seconds for you to sit quietly while I say it was probably in the House's interest to be able to hear any other speakers, but I do think it is timely to bring this debate to a close. The shadow minister has spoken probably 10 times and not raised anything new. The member for Boothby has not spoken. It is an awkward position because the Deputy Speaker rightly put the question when noone was on their feet. But I am certainly comfortable, if it assists the House and the chair, for members to be able to make contributions. We are not seeking to stop that but, ultimately, the contributions should be about this debate and then we should bring the debate to a conclusion and allow the vote to be taken.",51
52,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES," member for Paterson wishes to withdraw his dissent, I will allow further discussion on the question that the amendments be agreed to.",51
53,Mr Baldwin,NOES,"I withdraw, given your statement, Mr Deputy Speaker.",51
54,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I call the member for Boothby.,51
55,Dr SOUTHCOTT,NOES," In speaking to the government amendments, I am interested in amendment (7) and the scope of the report. Specifically, what this amendment talks about is the reports prepared by the National Health Performance Authority which will indicate poor performance by any of the following entities or facilities, and it goes on. Specifically under this section it talks about 'any other body or organisation that provides healthcare there services'. My question to the minister is: does this encompass primary healthcare services which are delivered by the state governments? Does this cover the ambulance services which are covered by state and territory legislation? Does it cover, for example, the child and adolescent mental health services which are covered at the state level? Does it cover any other primary care services which have been areas of responsibility for states? Most importantly of all, does it cover general practice? The RACGP have been particularly interested in this issue. I am seeking clarification on this because the clarification is not there in the bill. It says in this proposed amendment by the government, which is amendment (7), to clause 62(1)(e), 'any other body or organisation that provides health care services'. I am asking the minister: does it cover any of the organisations which I have mentioned? What is the scope of the reports prepared by the performance authority? Do they cover If the general practice? Do they cover those primary healthcare services which are currently delivered by state governments and which are enshrined in state and territory legislations? My other question on this is: does the minister require the permission of the territory minister for health in those areas which are state primary healthcare services, state-run community healthcare services, state-run community mental health care services and state-run ambulance services and are they covered by the scope of these reports?",51
56,Ms ROXON,NOES," I am happy to answer a question on an issue for debate which is actually on the topic of this legislation and amendments. As is set out clearly in the detail of these amendments, the bodies that the Health Performance Authority will report on are public and private hospitals, local hospital networks and Medicare Locals. As the member for Boothby would know, Medicare Locals do have a remit which goes broadly across a particular community and will include the level of services, for example, provided by GPs in the community. It is not a reporting function about individual GPs, if that is the question that you are asking. On the question of the scope to report on other state funded services, for example ambulance services that have never been included as part of the health system although they are obviously a vital part of how the health system works, they are not captured by this reporting. There is a provision, as the member for Lyne mentioned, that COAG can agree to extend the remit of the Health Performance Authority, so it might in its negotiations decide that X, Y and Z in the future should also be reported upon, and that would be something that the performance authority then would be able to do. It has been created by an agreement of COAG. This legislation gives force to that agreement struck by COAG. Its reach and remit does not extend beyond that agreement unless there is a state or future agreement that extends it.",52
57,Dr SOUTHCOTT,NOES," I am seeking further clarification on the same amendment-amendment (7). Proposed section 62(1) talks about the scope of the reports prepared by the performance authority and specifically about the entities or facilities which it can report on and it says in paragraph (e): any other body or organisation that provides health care services. As we stand here today with the current COAG agreements, are there any bodies or organisations that are covered by this paragraph? Is this just a catch-all paragraph that will allow any future decisions of COAG to include things? Does it include, for example, local government authorities that are offering immunisation services? Does it cover, for example, the Royal District Nursing Service? Does it cover things like home visits by nurses as well? I am seeking clarification from the minister as to the scope of proposed paragraph (e), which states: any other body or organisation that provides health care services. On reading it, it could be extremely broad. From what the minister has said, it is not envisaged that a number of the areas I have mentioned-such as the state primary healthcare services and general practice-are included by this paragraph. So what is included by this paragraph?",52
58,Mr LAMING,NOES," Again my question relates to the scope of amendment (7) and proposed section 62(1)(a) that covers the local hospital network. Mindful that data is already collected by the Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and by the COAG Reform Council around performance measures in hospitals-and obviously the AIHW performs an important role-I want to know what is in this legislation to avoid duplication of data collection, collecting data that has different baselines and benchmarks collected from different periods and collecting data that is unable to be compared accurately. What are the arrangements between the four bodies I mentioned to ensure that that reporting is harmonised so we can make sense of different reports, minimise the overlap and ensure there are not data omissions? Finally, which of these NHPA rated responsibilities for data collection could not have been done already by those existing three bodies?",52
59,Ms ROXON,NOES," I will deal with both of those contributions. I refer the member for Boothby to amendment (5), which requires COAG agreement to extend the scope. Amendment (7) deals with the way reporting works but not the scope of what else can be reported. I think that should satisfy his request for clarification. The member for Bowman raised a very legitimate question about the range of data that is already collected and also concerns about timely data and comparable data. One of the big changes that have been agreed to by the states and territories as part of this negotiation and the introduction of the performance authority is the streamlining of reporting so it is more timely, comparable across jurisdictions and able to be provided hospital by hospital. The Health Performance Authority will work with those existing datasets and in some areas create new datasets to be able to do its job properly. range of things that were not available before will be available when the Health Performance Authority is able to do its work properly. We will have truly comparable and timely data about each hospital across jurisdictions. Health ministers have already agreed to do some work on how we can streamline all of the different existing datasets. We do not have any interest in reporting for reporting sake. We want the reporting to be better in having more indicators and being more comparable across the country. Whilst everyone said we should look at what the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare collects and we should look at what is already provided for reporting in each of the states, we also are moving forward on agreed national reporting measures, for example, on infection rates. In October this year for the first time hospital-by-hospital infection rates will be published on the My Hospitals website. None of that could have happened if we did not have agreement on how we are going to progress with all of this performance reporting.",53
60,Dr SOUTHCOTT,NOES," My question relates to the My Hospitals website. The My Hospitals website has information about the sorts of patients that are seen in emergency departments, waiting times and waiting lists in various subspecialties within each hospital. In terms of the scope of the reports that are to be prepared by the performance authority, what consideration has been given to looking at things which relate to quality and safety in the local hospital networks, the public hospitals and the private hospitals? The minister mentioned in her previous answer looking at the infection rates for the first time. It sounds like a good idea to have an idea of the infection rates in an individual hospital. What measures are proposed by the So a performance authority to look at quality and safety: mortality rates within a certain period in a hospital, mortality rates after discharge, complication rates from surgery and any complications that occur during the admissions?",53
61,Ms ROXON,NOES," I do not have all of that detail here in front of me right now. There are a whole range of them and this is a very complex bill. I might remind the House that the shadow minister was briefed on these amendments and, as I say, less than an hour ago told us that he supported them. I am not questioning that other members have legitimate concerns. I am happy for them to be provided with a briefing. But the truth is that the opposition have indicated they oppose these amendments now, although an hour ago they did not. I do not think that it will serve this parliament much more to continue this ongoing Q&A about a whole range of different issues. I am happy to provide that information as the bill makes its way through the rest of the parliamentary process, but I think it is well and truly time for the amendments to be put.",54
62,Mr LAMING,NOES," I thank the minister for answering the first of my two questions. She emphasised that there is an effort through amendment (7) to harmonise the data collection and reporting. The second part of my question is: what parts of the work that has been assigned to the authority could not have been done by the existing structures already in place? I go back to the question: can she explicitly explain? This is the basis for the entire legislation and also of course it begs the question: if we need to set up a fifth authority to monitor the other four are we going to be back here again setting up a sixth one to monitor the previous five? What is it with the COAG Reform Council, the AIHW and the Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care that makes them unable to do the very things that have been described in this legislation that are being assigned authority? That comes under the scope of the work in amendment (7).",54
63,Ms ROXON,NOES," I think that comment just reveals that, for some reason unknown to us, there is a delaying tactic being undertaken by the Liberal Party. Every bit of the legislation, the second reading amendment, the summing-up speeches and the speaking on the amendments makes clear what new role the Health Performance Authority takes. I stand by all of those comments and I refer the shadow minister to those if he is genuinely interested in it. The government has no more comments to make on these amendments.",54
64,Dr SOUTHCOTT,NOES," This goes to amendment (7), which talks about the reports prepared by the performance authority, and specifically 'if the report indicates poor performance by any of the following entities or facilities'. While it might be very clear what would constitute poor performance for local hospital networks, public hospitals and private hospitals, I am seeking clarification from the minister as to what would constitute poor performance by a primary healthcare organisation which would be caught in the scope of amendment (7). It seems that while primary healthcare organisations-or, as they have been called, Medicare Localshave some role in the area of service delivery, in that they are going to be taking responsibility for after-hours care, they will not principally be in the front line of service delivery. The department has assured us that the primary healthcare organisations will not be fund-holding organisations, as we see in similar organisations in the United Kingdom or in New Zealand. So, given that the scope of the primary healthcare organisations is still a little illdefined, I am seeking clarification as to what to the would constitute poor performance by a primary health organisation. Would it be that they are not offering enough continuous professional development? Would it be that they are not holding enough seminars? Would it be that they are not liaising well enough with allied health or practice nurses? I am just seeking clarification from the minister as to what would constitute poor performance by a primary healthcare organisation as is envisaged in amendment (7).",54
65,Mr DUTTON,NOES," It is with a great deal of regret, I think, that the minister now refuses even to respond. This is a very important parliamentary process.",55
66,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES," The member for Dickson, and everybody, should realise that consideration in detail is not question time. Dr Southcott: It is consideration in detail.",55
67,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES, consideration in detail. There is actually no requirement under the standing orders for the minister to respond. The chair has given a great deal of latitude in this regard.,55
68,Mr DUTTON,NOES,"I do think that it is a very important parliamentary process to be able to consider in detail amendments moved by the government. These are important questions because they go to the very soul of how our health system will operate into the next generation. This is a government that proclaimed that they wanted to fix public hospitals. They have created all these new bureaucracies. They have now capitulated and weakened even the original process that they put forward. They now have 29 amendments on the books. Yet, remarkably, the government will not go to the detail of the amendments, either because they do not know the detail or because they are embarrassed by the detail. To go to your point, Madam Deputy Speaker, nobody pretends that this is about question time; but what does consideration in detail mean if the coalition cannot ask questions about the detail of the amendments? These are not flippant, tidyingup, clerical error type amendments that you sometimes see in this place. These are substantive amendments, 29 in total, and they completely water down, completely dilute, the original intent of the legislation. In some places whole sections have been struck out and new words have been submitted, and it is quite appropriate for us to ask detailed questions about why that has taken place. But, as importantly, it is incumbent upon the minister to answer in detail those considerations. To sit there silently and not contribute to the debate I think is a poor reflection on the minister and also shows the minister's contempt for you, Madam Deputy Speaker, as the chair in this place, and for the parliamentary process. We have reasonable It is questions that we want to continue to ask. We are frustrated by the process-there is no question about that-because right from the start the questions that were put have not properly been answered. We asked the minister reasonable questions from the commencement of this consideration in detail. The minister has plucked out a couple of questions and answered those, but the detail has not been forthcoming from the government. As I say, people need to ask the question: why wouldn't reasonable questions be answered by this minister? If this minister had an involvement in the construct of these amendments, why wouldn't this minister be prepared to step up and defend the amendments? If the coalition has questions to ask about why significant changes have been made-necessarily it seems at the hands of the premiers in order to do a deal by a desperate Prime Minister-why wouldn't the health minister in accord with the standing procedures in this place answer those reasonable questions? This is not a process where a minister can come in, with due respect to the minister, and somehow answer the questions that suit the minister's own knowledge but completely ignore those questions for which she has no substantive response. I think it is for the minister to answer the questions that have been put but not yet answered. It is incumbent upon the minister so that there is faith in this process for the doctors and nurses who are waiting to see whether or not this will substantially change their workplace and whether or not this is going to be the reform that people thought they voted for in 2007 and 2010. The minister's accountability is at question here. I think it is absolutely absurd if the minister continues to refuse to partake in this debate because we will continue to contribute and put questions until this minister answers the reasonable questions that have been put. If this process has to continue on until question",55
69,Dr SOUTHCOTT,NOES," The more I read these amendments, the more questions they pose. In terms of amendment (7) I do have some questions about the reports which will be prepared by the performance authority. The amendments go into quite a lot of detail about what must be done if the report indicates poor performance, the consultation that must be done with the state and territory health ministers and that they must be given an opportunity to respond. In reading the legislation and reading the amendments it is not clear what happens to the reports after they have been prepared. My question to the minister is: is there any requirement for these reports to be made public within a certain period of time? This is especially important in the area of quality and safety-there have been disasters in Australia, for example in the Bundaberg Hospital, and we do not want to see a repeat of what happened at Bundaberg Hospital. We need to know, if reports show poor performance in the local hospital network or in a public hospital, that these reports will ultimately be made public. Amendment (7) talks a lot about the consultation and the periods of consultation that are required but my question here is: what is the requirement on making these reports public? Is there a specific time line here? We would like to know when we will be able to see them and when these reports will be made public. I go back to my previous questions that still have not been answered on the area of primary healthcare organisations. ",56
70,Dr SOUTHCOTT,NOES,"They have not been answered, dopey.",56
71,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES," The member will withdraw and the member will not interject. This is not helping time, it will. the situation.",56
72,Dr SOUTHCOTT,NOES,"I withdraw. I thank the minister for her answers to my earlier questions, but I still have an unanswered question about what constitutes poor performance by a primary healthcare organisation. Would this be in the area of the delivery of after-hours services? Would it be if they are not sufficiently making networks with allied health practitioners or practice nurses-what would really constitute that? I also am particularly interested in quality and safety. I would like to know what quality and safety information will be prepared and made available to the public in these reports that are being prepared by the performance authority.",56
73,Mr OAKESHOTT,NOES," I raise from a tactical point of view what is becoming increasingly clear to everyone in this chamber. I raise it in defence of parliamentary processes and I raise it as, most people would know, a strong advocate of MPs' rights-that is, that the arch enemy of parliamentary processes and an MP's rights is the filibuster. What we are increasingly seeing before us is a tactic to filibuster. I do not know why. That is up to the coalition to defend, but the indication from the member for Dickson that he wants to push this through to question time and the indication from the member for Boothby that he is only just reading these amendments clearly demonstrate that this is a tactic over and above a true and genuine parliamentary process of inquiry into amendments before the House. I do not think I have ever supported the gag, I would have to go back and check my record, but I am not far away from actually moving it. I would hope that we have genuine questions being asked, we have genuine responses and we wrap up what has been at least a 50-minute conversation with very little contribution now to genuine consideration of these amendments.",56
74,Mr DUTTON,NOES," I want to address briefly those remarks and again I am sure they are held sincerely. There is no filibustering going on. The fact is that we have asked questions, Member for Lyne, and we have not received adequate responses. The member for Lyne may well be satisfied with what the government has put up. He has expressed some concerns and he is going to take a certain course of action. I respect that. It is his right to do that as a member of this parliament. We have not sought to cut short his contribution, and nor would we. But we have serious misgivings about this bill. Many of the reasons that you stated in your earlier contribution, Member for Lyne, cause us even more grief because we think that this government, by moving its 29 amendments, is without precedent in this public debate about health. They are substantive amendments, as I say-they are not 'tidy up' amendments-and they deserve an adequate and fulsome response from the minister. So, yes, we are frustrated, as I said before. There is no question about that. The Bills Digest talks about these points. It says: It is unlikely that the Authority, as a single entity, will be able to achieve these objectives … Does that not cause the House concern? It goes on to say: This Bill does not provide any details on how the three national governance agencies will work together to deliver improvements in the Australian health system. That is exactly the point that we are trying to make. These are reasonable questions asked by the people from the library who prepare the Bills Digest. They are not members of the coalition, they are not Independents, they are not people who support or oppose the government",57
75,Mr Baldwin,NOES,They're truly independent.,57
76,Mr DUTTON,NOES,"These are truly independent people asking these questions. So why would it be unreasonable for us to ask these questions? More importantly, why would it be unreasonable for the minister to answer the questions? The Bills Digest goes on to say: It is not yet clear how the ‗upstream‘ National Health Performance Authority proposed in this Bill will connect with ‗downstream‘ factors … That goes directly to questions being asked by both of the shadow parliamentary secretaries for health on this issue, so those questions are completely reasonable. The Bills Digest goes on to say: This Bill … does not give the Authority any enforcement powers … That is exactly the point we were trying to make before. What penalties are in place? If the government, having collected all this data, having created this new bureaucracy, having spent all of this money, are not happy with the way in which the data is trending, what can they do? This is a basic question and it has been raised not just by us but by the Parliamentary Library, the member for Lyne and others. The Bills Digest goes on: It is unclear how many primary health care providers will be monitored directly by the National Health Performance Authority. That, again, goes to questions that were reasonably asked before. I do not think that a guillotining in this situation should even be canvassed, frankly, until these questions have been properly answered. For the minister to stay in her seat and refuse to contribute answers to reasonable questions is unacceptable. In conclusion, the Digest makes a number of other points, and I think it goes to the concerns, as I have said before, of many stakeholders-not just those of the coalition and the member for Lyne. Those stakeholders have a real interest, as do many of us, in making sure that these reforms are tangible, are meaningful and achieve the aspirations that many of us in this place, including the member for Lyne, have spoken about both privately and publicly. That is why I think it is completely reasonable for us to put these questions and, most importantly, for the minister to respond. It is incumbent upon the minister to at least make some contribution to try and answer what are reasonable questions.",57
77,Mr SNOWDON,NOES,"Lingiari-Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (11:56): I want to make an observation. I have been in this parliament off and on for 24 years. I have seen different tactics used in this place to try and thwart debate. I have seen filibustering and attempts to change the dynamic. But it is a bit of an affront, given the history of this legislation and the detailed briefings the shadow minister has received around this legislation, to have him and his colleagues doing this. They are genuinely nice people by and large. We get on okay; we can all be mates. But I think it is worthwhile for them to ask themselves why they are doing this at this point. What is your attitude to the legislation-do you support the health reform process or not? If you do not, if you plan to vote against the legislation in any event, given that the amendments will have already been voted on, why are we participating in this farce? I think it raises serious questions about the judgments which are being made. I have been in my office engaging in meetings since the last division and I have had on in the background the parliamentary debates. With great respect to the shadow minister, I have not seen the minister demure; I have seen her fully engaged in the discussion. She has chosen, rightfully, to hear you out and to provide the capacity in other places-because this will be dealt with in the Senate as well-to deal with this. If your concerns are genuine you could have raised them in direct dialogue, through the process of briefing. You have not done that, and today we see you, after this legislation has been in place for a number of months, reading from the Bills Digest. It makes one wonder what your game is. I say to the shadow minister-with great respect, Madam Deputy Speaker-that, if he is genuine about a discussion around these issues, this is not the tactic to adopt. We expect that, when these amendments are voted on, they will be opposed by the opposition. So what is this process all about? I suspect that the shadow minister, if he were in our shoes, would be asking the very same question. I say to the shadow minister-and I heard the member for Lyne, whose views I respect-that this is culminating in a filibuster. I say to the shadow minister that it is in our best interests that this debate be concluded. Vote against the amendments if that is your desire. They will be dealt with somewhere else and we will have a further discussion. This is not the end of the debate, as you know. If you were concerned about the content of the Bills Digest, why was it not raised previously? You have had plenty of opportunity to do so. I support the views being expressed by the member for Lyne. It is about time you took a mature approach to this discussion and conceded that we should finish this part of it and get on to the next stage.",58
78,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES," Before I call the next speaker, I point out, as the member for Paterson has rightly done, that this is consideration in detail of the bill before us. I have allowed a latitude around what we are debating, but we will return to the bill before us. We will understand that consideration in detail is to consider the bill; it is not a question and answer session. The standing orders do not provide for anything otherwise. If you wish to establish a new procedure, you should take it to the Procedure Committee.",59
79,Mr LAMING,NOES," I, for one, am happy to be judged on the quality of the questions asked and by our scrutiny of the conduct of the minister, who is refusing to answer these questions. Already, one out of two questions has not been answered, so I focus again on amendment (7), which involves proposed subsections 62(5), (6), (7) and (8). My great concern with 62(5) is that, apart from the obligation upon the performance authority minister to give a copy, invite comments and have regard, after that this legislation and this particular amendment are silent on what occurs next. In 62(6), I am concerned about the reference to the manager of the network, who, having received a report 15 days prior to its completion indicating that there is poor Byrne, AM performance, is not entitled to give any comments on that final draft. I think it is a fair question and the public is entitled to expect an answer as to why it is in the public interest for that not to occur. We would like a clear understanding of 62(7) and (8), given that over this four-year process these were only released weeks ago. Before completing a report, the performance authority is at liberty to consult with any persons or bodies it considers appropriate, yet, if that report does indicate poor performance, Minister, the performance authority must not consult and is not otherwise obliged to observe any requirements of procedural fairness. Minister, my third question to you is this: regarding 62(7) and (8), why, in the preparation of a report, is it appropriate for the performance authority to consult with any person or body it wishes but if that report, particularly focused on a local hospital network or a territory hospital, indicates poor performance the performance authority must not consult, having, prior to that report being prepared, been at liberty to consult? I think it is a very important distinction that needs to be clarified in this consideration in detail stage.",59

84,Mr ANDREWS,PAIRS," I indicate, without detaining the House too long, that this a bill which, in a sense, makes some technical amendments to the legislation in a range of matters. These are matters which are important in terms of the legislation itself and the operation of social security legislation in this country. (Quorum formed) I apologise to those members who had to rush back to the House-not on every occasion a quorum is called but on this occasion. I thank them and the government for their cooperation in this regard. As I said, the Security and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 will introduce several measures affecting primarily the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs portfolio. The bill seeks to amend the Social Security Act 1991 to enable parenting payment recipients to transfer temporarily to bereavement allowances following the death of a partner, remove the family member exemption from the two-year newly arrived residents' waiting period before special benefit is payable, enable the minister to make legislative instruments determining impairments tables and rules relating to the tables and clarify that payments made by an employer to an employee in lieu of a notice of termination are regarded as redundancy payments for the purposes of social security Bill 2011 payments. The Disability Services Act 1986 will also be amended to provide the disability advocacy services. Compliance with the disability advocacy standards will be assessed by an independent certification body over a three-year cycle. The bill also seeks to amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 in relation to certain asset test exempt income streams and the provision of actuarial certificates. Schedule 1 of the bill-bereavement allowance-would provide parenting payment recipients access to bereavement allowance on the death of a partner. The Social Security Act prevents a parenting payment recipient from qualifying for bereavement allowance on the death of his or her partner. The original intent of the legislation was that the surviving member of a couple who had dependent children would continue to receive parenting payment single rather than transferring temporarily to the equivalent of bereavement allowance and then back to parenting payment single. Historically, there was no financial advantage in transferring between these payment types. The introduction of the secure and sustainable pension reform package in September 2009 resulted in an increase to the single rate of certain pension types, including bereavement allowance. Allowing parenting payment recipients to transfer temporarily to bereavement allowance will provide additional assistance. Schedule 2-special benefit-would align access to special benefit for certain visa holders with other migrants by removing the family member exemption from the two-year newly arrived resident's waiting period before special benefit is payable. Temporary visa holders may qualify for special benefit if the visa is included in a class of visas set out in a determination made by the minister. Currently, special benefit is payable to these temporary visa holders on arrival in Australia if suffering hardship, whereas other migrants would be subject to the newly arrived resident's waiting period and must wait two years before special benefit is payable, unless they can demonstrate both financial hardship and a substantial change in circumstances beyond their control after arrival in Australia. An exemption from the newly arrived resident's waiting period is provided to a family member under the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Act 1997. The Social Security Act defines a family member as a partner or a dependent child. As a result, unlike other newly arrived migrants, these temporary visa holders can receive special benefit much earlier than migrants entering with permanent visas. As a result of the changes made by this schedule, in respect of claims for special benefit lodged on or after 1 January 2012, the exemption from the newly arrived resident's waiting period will no longer apply to a holder of a visa that is in a class of visas determined under unless another exception applies. This change means that provisional partner visa holders will need to demonstrate that they have experienced a substantial change of circumstances beyond their control after arrival in Australia, in addition to financial hardship, in order to access special benefit. Schedule 3-impairment tables for disability support pension-removes the current impairment tables from 1 January 2012 and enables the minister to introduce new impairment tables through a legislative instrument. This schedule also establishes that the minister may make a legislative instrument setting out the new impairment tables and guidelines containing the rules relating to the new impairment tables. The placement of the impairment tables in a legislative instrument will enable the impairment tables to be updated more frequently. Schedule 4-disability advocacy services-provides for the introduction of a third-party certification quality assurance system for disability advocacy services. It is argued that the new quality assurance system will provide greater assurances about the quality of disability advocacy support by introducing mechanisms independent from government to assess the compliance of disability advocacy services against a tailored set of new disability advocacy standards. The current quality assurance system has not changed since 1997 and does not provide assurances about the quality of disability advocacy support being provided. Under the new quality assurance system, the compliance of disability advocacy services with the new disability advocacy standardswhich will be set out in a legislative instrument-is assessed by an independent certification body over a three-year cycle. The quality assurance system is based on the Joint Accreditation System of Australian and New Zealand-JAS-ANZ-under which JAS-ANZ is the accreditation body that accredits certification bodies to undertake certification assessments of disability advocacy services. This third-party certification system has been successfully in place for disability employment services since 2002. Schedule 5-asset test exempt income streams-would make a number of amendments relating to the treatment of certain asset test exempt income streams. Under the social security law, lifetime and life expectancy income streams receive concessional treatment for the assets test, provided they meet the requirements under sections 9A and 9B of the Social Security Act. This means that the asset value of the income stream is not taken into account when determining whether a social security payment is payable to a person. Similarly, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, in sections 5JA and 5JB, also extends a concessional treatment under its assets test when the equivalent requirements are met. Due to changes in economic and market conditions, the probability that a provider of an income stream will be able to pay the income stream as required under the contract or governing rules could fluctuate quite markedly, even over a short period of time. As a result, some social security customers provide the secretary-and, in similar circumstances, veterans affairs pensioners provide the Repatriation Commission-with actuarial certificates that fail to meet the probability test, which results in their income stream becoming subject to the assets test, within the 26-week grace period, until they obtain a favourable certificate that meets the high probability test. This schedule also clarifies that the grace period in which a person must provide a new actuarial certificate for an income stream applies from the beginning of the particular financial year-that is, from 1 July-and ends when a new actuarial certificate is given to the secretary or, as the case may be, the Repatriation Commission, in relation to that income stream for that financial year or at the end of the period of 26 weeks beginning on 1 July of that financial year. If a person does not give the secretary or the Repatriation Commission a new actuarial certificate in relation to the income stream by the end of the 26-week period, the income stream will lose its asset test exemption. Schedule 6-termination paymentsseeks to clarify that payments made by an employer to an employee in lieu of notice of termination are regarded as redundancy payments for the purposes of the social security law. The Social Security Act provides for an income maintenance period to be applied to people who have claimed, or are in receipt of, certain social security payments and have received a redundancy or leave payment. The income maintenance period is the period in which redundancy payments, or leave payments, are treated as income under the act. Income maintenance periods are applied because people who receive leave or redundancy payments from their employer are expected to use these payments to support themselves for a period before turning to the social security system for assistance. The amendments made by this schedule clarify that a payment made to a person in lieu of notice of the termination of their employment is a redundancy payment high for the purposes of the Social Security Act. The effect of this is that a payment in lieu of notice will be included when calculating whether the person has to serve an income maintenance period and the length of that period. The changes made by this schedule ensure that people who receive payments in lieu of notice are treated in the same way as people who receive other types of redundancy or termination payments. The amendments made by this schedule apply to payments in lieu of notice made on or after the commencement of this schedule. The schedule commences on the day after royal assent. As I indicated at the outset, these are sensible amendments that would be made, I suspect, regardless of who is in government, and for that reason the coalition does not oppose them.",62
85,Mr NEUMANN,PAIRS," I speak in support of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. I will concentrate particularly on schedules (3) and (4). As the previous speaker said, there are a number of sensible amendments that update disability provisions to make sure that we enhance the integrity of the social security and veterans affairs legislation in this country. There are a number of important changes and the first schedule deals with one of these. It makes sure that parenting payment recipients can access bereavement allowance following the death of a partner, giving them a helping hand in circumstances where they are going through the grief and difficulties that arise with the loss of a one. Historically, that first schedule has provided no financial advantage in transferring between types of payment. The bill gives parenting payment recipients access to a bereavement allowance, from 1 January 2012, following the death of their partner. It is a degree of compassion that means for a period of 14 weeks they can receive additional financial support, which they would need. It is difficult for people who go through these circumstances. There are added expenses, including funeral expenses, associated with the death of a partner and so this is a sensible, compassionate and charitable way to improve the lot of people in communities across the country. The second schedule deals with the special benefit. This deals circumstances which make it a sensible arrangement for provisional partner visa holders to have the same requirements as other new migrants who have a more restricted access to a special benefit. This is a matter of aligning the circumstances of different people. Other new migrants not only have a waiting period but also have to demonstrate financial hardship and a change of circumstances outside their control. We are changing the circumstances for provisional partner visa holders to make sure that those two factors are now taken into consideration. It makes sure that the system is consistent across the country. (Quorum formed) The coalition-who said these reforms are necessary and would have been passed if they were on the Treasury benches-are not interested in reform of disability legislation and are not interested in reform to improve the integrity of the system. The member for Cowper should hang his head in shame for calling a quorum loved in these circumstances. This is important reform. The previous speaker could not get here in time with his notes and it just goes to show the utter contempt and disregard the coalition have for sensible legislative reform. I will talk briefly on the third aspect, the very sensible asset test exemption income stream. It clarifies the period in which a person must provide a new actuarial certificate on lifetime and life expectancy income streams and is a sensible reform as well. There is a termination change in schedule 6 of the social security legislation. We know that this is important because people are made redundant and redundancy payments are taken into consideration with social security payments. That is why this schedule is important. The final two schedules I will briefly focus on deal with issues of impairment with tables for disability support pensions and with the disability advocacy services. This bill removes outdated impairment tables for the disability support pension and enables the minister to introduce a new impairment table through a disallowable legislative instrument. This gives effect to the 2009-10 budget Better and Fairer Assessments measure. The reform of disability care and support has been a priority of this government, and I welcome the Productivity Commission report that we saw recently. The national disability insurance scheme, which this government has shown significant commitment to by putting $10 million on the table to support technical policy work in this regard, and the new COAG select council of ministers, which will be established and lead to greater reform in this area, are indications, along with the advisory group to the select council, that this government is committed to repairing the dysfunctional system of disability support in this country. There are changes to the impairment tables, and they were announced in the 200910 year. The tables were last reviewed in 1993 and they contain a number of anomalies and inconsistencies-for example, assistance can be provided for hearing aids but that is not included in the assessment for hearing impairment. Visual assessment is assessed with glasses as well. There are a number of disability advocacy groups. The advisory committee recommended a thorough review, and it was found that the impairment tables were right out of date. The report recommended that new impairment tables be used for eligibility for disability support pensions from 1 January 2012. These tables are brought in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. The final aspect I want to touch on relates to issues concerning disability advocacy service. The bill introduced a third-party certification quality assurance system for disability advocacy services. We have had a long commitment to making sure we look after the most vulnerable sections of our society, and we have made a commitment in this regard. Stronger quality assurance for disability advocacy services is important. Development of a robust quality assurance system is really important for people in the disability support sector. The third-party certification quality assurance system in this bill has been successfully in place since about 2002, and we think this will be improved with this legislative reform. I am very strongly committed to making sure people in my area of Ipswich and West Moreton who have been disabled-and we have had a long history with large numbers of people suffering from disability in our area-are cared for properly. This goes back to the days of the Challinor Centre, which is an institution that in its first guise was an asylum for people who were previously described as 'lunatics'. That place is currently the location of the University of Queensland Ipswich campus. From that time and the deinstitutionalisation that took place in the eighties and nineties, the low cost of housing meant that Ipswich and the rural areas outside were areas for a large number of people with disabilities and their carers to live. In fact, Carers Queensland told me not long ago that I had in Blair the largest number of carers in Queensland for any federal electorate. So this is an important reform of the national disability insurance scheme. Anything that deals with disability service is extremely important for my electorate. I am putting on a national disability insurance forum in my electorate for people to come to. For any constituents who are listening, they can contact my office and we will give them the details of that. Later this year I will be running what we call the Blair Disability Links at the Brassall Shopping Centre. It is an expo where all the disability support groups across the electorate of Blair can come. They provide services and information. I congratulate the Brassall Shopping Centre, who have been the supporters of this, and I urge everyone in my electorate to contact me about the important activities of the Blair Disability Links and the national disability insurance scheme forum that we will be having in the next few months. I support this legislation. I think it is good for our system and it is good that we care for those with disabilities.",65
86,Mr SIMPKINS,PAIRS," I certainly welcome the opportunity today to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. As my constituents would be aware, I am an absolute supporter of the responsibility of government to provide that hand up to people who need such support. It is through the prism of the hand up and not the handout that we must always see welfare payments in this country. Those entitled to such support must be provided with it, and those who are not entitled to it must not receive it. My last newsletter reflected the common view of my constituents that they support such assistance; but, where anyone who seeks to obtain such assistance does so without entitlement and illegally, I certainly encourage my constituents to report such persons. It has been my experience that Australians dislike someone something that they are not entitled to, and that is the case with some welfare payment issues. However, I think Australians should be more willing to become involved and report such issues. But we are not here today for that. Instead we are here today to debate how to make the system more efficient and better for Australians. I know that across the 25 suburbs of Cowan there are people in need of welfare support. There are people who have to work within the confines of their disability. There are people who are in need of the various forms of payments, pensions and allowances that are available for Australians and residents of Australia. Through Girrawheen, Alexander Heights, Marangaroo, Ballajura-basically all the suburbs-there are people who are in need of support, and I welcome that support. There has been a lot said lately on the concept of the national disability insurance scheme. Certainly in the last couple of months I have had more and more contact with people who are involved in the disability area. I would like to thank Ann Wood, one of my constituents, who brought her son to me and made it very clear the life that she has to live with her son and the difficulties that they have had. She also made it clear that there are a lot of breakdowns and systemic problems that need to be addressed. I think we are united as a parliament in the view that a system that is broken needs to be dealt with and dealt with quickly. So I welcome the Productivity Commission report. I know from my discussions with the coalition leadership on this matter that we look forward to be giving the Productivity Commission report generous consideration in the future. We will work through these problems to try to get a better, sustainable, long-term deal for those who are labouring taking under the issues of disability-both families and the person who has the disability. We certainly welcome that step forward, but as we know it has been estimated that some $6 billion is going to be required to sort out a National Disability Insurance Scheme. That will be challenging, but there must be a way that we can work through it with the states to make sure that we end up with the right result. I will now move through the bill and talk about some of the issues that are involved. This bill deals with a range of income support measures, including those for veterans and for the disabled. It puts forward a range of changes that will better ensure that Australia's income support system provides more appropriate assistance to some of the most vulnerable members of our community. These are measures which the coalition supports. The first of these changes is to allow recipients of parenting payments access to bereavement allowance. It goes without saying that the loss of a spouse or a partner has a devastating impact upon individuals and families, and quite apart from the emotional effects that result from bereavement there is invariably a financial aspect to consider as well. I understand from changes that were made in 2009 that the Social Security Act as it currently stands prevents a person receiving a parenting payment from qualifying for bereavement allowance upon the death of their partner. A typical situation is that someone on a parenting payment who is met with the death of their partner is not able to move onto the bereavement allowance. Under the changes in this bill, and rightly so, they will be allowed to do so, and then after that period they may move back to the parenting payment (single). Before 2009, that did not place vulnerable people at a disadvantage, and this bill will remedy the situation of the 2009 changes. This bill also makes changes to correct an anomaly in the operation of special benefit for certain visa holders by removing the family member exemption from the newly arrived resident's two-year waiting period for special benefit. As things presently stand, temporary visa holders may gain access to special benefit if their visa falls within a class of visa set out in a determination made by the minister. As a result, special benefit payable to temporary visa holders upon arrival in Australia if they are suffering hardship, whilst other migrants on other visa types are subject to the usual arrangements. Other migrants must wait for two years before a special benefit is payable, unless they are able to prove that both financial hardship and changes to their circumstances beyond their control have occurred following their arrival in Australia. In other words, temporary visa holders whose visas fall into a certain category can receive a special benefit much earlier than those migrants coming to Australia with permanent visas. The changes contained in this bill will result in a fairer application of requirements for special benefit and will ensure that assistance is genuinely being provided to those in the greatest need. The bill also seeks to update what are known as the 'impairment tables' to ensure that Australia's legislation reflects contemporary approaches to medical treatment and rehabilitation. In order to access the disability support pension, an individual must have an impairment that rates at 20 points or more under the impairment tables. As the previous speaker said, the tables currently being used were last subject to a comprehensive review 18 years ago in 1993. Given the advances in technology, changed approaches to medical treatment and greater flexibility in rehabilitation practices that have occurred in the intervening years, a comprehensive review of those tables is appropriate and required. I understand that the government has consulted with medical experts, allied health professionals, medical health workers and those in the rehabilitation field as well as a range of peak bodies and professional associations in reviewing these impairment tables. I understand the updated tables will is be introduced at a later time by way of legislative instrument and that the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is committed to further extensive consultations to ensure that Australia has a system where assistance is better targeted and appropriate to contemporary medical treatment and rehabilitation frameworks. Placing these updated impairment tables in a legislative instrument will mean that they can be more responsive to changing medical and rehabilitation practices. This bill contains initiatives that are designed to improve the integrity of particular asset test exempt income streams. Over time, inequities have arisen between social security recipients and veterans' affairs pensioners; inconsistencies in the treatment of these payments have meant that some recipients have received concessions at higher payment rates without meeting their reciprocal responsibilities. The changes put forward here are intended to provide some clarity and to strengthen existing income stream rules. Social security recipients and veterans' affairs pensioners who have lifetime or life expectancy income streams are currently required to provide an actuarial certificate stating that there is a high probability that the provider of the income stream will be able to pay the income stream as required under the contract or governing rules for the term of the income stream. Due to changes in economic and market conditions, the probability that a provider of an income stream will be able to pay the income stream as required under the contract or governing rules could fluctuate markedly, even over a short period of time. As a result, some social security and veterans' affairs customers are providing certificates that fail to meet the high probability test. This leads to their payments being subject to the assets test, which can create a level of uncertainty and financial problems for some of the most vulnerable in the community. It is good that the changes in this bill are designed to help provide some clarity so that these customers may provide only one certificate for each financial year to show that the fund has sufficient resources to pay the income stream for its term. In the event that someone provides more than one certificate for a particular financial year only the first certificate given will have effect. The bill also provides some clarity in relation to the status of termination payments within social security law. For a variety of reasons some employers will elect to make a payment to an employee in lieu of notice of termination. The provisions of this bill will help ensure that people who receive such payments are treated in the same way as people who receive other types of redundancy or termination payments. Importantly, the bill will provide an enhanced quality assurance system for disability advocacy services to ensure that those Australians who live with disability are afforded the best possible advocacy support. As we know, the current quality assurance system has been in place since 1997 but no longer provides sufficient assurances about the quality of disability advocacy support being provided. Under the system proposed by this bill the compliance of disability advocacy services with the new disability advocacy standards, to be set out in a legislative instrument, is assessed by an independent certification body over a three year cycle. The quality assurance system is based on the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand, which is the accreditation body that accredits certification bodies to undertake certification assessments of disability advocacy services. I understand that the system has been the subject of a successful trial, and was developed following extensive consultation with those working in the sector. This bill makes a number of changes which clarify aspects of social security law, and should make it easier for those who depend on income support to understand the system. Moreover, it addresses a number of inconsistencies in the application of the law that have arisen over time and the changes proposed here should result in an income support system which is fairer across the board. It is right that the parliament do all it can to support those Australians who, because of a disability, are unable to work to support themselves and their families. It is equally important that the services of those who have risked their lives for our national security is recognised through a stable system of veterans affairs' income support. The coalition is supporting these initiatives in hope that they will improve the system for those who depend upon it. As I said at the start, it is right that we have a strong and viable social security system put in place to protect and to provide for those who are labouring under circumstances beyond their control-particularly the victims circumstances who do not have the same capacity as the rest of society to benefit from the opportunities that this strong society that we have provides. It is without doubt that we support these measures. We look forward to the passing of these when this motion is concluded.",67
87,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (13:02): First of all I would like to thank all of the speakers for their contribution to the debate on this bill, because the government is working very hard to support people with disability to fulfil their potential. Just last week the Prime Minister released the Productivity Commission's final report into long-term care and support of people with disability. As members would know, consistent with the Productivity Commission's recommendations we have already started work to transform the way care and support is provided to people with disabilities. We are working to deliver results for people with disability right now, including by improving support for Australians with a disability to help them into work wherever that is possible. The disability support pension is an essential element of Australia's safety net, and it is vital that it supports the people who need it: those Australians who, through disability, are unable to work to fully support themselves. In the 2009-10 budget the government committed to update the impairment tables used to assess eligibility the for the disability support pension to bring them into line with modern medical and rehabilitation practice. The current impairment tables have not been comprehensively rewritten since they were introduced in 1991. It is essential that the level of someone's impairment is assessed of using the most up-to-date medical information and with reference to modern rehabilitation practices. This is an important element of the government's reforms to the disability support pension, to make it simpler, fairer and sustainable for those who need it. An advisory committee of medical, allied health and rehabilitation experts, representatives of disability peak bodies, mental health advocates and relevant government agencies was established in 2010 to provide advice on updating the impairment tables. Following a thorough review the advisory committee has provided its final report to the government, which I released publicly last month. The report finds that the current impairment tables are out of date. The advisory committee has developed new impairment tables in close consultation with the medical profession and disability stakeholders. These proposed new tables have also been made public. The advisory committee's report recommends the new tables be used to assess eligibility for the disability support pension from 1 January 2012. In line with the advisory committee's recommendations the government is consulting with disability stakeholders, mental health advocates and experts to ensure the recommended new tables are implemented fairly and effectively. This bill removes the current outdated tables and enables new tables to be introduced through a disallowable legislative instrument. This change will occur on 1 January 2012. Putting the impairment tables into a disallowable instrument allows them to be updated regularly in response to developments in medical and rehabilitation practice, and will also retain the parliament's role in scrutinising any changes. The bill also introduces a stronger quality assurance system for disability advocacy services to make sure that people with disability receive the best possible advocacy support. The current quality assurance system has not changed since 1997, and the need for improved quality assurance for disability advocacy services has been highlighted in a number of reviews. This bill requires disability advocacy services that receive financial assistance under the Disability Services Act to be reviewed and assessed by independent, accredited certification bodies against disability advocacy standards. This quality assurance system has been in place for disability employment services since 2002. It involves people with disability at all levels in the system, including as members of audit teams. The new system has been successfully trialled and independently evaluated in consultation with the disability advocacy sector. The evaluation recommended formal implementation. These changes will help meet the objectives of the National Disability Strategy and will also help meet Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This bill also gives effect to a 2011-12 budget measure by enabling parenting payment recipients to access bereavement allowance on the death of a partner. Allowing a parenting payment recipient to transfer to bereavement allowance on the death of their partner will provide additional financial assistance during a very difficult time. The bill also gives effect to another 201112 budget measure, to more closely align the rules for accessing special benefit for provisional partner visa holders with the rules for other newly arrived migrants. Under current policy, provisional partner visa holders are able to access special benefit from when they are granted the visa and are in Australia if they can demonstrate that they are suffering from financial hardship. This is not consistent with other newly arrived migrants subject to the newly arrived residents waiting period, who need to demonstrate both financial hardship and change in circumstances outside their control in order to access special benefit. From 1 January 2012, the rules for provisional partner visa holders will be consistent with those for other newly arrived migrants. The new arrangements will continue to ensure adequate protection for vulnerable migrants-for example, where there is domestic violence, death of a partner or an injury or accident after their arrival in Australia. The bill also makes changes to the social security law and veterans entitlements legislation to enhance the integrity of treatment of certain asset-test-exempt income streams. These changes strengthen the existing rules that require lifetime and life expectancy income streams to provide an annual actuarial certificate in order to from concessional treatment and address inconsistencies in the treatment of these income streams that have arisen over time. Finally, the bill also makes amendments to the social security law to clarify that payments made by an employer to an employee in lieu of notice of the termination of his or her employment are redundancy payments for the purposes of social security law. This ensures that, in calculating income maintenance periods under the act, people who receive these payments are treated in the same way as people who receive other types of redundancy payments. I thank the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",70
88,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,"by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (13:12): On behalf of the opposition, I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011, which was introduced into this House on 22 June by the Assistant Treasurer, the member for Maribyrnong. This bill has three schedules. I will say at outset that the coalition will not be opposing this bill. As is often the case and as I have said on many previous occasions, bills such as this correct unintended errors, add to the tax law in other important ways and ensure the ongoing operation of an efficient and fair benefit tax system. This bill is no exception. I will deal with each of the three schedules. The first schedule exempts the outer regional and remote payment made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative from income tax. The second schedule provides an exemption for fringe benefits tax for transport, specifically with regard to circumstances where an employee is receiving fringe benefits in a remote overseas location-and I will come back to the detail of that. Finally, as is often the case, this bill updates the deductible gift recipients list in a number of important respects. I will deal with the first schedule. The Assistant Treasurer outlined in his tabling speech in some detail the proposed operation of this in schedule 1. As many members will be aware, there are already payments made under the program; I outlined the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative. Those payments are important payments for a range of disabilities, including sight or hearing impairment, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and a number of others. With respect to eligible children with those disabilities in remote and regional areas, there is an additional payment of $2,000 which is being provided to take account of the additional costs resulting from the distance involved in living in those remote and regional areas. The effect of this schedule is simply to ensure that the additional payment is not subject to income tax. That is the sort of schedule we see in these tax laws amendment bills when important benefits of that nature are provided. Without this the schedule, the tax law would automatically tax those additional payments, and this schedule sensibly ensures that the $2,000 payment is exempt from income tax calculations. The second schedule deals with overseas fly-in fly-out arrangements with respect to fringe benefits tax. Essentially at the present states: point in time there is an exemption from fringe benefits tax for transport from an employee's usual place of residence to their place of employment, where the employee is employed under what is commonly known as fly-in fly-out arrangements and the usual place of employment is a remote location in Australia or on an oil rig or another installation at sea. The Assistant Treasurer outlined in his second reading speech the intention of this schedule essentially to extend that exemption in the same way where the employee is an Australian resident employed in a remote area overseas under a fly-in fly-out arrangement. That makes sense. The point we on this side of the House would make is this has been necessitated by an earlier change to the taxation law. That was a change announced and legislated by the government back in 2009. It relates to foreign employment income for Australians working overseas. That change meant that Australians in this circumstance who had been exempt from Australian income tax to a level would no longer be. A corollary of that is because they may have been receiving fringe benefits before and they were not subject to income tax now, under the change to that law, there was the potential for them to be doubletaxed. I would commend members who are interested in this point to read the explanatory memorandum which outlines in detail this necessity on page 10 at 2.15: Such benefits were previously exempt from FBT because no FBT liability arose in relation to benefits provided to employees whose salary or wages were fully exempt from income tax. Removing the income tax exemption for affected individuals has brought these individuals within the FBT regime. It goes on to outline in great detail how that would occur. At 2.19 on the same page it Double taxation may occur because Australia taxes fringe benefits in the hands of employers, whereas most other countries that tax fringe benefits, tax them in the hands of employees. Tax law is a very detailed area of law as you would appreciate, Madam Deputy Speaker. But the point from this side of the House is that this is something that the government themselves should have recognised at the time of that change a couple of years ago. I make the point in the House that it is a technical oversight. This oversight was recognised prior to the introduction of this bill. In fact, the announcement of the change was made back in 2010, I believe, by the then Assistant Treasurer. I understand it has taken until now to make it into the tax laws amendment bill. The explanatory memorandum was in a media release on 18 November 2010, when it was announced that there would be this change in a tax laws amendment bill. As I said at the outset, the final schedule updates the deductible gift recipients list. It adds to that list the New Zealand government's Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust and the Cancer Australia Gift Fund. It makes some other consequential changes, including renaming some recipients already on the list. It also repeals some from the list, but only in cases where those names are now redundant and have been replaced by either new names or, in one case I think, a merger of a couple of organisations with the same purpose. The addition of those two to the list is something that all members of this House and the Australian public would welcome. I commend the bill to the House.",72
89,Ms ROWLAND,PAIRS," I am very pleased to rise in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill. This bill delivers a number of different but highly important measures. It will directly assist families dealing with disability. It will ensure certainty for industry regarding the fringe benefits tax. Finally, it adds two new organisations to the deductible gift recipients register for tax purposes. I thank the Assistant Treasurer for all his efforts on these matters and I encourage all members to support this legislation. First, I want to discuss the importance of this bill with specific focus on schedule 1 which amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that the outer regional and remote payment made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative is exempt from income tax. This government realises the unfortunate reality that it is harder for families who live in regional and remote parts of Australia and care for a loved one with a disability. It is much harder to visit necessary services in some remote parts of Australia. That is why the government introduced the outer regional and remote areas payment. This means that eligible recipients would receive a one-off payment of $2,000 to help manage the extra logistical difficulties that come with caring for a person with a disability(Quorum formed) Madam Deputy Speaker, I was talking about the needs of people with disability and the importance of assisting those people and particularly their carers. Under the current law, payments made to recipients under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative may be subject to income tax. This bill will ensure that the outer regional and remote payment made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative is expressly exempt from income tax. Schedule 2 of the bill will also provide increased certainty to fly-in fly-out employees working overseas and their employers by exempting transport from the fringe benefits tax. Finally, schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to update the list of deductible gift recipients. I would particularly like to spend a bit of time dealing with the issues relevant to schedule 1. On 29 July last year the Prime Minister made a landmark announcement in detailing the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative. As of 1 July this year, eligible children will be able to access a range of early intervention service providers, including speech pathologists, audiologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. Early intervention can make a huge difference to the development and lifelong learning of a child with a disability, and access to these services will help better prepare them for school. This initiative will see around 9,000 children of up to seven years of age who have been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome and/or sight or hearing impairments potentially benefit from these measures. Eligible children will have access to a total of $12,000 in flexible funding for early intervention services and will be able to use up to $6,000 in any one financial year. On top of this, those Australians living in outer regional and remote parts of the country will receive a one-off payment of $2,000 to assist with the extra costs of transport and other expenses that are incurred due to living in remote regions. By amending the Income Tax Assessment Act, the bill will ensure that families receiving the additional outer regional and remote payment under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative will be exempt from paying income tax on this one-off payment. This government realises the added pressures, financial and otherwise, that many people who are caring for a young person with disability in regional Australia face, and we are legislating accordingly. Schedule 2 of the bill ensures certainty for employees whose usual place of employment is overseas, specifically where they work at a remote location that is not in a state or internal territory for an Australian employer. This is otherwise referred to as a fly-in flyout arrangement. In November last year the Assistant Treasurer announced Australian workers in such arrangements who worked overseas would be treated the same as those in the same arrangement working in Australia. Therefore, the current fringe benefit tax exemption on travel that applies to fly-in fly-out workers in Australia will be extended to Australian workers overseas. This exemption will be backdated to 1 July 2009, when the tax changes to foreign employment income commenced. This exemption provides the certainty sought by industry regarding the fringe benefit tax implications of changes to the taxation of Australian residents employed overseas. This will improve the consistency of treatment and ensure certainty for employees and their employers. Finally, this bill will add the New Zealand government's Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust and Cancer Australia to the list of deductible gift recipients. I would like to mention a number of examples from my own electorate of Greenway that highlight why it is so important to address the issue of disability, as schedule 1 of this bill certainly does. In my first speech in this place, I made a commitment to try and improve the lives of people touched by disability. During my time here as a member I have been truly moved by the stories and experiences of the many people in my electorate who have a disability or who care for people with a disability. Over the winter recess, I visited a number of disability service providers and families who are caring for loved ones with a disability. Time and again, these people sat down and told me how difficult it is to provide care and support for clients and family members who have a disability. In June this year, I met local resident Peter Mortimer and his family during a visit to the disability service provider Ability Options in that Seven Hills. Peter's 25-year-old daughter, Kate, at the age of six suffered a catastrophic brain injury, causing her profound disability. After living at home with her family, Kate recently moved into a group home and receives support to manage her daily activities through the Ability Options selfmanaged program. Peter told me how difficult it was for Kate and the rest of his family immediately after Kate's accident and during her formative years, telling me: Because of Kate's growth and changing posture she has needed six custom-made wheelchairs over her lifetime and these are not something you can just pick off a shelf. For each new chair we have had to wait on average 18 months for the funding to be approved, for moulds to be taken and for the chair to be made. We even partially funded one of Kate's wheelchairs as we couldn't wait-Kate really needed it for her posture and so she could engage in activities. Unfortunately, Kate's story is not an uncommon one, and it is exactly why we must do all we can to help Australians who have a disability, especially younger Australians during their formative years. The Better Start for Children with Disability initiative directly aims to improve the quality of life of young people with disability. This amendment builds on this legislation by easing the financial burden on families living in remote and regional Australia who are raising children who have a disability. I want to take this opportunity to say that it is crucial we work towards easing the pressures on people with disability and on their carers. In addition to the Better Start Children with Disability initiative, we must ensure that all Australians with a disability have the care and support they need. That is why I and a number of other members have backed the Productivity Commission's report into long-term disability care and support, and will continue to push for the implementation of a national disability insurance scheme. I also want to thank the Prime Minister and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for their support of the Productivity Commission's report. For too long, people living with disability in this country have been treated as second-class citizens. Throughout my electorate, people have contacted me saying we must address these issues. I am advocating for a comprehensive national disability insurance scheme that will deliver lifetime care and support for people with severe and profound disability, a strong income support system to enable people who cannot support themselves through work to live in dignity and a range of measures to facilitate increased private expenditure. Only last week I visited Northcott Disability Services, where I met an extraordinary young women named Gretta Serov-and people may have seen Gretta in the Sydney Morning Herald. Gretta has cerebral palsy. She is confined to a wheelchair and cannot speak. She told me her story by communicating through a tablet computer. Gretta told me that an NDIS would 'basically mean I could integrate much more smoothly into the community and it will increase my independence and quality of life by providing much needed support and transport'. Gretta and the Northcott staff also highlighted how pleased they were with the Prime Minister's response to the Productivity for Commission's report. Gretta went on to tell me that she is looking forward to attending university to possibly study creative writing. I have no doubt that Gretta will get to university and achieve her goals, but it is up to us to remove the unfair and unequal barriers that currently stand in her way. That is why I support the implementation of a national disability insurance scheme and encourage all members to do the same. In conclusion, as I said, this bill does three important things. The bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to exempt from fringe benefits tax the cost of transport for Australian residents travelling to and from remote overseas places of employment, providing certainty to employees and employers. The bill will also amend the list of deductible gift recipients to make gifts to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust and Cancer Australia taxdeductible. Finally, the bill will ease the financial strain on families in regional and remote parts of Australia who are caring for someone with a disability, by exempting their regional and remote payments made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative from income tax. These are the right things to do for our community, and I urge all members to support this bill.",73
90,Mr BUCHHOLZ,PAIRS," I rise to lend my support to the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011. The bill is not controversial. It is broken up into three segments. The first schedule amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 in order to ensure that certain payments made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative are exempt from income tax-and I will expand on the benefits of that later on in my speech. Schedule 2 amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to exempt from fringe benefits tax the cost of transport for Australian residents travelling to and from remote overseas places of employment. Schedule 3 amends the list of deductible gift recipients, DGRs, in the ITAA 1997 to make gifts to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust and Cancer Australia tax-deductible. According to the explanatory memorandum, the sole financial implication of the bill is a $0.68 million cost to revenue in the 2011-12 financial year. Looking at schedule 1 in more detail, the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative, which we refer to as Better Start, provides funding for early intervention for particular disabled children. The aim of the initiative is to intervene early in the lives such children because intervention at that stage is considered to be more effective than later treatment. In particular, it is hoped early intervention will prepare this cohort of children for school. The disabilities covered by the initiative are cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and moderate or greater vision and hearing impairments including deaf-blindness. To be eligible for funding under the initiative, the family must provide evidence of the child's age; a confirmed, written diagnosis of a relevant disability; evidence of residential status; and the child's Centrelink customer numberrelatively easy things for parents to comply with. In addition to the general benefits available to all eligible children and their parents and/or carers, those living in remote and regional Australia will also be eligible for a further, one-off payment of $2,000. This is to reflect the additional expenses associated with accessing early intervention services, including travel and home visits. My seat of Wright includes an element of remoteness, so those funds will be well sought after by people in my electorate. I am sure we would all agree that parents of severely disabled children have one of the toughest gigs in the world. Coping with the additional amount of physical and emotional care is a challenge. Children with disabilities may need regular medical attention, time in hospital or regular therapy in addition to extra care at home. These pressures, the sense of isolation and, indeed, desperation that can accompany high levels of care can place a lot of emotional as well as financial stress on a parent. The difficulties of that responsibility are only magnified if they happen to live in a regional or remote area where access to services and support are naturally harder to come by. In those circumstances, a bit of extra assistance will of never go astray. To that end, the amendments contained in schedule 1 will ensure that the outer regional and remote payment will be that exempt from income tax. I personally believe these amendments are entirely appropriate for families to whom every extra dollar counts. Schedule 2 speaks to the overseas fly-in fly-out FBT exemption. The bill gives an exemption from fringe benefits tax for transport from an employee's usual place of residence to their usual place of employment where the employee is an Australian resident employed in a remote area overseas under fly-in fly-out arrangements. Current FBT arrangements expressly exempt transport from an employee's usual place of residence to their usual place of employment, where the employee is employed under what is commonly known as a fly-in fly-out arrangement and the usual place of employment is a remote location in Australia, on an oil rig or on another installation at sea. As we reflect on the booming resources sector that Australia is incurring at the moment, we have more people who are choosing to reside on the eastern seaboard while there is a greater demand for their skills either in remote parts of Australia or offshore. Schedule 2 extends the exemption to Australians whose usual place of employment is overseas specifically where they work at a remote location that is not in a state or internal territory of an Australian employer. The extension will apply to fringe benefits provided since 1 July 2009, which is when the foreign employment income of Australian residents became assessable in certain circumstances. Previously, foreign employment income was exempt from income tax paid by the taxpayer if they had been employed overseas for more than 91 days in a continuous period. However, in 2009 the Rudd government tightened the eligibility requirements for the exemption in section 23AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 so that only foreign income that is 'directly attributable' to particular activities, such as the delivery of Australia's official development assistance or the person's deployment as a member of an Australian 'disciplined force', is exempt. Since 2009 the foreign employment income of Australians not engaged in any of those specific activities has been subject to Australian income tax. Similarly, any fringe benefits provided by the employer, including fly-in fly-out transport, has also been subject to taxation. Under the proposed amendments, while foreign employment income will still be subject to Australian income tax, the provision of transport will become exempt from FBT. Extending the exemption will ensure that Australian residents working for Australian employers in remote areas on flyin fly-out arrangements are taxed consistently, regardless of whether they are working in Australia or overseas, as well as eliminate any possible double taxation on such benefits. The extension of the exemption will only apply to Australian resident taxpayers because foreign resident taxpayers are not taxable in Australia on their foreign sourced income. This amendment clears up an oversight from a previous tax law change. This is a fairly obvious technical oversight to previous changes that the government should not have allowed to happen in the first place. However, with the number of Australians working under fly-in fly-out arrangements increasing, it is satisfying to see that we are finally rectifying a loophole which unfairly disadvantaged those Australians who operated under similar circumstances in an overseas location. Schedule 3 speaks to deductible gift recipients. The income tax laws allow income tax deductions for taxpayers who make gifts of $2 or more to organisations registered as deductible gift recipients. To be considered a DGR, an organisation must fall within one of the general categories set out in division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 or be specifically listed by name in that division. DGR status assists eligible funds and organisations to garner public support for their activities. The amendments in schedule 3 add the New Zealand government's Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust, established following the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and Cancer Australia to the list of DGRs and makes other minor changes to the DGR listings. Both charities well deserve a place on that register. In my electorate of Wright, we know a thing or two about natural disasters and we can truly sympathise with the tough time the people of Christchurch have been through over the past six months or so. Recovering from a natural disaster is an ongoing process and no doubt it will be some time yet before the physical and emotional scars have healed. Later this year I look forward to catching up with the mayor of Christchurch to discuss the personal hardship that he went through, similar to that which we went through in the Grantham area. I understand the Earthquake Appeal Trust is doing fantastic work repairing schools, restoring the city's parks and sporting facilities and laying the groundwork for the construction of an interim 'cardboard cathedral' to temporarily replace the iconic Anglican cathedral in the city centre. I know that many Australians have donated generously to their Kiwi cousins and it is only fair that their generosity is acknowledged in this way on this register. Cancer Australia was established in 2006 to provide national leadership in cancer control and to benefit all Australians, their families and carers who are affected by cancer. The organisation works to reduce the impact of cancer and improve the well-being of those diagnosed by ensuring that evidence informs cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and supportive care. Everybody knows at least one person who has been tragically touched by cancer and it is the one cause to which almost everyone is happy to donate. For that reason alone, I am happy to see the Cancer Australia gift fund included on the list of DGRs. In conclusion, the coalition believes the amendments contained in the bill are worthwhile and, for that reason, it carries my full providing support.",76
91,Ms ONEILL,PAIRS, I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011. This is very important legislation because it seeks to amend various taxation laws and will implement a range of improvements to our current Australian taxation law.,79
92,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," Order! I apologise to the member for Robertson but, it being 1.45 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the honourable member for Robertson will at that time have an opportunity to continue her remarks. NA Probus Club of Elanora Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (13:45): Over the past couple of weeks I have had the opportunity to meet with many community groups within the MCPherson electorate. I would like to take this opportunity today to speak about and congratulate the work of one of those groups. I had the pleasure to meet with ladies from the Probus Club of Elanora at their August meeting held at the Currumbin RSL. I was warmly greeted by Margaret Eley, who is responsible for coordinating guest speakers for the club, and by their President, Josie Taylor. I have to say that my attention was immediately caught by a beautiful quilt that will be raffled in the near future. It did of course lead to a discussion about the fun and friendship offered and gained by being part of quilting groups and groups of that nature. The Elanora Probus Club makes a great contribution to the community within my electorate. This not-for-profit organisation serves the local retiree community by opportunities to increase well-being, both mentally and physically. For local retirees, the Elanora Probus Club offers a social environment where new friendships can be formed within a fun and engaging environment. Members are introduced to retirees from their local community, allowing many new friendships to form. The club also provides the opportunity to meet experts from a range of different fields, including travel, research, history, ancestry and much more. I congratulate and commend the ladies from the Elanora Probus Club on their work. I certainly enjoyed meeting with them. (Time expired) Football Queensland",79
93,Mr RIPOLL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to voice the concerns I and a number of others have about the conduct and practices of Football Queensland and their management. Football Queensland, like a number of other organisations in similar positions, holds a special place in our community not only in terms of sport but also in terms of its special status in business dealings and competition rules in the commercial world. I am deeply disappointed and concerned about the conduct and competency of Football Queensland in its business dealings, which have been the subject of an ACCC inquiry, particularly in relation to Veto Sports. It is my understanding that the relationship between Football Queensland and Veto Sports has broken down over an allegation that has not been proved or verified. The response from Football Queensland has been unparalleled, unjust and without regard for due process of natural justice. When an organisation has special powers and exemptions under law, it also has special responsibilities. I believe Football Queensland has breached responsibilities and, perhaps more, acted in a manner inconsistent with it duties and responsibilities in relation to Veto Sports others and their contract. I have spoken to the President of Football Queensland and will be meeting with Football Queensland this Friday to discuss further some very serious issues and matters that I believe are at odds with the proper conduct and exercise of its powers. Football Queensland, like other not-for-profit organisations in sport or in the community, occupies a very special place that carries with it special responsibilities to exercise power dutifully and ethically.",80
94,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS, Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The member for Mallee ought not to stand before the previous member's time has expired. The member for Mallee has the call. Farm Exit Support,80
95,Mr FORREST,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I rise to protest in the strongest possible terms the decision by the federal Labor government last week to not honour farm exit grants, which is having a devastating impact upon my constituency. Rural councils were advised at about 4.35 pm on Thursday that, if sale transactions had not been finished by five o'clock that evening, farm debt exit packages would not be honoured. This is a despicable decision. I am hoping with great naivete that it is just a bureaucratic mistake. I have called upon the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, to rescind the decision. I have written to him and have put a question on the Notice Paper which will appear tomorrow. I have pleaded with him to think about the serious ramifications of this decision. People have made decisions and sold their farms. In those the meantime they have had to find somewhere to live and they have entered into contracts of sale to purchase a home, either and on a smaller property or in town. They have nowhere to go with this sudden impact upon them. The $150,000 grant in the exit package will not be there. Instead of retiring from farming, they are now in the awkward position where they will have to go to the bank and take out a mortgage to pay for their new home in town. I hope I am not being naive, but I hope the minister can rescind this decision if it is all Melbourne about money. This decision is having a terrible impact on the emotional stability of people in my electorate. (Time expired) Neighbourhood Houses",80
96,Mr BANDT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Neighbourhood houses in my electorate of Melbourne are likely to close their doors to occasional child care because of a stand-off between the federal Labor government and the Victorian Liberal government. The Take a Break program had a joint-funding arrangement until 2010, when the federal government ceased its contribution. The state government in Victoria has now removed its funding, vowing restoration if the federal component is also restored. Despite both governments claiming to value quality, affordable and flexible care opportunities for children, this political stand-off is delivering the opposite. According to research by the Association of Neighbourhood Houses and Learning Centres, which is located in Melbourne, more than one-third of occasional childcare services in Victoria may close. Areas hardest hit will be low socio-economic areas, where families will not be able to afford the fee increases. With my Greens colleagues I am calling for the funding to be restored. The government's National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care provides a framework for such funding. Lifting the existing cap on the number of approved occasional childcare places would also assist centres. The federal minister has written to providers suggesting they may like to convert to long day care, but this ignores the important role played by occasional child care for parents in part-time, job-seeking or training positions. Tomorrow a rally will be held in again asking the two governments to end their squabble. Neighbourhood houses in my electorate will then be meeting at my office to discuss further the future of the services that they provide. I ask the federal government to remove their anxiety by restoring this essential funding as soon as possible. (Time expired) Health",81
97,Mr MCCORMACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Another day, another Labor bungle! Regional health has become a victim of federal Labor penny-pinching as shown by the government asking doctors to pay tax on grants for the building of GP superclinics. The owner of Narrandera's new $1 million superclinic has been hit with a $380,000 tax bill on the grant. Liz Romeo, whose GP husband, Joseph, runs the clinic, has been waiting for a private ruling from the Australian Taxation Office since February. Late last month, Narrandera community's 6,000-plus people heard it may lose the town's only dentist, Dr Iain Douglas, because no clinic had been made available to him in the first stage of the GP superclinic. This farcical situation with Dr Douglas and now the tax bill is so typical of this government which cannot do anything right. It is a government which gives with one hand yet takes away with the other. The Narrandera clinic which opened recently is one of 64 to be built across the nation using $528 million in grants from the federal health department. By treating the grants as an income, the government can regain millions and millions of dollars, money originally intended to improve and expand on primary health services, particularly in regional areas. The initial idea of the superclinic was so that GPs could provide better facilities to their However, slugging them with this extra tax will just disadvantage the doctors and in turn their patients. Once again Labor has made a promise which creates more concern for the regions without so much as a thought for the people, jobs and long-term sustainability of those regions. Men's Shed Association",81
98,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I would like to draw attention to the valuable contribution made by men's sheds in the Canberra community. Over the past decade men's sheds have increased dramatically across the country to promote men's issues. Men's sheds focus on helping men around Australia with any problem they might be facing. It could be a health problem, isolation, loneliness or depression. The shed connects men with their community and establishes a feeling of mateship. In Canberra there are two men's sheds and another one is currently being proposed. Men in the community such as Robyn Matthews in Greenway and Kevin Bawden in Richardson work overtime to run the men's shed. I would personally like to thank them for their time and commitment to improving men's health and well-being. A men's shed provides a space for mateship and a feeling of belonging. It meets the needs of members and their families. It has a developed program designed to advance men's health and well-being. It is inclusive to men of all ages and has a strong community engagement. I would like to acknowledge men's sheds throughout Australia and all those individuals who operate the sheds for their commitment to their community and to the health and well-being of their members and for their commitment to promoting and assisting men communities. with their range of issues. Queensland Members of Parliament",82
99,Mr BUCHHOLZ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I support the previous speaker's comments on men's sheds and the well-being and health of men. It is a great initiative and should be applauded at every opportunity. I rise to take the opportunity to congratulate and thank a couple of personalities from my electorate, in particular the state members from both sides of the house who have been extremely supportive to me personally during the time of hardship in the Lockyer Valley with the devastation of the disasters we experienced earlier in the year. In particular, the local member for Lockyer, Ian Rickuss, was a strength for me. He knew the majority of the people in the community and not only did he know them, he knew their children, their background and their religion. He is a state member who is extremely well connected with that community. I take this opportunity on the floor to acknowledge the great work that he did during that drastic time. I would also like to acknowledge Ros Bates, the member for Mudgeeraba. At the weekend she took time out to take me around and introduce me to a number of business houses over there in her electorate. She is well received in her electorate and has a strong profile and does a great job over there. Also there is Dr Alex Douglas, the member for Gaven, whose wife does a magnificent job with the Gold Coast Council. I congratulate all of their staff on the job well done. I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate John Mickel, the Speaker of the Queensland house, for a magnificent term in parliament. John is the Labor member up there for Logan, who announced recently that he will not be contesting the next election. I would like to take the opportunity to thank him for the work that he has done for that electorate. MCGovern, Ms Karen Marino, Mr Fernando Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (13:56): From time to time, members have the melancholy duty of advising the House of a tragic event within their electorate impacts on the entire community. Today I have such a duty. I advise the House of a tragic accident that has devastated a local family from Albion Park within my electorate of Throsby. Karen MCGovern and her partner, Fernando Marino, had travelled to Melbourne on the weekend last for a birthday treat to watch the Sydney Swans play Richmond Tigers at the MCG. Karen and Fernando were on a marked pedestrian crossing in central Melbourne when they were hit by a car that is believed to have been running a red light. Sadly, they have both now died as result of their injuries. What compounds this tragedy is that their young children, aged two and five, have now been left without parents, which I am sure we all agree is one of the worse blows which you could experience in your life. It is shocking that all in one family could have been destroyed by such a brutal and random accident such as this, and I am sure that all members here will join me in extending our deepest sympathies to both the children and their extended family and friends. Mr Marino worked across the road from my electorate office, at the IMB at Dapto. I did not know him personally but I knew him from around the community and it is a tragedy that has touched everyone. The community is reaching out. A fund has been established to help the children and a Facebook page has been established to place tributes. (Time expired) Australian Workers",82
100,Mr CHESTER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise in sorrow to appeal to those opposite to stop vilifying Australian companies as 'big polluters', to stop vilifying honest Australian men and women who go about their jobs in companies like Qantas and Virgin Australia and the power stations in my electorate and also the food manufacturers. Stop vilifying that these honest Australian mums and dads as working for 'big polluters'. Have the courage to come into this place today in question time and put a ban on 'big polluters'-put a ban on using that term. You come in here every day and you make these accusations. You vilify honest working Australian mums and dads and then you pretend to stand up for the workers of Australia. Whatever happened to that great Australian Labor Party tradition of standing up for the workers of Australia, standing up for their jobs? Whatever happened to the great Australian Labor Party tradition of standing up for the workers? You have stopped doing it because now you are talking about those scary big polluters. Have the guts to come into this place today and not talk about big polluters-just for one day. Recognise that truly these are big businesses who create the prosperity and the wealth of our nation and stop vilifying these companies and stop vilifying these people. One last appeal I would like to make is for the unions of this country to finally stand up for the workers' jobs. Why don't the unions of this country actually give their workers a vote? Why don't the unions of this country actually go on the shop floor and give their workers a vote on this carbon tax? They know their jobs are at stake and this government- (Time expired)",83

104,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to page 18 of the government's own modelling document. I refer to the statement on page 18 which shows that, under the carbon tax, Australia's emissions will rise from 578 million tonnes now to 621 million tonnes in 2020. I ask the Prime Minister: what is the point of a carbon tax if it does not get Australia's own domestic emissions down?",84
105,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question I would remind him that he and I, the government and the opposition have exactly the same target for the reduction of carbon pollution in 2020. The figures that he refers to are figures which would apply to his target as well. What the Leader of the Opposition fails to recognise is the difference in the two schemes. Ours is a price that is paid by big polluters and as a result we cut carbon pollution. We then use that revenue to assist Australian families by cutting tax, increasing family payments and increasing pensions. We protect Australian jobs and we invest in a clean energy future. Under the Leader of the Opposition's plan to reach exactly the same target he puts a tax on families",84
106,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point Ports of order on direct relevance. I asked her about her plan which shows that emissions will actually increase from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes with the carbon tax. What is the point, Prime Minister?",84
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition has made his point of order. The Prime Minister has the call. She knows her responsibilities.,84
108,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under the Leader of the Opposition's plan he would oppose additional tax on Australian families. He would give that money to big polluters, he would cut pensions and he would cut family payments. Here we go again. We are apparently back to that moment where the Leader of the Opposition went to a meeting and decried his own target as crazy, only within 24 or 48 hours to recant from that. We are back to that moment again so",84
109,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,84
110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The House will come to order. The Prime Minister must directly relate her material to the question and she will be heard in silence.,84
111,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am directing my answer to the target of the government and the opposition for the reduction of carbon pollution in 2020. The difference here is that the government backs that target in every day of the week, the Leader of the Opposition tailors his answers on that target to whatever audience he is speaking to that day. Economy",85
112,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. How has Australia benefited from past economic reforms? How is the government continuing to pursue economic reform and address the challenges of the future?,85
113,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Robertson for her question. It is not that long ago, decades but not that long ago, that we in this country used to talk about the tyranny of distance and our economic debate was dominated by the fact that we felt remote from the markets that we most wanted to trade with. In response to that we lived behind high tariff walls with all the implications that had for real wages. It reduced the real wages available to working people over time with all the implications that had for suppressing innovation in our economy. Our economy changed as we moved away from such a tyranny of distance model and we opened our economy up to the world. We commenced the economic reforms that were necessary to change a closed insular economy into a great trading economy. Australians can be rightly proud of the economy that we have built together, a great trading economy and an economy that has come out of the global financial crisis strong, not having gone into recession and not having seen the sharply rising unemployment we have seen in other countries around the world, where millions and millions of people have lost their jobs. What was that tyranny of distance is now an opportunity for us, a huge opportunity. We are in the region of the world that is continuing to grow strongly and we are prospering from that growth. Three-quarters of Australia's goods exports go to Asia-a quarter of them to China alone. These are important statistics. We continue to have a prosperous future trading with the economies of our region, which are continuing to grow. As we are in the right region of the world, we bring to this task the right economic fundamentals. We have low unemployment. We have strong prospects for growth, with $430 billion of projects in the pipeline in the resources sector alone. We have strong a few public finances. We have a strong banking system. This is important and is a standout in comparison to the positions of nations overseas that are coming to the economic challenges of today with high unemployment, high debt and institutional weakness. Consequently, we are here with a huge opportunity, a huge opportunity that we can seize by keeping our economy strong today and by engaging today in the reforms that our economy will need to keep it modern and strong tomorrow-that is, we have to bring the same national character and characteristics to today's reform challenges as past generations brought to the reform challenges that confronted them. That is why, to manage today's economy, we are determined to invest in skills, to invest in infrastructure, to better tax our mineral wealth and to spread those benefits through the cutting of company tax, through the growth of our pool of national savings and through special breaks for small business. Over the medium to longer term we are determined to keep investing in our productive capacity and to grow our productivity by investing in education, by investing in skills, by rolling out the NBN, by seizing the opportunities that come from a clean energy future and by bringing our reform tools to health and education. We stand in a country with strong economic fundamentals and a huge opportunity for the future. It is an economy we have built together, and we should be proud of it. Economy Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:10): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the forecast by former Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet economist SuLin Ong that the budget will be in deficit in 2012-13 by an amount of $5 billion. Does the Prime Minister stand by her commitment that, when it comes to delivering a surplus: Failure is not an option. And: … no ifs no buts it will happen. Or will that commitment end up on the same scrap heap as her claims: The Labor Party is the party of truth telling. And: There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.",85
114,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I possibly should have studied that new shadow ministerial list that the Leader of the Opposition tabled earlier, but I do thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. In answer to her question I would repeat the answer that I gave to the House yesterday, which is that we have a clear plan to bring the budget to surplus, we have strong fiscal rules and we are determined to bring the budget to surplus. In coming to this task of bringing the budget to surplus in 2012-13, we will build on what we have achieved in the May budget. We have been determined to look for savings. We did that in the May budget, and of course we did that in the election campaign prior to the May budget. We do not bring to this task the $70 billion black hole which the opposition built up through their own fiscal incompetence. We are determined to bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13. The Treasurer gave an economic statement about this matter yesterday. We have been explaining to people the turbulence in global markets. We have also been explaining to people that our economy has strong fundamentals and that as a nation we should be proud of those strong fundamentals because we built them together. We particularly ensured those strong fundamentals were held during the global financial crisis, where we had the combination of the reforms that this nation has engaged in over a number of decades, the decisive action of the government in providing economic stimulus and attending to banking issues, and the hard work of employers and employees and trade unions in the community. Through that national spirit and combined national work, we came out of the global financial crisis without going into recession-something we should all be very proud of. Economy",86
115,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer please update the House on the economic outlook for Australia and the importance of delivering on reforms for the future, and what are the risks to the government's economic reforms agenda?",86
116,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Page for her question. Yesterday I reported to the House on the changing global economic conditions, and overnight we have seen further broad based weakness in the euro area. There has been some improvement in the US figures overnight but we are still going to face very substantial economic headwinds in the global economy as we go forward. In Australia we do have every reason to be confident about our fundamental economic strength. As the Prime Minister said, we avoided recession. Virtually alone amongst developed economies we avoided recession. We have low unemployment, we have low debt, we have low deficits and we are located, as the Prime Minister said, in the right part of the world at the right time. But we cannot take all of this for granted. What we have to do is put in place the fundamental long-term economic reforms that will ensure our continued economic strength. Where would Australia be today without the far-sighted reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments? I will tell you where we would be: we would have a really high tariff wall, we would have an old, rickety, fixed exchange rate, and of course we would not have the national savings that we have got through superannuation. What we would have is an economy stuck back in the 1970s. This indicates the importance of putting in place these long-term reforms for the future, the importance of putting in place a price on carbon. You cannot be a First World, firstrate economy in the 21st century unless you are powered substantially by clean energy. We do need to boost productivity, and of course we have the NBN, a very substantial boost to productivity and a very important long-term reform. And of course we need reforms when it comes to the taxation system, bringing down taxes for small business so that they can grow. The patchwork nature of our economy makes these long-term reforms all the more important. Those opposite want to go around the country talking our economy down. Shame on them for talking this economy down the way they do, day in, day out. They go wandering around telling people anything they want to hear and suddenly turn round and find out there is a $70 billion black hole in their budget.  of order. Clearly the Treasurer is at it again. He was not asked about us. He should be answering the question he was asked, not talking about reforms that happened 30 years ago.",86
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. There is only one point of order. The Treasurer knows his responsibility to relate his material directly to the question.,87
118,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On this side of the House we are getting the big economic calls right and building on our strengths. What that has meant is low unemployment. We have a proven capacity to deal with global economic uncertainty. We have faced up to national the big challenges of the future. Those on that side of the House cannot get their story right. On Friday the member for North Sydney said there was a $70 billion black hole in their budget estimates, and on 7:30 last night he said, 'I didn't say it.' He has developed amnesia. They are all over the place when it comes to fiscal policy. They would rather see the country fail than the government succeed. Budget",87
119,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his own budget speech, where he said, just three months ago: We will be back in the black by 2012-13, on time, as promised. The alternative-meandering surplus-would compound the pressures in our economy and push up the cost of living for pensioners and working people. Treasurer, do you stand by your words?",87
120,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I stand by the budget and I stand by the government's commitment on the surplus. Let us be very clear about that because there is a very clear contrast. We on this side of the House have a commitment to a set of strict fiscal rules, and they on that side of the House have a $70 billion black hole. The contrast on fiscal policy could not be clearer. We on this side of the House understand the importance of putting in place strict fiscal policy. When we moved to stimulate our economy in 2009 we outlined a very clear and consistent set of fiscal rules, and we have been applying those fiscal rules in a clear and consistent way. In fact, we went through the whole election campaign last year and did not spend an extra dollar, but what we found out after that campaign was that there was a $10 billion hole in the estimates of the opposition.",88
121,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will relate his remarks to the question.,88
122,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So their record on fiscal policy is in tatters. Now there is a $70 billion hole. It has gone from $10 billion to $70 billion in,88

134,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. I come back to fiscal policy, which is what the question was about. It was about the surplus. By any definition the surplus is fiscal policy.

I do not know what you are on about. I honestly do not know what you are about. What I do think you are on about is the embarrassment of the $70 billion black hole in your lack of fiscal policy. Defence,89
142,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Defence. Minister, Australia plans to purchase as many as 100 Joint Strike Fighters at a cost of $16 billion, but the US program is deeply troubled by cost overruns, capability shortfalls and schedule slippage. US Senator John MCCain has dubbed it a train wreck while you have said the program is rubbing up against Australia's cost and schedule limits. Minister, this program is vital to Australia's security in light of our retired F111s, ageing FA18s and limited Super Hornets. The 14 JSF we have committed to buy will not fill the gap. What are our cost and schedule limits, and what is plan B? Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (14:24): I thank the member for Denison for his question and acknowledge his long standing interest in national security matters. Of course, Australia's air combat capability is a vital part of our national security framework. I make this point crystal clear at the outset and I will also make it at the conclusion of my remarks: I will not allow, and the government will not allow, a gap in our air combat capability. Let me refer to some of the facts here. The member referred to the F111, of which we had 24. It served us very well. We now have about 70-71, in fact-classic Hornets. They are subject to an upgrade and maintenance program, and we expect that they will be retired by the end, or at the end, of this decade. We also have 24 Super Hornets-20 have arrived and four are to be delivered by the end of the year. The white paper and the Defence Capability Plan talk in terms of around or up to 100 Joint Strike Fighters at an estimated cost of $16 billion. The government has committed itself to, and announced, 14 Joint Strike Fighters. We expect the first two of those to be delivered to us in the United States for training purposes in the course of 2014-15. There are a number of advantages that Australia has in this project. Firstly, we sensibly chose the conventional variant and not the other two variants, which have been the subject of most difficulties so far as the program is concerned. Secondly, in working out our schedule and cost we put in sufficient padding to make sure that we did not suffer, most importantly, a capability gap. I was recently in the United States. I discussed this matter with Secretary of State for Defense Panetta; with Ash Carter, his assistant secretary on capability, who was recently the nominee for Deputy Secretary; and also with the Joint Strike Fighter program office itself, including Admiral Venlet. I made it clear that our concern was in the risk of rubbing up against our schedule. We are proposing, in conjunction with our Joint Strike Fighter program partners, to do an exhaustive assessment of the delivery schedule by the end of this year. The advice I have from my department is that we are in a position to wait until 2013 to make a judgment about whether alternative arrangements are required to ensure there is no gap in our capability. I am not proposing to wait until the last minute. I am proposing to recommend to the government that we make that decision next year. There is an obvious option, or plan B, which I have stated publicly in the United States and on my return here.",89
143,Mr Dutton,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Tell us about plan B.,90
144,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Dickson! Mr STEPHEN SMITH: I have stated publicly in the United States and here that there is a viable alternative. Whilst the government has not committed itself to this, the obvious alternative is the Super Hornet. So I am proposing to recommend to government, in the course of next year, whether there is a need for us to take alternative steps to ensure there is no gap in our air combat capability. So far as cost is concerned, as I have said, we have committed ourselves to 14 at a cost of about $3 billion. What further orders, if any, are placed, will be a judgment for the government at the time. So far as cost is concerned the single biggest variable is whether the United States reduces the number of Joint Strike Fighters for its navy and its air force. That is something which we are also closely monitoring in the context of their defence budget difficulties and general budget difficulties. So far as the government is concerned we will not allow a gap to occur in our air combat capability. Climate Change Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:28): My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Will the minister update the House on support for jobs and competitiveness in the government's clean energy future plan. How has this been received and what is the government's response?",90
145,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I would like to thank the member for Petrie for her question. The clean energy future plan that the government announced on 10 July contains very significant support for jobs in key industries. The jobs and competitiveness program in particular provides very significant support for, and assistance to, industries in the trade-exposed and emissions-intensive sectors of the economy. This assistance, just in the first three years of the carbon price mechanism, represents $9.2 billion of assistance for those industries and, of course, it is an ongoing program. This program will be extremely important for the competitiveness of industries such as alumina refining, aluminium smelting, steel making and cement manufacturing. Industries under the Jobs competitiveness program will be entitled to assistance in the form of free permits at the rates of 94½ per cent for the most emissionsintensive industries and 66 per cent for the moderately emissions-intensive industries. This will underpin the competitiveness of these industries by significantly offsetting their carbon liability. It will support the jobs of those employed in those industries and still, of course, maintain an incentive to reduce pollution and to invest in clean technology. The package also contains a number of other very important measures: an $800 million Clean Technology Investment Program for manufacturing businesses, a $200 million clean technology program for manufacturing businesses specifically in the metal-forging and food-processing industries and a $200 million Clean Technology Innovation Program to support business investment in low-emissions research and development in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency. In relation to small business there will be an increased small business instant asset write-off, which has been increased to $6,500 for depreciating assets. These are just some of the important programs announced by the government to support jobs and competitiveness. It is important that they are also appropriately represented in the debate. There are other measures, including approximately $1.3 billion to support jobs in the most methaneintensive coal mines and a $300 million Steel Transformation Plan. But, of course, none of these measures will deter the Leader of the Opposition, it seems, from his campaign of fear and misrepresentation. He has run around the country trying to terrify people in a completely unprincipled, opportunistic and and irresponsible manner. He has declared repeatedly that entire industries will be destroyed and that towns and regions will be wiped off the map. It is disreputable to undermine people's job security in this way, and it is disreputable to damage consumer sentiment in our economy with these claims.  of order. The minister's slagging and bagging of the opposition could not possibly be directly relevant to the question he was asked, and I ask you to draw him back to the question or sit him down.",90
146,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I noticed, reading today's papers, that the Leader of the Opposition was speaking against exactly that sort of behaviour in the opposition party room yesterday-exactly that sort of behaviour. In the guise of a point of order, the Manager of Opposition Business is repeating a term that in the past you have ruled is unruly and you have asked him to desist from using it.",91
147,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The expression used was one that I have indicated has been something that people listening to the proceedings of the House have expressed some concern about. I have counselled the member for Sturt about its use and on at least one occasion I have asked him to withdraw it. This is an occasion where I would hope that those observers from outside would see that the person using it is the person using it, and that in general there is some concern in this chamber. On the point of order: the last part of this question was, 'How has the government's policy been received, and what is the government's response?' Without marking people's homework, that is code for the type of answer that we are now seeing. If there were no debate allowed in responses there would not be a problem. But that is not something that the House has addressed at this stage. I will listen carefully to the minister's concluding remarks, and I know that he knows he is required to relate his material directly to the question.",91
148,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The fundamental problem here in the debate is that the Leader of the Opposition will say anything to anyone as long as it suits him at the time.,92
149,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister must relate his material,92
150,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He will tell one audience that he is committed to the five per cent bipartisan target and on the very same day turn around and tell a seniors group that crazy; one thing to one person and another to another.

152,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition's word is worthless. Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (14:35): My question is to the Prime Minister. When the Prime Minister expressed unreserved confidence in the member for Dobell yesterday, was she aware that he had failed to add a $90,000 gift from the New South Wales Labor Party to his register of member's interests?",92
153,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In answer to the member's question can I say that I am advised by the member for Dobell that media reporting on the matter he raises is incorrect, and his statement of interests was updated in the interest of full disclosure.  Opposition Business) (14:36): supplementary question, Mr Speaker: is the Prime Minister aware that the member for Dobell has also failed to register his role as the registered public officer of the Coastal Voice community group? Given the member for Dobell's failure until yesterday to disclose his gift from the ALP and his still undisclosed role as head of the controversial Coastal Voice community group, does the Prime Minister still have confidence in the member for Dobell?",92
154,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,92
155,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. The Prime Minister has the call.,92
156,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lalor-Prime Minister) it is (14:37): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I have complete confidence in the member for Dobell. Of course, there is an obligation on all members of the parliament to abide by the rules in relation to declarations of interest. As the member who asked the question would well know, there is more than one member in this parliament that has declared things late. Of course, people should abide by the rules. Coal Seam Gas Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (14:38): My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. Will the minister update the House on the significance of Australia's coal seam gas industry? Why is investment certainty important for our economy, and what are the risks to that investment? Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (14:38): I thank the member for Throsby for the question. In thinking about the coal seam methane industry, let us first be clear: this is not a new industry to Australia. On the east coast of of Australia the coal seam methane industry, On a from a domestic point of view, currently represents 30 per cent of our east coast gas supply. In Brisbane alone it represents 90 per cent of the gas currently used. What is new to Australia is a world first-potentially the first ever world export contracts from the LNG industry. That represents $45 billion in new investment for Australia. Yes, there is some foreign investment, but, importantly, there are two leading Australian companies in partnership with international investors, Santos and Origin-ordinary Australians investing in their future, side by side with international investment. But, importantly, that $45 billion in new investment also represents, for the state of Queensland out of those three projects to date, 15,000 new jobs not only in Gladstone but in a number of regional communities that are struggling to rebuild themselves because of the challenges that have confronted the agricultural sector in recent decades. When I went to Chinchilla last August to open a new local apprenticeship training centre, the young apprentices I met and their parents were absolutely delighted with our investment in support of the industry and new apprenticeship opportunities. The parents spoke about the opportunities now to train locally, to be employed locally and to sustain those local communities. I should also remind the House that, in terms of royalties, they will principally go to the of Queensland, because they are onshore resource developments. That means a greater opportunity for Queensland to invest in those regional communities in funding health, education and infrastructure, just to name a few of the basic requirements that those local communities expect. What really disappoints the Australian community is the endeavour by the opposition time and time again to talk down the Australian economy. That is what we have seen: rank political opportunism over the last couple of days by the Leader of the Opposition. Members of the gallery should listen: if you walk out of question time today, run into Tony Abbott and say something to him, he will agree with you. He will then walk to the next group of people, they will say the exact opposite and he will agree with them. That is what we have on the other side of the House. This is very serious. We are very fortunate as a nation at the moment, with $45 billion in new investment in the coal seam methane industry and an investment pipeline of $440 billion. We also had the Leader of the Opposition last Friday not only challenging the constitutional capacity of the state and territory governments to regulate this very important industry but also saying to foreign investors, 'You are not welcome in Australia.' It is about time he understood that the history of Australia is that we are a trading nation built on the back of foreign investment. Companies such as Shell, Chevron and BP are investing in Australia and creating real jobs. So it is about time that the Leader of the Opposition fronted up to his responsibilities and stopped going around Australia talking about his so-called policy mix, which is nothing but populism masquerading as policy. He is a rank political opportunist and nothing but an economic vandal who has clearly shown yet state again that he has no understanding of the functions of the Australian economy. Carbon Pricing",92
157,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that under her carbon tax Australia will meet its abatement target in 2020 only if Australian businesses purchase $3.5 billion of carbon credits from foreign carbon traders? Prime Minister, what is the point of a carbon tax if it does not actually reduce Australia's own domestic emissions?",93
158,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Of course, I can confirm for the member who asked the question that the emissions trading scheme that we will reach after a three-year fixed price period will be an internationally linked schemeabsolutely. Yes, it will, because our nation linked to the world. You have just heard the Minister for Resources and Energy talk about our history as a great trading nation. We live in a global economy. So, as we transform our economy to a clean energy future, we will ensure through international linking that we can get abatement in carbon pollution at the least cost, and that is achieved through international linking. Anyone who puts the contrary view to you is saying to you that we should transform our economy at a higher cost-that is, we should ask Australian businesses to pay more than they need to and put more on our economy than we need to for this transformation. Looking at the policies of the opposition in this regard, I think",93
159,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. What is the point of a carbon tax if it does not actually reduce Australia's own domestic emissions? The Prime Minister really should address the",94
160,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call. She is responding to the question.,94
161,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, what we are hearing from the opposition-and here we go again-are a set of misrepresentations about the way in which carbon pricing works-just as they misrepresented what would happen about coal, just as they misrepresented what would happen about steel, just as they misrepresented what would happen about the cost of living, just as they have misrepresented, every step of the way, every aspect of this scheme. Here we go again. The question that was asked by the member went to international linking. Let me explain to him: yes, it is a linked scheme because that enables us to reduce carbon pollution at the least possible cost. There was is a period when the opposition understood this and I refer them to the words of their spokesperson who said: We have unashamedly tried to source the cheapest abatement because once verified, a tonne of carbon is a tonne of carbon. And that is all that the planet knows. Because of the usual cheap politics we see, when the opposition or one of its spokespersons is in front of an audience where they think that is going to be a good message or they are in front of perhaps a business audience and they want to explain that their policy is about cheap abatement, they will say something about that. But then in a community meeting, when they think they might get away with stoking some fears about the rest of the world, they say something different. For example, the Leader of the Opposition said in complete contradiction of his spokesperson: Our five per cent target is to be achieved entirely within Australia, no taxpayers' funds would be spent overseas under the policy we announced. What the Leader of the Opposition did not go on to say is: if you do not have international linking the cost per tonne of abatement is higher. Consequently to reach the bipartisan targets of five per cent, the cost per tonne of abatement paid under the opposition's policy would be greater than under the government's policy. Mr Hunt interjecting",94
162,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Flinders is warned.,94
163,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is that that leads to the calculation that the opposition's policy would cost Australian families $1,300. We used to use a lower figure of $720 until they ruled out international linking and that is what made that figure $1,300. The Leader of the Opposition stands for abatement at the greatest possible cost. We stand for a modern economy, a clean energy future and getting there in the cheapest possible way. (Time expired) Tobacco Plain Packaging",94
164,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. What progress is being made to implement the important reform of plain packaging for cigarettes? What reaction has there been and what is the government's response?,95
165,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Banks for his interest in this topic. Members know that two pieces of legislation have been introduced into this House that will deliver the world's packaging for tobacco products here in Australia. This is likely to be debated in the House next week. Of course, it was with interest that we read reports today that the Liberal Party have made a decision formally within their party room that they will support one of those bills, but they will not support the other bill. I am disappointed to hear This reform is about the public health impact of smoking-that is, that we reduce the number of people in this country who smoke as much as we can and we reduce methods for tobacco companies to be able to advertise and promote their products to new smokers-and it has been supported by everybody in the public health community. The health professions across the country have supported us, including the AMA. I understand both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition-as well as others, including me-are attending the AMA's dinner tonight. The Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition might be interested to know that the AMA awarded the government their annual tobacco award this year for this particular initiative. So it is disappointing to hear that the Leader of the Opposition is going to lead his party to a position where they will support part of plain packaging, but cannot quite bring themselves to support all of it. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has never been a true believer in this measure. He had to be dragged kicking and screaming by backbenchers in his own party who understood the importance of this measure. But now we have another example, like the one Minister Combet used, of the Leader of the Opposition saying one thing to one group of people and another thing to another group of people. Today he is actually saying two things at the same time to the same group of people-that is, he supports plain packaging and he does not support first plain plain packaging! We have two bills in place because we need to make sure that the plain packaging restrictions are clearly articulated and we need to make changes to the trademarks legislation. We have seen all sorts of protests in the media that this is an outrage, that the this. parliament has never seen such a reaction before and that somehow these regulations are going to be different to every other regulation and they are not going to come to parliament. But before the members opposite lock into supporting the Leader of the Opposition's position and voting against one of these bills, I think they might need to do a little bit of research. I am disappointed that the member for Leichhardt is not in the chamber when I say this because he is one of the members who would remember that in 2000 the Howard government, Mr Entsch and others, introduced a piece of legislation amending the Trade Marks Act in exactly the same way to make sure that trademarks legislation could operate effectively in an area where we know industry practice changes very quickly and quick responses by regulation are required. This is a standard procedure. It is an important part of the plain packaging legislation. It is ironic that this would be opposed by those opposite when it is actually about making sure trademark laws are retained. You have to wonder whether the 97 per cent of donations coming through to the Liberal and National parties are actually buying something here. They are going to support part of the plain packaging legislation, but they are not going to support the other part. Is this what big tobacco are getting for their money? Dr Southcott interjecting",95
166,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order, I ask that the member for Boothby withdraw the interjection he gave across the chamber that was unparliamentary. Dr Southcott: Mr Speaker, I withdraw.",96
167,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Boothby. Carbon Pricing,96
168,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister to confirm that under her carbon tax a business that emits 24,999 tonnes of CO2 will not have to purchase any carbon permits, but a business that emits one tonne more will have to pay over half a million dollars in carbon permits. Will the Prime Minister explain why any company in that position would ever bother to grow in this country?",96
169,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Here we once again have the opposition trying to induce confusion and continuing its campaign of misrepresentation against carbon pricing. We saw it in the last parliamentary session, we saw it across the winter recess and of course we are seeing it again in question time today. It is exactly same type of misrepresentation we saw when the Leader of the Opposition was saying that coal would be out of business-he was wrong-and steel would be out of business-and he was wrong. He said that cost of living increases would be astronomical-and he was wrong. We have seen all of this play out day after day. To the member's question, what I would say, of course, is that the scheme has been designed so that it is the generators of the most pollution, the biggest polluters, who pay. It has been designed to do that. If the member who asked the question somehow now has a perspective that the scheme should be more broadly based then that would truly be an eccentric move by the opposition. But, given we have heard different things on different occasions about all aspects of the scheme, I am not surprised. What the calculation about the amount of carbon pollution relates to is the amount of carbon pollution generated at a site. What happens is that, in terms of the carbon pollution, a price is paid, and businesses will adapt, they will innovate and they will reduce the amount of carbon pollution. The member then seems to conclude that all of this somehow adds up to less economic growth. The Leader of the Opposition has apparently finally found the detailed documents about carbon pricing. I would refer the member who asked the question to those detailed documents because of what they show-that is, continued economic growth",96
170,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will resume her seat. The member for Sturt will withdraw.  did not say anything,96
171,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no need the to qualify it. The Prime Minister.,96
172,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I have actually got this document and I am going to go to it in one second, so thank you very much for drawing attention to that.",97
173,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,97
174,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will resume her seat until the House comes to order.,97
175,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I was saying was that the member should refer to the detailed documents about carbon pricing. He seems to have assumed that somehow our economy will cease to grow. Of course, that is completely untrue. Our economy will grow and there will be 1.6 million more jobs between now and 2020. Given the member has taken an interest in this matter, I would refer him to his own policy, which says: Businesses that undertake activity with an emissions level above their 'business as usual' levels will incur a financial penalty. The penalties will be on a sliding scale at levels commensurate with the size of the business and the extent to which they exceed their 'business as usual' levels. So, to the member who has asked the question, am I to assume that he is now campaigning against the coalition's so-called direct action policy, because it would be as consistent as anything else the coalition has done on carbon pricing. Apple Imports",97
176,Dr LEIGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Trade. Will the minister update the House on recent decisions in relation to the importation of apples from New Zealand? What other options have been put forward and what is the government's response?,97
177,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Fraser for his question and for his dedication through his entire professional career to sound economic policy, a consistency that he has demonstrated that has been sadly lacking from those opposite. Today I can report that Australia's Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine has made a policy decision to allow the importation of New Zealand apples into Australia. This decisionMr MCCormack interjecting",97
178,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Riverina is warned! And a warning is a precursor for a naming. He knows that that behaviour is out of order.,97
179,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The decision is subject to a set of strict, science based conditions set at arms-length from government by the Director of Quarantine. New Zealand had taken a dispute against Australia to the World Trade Organisation and the World Trade Organisation ruled in November of last year that Australia's quarantine measures were not value of supported by science. The Gillard government is making the right decision in implementing this science based advice. Any attempt to prevent the implementation of this decision would be extremely damaging to Australian farmers. If Australia does not fully comply with the decision of the World Trade Organisation, Australian farmers will be exposed to retaliation by New Zealand. Australia exported $8 billion worth of goods to New Zealand last year. New Zealand could retaliate against any Australian products, and they would be able to raise their tariffs on Australian goods by up to 100 per cent. For example, New Zealand could choose to target the $110 million worth of sugar that we send to New Zealand every year; New Zealand could target the $10 million worth of citrus fruit we send to New Zealand; New Zealand could target the $19 million worth of pig meat we send to New Zealand; New Zealand could target the $18 million worth of beef we send to New Zealand; or New Zealand could target our exports of stone fruit, wine, grapes or vegetables. New Zealand could target the $39 million worth of chocolate that Tasmania sends to New Zealand. The World Trade Organisation rules matter-they actually matter. I know that the Leader of the National Party does not believe World Trade Organisation rules matter, but they do-and accepted science matters. We must have a quarantine system based on science and not on the whims of politicians. Australia has actually used the WTO rules to defeat import restrictions on Australian beef and sugar. Australia is a major agricultural exporter, with more than 60 per cent of our agricultural production destined for the world export market. By refusing to comply with the global trading rules, Australia be jeopardising its valuable export markets and the livelihoods of the farmers who depend upon them. I ask the coalition to consider that very seriously. Carbon Pricing",97
180,Mr CHRISTENSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to CQ Rescue, an emergency rescue helicopter service based in Mackay. CQ Rescue estimates their carbon tax bill due to increased aviation fuel and electricity costs alone to be at least $20,000 in the first year and to go up and up and up as the carbon tax rises. In the so-called carbon tax detail announced six weeks ago, can the Prime Minister refer me to the page or pages that show exactly how CQ Rescue will be fully compensated for the costs of your carbon tax?",98
181,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I can refer the member to the more than $300 million allocated in the Low Carbon Communities section of the package. If he looks to the detail of how that is described he will see that it deals with assistance for not-for-profit organisations. Family Payments and Support,98
182,Ms BIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Minister, how is the government supporting Australian families into the future? What risks exist to the system of family payments and how is the government addressing these?",98
183,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (15:02): I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. This government is serious about supporting families and has delivered a number of improvements over the last four years to would make sure that Australian families are getting more support. We understand just how important it is for families, as they sit down every fortnight to balance their family budgets, that they have some certainty about what is going to happen into the future. One thing that families can be sure about is that this government will deliver next year around $20 billion combined through the family tax benefit, the baby bonus and paid parental leave. Families can also be certain that they will receive a number of improvements that this government has put in place. This government has put in place the 50 per cent childcare rebate; paid parental leave; the education tax refund; and, very importantly for families with older teenagers, from 1 January next year a higher rate of family tax benefit part A for those families with teenagers aged 16 to 19 in full time secondary study. Of course, none of these improvements were put in place by the previous Liberal government. I am asked about risks to Australian families. The biggest risk to family budgets is coming from this Leader of the Opposition. Every single person in this chamber today knows that this Leader of the Opposition will do anything for a sound bite on the six o'clock news. While this government was working very hard during the budget to deliver a sustainable footing for our family payments system, everybody will recall that this Leader of the Opposition during the budget reply had that little sound bite about 'forgotten families'. But then when it came to the vote in here, this Leader of Opposition forgot about them. He will say one thing at one point in time to one group of people and then of course, when it came to the vote in this House of Representatives, this Leader of the Opposition voted for the changes that the government had put in the budget-exactly the same performance in this budget that this Leader of the Opposition went along with back in 2009. We know that exactly the same behaviour has taken place from this Leader of the Opposition when he said, I am sure people will remember, that under any government of order. I hesitate to use the phrase that talked about before, but I cannot understand how this could possibly be directly relevant. It is an unmitigated attack on the Leader of the Opposition-a weak attack on the Leader of the Opposition as well-in a question about family tax payments.",98
184,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sturt will resume his place. The question went on to ask about risks and how the government was addressing those risks. The minister has the call.,99
185,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Everyone will recall this Leader of the Opposition going out on the six o'clock news telling people that there would be no new taxes on business under a government that he led. There would be no new taxes on business and then a few days later this Leader of the Opposition announced a great big new tax to pay for his paid parental leave scheme.,99
186,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has concluded. Carbon Pricing,99
187,Mr TUDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the praise her Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change the gave to Mystique printing, a small printing company in my electorate, as being 'the first Australian printing company to be certified carbon neutral'. Given that this business is carbon neutral, why is the Prime Minister hitting it with a carbon tax that will cost it thousands of dollars in higher electricity, paper and transport costs?",99
188,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I would say to the member who asked the question that, once again, this is a misrepresentation by the opposition. I doubt the printing business that he refers to, if it is carbon neutral, is amongst the 500 biggest polluters in this country, so it will not be you paying a price per tonne. The question, as it is phrased, is an attempt to mislead the Australian people.",99
189,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,99
190,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! If I actually knew who had used the expression, I would have asked for a withdrawal. When a question is asked there is an expectation that the response is listened to. Carbon Farming Initiative",99
191,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Will the minister outline the reasons for the government's decision to contribute to the purchase of Henbury Station as well as the implications for carbon farming? What is the government's response to other opinions that have been put forward in relation to carbon farming?",99
192,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (15:09): I thank the member for Lyons for the question and note his strong interest in the Carbon Farming Initiative and the extra lines of income it can provide for land use. During the break the government, through the National Reserve System, was responsible for the largest parcel of land ever purchased through the National Reserve System. Together with RM Williams, we contributed $9.1 million to a $13 million purchase price to convert Henbury Station to what will be the world's largest carbon farm. On Henbury station, what RM Williams are wanting to do is effectively provide a template, a canvas, where they can, through trial and error, work through the best way to drive business models for carbon farming. What this will provide is an extra line of income and effectively a massive demonstration project that other large pastoralists and other farmers will be able look at. It is using some of the best accountancy advice available. It was interesting to listen to the earlier exchanges when people were talking about which way investment goes through international linking. Just before question time. I received a text message from David Pearse, who has been responsible for the project for RM Williams, who let me know that they have already been approached about international linking by major European insurance companies wanting to invest in carbon in Australia because of the Carbon Farming Initiative-wanting to pay international permits and use them in Australia through the Carbon Farming Initiative. You would have thought that the concept of the Carbon Farming Initiative was something that may have provided some Water, level of bipartisanship across the chamber, but no. Senator Nash, when this was announced, opposed the Henbury purchase. She opposed there on the Finke River Australia being involved in the world's largest carbon farm on the basis of the principles that had already been put by the Leader of the Opposition. He said we should not go to prime agricultural land and Senator Nash then described Henbury Station as an example of prime agricultural land. Can I make clear Henbury Station is in Central Australia. Henbury Station is in the red earth area, surrounded by desert, in Central Australia. The coalition are looking for where they are going to plant their trees. They are looking for an area five times the size of Tasmania, they are looking for an area roughly the size of Germany but they have ruled out the Darling Downs, they have ruled out New England, they have now ruled out all of the desert and they have now ruled to out all of Central Australia. Where will their trees go? Where is the concept of carbon farming? There is a limit to how many trees the Leader of the Opposition can plant at Manly Beach. There is a limit to how well trees will grow if they decide to plant them in the oceans. Once you start describing the entire continent as 'prime agricultural land' you are effectively saying that anything that goes to carbon sequestration is off the agenda. You can also add inside that black hole where sits $70 billion their entire direct action policy. Carbon Pricing",100
193,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her previous answer to the member for Aston. Is the Prime Minister seriously suggesting that small businesses such as Mystique printing will be exempted from the 10 per cent higher electricity charges admitted in her own carbon tax modelling?,100
194,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I am seriously suggesting that it is inappropriate for the opposition to phrase questions or make statements which mislead people about who is liable to pay a price per tonne for carbon pollution. That is what that question did. It sought to mislead on who was liable for paying the carbon tax. Superannuation,101
195,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. Will the Assistant Treasurer inform the House why it is vital to harness the resource boom to invest in increased superannuation, lower company taxes and better infrastructure? What are the risks to these reforms?",101
196,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (15:14): I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She is very committed to the mining industry and, indeed, sharing the prosperity of the mining boom throughout Australia. The minerals resource rent tax is about a fair deal for all Australians from Australia's nonrenewable natural resources. It is a very good idea. We have an unprecedented boom in the mining industry. This is due, of course, to the ongoing rise of Asian economies. We have the highest terms of trade in 140 years. Eventually the penny will drop with the opposition that this mining boom is extraordinary, the likes of which we have never seen before. Whilst this mining boom is bringing great benefits for many within the mining industry, we are also seeing at the same time a patchwork economy. Not all of Australia is going as well as the mining sector. It is important when we have benefits from the mining boom that we share the prosperity across the whole Australian economy. That is why when the Gillard government introduces the mining resource rent tax it is our intention to pass on the benefits of the mining boom to all parts of Australia. That is why we want to lower corporate tax to 29 per cent. That is why we want to raise compulsory superannuation for all Australians from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That is why we want to have better infrastructure across the whole of this continent to make sure that all can benefit. That is why we want simplified taxes for all Australians. The question I was asked also talked about inconsistency. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition thinks that miners are paying too much tax. He said it on his radio station of choice, 2GB, on 26 May. He thinks the miners are paying more than their fair share of tax now. How can he think that when Rio Tinto, Xstrata and BHP have set new records for profits in this most extraordinary mining boom? The Leader of the Opposition also says that the mining resource rent tax will kill off the industry. He said it is guaranteed. He said that in a doorstop on 10 June. Yet in that same period we have seen mining capital expenditure go from $35 billion to $51 billion this year and forecast at over $80 billion next year. The Leader of the Opposition would have you believe that raising this minerals resource rent tax is bad for the economy. On the contrary, we say to 2.7 million small businesses: 'This is good for you. We want you to share in the prosperity.' As much as the opposition do not like hearing about inconsistency, they always take the path of least resistance. When there is the option of lazy economics they are always first to the front of the queue. They would have you believe that, if they were to form the government of this nation, they would cut the mining taxes to the richest companies in Australia, yet sack 12,000 hard working Commonwealth public servants. They would have you believe that raising superannuation to 12 per cent is a bad idea, but they pay themselves 15 per cent. Furthermore, they would have you believe that lowering corporate tax to 29 per cent is a bad idea, yet they would put a Coles and Woolworths tax on that clanger of an idea that you forecast. In fact, the only time when the opposition are not inconsistent was on the Funniest Home Videos news clip on Saturday in Perth. The Leader of the Opposition looked everywhere but at the question. He was struck dumb. He was like a man in a round room looking for a corner. (Time expired) Ms Gillard: I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: I ask that the minister who gave the last answer table the speech from which he read.",101

The SPEAKER (15:20): I will do as required under the standing orders. I will write to the minister. NA NA Carbon Pricing The SPEAKER (15:20): I have received a letter from the honourable member for Flinders proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to adequately explain its carbon tax. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",102
202,Mr HUNT,IMPORTANCE," The government is spending $25 million of taxpayers' money on advertising its carbon tax, but it is not giving the facts, the details and the impacts and it is not telling the truth about what will happen to Australians, Australian businesses and the Australian economy under this carbon tax, nor is it telling the truth about the alternatives. Let me begin where the Prime Minister left off just a few moments ago. The member for Aston asked about the impact of the carbon tax on Mystique printing. Mystique printing is a carbon neutral business but it will still have electricity bills to pay. Mystique printing is not going to be magically exempt from electricity bills. Mystique printing, like hairdressers, pizza shops, small manufacturing shops around the country and firms of any shape, sort, type or nature that consume electricity or gas, will have higher bills to pay. The Prime Minister would not stand before this House, in the same way that her advertising campaign will not disclose the full facts and the truth to the people of Australia, and give the simple plain truth that Mystique printing will have higher electricity bills-on the government's estimate, 10 per cent alone in the first year. And that is simply on their electricity bills. It is nine per cent alone in the first year on their gas bills and, most significantly, as the New South Wales Treasury modelling has shown, a 15 per cent increase in electricity, debunking the figures provided by the government. That is in the first year, because each year and every year thereafter the cost for firms such as Mystique printing will increase. Each year and every year thereafter the costs for Australian families will increase, but the full scope, scale and nature of the impacts of this tax have not been released, have not been disclosed and have not been given to the Australian people by the government. Let us start with something very simple. This is the government's modelling. At the top of page 18 of the government's summary modelling document, there is a simple proposition. It says: Macroeconomic modelling with an domestic carbon price of $20 in 2012-13. Five and a half weeks after the carbon tax was released, this government has yet to release modelling which reflects even the correct carbon price. When your modelling cannot reflect the correct carbon price of $23, which is 15 per cent higher, 5½ weeks after it has been released then you know that something is not right with the government of the day. This government has directly, deliberately and consistently failed to disclose the full detail, the full impact on Australian houses and Australian homes of their system and it has been utterly untruthful in analysing the alternative model available to the Australian people and utterly untruthful in presenting the world as it is today. So let me begin, when we look at the government's failure to adequately explain its carbon tax, with the cost to families. Nowhere have I seen in any of the numerous television advertisements at taxpayers' expense, in any of the numerous mainstream newspaper advertisements at taxpayers' expense, in any of the local newspaper advertisements at taxpayers' expense or in any of the internet advertisements at taxpayers' expense the simple fact that the average Australian household will pay $515 per year more for their cost of living as a consequence of the carbon tax. There is no recognition that the New South Wales Treasury says it will have a 15 per cent impact on their electricity prices for households-for mums, for dads, for pensioners, for seniors-in the first year of the carbon tax, before increasing each year every year thereafter. That is the nature and purpose and intent of this tax: to drive down demand by driving up the cost of living in the hope that a sufficiently punitive price will cause people initial to shiver through winter and swelter through summer. That is the nature and goal of this particular mechanism. That is what it is designed to do. It is designed to hurt those who are least able to afford it so that they will consume less electricity. That is the structure and the intent. On numerous occasions the Prime Minister has talked about people consuming the lower cost product. Unfortunately the lower cost, lower carbon product does not exist. The lower the carbon, the higher the cost. What we see is this government intentionally driving up electricity prices. The fundamental problem with what this government is doing is that electricity is an essential service and if you drive up electricity you drive down the quality of life for Australian families. But you do not drive down the consumption significantly because people substitute not out of electricity consumption but out of the ordinary day-today things. Electricity goes up but consumption barely changes. On every analysis it is a largely inelastic good and so, in real human terms, families suffer. As we see in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, higher electricity prices have not made a material difference to consumption but they have made a dramatic difference to the cost of living for ordinary Australian families. It goes on from that, though. These things are not set out in the government's carbon tax advertising. The fact is that we are likely to see, as the member for Bennelong has found, that in the city of Ryde $1.8 million of electricity bills for lighting will go up immediately by $270,000, according to the New South Wales Treasury. That $270,000 will either come off services to local ratepayers in the city of Ryde or it will go onto the cost of council rates. There is nothing about that in the government's carbon tax advertising. Nor is the fact that there will be over $100 million of additional landfill costs to be passed through council rates as a consequence of this tax. There are better ways of doing this that do not involve a massive increase, a $27 billion tax over three years, a $36 billion tax over four years. That is the size and scope and scale of this carbon tax and these are the figures that are missing from the government's carbon tax advertising. Nor is there reference to the fact that for dairy farmers, on some estimates provided by the industry, the average cost will be $7,000 per year more. Some of that will be passed through to consumers, but in many cases where the vast bulk of production is sent to export markets it is the dairy farmer that will face those costs. The dairy farmer on a struggling farm will meet that cost himself or herself, with the cost going straight back to the family budget and the impact on their viability. Nor do we see the extraordinary fact that South this carbon tax produces approximately 25 per cent of all of the savings that the government claims will be made in terms of electricity emissions. This is the great lie at the heart of the policy and the advertising. Approximately 100 million tonnesaccording to the summary indicators document, 101 million tonnes-will be sourced from overseas. According to the deeper modelling document, 94 million tonnes will be sourced from overseas. Let's call it a rounded figure of 100 million tonnes that will be sourced from overseas and that is using abatement purchasing. That is using the very model which this government has attacked, derided, denounced and ridiculed. At the end of the day they have been forced into an abatement purchasing model. The second thing, though, is that 20 million of their 160 million tonnes comes from an incentive scheme to clean up the power stations. The difference is that we would clean them up and they would close them down. This is the heart of direct action which they have ridiculed, mocked, derided and yet adopted when it comes to the moment. That leaves the carbon tax itself being responsible for about 40 million tonnes of emissions reduction versus business as usual by 2020. What does that mean? It means that the effective cost of carbon for domestic abatement using their tax is well over $160 per tonne. It means that their system, which relies on driving up the price of electricity, is fundamentally economically unsound because it has relied upon either driving down demand by driving up pricebut the history of Australian economics in the last 30 years, as Colin Barnett says, is that electricity is an essential service-or changing supply by forcing the closure of coal fired power stations unfortunately, their own work shows that a dramatically higher price still would be needed. In other words, their system on their own analysis does not work. Seventy-five per cent of their reduction comes from some form of direct action and 25 per cent of their reduction actually comes from the carbon tax. The carbon tax is entirely superfluous reducing emissions. These figures are not included in any of the advertising, which is why it is so execrable. More significantly, when you look at the modelling you see that the $20 per tonne carbon price 5½ weeks later still has not been updated. How can it be, Minister Combet, that you have the wrong carbon price in your modelling? How can it be that the government of Australia has the wrong carbon price in its modelling? It is unacceptable, indefensible and incompetent. Nor has the modelling been reflected to update the fact that its assumption of 100 cent purchase from overseas sources has been overturned by a political decision to leave it at 50 per cent purchasing from overseas sources. Nor does the modelling indicate the fact that the brown coal buyout is entirely unfunded. They already have a $4.3 billion black hole but, other than some vague reference to the contingency reserves beyond the forward estimates, there is no provisioning for the $2 billion plus that is likely to be the cost of the brown coal buyout. While we have a $10 billion program where we are completely upfront, they have a program which over nine years is likely to be well over $80 billion. What we see is a $4.3 billion black hole to start, another $2 billion that is missing and none these figures are set out in the carbon tax advertising. Then this brings me to the extraordinary element which the Leader of the Opposition made reference to today, $3½ billion each where, year every year from 2020 onwards-it will start at a lower figure before then but it will climb-will be spent on purchasing foreign carbon credits from foreign carbon traders. That is Australian money going straight offshore each year with a huge impact on our national viability. According to page 72 of the government's own modelling, that figure to by 2050 will be 434 million tonnes of certificates at a price in 2010 dollars of $131 at a total cost to the economy of $57 billion or approaching 1½ per cent of GDP, and that is on purchasing foreign carbon credits from foreign carbon traders. The Australian Crime Commission has found that there has been widespread fraud in Europe in relation to these credits. This is not in relation to some emerging economy. In Europe there has been massive fraud using this approach and that is what this government is proposing-1½ per cent of GDP on foreign carbon credits alone, $3½ per billion by 2020 on foreign carbon credits from foreign carbon traders alone. We set out in our policy on day one-which the minister has failed to acknowledge, but I see on page 14 of the direct action policy in big blue headlines the words, 'Direct Action in Australia, not Overseas'-that every dollar of our policy would be spent in Australia. Obviously, the minister made a false statement to parliament yesterday. He would not defend himself today. We set up from day one that every dollar would be spent in Australia. If the minister is unable to read the document, there it is in big blue letters, 'Direct Action in Australia, not Overseas', every dollar to be spent in Australia. The minister might do the honourable thing and of apologise to the House for his express, clear and absolute misstatement yesterday because there is no defending that. He knows it, we know it, the Australian press gallery know it and the Australian people will increasingly know that we have seen deception on a grand scale. But at the bottom line at the end of day what this government has done is that it has systemically misled the Australian people about the costs to households of the carbon tax, the costs to businesses such as Mystique printing, and the cost to the economy of $3½ billion a year straight to foreign carbon traders. (Time expired)",102
203,Mr COMBET,IMPORTANCE," I appreciate the opportunity to explain the government's policy, but at the outset can I completely repudiate the assertion that was just made by the shadow minister that I had made a false statement to the House. That is completely incorrect and I repudiate it entirely. It was completely unsubstantiated. On 10 July the government announced a Clean Energy Future package. What we announced was accompanied by a very detailed set of materials outlining a host of the policy issues in detail including Treasury modelling and a number of other materials. At its core were a number of elements. One of them was a carbon pricing mechanism. The carbon price mechanism is an emissions trading scheme that commences with a three year fixed price period, commencing from 1 July 2012, and from 1 July 2015 it is an internationally linked, fully flexible, emissions trading scheme-that is, it links with international carbon markets. I will return to that issue in time to address some of the comments made by the shadow minister. There were other important elements of the announcement by the government on 10 July. Within that announcement was very strong support for renewable energy and a number of measures to improve energy efficiency in households and in businesses. A very significant element of the package relates to the land sector, carbon farming and the storage of carbon in the landscape. It the very comprehensive policy package and I do not think anyone could seriously assert that a considerable amount of detail was not provided to the community. I make that point to repudiate the general statement that the shadow minister was endeavouring to make. The policy material is principally contained in the document Securing a clean energy future. Behind it sits a very comprehensive and credible set of Treasury modelling based upon the scenarios that would appropriately underpin a major policy initiative of this nature, representing, as it does, significant economic and environmental reform. All of that material is available to the community and has been published. It is worth recalling for the moment that this is an emissions trading scheme and it has some features in common with the policy that Labor endeavoured to prosecute in the previous term of parliament. That previous proposal was at one point in time the subject of agreement with the coalition. It included important features such as the international linking of the emissions trading scheme with the international carbon markets. It is embarrassing, in fact, to hear the shadow minister repudiate so much that he stood for in the past from a policy standpoint, having completed a thesis on market mechanisms, including, I think, a set of policy propositions that he has completely walked away from. It is a pretty pathetic thing to see. The entire policy position that the government announced is underpinned by the climate science. Of course, this is another matter of contention across both sides of politics. The shadow minister professes to accept and respect the climate science, but his party is led by someone who has had 100 different positions on the science and who sends the signal to those in the community who do not respect the science that he is with is a them. It is the same way that he walks both sides of the street on many different issues. In a formal forum he will say he accepts and respects the science, but when it is appropriate-particularly when he is on radio in Sydney with Alan Jones, his close colleague-he will send a very clear signal that he has no respect for the science, no respect for scientists and indeed no respect for economists, who support dealing with carbon pollution by a market mechanism. It is always important to come back to the foundation of the science because the opposition has no credible policy to address what scientists are telling us. We always have to bear in mind that the empirical evidence is clear. Last year, 2010, was the warmest year on record, equal with some others. It was the 34th consecutive year with temperatures higher than the 20th century average. The warmest decade on record was 2001 to 2010, and each decade since the 1940s has been warmer than the last. This country, and many others, has a lot to lose from climate change and the warming that we are experiencing. The science is telling that carbon pollution is contributing to the change that we are experiencing. It is an international problem. The atmosphere is global; it is not confined to any national boundaries. Australia needs to participate in discussions with other countries about how we will address this problem, because, in particular, Australia is one of the top 20 polluters internationally and the highest polluter per person of all of the developed economies. No responsible government receiving this scientific advice and recognising these statistics has any alternative but to address this issue, in partnership with the international community, by reducing its levels of carbon pollution and driving investment in clean energy sources in its own economy in order to play a responsible part internationally in dealing with this issue. It is incumbent on any government receiving this advice to act upon it. The government must take these steps to cut pollution, to contribute to international efforts to address climate change and to drive change in our own economy, but to do so at least cost to our economy, at least cost to businesses and at least cost to households. This is precisely what has driven the development of the policy that the government announced on 10 July. A carbon price mechanism, in partnership with the other elements that I described earlier, will drive cuts in pollution in our economy at least cost to the economy, to businesses and to households. It is a simple proposition, to provide the incentive to cut pollution to the largest emitters of pollution in our economy. Those polluters can reduce their liability under the carbon price mechanism by reducing their pollution. They can do so in particular by improving energy efficiency and investing in us lower emissions technologies. It will be particularly important in the years to come to improve the performance of our electricity generating sector with respect to the pollution that is attendant upon electricity generation. The advantage of a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme is that the government can set emissions reduction targets. In fact, there is supposed to be bipartisan support for a set of emissions reduction targets in this parliament, in this House. The unconditional bipartisan emissions reduction targets that both sides have indicated their acceptance of is a five per cent reduction in pollution by 2020 from year 2000 levels. The carbon pollution mechanism that the government announced on 10 July will deliver at least that outcome, and that represents a reduction by the year 2020 of 160 million tonnes of carbon pollution. That is a very important commitment. The government has also indicated its intention to establish the Climate Change Authority. It will be chaired by former Reserve Bank Governor and Treasury secretary Mr Bernie Fraser. The Climate Change Authority will have responsibility of providing advice and recommendations to government on the pollution caps that will operate under the emissions trading scheme so that from 2015, when we commence emissions trading with international linking, pollution caps will be set by regulation by government. The emissions trading scheme will achieve at least the 160 million tonnes of pollution reduction by 2020, but the Climate Change Authority may recommend further emissions reduction targets by that time. Government has the discretion, of course, to act on those recommendations. The other thing that is important in the development of an approach to tackle climate change and is represented in the policy that the government has announced is, as I mentioned, that we address change within the electricity-generating sector. One of the elements of that that is contained in the policy is the commitment by the government to seek to negotiate the closure of up to 2,000 megawatts of high-emissions, older, pollution-generating capacity in our system. The shadow minister falsely indicates that there has been no provision made for that negotiation in the material that was released; in fact, there is provision. A contingency has been made in the contingency reserve in the budget for that negotiation for the closure of up to 2,000 megawatts of high-emissions capacity. I do not think any responsible government is about to indicate what that quantum that has been provisioned may be. There will be a negotiation should some participants in the energy market wish to discuss that issue with the government, but we are not about to indicate to those players what the government may have provisioned. However, a provision has been made. A number of other important elements of the policy have also been included. The the government has indicated a commitment to establish a clean energy finance corporation and make an equity investment of $10 billion. That corporation could provide loans, loan guarantees or make equity investments in an effort to assist participants in the private sector and bring some technologies to the market. Mrs Mirabella: Not a front for your mates?",106
204,Mr COMBET,IMPORTANCE,"The member for Indi suggests it may have some inappropriate use. It will not. It will be a finance corporation with an independent board. It will have an investment mandate and it will be established in a manner that will ensure that it operates in an appropriate fashion to assist and commercialise low-emissions technologies and renewable technologynotwithstanding all the slur, slander and rubbish that comes from the other side. Importantly, having established all of these mechanisms to cut pollution and drive investment in our economy, naturally the government has also placed a lot of attention on assistance to households and businesses, in particular to households to deal with any price consequences of the establishment of a carbon price in the economy. The Treasury modelling on this is clear. There is projected to be a 0.7 per cent increase in the CPI as a consequence of introducing the carbon price mechanism. The average potential price impact on households averaged across the economy is around $9.90 according to the Treasury modelling. The government, of course, will institute tax cuts, increases in the pension, increases in family tax benefits and a host of other Commonwealth payments to offset for many households that price impact, modest as it may be. In fact, the average level of assistance provided to households across the economy is $10.10. The tax cuts will be delivered by a very important tax reform. The proposition contained in the policy material that the government will implement provides for an increase in the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 from 1 July next year and, from 1 July 2015, an increase in the tax-free threshold to $19,400. This will mean that more than one million people will not have to submit an income tax return. It will deliver tax cuts to many households. Coupled with that, pensions and other Commonwealth payments will rise by 1.7 per cent, meaning that, contrary to the assertions falsely made by the shadow minister, nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance to meet the modest price impacts. Six million households will receive assistance to meet their expected average price impact. Four million households will receive assistance of 120 per cent of their expected price impact. Single pensioners will be better off. Coupled pensioners will be better off. Many others in that category of four million households will be better off. On top of this, the government is providing significant assistance to industry to support jobs, in particular in relation to industries that are in the emissions-intensive trade-exposed part of the economy. There is also assistance for small business. There are other measures contained in the policy announcement that are very important that interested members of the community have access to. Up against all of this is a farce of a policy from the coalition. It does not stack up. When the policy was first enunciated by the shadow minister in February 2010, it asserted that about 70 per cent of the emissions reductions it proposed could to achieve an emissions reduction target of a five per cent cut in year-2000 levels of emissions in our economy by 2020 could be achieved from soil carbons. The science is not there, and it does not comply with the international rules. It simply cannot work. (Time expired) Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (15:51): The minister, the member for Charlton, gave us one of his least convincing performances. He has this tactic: if you want to have everyone switch off, if the potato is too hot to handle, speak in the most boring monotone voice to bore people into submission. We have a government that is not and should not be surprised that they are not believed. It all goes back to an issue of trust. She stole an election result on the explicit promise, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead', knowing full well that she did not intend to fulfil that promise. They go to an election campaign saying that they will not introduce a carbon tax. They belittle and ridicule the Leader of the Opposition-who said that there would be a carbon tax. Then they win government and give into the Greens, not in order to save the planet but to save Ms Gillard's job. She is called the great negotiator. What a fool! She should have known there was no way in hell that the Greens would have supported the Liberals over the Labor Party. There was no way they were going to support Tony Abbott. She gave the Greens the carbon tax. She decided, using her great negotiating skills, that the Greens would run away to the Liberal Party. What a fool! What an idiot! What a liar, as she is called by so many people in the community.",108
205,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," Order! The member for Indi will resume her seat. I require the member for Indi to withdraw the term 'liar' and other derogatory terms referring to the Prime Minister, and while I am at it I would ask the member for Indi to refer to other members in accordance with standing order 64, not by their name. I call the honourable member for Indi. Mrs MIRABELLA: I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker, and fully respect the standing orders that prevent me as a member in this House from repeating the comments made out there in the community from one end of the country to the other, particularly from many former Labor voters. But when a Prime Minister goes to an election making such an explicit comment, then reneges on it and decides to sell out to Bob Brown and decides to speak to Bob Brown before her own backbenchers, is it any surprise that people do not believe the scant explanation and promises given on the carbon tax and the so-called compensation package? People do not believe that the CPI will increase 0.7 per cent-and why should they? None of the government's budget estimates or midyear updates have been accurate in any way whatsoever. Why would the situation change now? We have seen costs go up and up and up. The carbon tax will go up but compensation will not go up. The minister talks about modest price increases, but people are already hurting. They know that they cannot trust the government's modelling; it has not been fully explained and there are many factors that have not been included. For example, where is the modelling to show the number of SMEs that will close? We know that the SME sector is very important in Australia. We know that it has the least capacity to absorb increased costs of production. We all know that, when small businesses close and larger businesses increase their market power, prices also go up. That has not been factored into the government's projections either. The government says there will be all this compensation, but what is the reality? Everyone knows that a carbon tax is intended to hurt every time you use electricity and every time you use energy. Even on the government's own figures, even if we were trusting and naive enough to believe the figures that it has provided, we see that a couple earning $60,000 each with two children would be worse off. A couple earning $60,000 with no children would be worse off. A single person earning $60,000 would be worse off. This is intended to punish consumers because that is what the Greens want. The Greens want to punish consumers. They think we probably live too affluent a lifestyle, we use too much and we consume too much; so let us just punish people-punish people into submission! If you look at average wages in professions by only such as teachers, ambulance drivers, accountants, crane operators, manufacturers, park rangers and physiotherapists, all of these people will be worse off. We hear about compensation to industry, but if you do not damage industry you do not need to pretend to compensate it. As Graham Kraehe from BlueScope said, any compensation would be like a bandaid over a bullet wound.",109
206,Mr Bradbury,IMPORTANCE,"When did he say that? Mrs MIRABELLA: He said that at the National Press Club. You should have been there, my friend. You should go to your electorate of Lindsay and speak to those people who are saying to us: 'Our member is letting us down. Our member does not understand how hard we are doing it. Our member does not understand how difficult it is to make ends meet. And now, instead of listening to mainstream Australia and Lindsay, our member supports the Prime Minister in sucking up to Bob Brown so she can keep her job.' You are a disgrace and you should hang your head in shame. When we look at the steel industry, a very important industry, and those important workers across the country, particularly in Port Kembla, we hear the government proudly say that it is providing additional assistance to the industry. It is supposed to be $300 million in assistance, but guess what? For our two main steel companies, BlueScope and OneSteel, the total value lost on the first day that the carbon tax was announced was almost the equivalent of the package. On the second day the value that these companies lost was over $100 million. So your so-called compensation is inadequate to even make up for the loss in corporate value of our two main steelmakers. So much for compensation! This government is all about churn: punish people, bring in a program, tax it, borrow it, hand it around, move it around-a bit of trickery and a bit of deception. No wonder there is no trust in what is said. This government has not explained to the Australian people that Australian industry and Australian manufacturers are some of the most efficient in the world. Our steel producers are the most efficient in the world. They create fewer emissions and have a more efficient production process than exists in China. The government has not explained that to the Australian people. It has not said to the steelworkers: 'You do a great job. You are part of an efficient and effective industry.' 'No', it has said: 'You are big, polluters. You naughty people! You make steel-the steel we need for our cars, the steel we need for our houses-you big, bad, naughty people! We would prefer to make the steel you make more expensive, to drive manufacturing offshore to countries that will create more emissions to make the same things we used to make'. So we are closing down industry and closing down jobs toguess what?-increase worldwide emissions because our manufacturing will go to places like China, where they create more emissions making the same stuff that we used to make. You have not explained any of those facts, not to your constituents and not to the Australian people. You have not actually stood up and been proud of Australian manufacturing. In industries like cement, chemicals and plastics; in the steel industry, in the car industry and the car components industry; in food and grocery processing; and in aluminium and glass making, a carbon tax is going to punish these industries and give a leg-up to imports with which they compete. So we will be sending our manufacturing offshore to increase emissions. Many Australian businesses already operate on wafer-thin margins. Does the government listen? No. When the Prime Minister was asked, 'What do you say to manufacturing?', she giggled, 'Ha, ha, ha. They will do what they've always done. They'll innovate; they'll get on with it'. Well, Prime Minister, manufacturing businesses are facing a pretty tough time and your carbon tax will send many of them to the wall and will send many of them offshore. What will it do to households? It will hurt them even more because of the lie you spread during the last election and the lies you continue to spread now. Mr Dreyfus interjecting",110

218,Mr DREYFUS,IMPORTANCE,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:02): It is a pleasure to rise on this matter of public importance raised by the member for Flinders, because it is a significant achievement for the opposition. In introducing this matter they have had to use the words 'matter of public importance' in the context of the climate change debate. After listening to months and months of the 'no, no, no, no' campaign waged by the opposition-which is all we have heard from the member for Flinders, all we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition and all we have heard from those opposite-I can tell members of the House that this grudging acceptance that this is a matter of public Indi importance is about as close as we are going to get to recognition from the opposition of the importance of this environmental threat to Australia and the whole. I am more than happy to talk about the government's climate change policy, about how we are getting on with the job of legislating a carbon price for Australia and how we are getting on with the job of legislating to tackle climate change by putting a price tag on every tonne of pollution that is produced by around 500 large polluters. That carbon price will commence on 1 July 2012. I am very pleased to talk to the House about how every He has member of the Labor caucus since we announced the scheme on 10 July has been out there discussing the carbon price package; out there discussing the clean energy future plan that we have for Australia with communities and with businesses around the country, and about our plans to continue that discussion with the Australian people as we move to deliver this major economic and environmental reform. Of course, I will wait, because I do not think that we have yet had all of the speakers from the opposition. I must be patient; we have not heard from all of them. I will wait to hear the lament that they seem to share because they are concerned about the way that the carbon price plan for Australia has been explained by raising this matter; their lament at the impediments that have been put in the way of the government-by the opposition-in adequately explaining the carbon price. I hope that we will hear from some members of the opposition who are yet to speak about some of the misinformation that has made its way into the public debate. I fear we are going to be disappointed, because we have seen two further examples this afternoon-in the speech by the member for Flinders and in the speech by the member for Indi-of the repetition of misinformation; further repetition of false claims about the effect of the carbon price on Australian manufacturing and about the effect of the carbon price on Australian industry. What we should be hearing from those in the opposition, if they were genuinely concerned about properly debating this question with the Australian people, is a complaint about the way the Leader of the Opposition has engaged in a fouror fivemonth-long bricklaying, petrol-pumping, fish-slicing fear campaign that has done so much to crowd out genuine debate on this issue. They might pause to reflect on the full spectrum of the misinformation that the opposition has been spreading about the carbon price plan, which has now included singing and dancing in the Senate, Shakespearean recitals, made up figures, made up facts, the wall of Weet-Bix, denial of climate change-apparently followed by a reluctant acceptance of climate changesome cameos with Pauline Hanson and also, really, just an exploration of the red-cordialKraehe induced limits of silliness. I know there are few speakers from the opposition yet to speak. Perhaps we will hear from them and I must wait. In contrast to what can only be described as the completely unprincipled and disgraceful campaign from the Leader of the Opposition, assisted by the member for Indi in particular, where the opposition has sought to misrepresent the government's position across the country and instil in Australians fears about their job security and cost-of-living pressures that are completely unjustified, the government will continue to explain the carbon price package, the clean energy future plan, to the Australian people, and I am looking forward to continuing to do this in the months to come. In the past few weeks I have visited communities in Victoria, in Queensland, in the ACT and in New South Wales, and I have spoken to businesses, to community leaders, to people at retirement villages and to people at bowls clubs about how Australia is going to be implementing this carbon price and about the financial benefits to our country of implementing this carbon price. I have met with people in communities who want to know the details of the assistance that is going to be coming their way under the clean energy future plan, about the assistance that is going to go to nine out of 10 households, about the tax cuts that are going to go to everyone in this country who is earning under $80,000 a year and about the extra benefits that are going to be flowing to everyone in receipt of a pension or a government benefit. This is in contrast to the kind of fantasy land inhabited by the member for Indi, who this afternoon was again repeating-but in a particularly egregious fashion-elements of the opposition's scare campaign about the steel industry. She made a remarkable misattribution of the time at which Graham spoke; I have had it checked while I a have been waiting to speak, and in fact he spoke on 22 March this year, so it was some months before the carbon price package was announced. Graham Kraehe is, of course, the chair of BlueScope. I think it is more important to look at what the two steel companies of our country, OneSteel and BlueScope, said about the carbon price plan after it was announced. We have Geoff Plummer, the managing director and CEO of OneSteel, saying in his release to the Australian Stock Exchange-a formal document-on 10 July 2011: We believe that on balance, the sectoral approach announced today by the Prime Minister for the steel industry, including the introduction of Steel Transformation Planis both appropriate and sensible. We are pleased that the Government has responded by adopting this approach. I then go to the BlueScope response, contrary to what was suggested by the member for Indi. This is Paul O'Malley, managing director and CEO of BlueScope Steel, speaking on 11 July 2011, the day after we released the clean energy future plan: This is a pragmatic solution to a complex problem. BlueScope said: … the Government‘s proposed new Steel Transformation Plan (STP) recognised the Company‘s long-standing call for a sectoral approach to a carbon tax in Australia. Mr O'Malley said: The STP will provide funds to minimise the impact of the carbon tax on the Australian steel industry for the first four years … And it signals the Government‘s intention to limit the potential pass-through of Scope 3 coal emissions costs onto steelmakers … In summary, the STP materially reduces the overall cost of the carbon tax on BlueScope. … The Government has listened to our arguments and our deep concerns about the carbon tax In the STP it has produced a packageand so on. Those, of course, are not the words that the member for Indi wants to hear, and that is why she did not quote from actual commentary made by Australia's two steel companies after the announcement of our clean energy future plan. We have the situation that the opposition's scare campaign is falling apart day by day. As more and more Australians learn the details of the government's clean energy future plan, there will be less and less concern. Because there is less and less the- concern as Australians learn of the details of the assistance going to nine in 10 Australian households, we are seeing more and more shrillness and nonsense spoken by those opposite and more and more misleading statements-anything rather than actually quoting from what the steel companies are telling Australians, anything rather than actually quoting from our plan and anything rather than explaining to the Australian people that there is in fact assistance coming to nine in 10 households. By the end of next year-I know that is a long time off for the short-term people on the benches opposite to even contemplate-a few months after the introduction of the carbon price on 1 July 2012, which I know is a long time for those opposite to think about, Australians are going to be saying: 'What on earth were the opposition banging on about? What on earth was the Leader of the Opposition banging on about? What on earth was the member for Indi banging on about as she went around Australia trying to drum up fear by spreading misinformation and misrepresenting the effect of the carbon price?' As for the inaction policy of the coalition, it is not capable of meeting the target which the Liberal Party claim to share. (Time expired)",112
219,Mr HARTSUYKER,IMPORTANCE," I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance, but before I go to the substance of my contribution I would just like to challenge a few words from the member for Isaacs. He commented on the fact that the Prime Minister said from on high: 'Go out and sell the carbon tax. Go out and make your voices heard. Go out and tell the Australian people why higher power prices are going to be so good for them.' And do you know what the response was, Mr Deputy Speaker? The response was silence, because I have to say I did not hear too many marginal seat members out there selling the benefits of higher electricity prices and job losses. I did not see too many marginal seat members saying too much at all about the carbon tax. In fact, they were running and hiding. I have to say that, if you wanted to see the definition of someone looking sick, it was a Labor marginal seat holder when the Prime Minister came to visit to sell the carbon tax, because it is a toxic tax that nobody wants and you are deluding yourselves to think any differently. This day, one day after the first anniversary of that notorious statement that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led, the Prime Minister needs to explain why she is so intent on doing so much damage to the Australian economy, on destroying jobs, on driving up the cost of living and on cruelling small business and large business. We have a situation where the world is facing very challenging and very uncertain times. Just yesterday the Treasurer said there had been: … big swings in global share markets, a downgrade to the US government's triple-A rating … and a rapid rise in borrowing costs facing Spain and Italy. He continued: In uncertain times like these, it is more important than ever that we have a mature debate about our economy and where it is heading … Yet at the same time his government is imposing a carbon tax which will increase the cost of doing business, that will cost jobs, that will slow growth and that will damage our economy. This is no time for this negligent Prime Minister to be introducing a carbon tax that is going to do so much damage to Australia. Overnight, Germany announced that their GDP slowed to almost a standstill in the second quarter of 2011, increasing only 0.1 per cent, down from 1.2 per cent in the previous quarter. Markets took a dive again overnight over fears that France is struggling to deal with its debt crisis, which totals 85 per cent of French GDP, some €1.65 trillion. Countries like Greece and Spain are struggling with trillions of dollars of debt brought on by governments spending more than they can afford. There is a crisis of confidence in the world economy. The US government owes US$14.6 trillion. Australia must ensure that our economy remains as stable as possible and not do anything to threaten our growth. Instead, what is this government doing? This government is intent on imposing a tax that is going to reduce our international competitiveness. This government is intent on imposing a tax that is going to make it harder for businesses to generate growth, generate jobs and continue to allow Australia to prosper. In the labour market, Qantas has announced 1,000 job losses-that is before a carbon tax is going to hit; OneSteel has announced 400 job losses; Channel 10 has announced 150 job losses; and Westpac has announced job losses. What is the government's policy response? You are going to impose another great big new tax. Is that good policy? You guys are dreaming if you think that is going to help our economy prosper. If you think that is going to aid this country to grow you are in dreamland. At a time of global uncertainty the government is reducing the ability of Australian businesses to compete, and there is no question that that is going to result in job losses. Australia is dependent on exports to maintain our economic growth. The Treasurer said after the budget in May: With the right policies and decisions, we can convert an unprecedented mining investment boom into an opportunity boom for more of our people. The carbon tax is the wrong policy at the wrong time to capitalise on Australia's competitive advantages. We are dependent on China for much of our exports. In 2010, Australia's exports to China totalled $58 billion or around five per cent of our GDP. demand in China for Australian resources were to collapse, it would greatly impact our economic growth. But our threats are not limited to a potential slowing of growth in China. Australia exports $18 billion to the European Union each year and a further $9 billion to the United States. Both the EU and the US are certainly encountering huge economic challenges, and this tax is not going to do anything to assist Australia in combating the potential impacts of those challenges. The fallout from the problems overseas could have major impacts on our exports and major impacts on Australian companies. We already have this government planning to impose a mineral resource rent tax on our mining exports. This Prime Minister really does have to come into this House and explain why she is doing that. The Prime Minister promised she was going to wear out her shoe leather to tell the story, but I can report to this House that her shoes are in perfect condition. After only a week she gave up on the information campaign, she gave up on peddling the falsehoods, she gave up on trying to spin the lie that has been put about",114
220,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! The member for Cowper would be aware that that terminology is completely inappropriate and disorderly. I call on him to withdraw that statement unreservedly.,116
221,Mr HARTSUYKER,IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. We saw the Prime Minister abandon her sell job. She abandoned the job of trying to convince the Australian people that this toxic tax was good for them. She abandoned any notion that that was going to be good for them. In fact, she has done everything she can to change the subject. We heard the Prime Minister talking about the If VFT, the very worthwhile notion of the disability insurance scheme and hospital reform-anything but the toxic carbon tax. Anything that she could get in the news cycle apart from the carbon tax was mentioned by this Prime Minister. The government talks about the fact that many of our industries will be protected by a range of subsidies. What international investor and what Australian investor would want to invest in an industry that will be dependent on government subsidy for the rest of its life? What a ridiculous situation to put our very fine industries in, a position where for the foreseeable future they are dependent on government largesse-largesse that can be taken away with the stroke of a pen. She would be making our very important industries dependent on government subsidies to survive. It is an absolutely ridiculous situation. It is an absolutely ridiculous policy. The Prime Minister also needs to explain the untruths that she is peddling about the rest of the world allegedly running lemming-like to throw themselves over a cliff, just like she is trying to do to the Australian economy. She is trying to claim that the US is making great strides in relation to an emissions trading scheme. The reality is that is false; that is untrue. We saw the 10 western American states abandon their plans for an ETS. We saw the eastern state of New Jersey withdraw from a carbon trading scheme. We saw the closure of the carbon exchange in Chicago. I see the Labor members shaking their heads. Their constituents are shaking their heads that their local members would be imposing such a tax on them. We see the US retreating from a carbon regime. The New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, said that the scheme: … does nothing more than tax our citizens and tax our businesses with no discernible or measurable impact upon our environment. I think he has captured the situation in Australia perfectly. We have a government that has attempted to mislead the Australian people. We have a Prime Minister who refuses to say why she is imposing this tax. We have a Prime Minister who promised to wear out her shoe leather, but she did nothing of the sort. After a few days out in the field she saw the response the Australian people were giving and she ran for cover-and she has got a lot more running to do before the next election. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (16:22): Where to start after listening to that! The member for Cowper talked about damage to the economy. I think that he should think long and hard about the way he is talking down the economy in this country, when it is the envy of the developed nations and the G20 countries. If you want to worry about business confidence, start looking at the comments being made by the Liberal Party and its leader. But let us look at the MPI. That is what we are supposed to be responding to today. It talks about failure to adequately explain, but I think this is a bit of an embarrassment for the other side. They did not really want to word it in the way that they really meant it, so they are saying that we, the government, are not out there adequately explaining it; but it is the Liberal Party not understanding it. It is not a surprise that the Liberal Party does not understand the Labor Party's clean energy future plans, because they do not even know when they get up each day whether they are actually believing in climate change or not. It all depends on what Tony Abbott said on radio that morning.",116
222,Mr Hartsuyker,IMPORTANCE,"Your constituents don't electricity, tax believe in you!",117
223,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," The member for Cowper has had his opportunity. Mrs D'ATH: I have to acknowledge a well-known and very talented actor, Noni Hazlehurst, who was recently on Q&A. She made the comment that she has worked with a lot of children and has dealt with the terrible twos, where two-year-olds just say, 'No, no, no' to everything. I think what has been proven today is that you do not have to be two years old to chuck a tantrum. The member for Indi was very good at chucking a tantrum today, so I think Noni's comment on Q&A the other week was certainly appropriate in relation to the way that the opposition is dealing with policy in this country; it is about opposing everything. The reality for the Leader of the Opposition, if you want to talk about explanations, is that the people in my electorate are eager to learn more about the clean energy future plan, and we should not treat these people as fools. They do understand. When you go out, when you talk to them and when you provide them with information, they understand why it is important we act, why it is important that we put in place an interim fixed carbon price for three years and why it is important in 2015 that we move to a market based mechanism for a carbon price. They understand this. They understand also that that will come with some cost. They also understand that it is the federal Labor government that is stepping up and providing assistance to households and also supporting industry and jobs and investing in clean energy and renewables. What the people in my electorate do not understand and are wanting an explanation for is where the opposition think they are going to get the money to support their climate change policy-for what it is worth-to meet what they claim are the same targets that have been set by this government. Today in question time the Prime Minister said that both parties are committed to the same targets. The Leader of the Opposition sat there and shook his head. He shook his head, saying, 'No, no, no; we haven't got the same targets.' So each day do not know whether they are committed or not to dealing with climate change. To give the Australian people some insight as to the opposition's commitment to dealing with climate change, we only need to go back to the recent comments by the shadow Treasurer when being interviewed on Lateline by Tony Jones. He was asked: 'You say that if you get into government you are going to scrap 12,000 Public Service jobs. Where would you cut these 12,000 Public Service jobs from?' What about the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency? The shadow Treasurer said that he does not believe any of their modelling. When asked the question, 'Would you consider disbanding the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency?' there were no ifs and no buts-the shadow Treasurer said yes. It is not just all the jobs that would and they are worried about the economy and they are talking about actually taking away jobs-but it is the fact that they say they have a climate change policy at the same time as the shadow Treasurer is saying, 'Oh, if we get into government, there goes the whole department. We don't need a department to look into climate change, clean energy or renewables.' These are the explanations that need to go out to the Australian people. This is what the Australian people want to hear. If the Leader of the Opposition is going to go out there and run a scare campaign-we heard it from the member for Indi today; we heard it from the member for Cowper-talking about closing industries, loss of jobs, cost-of-living increases and damage to the economy, where is their alternative policy? How is it being costed? Where are all these trees covering the size of Tasmania and Victoria combined we going to be planted? We heard the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency talking about that in question time today. The opposition talk about alleged increases in the cost of living. Modelling by Treasury has estimated a 0.7 per cent increase on the CPI for our country to take the historic step of addressing climate change and implementing a carbon price. What you do not hear from the other side when they criticise the modelling done by the same department and the same people who did the modelling for the GST is that when the GST was introduced it actually created an increase of more than three per cent on the CPI. But we do not hear them going out and telling everyone that. They would not want to go out and actually compare the Howard government's policies and actions to what this government has done since it came in during 2007, because if go- they did that they would be embarrassed and shown for what they are: a party that just believes in opposing for the sake of opposing and who want to engage in popular politics-and they do not care what that means. If it means saying one thing one day and something else the other, that is what they will do. The Prime Minister, the cabinet-every member of this government-has been out explaining to people across Australia what this clean energy future plan is all about. The Leader of the Opposition has been trying to do that, going out talking about Labor's policy, talking about their policy a little bit. He is starting to have a bit of a problem there. Mr Hartsuyker interjectingMrs D'ATH: The Leader of the Opposition just hit a little bit of a snag, maybe, Member for Cowper! Just a little bit of a problem there-he couldn't get into a butcher's. He lined up all of the media to do another stunt. We have done the Weet-Bix and everything else. The Leader of the Opposition tried to set up his little media stunt with a local butcher, but it all came apart because the butcher didn't want a bar of it. The reality is, despite all the huff and puff from those on the other side-a lot of allegations thrown around-there is very little statistics, very little fact. Why? Because they would rather go out into businesses and run scare campaigns. They would rather go out there, get attention and say that whole industries are going to shut and jobs are going to disappear. But in fact we know that that is not true. Members of the opposition again stood there today making all these allegations-talking about steel, talking about manufacturing, talking about mining but definitely not quoting anyone. Of course they would not want to quote David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, who on 31 July 2011 wrote to the Prime Minister of Australia saying: I was delighted to hear of the ambitious package of climate change policy measures you announced on July 10 and wanted to congratulate you on taking this bold step. You would not want to quote Cameron Clyne, the NAB CEO, saying: ―If you‘re asking for an economic assessment of the two, the carbon price followed by an ETS is economically superior to the direct action policy,‖ he said. ―It will drive certainty, it will drive investment, so as a straight comparison between the two, that‘s the choice.‖ We had comments from the bank chief economist supporting that. We have OneSteel CEO saying: We believe that on balance, the sectoral approach announced today by the Prime Minister for the steel industry, including the introduction of the STP is both appropriate and sensible. We are pleased that the Government has responded by adopting this approach. BlueScope managing director and CEO on 10 July said: This is a pragmatic solution to a complex problem. None of those quotes were made today by the member for Indi, the member for Flinders or the member for Cowper when they stood here and claimed that jobs would be lost in steel manufacturing, that industries would close down, that there would be cost of living increases. These are all things that the opposition do not want to talk about. (Time expired)",117
224,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA Disability Services,119
225,Ms MACKLIN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (16:33): by leave-Last week I visited Rod and Janette Mattingley, and their 25 year old son, Thomas, who live in my electorate of Jagajaga in the northeastern suburbs of Melbourne. Thomas has been severely disabled since birth. He has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and scoliosis. Rod and Janette have provided almost constant care for him since birth. Rod and Janette kindly opened their home to me and talked me through their days with Thomas and their experiences of the disability service system. The Productivity Commission's final report into the long-term care and support of Australians with disability, which the Prime Minister released last Wednesday, judged the disability service system to be unfair, underfunded and fragmented. It is a judgment that sums up the daily frustrations and inconsistencies that the Mattingleysand thousands like them-face each day. The system of disability services in Australia today is letting people down. This government asked the Productivity Commission to examine reform of disability support services because we believe that the system we have today is not delivering the kind of care and support Australians expect for people with disability. The Productivity Commission has recommended a national disability insurance scheme that would entitle all Australians to support in the event of significant disability. The scheme would provide individually tailored care and support to around 410,000 people with significant disabilities. It would be accompanied by a national injury insurance scheme to provide no fault insurance for anyone who suffers a catastrophic injury. The Australian government shares the vision of the Productivity Commission for a system that provides people with disability with the care and support they need over the course of their lifetime. We understand that the system needs more funding, and people with disability need more services and support. We also understand that the system needs a complete transformation to deliver the kind of care and support the community expects for people with disability. We are acting on both fronts, right away. We are already doubling Commonwealth funding to the states and territories, who deliver disability support services. We have more than tripled the rate of indexation from 1.8 per cent under the previous government to 6.3 per cent today so that our investment in services grows faster. We are investing in people with disabilities and those who care for them, by delivering record pension increases to people on the disability support pension and the carer payment. We have increased the maximum rate by around $128 a fortnight for single pensioners and $116 a fortnight for couples since September 2009. To improve access to services for people with disability and to drive reform, including in access to mainstream services like health and education, we have launched a National Disability Strategy, and to support carers and to shine a light on their work, we have recently released a National Carer Strategy. We are making headway in overhauling key aspects of the disability support pension to better support people with disability into work wherever possible, because we know that many people with disability do want to do more. We are investing $3 billion over the next four years in uncapping access to Disability Employment Services, so people with disability know they can get help to give work a go. Under the previous government, people with disability could wait up to a year for help to get back into work. We are helping parents of children with disabilities to access early intervention services through the Better Start for Children with Disability program. Under this program, around 9,000 children with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome, and sight or hearing impairments will be eligible for up to $12,000 of services under the program over four years. Since 1 July this year, when the Better Start program began, 725 Australian families have registered for funding for early intervention services for their children. Since 2008, more than 12,000 children with autism spectrum disorders have accessed early intervention services through the Helping Children with Autism package. To meet the need for community based supported accommodation places for Australians with disability, we have established a new $60 million fund to build up to 150 innovative supported accommodation places. This builds on the $100 million capital injection we delivered in 2008 to build more than 300 places for people with disability. These are important investments, and they are being delivered to people with disabilities, their families and carers right now. But we know we need to do more. That is why this government asked the Productivity Commission to undertake this major inquiry. We know the disability service system will not be repaired by increases in funding or more services alone. Both are necessary, but not sufficient. People with disability, their families and carers argued that the system needs a complete overhaul. The Productivity Commission has agreed. And so do we, the Australian government. The disability service system needs a complete overhaul so that it, first and foremost, meets the needs of the individual. It needs to take an insurance approach that meets the care and support needs of a person with disability over their lifetime-and not the crisis-driven approach of the past. The Productivity Commission has set out a clear vision for change. The commission recommend work start right away, with the launch of a scheme in selected sites around the country in mid-2014 and they also recommend the progressive rollout of a national disability insurance scheme to full operation by 2018-19. The report from the Productivity Commission demonstrates that we do have a lot of work ahead of us. Under the recently signed National Health Reform Agreement, the states and territories have primary responsibility for the funding and delivery of disability support services. Reform of the disability service system must therefore be done with the states and territories. This Friday, the Prime Minister will ask the Council of Australian Governments to establish a select council of ministers from the Commonwealth, states and territories to drive disability reform. We are starting work right away, to lay the foundations for reform and get disability services, as we like to call it, NDIS-ready-ready for a national disability insurance scheme. This means working with the states and territories to develop common assessment tools, so that people's eligibility for support can be assessed fairly and consistently, based on their level of need. It means putting in place service and quality standards, so that people have with disability can expect high quality support irrespective of what disability they have or how they acquired it. It means building workforce capacity so we have more trained staff to support people with disabilities. And it will also include developing rigorous timelines, milestones and benchmarks to support the delivery of these and other essential foundation reforms, and to hold governments accountable for progress. Much of this work has commenced through the National Disability Agreement. But this work must now be accelerated and extended because these, and other matters, are essential foundations for a national disability insurance scheme. Consistent with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission, we have announced an immediate $10 million to support this technical work. This is in addition to our increased funding for the states and territories to deliver disability services through the National Disability Agreement. We have also announced an advisory group to work with the new select council on the design and oversight of activities to build foundations for reform. This work will be led by Dr Jeff Harmer AO, supported by Mr Bruce Bonyhady AM and Dr Rhonda Galbally AO. Others will be added once further consultations have taken place. And in response to the Productivity Commission's recommendations for the states and territories to harmonise their approach to catastrophic injury, the government will convene a working group led by the Assistant Treasurer to work with state and territory governments, lawyers and other stakeholders to progress this element of reform. Work is already underway. And it will continue as we lay those foundations which are essential for reform, and are necessary precursors to the launch of a national disability insurance scheme. Future reform of disability services will require investment from all levels of government and it will require our shared commitment to fundamental reform, a complete overhaul, so that it delivers the kind of care and support we expect for people with disability. The Australian government is committed to this reform. We believe that people like Thomas Mattingley deserve quality care and support and that people like his parents, Rod and Janette Mattingley, should be supported and have certainty in Thomas's continuing care. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Menzies to speak for 11½ minutes. Leave granted.",119
226,Ms MACKLIN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr K. J. Andrews speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 11½ minutes. Question agreed to.,122
227,Mr ANDREWS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," Approximately 20 per cent of the Australian the population have a disability-that is, some four million people have a disability-and there are some 2.6 million carers. The coalition believe that continuing support for these Australians is important. It is in this context that we have already indicated our in-principle support for the establishment of a national disability insurance scheme. The reality is that the current system is broken. It is inconsistent and lacks coordination. Support is determined not by need but by how a disability was acquired. Indeed, the Productivity Commission has found that the current system is 'underfunded, unfair, fragmented and inefficient' and 'gives people with disability little choice and no certainty of access to appropriate supports'. Currently support depends on a number of factors: what state you live in, whether the disability is congenital or was acquired, and, if acquired, whether it was acquired in the workplace, a motor vehicle accident or some other context. There is a level of care which families and informal carers want to provide and should provide for their loved ones with a disability, but there is also a level of care which it is unreasonable to expect to be undertaken without some support, and in some cases some very considerable support, from the wider community. Importantly, any response to disabilities must be a combined federal, state and territory response. At present, total government expenditure is around $7 billion per annum. The Commonwealth contributes about $2.3 billion and the states and territories contribute around $4.7 billion. The reality is that the status quo is no longer an option. Australians with disability and their families deserve a better deal. Good economic management of course is key to providing a better deal, to providing real reform and real support. Expressions of goodwill and statements of good intent are no longer good enough. Every Australian should feel disappointed by what is initially weak response on the part of the government to the Productivity Commission's report. This Labor-Green alliance has a history of overpromising and underdelivering. This government has a history of making announcements that are empty and tokenistic, announcements that are never actually acted upon. Expressions of goodwill and statements of good intent are simply no longer good enough. The government should provide a clear timetable for change and a clear and definite funding envelope. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot be keen to push the envelope on their great big new tax on everything but not push the envelope to repair a system that impacts on some of the most vulnerable members of our society. The coalition remain concerned, with good cause, about the government's ability to deliver the complex reform needed in this critical area, so we will monitor its implementation closely because we have seen time and time again the disasters that the Labor-Green alliance has presided over. Anyone who has seen the detail of the government's announcement, seen the paltry $10 million commitment, knows that Labor could have done better. Imagine how much more they could have done without the waste and mismanagement-with no pink batts, no school hall rip-offs, no program failures and no NBN. Australians might not know that the Productivity Commission's final report found that the current unmet need for support for Australians with disability is some $6.5 billion. That is roughly equivalent to the Gillard government's current annual debt interest repayments. Australians with disability, their carers and their families are not focused on funding options. They just want the system fixed. The government has raised the hopes of a these families, so it is now up to the government to outline how it will deliver. That is why it is so disappointing that the government's response has not identified at this stage any funding envelope. The government are, I fear, incapable of reforming anything. Their strength lies in waste, mismanagement, bungling programs and doing nothing. I suppose there is some hope that they at least have put $10 million up. Ms Macklin: I'll send this around to people with disabilities. They'll be thrilled to get this.",122
228,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," Order! Minister, you were heard in silence.",123
229,Mr ANDREWS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I will respond to the interjection. People with disabilities have said to me over the last week that they are concerned that this government, given its history of mismanagement and incompetence, is not in a position to be able to deliver. If it were, then we might have seen more. You cannot talk about reform without also talking about the disability support pension. About 800,000 people are on the DSP, at a cost of $10 billion to $13 billion per year. This represents about five per cent of all Australians of working age. The Prime Minister says she wants to tackle the issue; however, again you see Labor with a poor record on welfare reform. In the early years of the last decade attempts by the Howard government to reform welfare were stymied by the Labor Party. It was not until the coalition gained a majority in the Senate in 2004 that welfare reform actually occurred, in the face of Labor resistance. Australians wish to be secure in the knowledge that a safety net and social support system will always be available to them if it is genuinely needed. However, at a time of strong jobs growth and emerging labour and skill shortages during the late 1990s and early 2000s the number of working age people in receipt of income support grew to over 20 per cent of all working age Australians, or more than 2.7 million people. Only a small percentage of this number had participation requirements tied to their income support. Seven hundred thousand were on disability support pension and 618,000 received at that stage the parenting payment. Both of these payments were more generous than Newstart allowance, which is received by the unemployed. There were more people receiving the DSP than there were on unemployment benefits. This highlighted that people with disabilities in particular had a very low rate of participation in the workforce. Less than 10 per cent of people receiving DSP undertook any work, including many people who had significant work capacity. Approximately one-quarter of all DSP recipients in Australia suffer from psychological and psychiatric conditions. Such conditions are often episodic, and due regard has to be given to how we could more appropriately deal with the situations that many of these people find themselves in when they have an episode which leaves them unfit for work. There are substantial barriers which prevent people with disabilities from participating both in the workforce and in everyday life. They include physical barriers, such as access to transport, and mental and psychological challenges. Whatever shape or form they come in, these barriers have been unfortunately reinforced by negative community attitudes and a low expectation of people with disabilities, and this has contributed to many people with disabilities feeling a sense of disempowerment. Governments, business and the disabled themselves must work together and set about removing these barriers and negative stereotypes. People with disabilities acknowledge that they want to be more economically active. The disability support pension should not be a dead-end payment, as unfortunately so many see it today. The principal object of reform, therefore, should be to encourage and assist more and more people to contribute and participate positively. The Henry report, for example, laid out one approach to welfare reform. If the government deals only with funding a scheme and does not tackle the more important issue of getting people back into the workforce where that is appropriate and able to be achieved, then it will not resolve the problem. The Prime Minister talks about addressing the issue, just like she said in 2009 that getting people into work was her priority. It remains to be seen whether this is just another empty promise from the Labor government. The coalition remain committed to supporting Australians with disability. We can only hope this government can actually deliver some of what it has promised. NA Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011 Report from Main Committee Bill returned from Main Committee without amendment; certified copy of bill presented.

NA Parliament House: Energy Use Consideration of Senate Message",123
230,Mr BANDT,MOTIONS," move: That this House concurs with the resolution relating to the reduction of energy use in Parliament House. The 10 Per Cent campaign is a challenge to individuals and businesses to reduce their energy consumption, electricity and fuel by 10 per cent, and it is a great practical campaign being run by Do Something and by Choice. The motion before us passed the Senate on the voices and has been sent to the House for concurrence. Parliament House easily has the capacity to meet this challenge and the Department of Parliamentary Services has the capacity to facilitate these reduction targets. Other organisations that have signed up to the 10 Per Cent challenge include Bunnings, Visy, Unilever, Toyota, Sensis, the University of Canberra and, notably, News Limited. I for one would hate to see a situation where this Parliament House was trailing News Limited when it came to energy innovation initiatives. One of the practical consequences will be to provide some real leadership from this parliament to Australians about the benefits of cutting their electricity bills through energy efficiency. It is clear that one of the greatest steps we can take to reduce energy use is also the one that is going to reduce people's power bills. That is true in the home. It is estimated that somewhere between 30 and 40 per cent savings can be the made on energy bills simply through energy efficiency measures. And that is true here. By reducing our reliance on energy here in Parliament House we will of course be saving a significant amount of taxpayer dollars. It is also an example of practical leadership, one that I would hope all sides of parliament and all members of this House I would support. I commend the motion to the House.",125
231,Ms ONEILL,MOTIONS, I second the motion and I reserve my right to speak. Question agreed to. NA Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,125
232,Ms ONEILL,BILLS," I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011. This bill makes three changes to Australian tax laws further modernising our taxation system and ensuring that our taxation system takes account of the most disadvantaged in our society. I strongly support the first initiative in this bill which is aimed at promoting early intervention for children with disabilities. Under the system known as the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative, which the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has just outlined and that was announced as part of the government's election commitments on 29 July 2010, I am proud to be a member of a government that has fulfilled a commitment to improve the long-term outcomes for children with disabilities. I have long believed that we must not consider children with a disability as necessarily placing a significant burden on the state. Indeed, as a teacher and now as a parliamentarian I have long observed the incredibly positive contribution that people with disabilities play in our community at all ages and stages of their lives. It is always important to reaffirm the vast variety of disabilities of differing degrees that people are affected by and to identify within that incredible talents and abilities as well. Early intervention initiatives have proven immensely successful in improving the lives of children with a variety of disabilities. Indeed, intervention at the early childhood stage of development is now considered to be much more effective than later treatment. The Better Start for Children with Disability initiative funds early intervention for children with certain developmental disabilities which the minister recently outlined. This amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ensures that the outer regional and remote payment made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative is exempt from income tax. I find this reform very encouraging because it will ensure that financial assistance is available and secure. Funding under this initiative is available to families after evidence is provided of confirmed written diagnosis of disability. Whilst this eligibility regime necessity, as a community I say again we must always remember that people, including particularly children disabilities, are never to be defined by those disabilities. While definitions of disability are a necessity in relation to the administration of these tax and social security benefits, we have to be mindful of the inherent limitation of labels, to see the abilities of all, and to celebrate the gifts that kids with disabilities bring to their families, to their school communities and to their broader communities. The provision I mentioned here provides a further one-off payment of $2,000 to parents and carers who are living in rural and regional communities in Australia who require assistance to get their young child with a disability to the type of care and support that they deserve and they need. This element is a vital component to the scheme because parents and carers living in remote and regional areas experience far greater difficulty in accessing services than we would like to be the case. I believe that the additional $2,000 will help remedy this by enabling additional expenses such as travel for doctors appointments and transport to be able to be covered. This social program represents a very smart investment by government. By investing in early intervention we not only improve real life outcomes, we also save on health costs. By intervening early we are increasing the likelihood that individual children with disabilities will lead happy, independent and fulfilling lives. By establishing support services early in life, it is likely that children with disabilities will grow up much more engaged with and active in their communities. I am proud to support a government committed to improving the life circumstances for people with disabilities. It is a core Labor value to support the most is a disadvantaged in society. Our record shows that our policy decisions are not just geared to ensuring the greatest good for the greatest with number but always retain within our legislative program compassion, empathy and a belief in supporting those who might be less advantaged. I believe that this legislation is complemented by our plan to introduce a national disability insurance scheme, a once in a generation reform that will directly improve and transform the lives of people with disabilities and those of their families. Another important reform contained in this bill is the amendments to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 in particular in relation to transport from an employee's usual place of residence to their usual place of employment. This bill will provide an exemption from the fringe benefits tax for transport from an employee's usual place of residence to their usual place of employment. This amendment operates in the circumstances where the employee is an Australian resident employed in a remote area overseas under what is commonly known as a fly-in fly-out arrangement. Our taxation system should not act as a disincentive for people to work under a fly-in fly-out arrangement. Also as stated by the minister in his second reading speech, this measure ensures that any possible double taxation is eliminated. Taxing transport provided under these arrangements may also result in economic double taxation, with an Australian employer paying FBT on transport provided to an employee employed under a fly-in fly-out situation. Our taxation system needs to take into account the fact that Australians work and engage in a global economy, and working overseas is necessarily a component of this. The amendments improve the fairness and integrity of Australia's tax system by better targeting the tax exemption for income earned by Australians overseas. As a result, most Australian residents employment income are now treated more consistently. The third important change that this legislation brings is one to our recognition of charitable donations and adds a new fund to the list of deductible gift recipients. DGR status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities. It will allow those who wish to donate more than $2 to deduct the amount from their tax for that year. The Charities Aid Foundation, a body representing charities in the United Kingdom, has recognised Australia as the most giving nation in their annual World Giving Index. The giving index aggregates three key factors: money given to charities by a nation's citizens, time spent volunteering, and how willing a nation's citizens are to help strangers. Australia and New Zealand were shown to be the most giving nations. It is a testament to the Australian character that we are so willing to give. We are willing to give our time to friends and family, to give support to strangers, and to give money to help our fellow Australians and our friends across the Tasman. This schedule adds an organisation to the act, namely, the New Zealand government's Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust, and also the Cancer Australia Gift Fund. The New Zealand government's Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust was established to help the families and communities affected by the devastating earthquake of 22 February 2011. Listing the New Zealand government's Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust will allow Australians to donate to the appeal and claim a tax deduction for the donation. These changes reward Australians who give to our closest neighbours and friends. New Zealand suffered greatly through the earthquakes earlier this year, and since then earning has suffered many tremors and frightening shocks. Nearly 200 New Zealanders lost their lives, and the resulting damage bill is in the tens of billions. The natural response from Australians is to act. Immediately, the Prime Minister pledged Australian assistance to New Zealand and gave $5 million to the Red Cross. This was accompanied by direct assistance from the people of Australia. As the Prime Minister said in her address to the parliament of New Zealand earlier this year: That is why I say Australia has many alliances and friendships around the world. Economic and defence partnerships of every kind. But New Zealand alone is family. This schedule does not only deal with aid to New Zealand, however; it also makes some procedural changes related to the amalgamation of the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre, the NBOCC, and Cancer Australia on 15 June 2010. The National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre and Cancer Australia merged to create a one-stop shop to provide improved leadership to and outcomes for Australians living with cancer and their families. The new Cancer Australia will combine the experience and successes of both organisations to further strengthen the Australian government's strategic focus on cancer and create a solid platform for the coordination of cancer initiatives at a national level. Breast cancer and ovarian cancer will remain a priority for Cancer Australia as it delivers the government's broader cancer programs and research priorities. Following the listing of the Australia Gift Fund, donations made to this new organisation will be used to improve breast cancer outcomes for women, reduce mortalities from breast cancer and improve the well-being of women diagnosed with the disease. This is an important bill that will ensure greater equality in our taxation system. It will support early identification and intervention for children with disabilities who live in families in remote and rural areas. They will get the assistance they need. The bill will support Australian workers that are employed in fly-in fly-out industries by ensuring they will not be taxed twice. It will also support charitable donations to new and vital organisations to ensure that Australians can contribute to, and great outcomes can be achieved for, the health of the nation. I commend the minister for his work and I commend the bill to the House.",125
233,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (17:10): I would like to thank all those members who have contributed to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011, including the member for Robertson. Schedule 1 to this bill ensures that the outer regional and remote payments to support families with children with disabilities will be exempt from income tax. This is an important amendment to ensure families with children with disabilities will not have to pay tax on the outer regional and remote payments they receive. Schedule 2 extends the fringe benefits tax exemption for Australian residents working in remote locations on a fly-in fly-out basis to Australian residents working on a fly-in fly-out basis in similar remote locations overseas. Extending the exemption will ensure that Australian residents working for Australian employers in remote areas in flyCancer in fly-out arrangements will be taxed consistently, regardless of whether they are working in Australia or overseas. This measure will apply to fringe benefits provided after 1 July 2009, when Australian residents working in remote areas overseas became potentially assessable on their foreign employment income. Schedule 3 amends the deductible gift recipient, DGR, provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts to organisations that are DGRs. This schedule adds two new organisations to the act, namely: the New Zealand government's Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust and the Cancer Australia Gift Fund. Making these organisations deductible gift recipients will assist them in attracting public support for their activities. It also recognises the name change of WorldSkills Australia Inc. to WorldSkills Australia. This bill deserves the support of the parliament. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",128
234,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. (Quorum formed),129
235,Mr HARTSUYKER,BILLS," I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011 because it is a particularly important industry reform. It is vitally important that we protect our manufacturing industries from unfair competition. This legislation makes some meaningful improvements anti-dumping regime. We should be aiming towards a regime that allows our manufacturers to access good protections without undue cost or undue delays. Under the present regime, where it is very cumbersome and very untimely to counter the effects of dumping, our manufacturers are being greatly disadvantaged. In my electorate, our many manufacturers are concerned with the issue of dumpingand I do welcome the reforms in this legislation. On 8 August, I welcomed the member for Indi, the shadow minister for innovation, industry and science, to my electorate. We met with a range of manufacturers and discussed a range of issues of importance to them. That visit was held at the premises of WE Smith Hudson, an innovative manufacturer of pressure vessels in my electorate. They employ some 90 employees. They have reduced staff fairly recently due to a downturn in orders, but they still maintain a staff of around 90. They produce world-class equipment, particularly in the area of heat exchangers, and they raised a number of important issues with the shadow minister and me. One of the main issues that they raised was the ineffectiveness of our current local content laws, where a range of projects are required to have a certain set percentage of local content, but unfortunately it is possible for those laws to be circumvented by certain operators, who incorporate parts of the structure which are groundworks and are actually considered to be part of the local content. They raised with us the very important issue that, where you had local content requirements, they had to relate to the equipment itself and not to the preparatory work and groundworks that might be a necessary accompaniment to the equipment but really could not be imported to our anyway. If you have a local content requirement, it is vitally important that it is effective, and WE Smith Hudson raised the very important point that the current local content rules certainly did not pass that effectiveness test because purchases of equipment were able to incorporate the groundworks as part of the local content. Clearly that was not the intent of the legislation, but it has been the practical effect. Another issue that WE Smith Hudson raised with us during that visit was the fact that many overseas countries are subsidising their manufacturers in competing with Australian manufacturers. Countries in Europe, for instance, are subsidising the cost of transport of their equipment to Australia for the purposes of incorporation in resource projects. I think that is a very important issue; it is not a level playing field for our local manufacturers. We are losing manufacturing jobs at the rate of around 620 every week and we need to look to ensure that our world-class manufacturing industry is not being disadvantaged by unfair competition, either through the failure of the effectiveness of the local content laws or through our industries having to compete with unfair subsidies being provided by countries in Asia and Europe. Also the issue was raised with us of the fact that many countries preclude our manufacturers from competing in their markets. It is a source of great is costing us jobs. A firm like WE Smith Hudson has incredible skills-the match of anywhere in the world and better than most countries in the world-and incredible intellectual property, but in many cases it is disadvantaged in the markets that it wishes to compete in. During that visit by the shadow minister, we spoke to a range of other manufacturers and the story was the same. Dealing with unfair competition, rising costs and government induced overheads was making it more difficult for them to compete in markets where imports are benefiting from a strong Australian dollar and cheaper labour costs. It is making it very difficult for those manufacturers to compete and to continue to employ people. I commend the shadow minister on coming to my electorate and sharing her time and discussing with my local manufacturers their concerns. I commend the work that she did in discussing with WE Smith Hudson their specific concerns in relation to the very specialised pressure vessel markets and the challenges they faced with regard to the ineffectiveness of the local content laws and dealing with subsidised overseas competitors. They also raised the issue of infrastructure. The pressure vessels which they produce are massive in size and in many cases they are limited in transporting them on the current road infrastructure because of load limits on bridges. Another important factor that we need to incorporate in our transport policy is measures in relation to load limits so that we can transport large objects that are manufactured locally along our roads and get those goods to market. I commend this legislation for the improvements that it makes to the anti-dumping regime. I know that much more needs to be done in this area. I commend the concern and it bill to the House.",129
236,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I speak in support of the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Improvements) Bill 2011. To start, I want to commend a number of organisations and individuals for the work they have done in relation to this: my good friend the member for Oxley, the Hon. Bernie Ripoll; the Hon. Brendan O'Connor, the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Justice; the Australian Aluminium Extrusions Association for their advocacy; and the Australian Workers Union, particularly Paul Howes. Locally, out my way, I would like to thank Sven Gade, the business manager of Capral Ltd, and Phil Jobe, the managing director of Capral; and G James Glass for their advocacy in relation to this issue. This is a national issue that has big resonance in my electorate of Blair in South East Queensland where Capral is located. Capral is a major manufacturer of aluminium products. The legislation here will make a big difference that will protect the jobs of hundreds of people living in the western corridor between Ipswich and Brisbane and the rural areas outside. I want to thank those people and those organisations for their wonderful advocacy in relation to this bill. Dumping is a particularly iniquitous practice that affects Australian jobs. Dumping occurs when an overseas supplier exports goods to Australia at a price below their normal value. The normal value is usually based on the domestic price of the goods in the exporting country. Tragically for Australian jobs, this has happened all too often. It is not a matter of free trade versus fair trade. We believe in free trade; as an exporting country we believe that it is in the best interests of Australia to export to countries like China, South Korea, the United States, Japan and Europe. But we also believe that trade between countries needs to be based on a degree of justice and fairness. When a company engages in dumping, it really seeks to have an unfair advantage compared to local Australian companies, and it will materially impact on local Australian jobs. The improvements summarised in this legislation are the result of extensive stakeholder consultation, and some of the organisations and individuals I mentioned here have been major players in that consultation. There has been consideration of the Productivity Commission Inquiry Report No. 48 of 18 December 2009, Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing system. The consideration of this legislation comes very much out of that. The changes, we believe, will improve access to the anti-dumping system across the country. It will improve the timeliness of decisions in relation to this. We believe it will improve decision making over the whole process. We do not believe these are protectionist measures. We believe they are in line with our obligations, particularly our obligations under World Trade Organisation arrangements. We think also that we are doing what other countries comparable to us, the United States, Canada and other countries in the EU, are doing to protect local jobs and to make sure that there is a level playing field in relation to this particular measure. There is a raft of improvements. I welcome the package of 29 improvements to the system. They will have a big impact on not only employment but also the social fabric of our community. There will be better support to industries in our area. The AWU supports this. We have had companies like Capral supporting this. We have even had the National Farmers Federation coming out in support of the measures we are undertaking here. David Crombie, the chair of the National Farmers Federation Trade Committee had this to say: Agriculture is one industry that is particularly susceptible to dumping, where foreign products are exported to Australia at a price below cost price. The NFF believes it is very important that industries like agriculture, that have legitimate claims against dumped exports, have the opportunity to seek a remedy for this through Australia‘s anti-dumping system, ensuring unfair trading practices can be challenged. He went on to say: This means that the emphasis remains on whether goods were exported to Australia at a price below the normal value of the goods, thus making it harder for our farmers to complete, rather than on any perceived short-term consumer benefit. When you have a situation where the National Farmers Federation, the AWU and business are in support of these changes, I think we have got it right. In my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland, which has a very large farming community and a very big manufacturing base in Ipswich, this will be particularly important-also for smaller businesses as well because they have found the cost, the expense and the complexity of anti-dumping action prohibitive in taking actions. So these amendments, which will make an impact nationally, will make an impact locally in my electorate. There are a number of improvements. The minister said in his second reading speech on 6 July 2011: These improvements will improve the way we administer global anti-dumping rules in Australia and better align our laws and practices with of other countries. I agree. This will make a difference locally. I will go through the amendments which will have an impact in my electorate and in communities across the Improvements include the following. There is an improved timeliness in relation to this issue. We will have a 45 per cent increase in Customs staff working on anti-dumping issues over the next 12 months to ensure cases are dealt with more efficiently and effectively. I think the 30-day time limit for ministerial decisions on anti-dumping cases will make a difference, for a start. I think one of the biggest problems in this area is that it is extraordinarily complex. It is very difficult for the average person to get their head around. It is difficult for small companies to take on these types of cases. One only has to read anything prepared in relation to this issue, including reports, advice from QCs given to me, reports from companies involved in these types of cases, and analyses by Access Economics, to see this. It is extraordinarily difficult for the layperson to get their head around. This is very complex law. The whole practice and procedures here make it very difficult to identify whether a company overseas is dumping. We have not had the expertise, in my view. We have not had the staff in Customs to take this on. I think the commitment to boost the monitoring measures to ensure compliance will be very important. With companies from overseas, particularly in the case of Capral, the competition and the dumping have been from Chinese companies. For too long we have found it difficult to identify that dumping has actually occurred. The indexes, the criteria, the factors and the circumstances make it very difficult, particularly when companies overseas are often state-owned those companies, which are heavily subsidised in countries like China. We need stronger compliance. The idea that we can combat these measures is really important. I think we need improved decision making. (Quorum formed) country. Obviously we on this side of the House are concerned about protecting jobs and helping farmers, but those opposite are not listening to those sorts of speeches. They are not interested in protecting jobs, protecting workers or protecting farmers in our economies across the country. I mentioned before the complexity of this issue. For example, on 22 March 2011 Deloitte Access Economics undertook an analysis of anti-dumping measures in aluminium markets in 2008-09 for Capral. It is extraordinarily complex analysing the approach of Customs and Border Protection to substituting the London Metal Exchange prices with Shanghai Futures Exchange prices over 2008-09. Capral have been involved in a number of pieces of litigation, including an application they made on 11 May 2009 for the publication of dumping duty and countervailing duty notices in respect of aluminium extrusions exported to Australia from China. That is just one of many measures that the company and other companies in the country have been involved in. As at 30 June 2011, there were 24 measures in place against 18 products and 12 countries in relation to anti-dumping. This is not some academic exercise. This is about protecting jobs and making sure that we have got a fair system across the country. We want to make sure that, while our local economies are strong and our national economies are strong, workers are protected, and that is what we believe in the Labor Party. We are not the party of Work Choices; we are the party that protects jobs and makes sure that we stand up for the living standards of people across the country. The reforms here ensure quicker and better dumping decisions and greater consistency with other countries. This is doing what the Americans and the Canadians are doing, in large part. There is stronger compliance with anti-dumping measures. We have accepted 15 of the 20 recommendations in the Productivity Commission report I referred to. Some of the Productivity Commission report recommendations make it more costly and more difficult, and we did not adopt those. We have made a big difference here. As I say, there is improved decision making through greater use of trade and industry experts in investigating complaints. There is a more rigorous appeals process supported by more resources from government, providing flexibility in allowing extensions of time to complete the complex cases, which makes it easier to expedite, and there is better access to the anti-dumping system. I think increasing the standing of individuals, companies, unions and other people to take these cases on will improve the capacity to stand up for local jobs, local companies and local farmers. That is important. We need to clarify who can participate in these investigations. It has been difficult in the past. A lot of small businesses and small farmers could not do it. I can imagine industry associations, large trade unions and downstream industry standing up for workers and farmers in this country. I think it is important that we have these measures. It is important nationally and it is important for local jobs. Once again, it is a federal Labor government that stands up for workers' rights, as it has been in the past and always will be in the future. I commend the legislation to the House. Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (17:37): I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Antidumping Improvements) Bill 2011. This is a day that Australian industry and the coalition has been waiting for for a long time-around three years, in fact. It was genuinely as long ago as that that the Labor Party flagged that the government would be taking action to improve Australia's anti-dumping system. Finally, after all that time and following almost endless and ongoing efforts at buckpassing in recent years, the day has arrived when we have the opportunity to debate a piece of legislation on this issue. Of course, as every stakeholder in this area appreciates, the government has only acted now because it was shamed into it. Such a cross-section of critics had coalesced and so many storm clouds had gathered around its inaction that the government was rendered powerless to resist the inevitable any longer, especially after it became clear that even its own brethren in the union movement-and the faceless man who installed Ms Gillard as Prime Minister-were unhappy with its impotence on this issue. They told the government in no uncertain terms that something had to be done. I only wish this debate had come on sooner. We all know that the Labor Party does not have its heart in legislation like the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill. You only had to watch the awkward, cringe-worthy body language and answers of the trade minister at the press conference on this issue on 22 June if you were not aware of this point already. This legislation is being introduced under sufferance and it is born not from a desire to support, encourage and improve the fate of Australian industry and agriculture but out of what the government see as a need to appease Mr Howes and to shut down public criticism of their misunderstanding of the problem of dumping and its ramifications for the Australian economy. It is the result of Minister O'Connor and Minister Emerson being panicked into doing and saying somethingso much so that, even at the time they were staging their rushed press conference, some of the key documents outlining the changes were, quite remarkably, still being hastily cobbled together, to the point that, for a number of days after the announcement, they were not even ready on the ALP website, the Prime Minister's website, the customs minister's website, the trade minister's website or in any other kind of public distribution, even though they had had three years to get the details ready. And then we found out that that was not even adequate in any case. What has subsequently been revealed is that this turned out to be yet another occasion when a policy was not even taken to cabinet, let alone to caucus, for its consideration. On one hand you had two ministers spinning a line for public consumption that the changes in this bill are revolutionary and apparently-if you swallow what was in their media alert-the most ground-breaking changes to Australia's anti-dumping framework in more than a decade. Yet, on the other hand, it turns out that this issue, in practice, is so trivial to Labor Party that it has not even been listed as an agenda item for its caucus to discuss. The succession of Labor backbenchers who will be trotted out in this debate have had absolutely no say in their party's policy on this issue of anti-dumping and are now, far from the first time in their careers, being ordered to blindly support a policy that has come their way. Nor have Labor powerbrokers even bothered to make any Australian serious explanatory information available to key industry stakeholders or to the Australian public at large. It just shows, yet again, how loose is their grip on proper government and democratic processes, how feigned is their interest in the future of Australian industry, especially local manufacturing, and how skewed their priorities are. Nonetheless-I will make an important concession here-given how reluctant they always are to admit error and defeat, even when it is blindingly obvious how bad their decisions and policies are and how devastating the impacts are for the Australian community, I suppose we should be grateful for small mercies like this piece of legislation. In that context the coalition will be supporting the passage of the bill because at least it legislates for some basic improvements, and that is a start. But, as the AWU says, it is a first step. It is also quite a come-down-and an important one at thatfor the trade minister and the customs minister. So some change in this area is definitely preferable to none. We are glad that, dragged kicking and screaming though they may have been, the government have eventually reacted to the combined pressure of the coalition, Senator Xenophon, industry groups, individual businesses and trade unions to make changes such as imposing a time limit of 30 days on ministerial decision making, widening the the range of factors available for consideration in the determination of material damage and expanding the list of subsidies against which Australian industries can apply for countervailing duties. Those are sensible and practical changes for which key stakeholders have been calling for some time and it is good that something is being done about these problems. The coalition will also support the move to grant interested-party status to unions, industry associations and other downstream users through part 10B of the Customs Act. This change will allow these parties to gain direct participative rights in dumping investigations and the capacity to initiate appeals and reviews of decisions. It embeds in legislation recognition of the obvious point that the dumping of goods in Australia impacts on a wide range of parties. It also recognises that there are sometimes commercial limitations on the ability of a business or businesses to engage in anti-dumping applications. Indeed, some of the trade unionists who have been at the core of this debate in Australia over recent months should be congratulated for their commitment to placing pressure on the government when it comes to anti-dumping policy. More broadly, we also welcome the custom minister's statement, in his second reading speech, that changes to improve Australia's anti-dumping system are vital, and we welcome his accompanying comment that local industries here are vulnerable to dumping. These are long-overdue acknowledgements from the government. There have been considerable and growing frustrations over recent years in Australia with the lack of a timely and effective investigation process undertaken by Customs and the significant costs imposed on businesses that wish to raise possible cases for consideration under the current anti-dumping regime. The system is widely regarded as being too expensive to access and is largely unworkable in its present form. The current structure of the system typically works against the best interests of Australian manufacturers. It represents another burden on them at a time when they are already encountering a range of unwanted costs and pressures and a series of poor and clumsy policies from a government that simply has no empathy for their plight. They want a system that works for them, not one that thwarts them, especially at a time when they are already confronted by a range of government imposed costs and compliance burdens and a series of clumsy policies from the government. Against this background, anything that can be done to strengthen the integrity and quality of the administration of our anti-dumping system should be supported. We need to recognise that, for as much as Australia and other nations have embraced the ethos and operation of free trade over recent decades, it does not mean that there are not instances of unfair restrictive trade, nor that such instances may even be on the rise. After all, it is for entirely these reasons that anti-dumping systems exist in the first place and it is why their use is fully sanctioned and supported by the WTO. Far from serving as some sort of abominable subversion of free trade or as the last form of refuge for the closet protectionists, as some observers like the trade minister would often imply, they actually enshrine and serve to underpin free trade principles. If they are effectively implemented, anti-dumping systems can go a long way to remove cases of market distortion and ensure that trade is conducted on a genuinely even playing field. If there is unfair trade, if goods are being dumped on the Australian market at below their comparable price at home or in some cases even below the cost of production, then these practices should be identified and dealt with. To simply cite the pre-eminence of market forces in this kind of debate and stand idly by while industry is held hostage to unfair practices that threaten their very existence is frankly nowhere near good enough anymore. Hopefully the changes that the government is making in this bill will mark a turning point in helping to reverse any increases in dumping in Australia. They are certainly among the kinds of changes to which the coalition was giving voice when we committed in our 2010 election policy statement to review Australia's anti-dumping scheme to effectively ensure that Australian manufacturers' products are not undercut by imported subsidised products or products that do not comply with appropriate quality standards. In early 2011 we reinforced that commitment by establishing our dedicated coalition anti-dumping task force to specifically examine problems with the current regime and advocate for a more workable, accessible and effective model. They also tap into-albeit in an understated way-the reality that a number of other countries have increasingly recognised the importance of anti-dumping measures when encountering market-distorting activities, especially countries like the US and a number of EU member states, and more recently nations like Brazil, Argentina and India, where there has been a rapid escalation in the uptake of anti-dumping actions. Australia will find itself increasingly exposed and in an increasingly dangerous position if it does not remain mindful of these realities. That said, the government here still has considerable work to do. Not only is it apparent that this bill legislates for only four of the policy changes announced on 22 June-and it is anyone's guess when we might expect to see further legislative changes that have been promised-but it is also clear that, even taking all of the flagged changes as a whole, the government has still not gone far enough. It is again indulging in another of its landmark hollowmen style games by selling some of its changes as things they are plainly not, especially when it comes to the absurd boast that it is allegedly boosting the resources of Customs-a point to which I will return shortly. Fundamentally, this is yet another exercise in spin, in which the government is being too cute by half. In characteristic style, it is demonstrating that it is more obsessed with controlling public reporting of this issue than with putting in the hard yards and legislating for a full suite of changes that will actually have teeth and will genuinely deliver the kinds of reforms that will work to the full benefit of the Australian economy. The spectacle of Minister Emerson breathlessly invoking the acronym WTO in almost every question he is asked on this issue and essentially railing against everyone and everything that argues for enhancements to Australian's anti-dumping system represents not only a public slap in the face for at least two senators on his own side of the parliament who have identified grave trade concerns with recent approaches to this policy area but also a misreading of the national interest-and it is a slap in the face for Australian industry, which is heartily sick and tired of being treated so poorly by this government. It is a shame he clearly does not come to this debate realising that anti-dumping systems and free trade are not mutually exclusive and that our obligations to the World Trade Organisation do not preclude us from implementing a more effective and robust framework. If he recognised that to be the case, then we might have had a more serious and proactive effort from the government. For once, just once, it would be nice if Minister Emerson actually stood up for Australian industry and for all those millions of workers who used to be the lifeblood of the Australian Labor Party-the Australian Labor Party that is now simply an axis of weasels. As one of their own senators drubs them, they are a group of 'lobotomised zombies' whose passive acquiescence, as Australian industry gets battered from pillar to post, is a national disgrace. Let me turn to one of the many obvious holes in Labor's spin on this issue: the implication in its glossy promotional documents that its alleged extra resourcing of Customs represents 'a boost'. There is Minister O'Connor's statement on 22 June that the government is looking to increase Customs' resources by nearly 50 per cent. The coalition's suspicion at the time that this was nothing more than sneaky rhetoric has subsequently proved to be extremely well founded because it has now emerged that there is going to be no extra funding of Customs at all. Rather than recruiting 14 new staff, it turns out that there will be no net increase in the overall staff numbers of Customs, only that 14 positions will be taken from elsewhere within the agency. So the overblown claim that there is an increase at all, let alone one of nearly 50 per cent, is exactly that-overblown. Even if they do ultimately shift another 14 staff to the relevant branch, other areas of Customs will obviously need to be cut to compensate. All of this is at a time when there is already unprecedented strain and pressure on Customs staff in a number of areas, especially passenger processing, as the government continues to try in vain to patch up its dog's breakfast on border protection, following year after year of budget reductions that have already been forced upon the agency under this governmentand to think that the Labor Party has the hide to criticise the coalition for its statements about the Public Service. Something has to give and it is clear that Labor does not particularly care where or what it is. There is no commitment to improving the lot, the culture, the morale or the practical effectiveness of Customs. There is only a determination to try to make up for some of its excessive spending and appalling waste of government by now starving funds to areas that are already on life support anyway. Simply shuffling resources and giving the relevant branch the appearance of a lick of fresh paint by changing its name and relocating back to a diffuse staff that it probably had shifted out of there during its first few years in office is not going to achieve anything. What is to say that when it is required to extinguish another spot fire in another area of Customs at some point in the future the government will not just engage in the same kind of cost shifting again-only this time removing resources from the anti-dumping area itself? This government is on the run. It is not considered policymaking or careful deployment of resources. I also note that the second reading speech of the Minister for Home Affairs on this bill featured references to the utopian prospect that this bill will provide 'greater certainty'. Unfortunately, he is clearly a long way from providing certainty on at least two of the key other measures, namely, the appointment of an SME support officer and the creation of a working group of the International Trade Remedies Forum, because it is not clear how these will function in practice other than that the SME support officer will be appointed purely on a trial basis and-surprise, surprise!-only until just after the time that the next federal election is due. One of the other critical points of contention, confusion and uncertainty around dumping is that there is growing suspicion of increased use of subsidies by foreign governments to help lower the costs of production borne by exporters from within their own countries. It is true that through this legislation Labor is taking the rather obvious step of expanding the list of subsidies against which Australians can take action, and that is a good thing. But there has been nothing in the way of serious debate, discussion or information from the Labor Party about how it practically plans to strengthen the application of measures such as preliminary affirmative determinations or how it takes account, through article 2.4 of the WTO's anti-dumping agreement for instance, of the comparative advantage that will be conferred on overseas producers as a result of the introduction of Australia's alone carbon tax or how it intends, if at all, to make changes to the way in which the WTO's agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures is interpreted and applied. Labor's changes do represent an improvement, but you could also be forgiven for being worried that the pursuit of this so called package of improvements will, at the end of the day, just be another chapter in the long tale of Labor inaction and impotence when it comes to anti-dumping-just as was the case in 2008 when Labor, as part of the COAG process, formally agreed that anti-dumping was a priority area for reform but then nothing whatsoever was even uttered about it until the following year, just like in 2009 when the Labor Party commissioned and then received a Productivity Commission review of anti-dumping policy but then stuffed the report in the bottom drawer and did not bother to dust it off until after the 2010 election and just like earlier this year when the Minister for Home Affairs faithfully promised that Labor would commit to a new approach to anti-dumping-and presumably to new financial investments in the system as well-as part of the budget but then was forced to give into the Treasurer who presumably told him that Labor's serial squandering had ensured there was simply no money left to fund this new approach and the announcement would need to be postponed and reworked yet again. If the Labor Party were genuinely serious about anti-dumping reform, it would not merely introduce this so-called first tranche of anti-dumping legislation or even the second, third and however many more tranches it has in mind to implement what has been announced. Indeed, it would go further. Rather than gilding the lily about the modest reach and impact of its changes, it would practically and genuinely commit to go-itmore far-reaching cultural and practical reforms that are required. Nonetheless, these modest improvements are welcomed and I commend the bill.",130
237,Mr SECKER,BILLS," From the outset, when speaking on the Customs Amendment (Antidumping Improvements) Bill 2011, I will give the House a little bit about my background, because it was actually an antitariffs message that got me really interested in politics as a teenager. I pay homage to Bert Kelly, who was a lone voice in the Australian parliament for a couple of decades. He kept on fighting the anti-tariff issue on the basis that it made our economy worse off by trying to protect certain industries, because whenever you protected one industry you invariably hurt another industry and, of course, you hurt the consumer. So I come here on the basis of being still a free marketer. I am sure there are many on the other side who are of the same opinion and believe in free trade-but it has to be fair. That is why we have the World Trade Organisation and the rules on the basis that, where a product is proved to be dumped and harming a local industry, you can then use tariffs to fight against that unfair trade. I come from a free-trade basis, but I also believe it has to be fair, and that what this issue is all about. The issue of dumping in Australia is not just about competition. It is about unfair competition, and there is a substantial difference. Australian businesses are generally resilient and tough and have become so from reforms over the last 30 or so years, so there is no doubt that if they are given a fair go they will withstand, innovate and produce. However, it is very difficult for Australian businesses to move forward in the current climate when they come up against forces such as a cheap product being dumped into the country at up to 60 per cent below production cost. This is where Australia needs to support businesses with responsible policy. It can be a hard decision for businesses to launch a case against dumping; if they go ahead, the process needs to be made much fairer than it is. Certainly the feedback I hear currently is that time and money invested just in putting a case together is hugely consuming. I am not saying it should be dead easy, but I think everyone recognises it is way too hard, is way too expensive and takes too long, and by that time the industry can be in such a situation that it will not survive. Recently I met with a business in the south-east of my electorate of Barker along with my colleague the member for Indi. I think it should be noted that the member for Indi visited 20 electorates during the fiveweek break from parliament. That shows a huge amount of commitment to this goal, and I think we are all the better for it. This company could clearly point out where dumping had occurred and the devastating effects it was having on their operations. When weighing up their next course of action, the company is faced with the arduous task of proceeding with putting forward a case for dumping. A large amount of resources is needed to prove a dumping is case. The process has many flaws, and for small to medium sized businesses it is simply not possible for them to see out the process. Consider the obstacles faced by industry in Australia: the looming price on carbon that will drive up costs and drive investments offshore; the dangerous two-speed economy that is making it increasingly difficult for businesses to remain profitable; and now the prospect of a product being dumped unfairly against their business. With responsible policy, the pressure of dumping could be alleviated somewhat. With appropriate measures, businesses would feel confident that they had the backing of a government that understands the issues they face and is willing to support them. But they have no such feeling of this government. It is simply not happening under the Gillard government. I know this because I have met with businesses and heard it straight from the horse's mouth. The government should be well informed about this issue, considering they commissioned the report into dumping. I was certainly floored that, even after the government's own report saying that product was in fact being dumped in Australia at up to 60 per cent below cost of production, Labor chose to take no action. Here we are, over 12 months down the track, and this government has made some changes to their anti-dumping policy, but it is nowhere near enough. An example I can give the House-and have on numerous occasions already-is that of Kimberly-Clark's mill in the township of Millicent. Millicent is a town with a little over 5,000 people, about 700 of whom are employed in the Kimberly-Clark factory. Many more, of course, are in related industries. So you can understand how important the Kimberly-Clark mill is to the people of Millicent. The factory uses a lot of our wood products, which we also grow in the local area, and it is a very strong part of our whole economy down there. In fact, the forestry industry alone is worth more than $3 billion a year to the local economy. It is not just a very substantial part of the direct local economy around Millicent; it is also important to the area for another 100 kilometres around it, where there is a lot of forestry. This factory uses those products and makes tissues, toilet paper and those sorts of things. The Productivity Commission report showed that there were other countries dumping tissue and toilet paper in Australia, to quite an extensive degree, at up to 60 per cent below the cost of production. It was not five or 10 per cent-in fact, I think most companies in Australia could still compete with that-but up to 60 per cent below the cost of production. Kimberly-Clark is a prime example of a business that was harmed by dumping, and I brought the plight of the Kimberly-Clark mill to the attention of the House over 12 months ago. It is only now that the government is taking some steps to rectify the issue. It is interesting that the government established a $17 million fund in the southeast for innovation and investment. This was in part to help Kimberly-Clark workers who were made redundant to find new jobs and up-skill. It is hard not to wonder if this patch-up job by this government. Perhaps, if Labor had acted responsibly in the first place and made certain businesses were protected from this unfair dumping, there would have been no need for this fund in the first place. note the government's improvement to this anti-dumping policy, and it is a step in the right direction, but it does not go anywhere near far enough. Businesses need to be protected and the processes need to be such that businesses have the resources to complete the process. I am talking about the time and the money, because, in speaking with several local businesses, it has been made clear to me that there are significant faults in the current process. The government has indicated that this legislation is the first instalment, with more to come. We will wait with bated breath on that one. I am aware that these improvements have been well received by stakeholders, but a lot more has to be done. This legislation is not tight enough and not structured well enough. The coalition has really pushed the government into making these improvements. If not for the pressure from the coalition I very much doubt that this Gillard government would have bothered to make these improvements. There were some contrasting views within the Labor Party itself about this issue. A few Labor members took it upon themselves to write their own report on anti-dumping, which they felt quite strongly about, and this was quite a bit more involved than the changes proposed here in this legislation. As I understand it, the Minister for Home Affairs, Brendan O'Connor, was not very happy about that, but at least some members on the other side were prepared to stand up for their constituents. This legislation was not taken to cabinet or the caucus, something we are seeing more and more often from this government. It is was a just a select few making the decisions and the rest are expected to follow quietly. I wonder what the members with manufacturing in their electorates think about this legislation. Do they think it has I made the appropriate measures to protect businesses? I doubt very much that they would agree that this is anywhere near enough. I am sure that there would be members of the other side pushing for further improvements because if, like me, they spend any time out in their electorates visiting businesses then I am confident they would know of the issues that have been plaguing the anti-dumping campaign. The government must take further steps to protect businesses from the burden that dumping brings to their operations and profits, because without profits you will not have employment. Businesses are the backbone of this nation and should be treated as such, not crippled as they are under this government. For instance, the government has promised to increase resources within Customs, adding extra staff to deal with anti-dumping. It sounds like a great idea in theory, except it has allocated no new money for it. Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor said a few weeks ago that the government was promising 'a 45 per cent increase in Customs staff working on anti-dumping issues over the next 12 months'. If there is no new money, then how can this be achieved without cuts from other areas? This is going to add pressure to an already under-resourced sector. Customs has plenty to worry about with keeping the country safe from terrorism and the like, and then the Labor government comes along and cuts their resources even further. This government has cut resources from Customs in every budget it has delivered. Now it is making more promises that will equate to more cuts. This is a real shame. Another improvement the government is making is to include a few new groups to the list of 'interested parties' who investigate complaints and are generally involved in the process. These groups include industry associations, downstream groups and trade unions. The involvement of trade unions can be concerning, but in this instance it seems that they are on board with helping businesses overcome dumping. It really is in the best interests of the workers to see the business recover fully and move on with business as usual. Certainly, in the dealings I have had with local businesses that have been harmed by dumping, their unions have assisted with the process and acted in the businesses' best interests, and I welcome that action. The Minister for Home Affairs was quick to criticise the opposition during his press release on the government improvements and he called on Tony Abbott to declare where he stands on dumping. I think it is quite obvious where the coalition and Mr Abbott stand on dumping, given we stand in this place time and time again asking the government to take action and run campaigns in our electorates. On top of that, Mr Abbott created the anti-dumping taskforce in February this year so the coalition could develop responsible and practical policy. Yet this government jumped on the band wagon only a month ago, even though these problems have been very clear for a long time. I think the minister should pull his head out of the sand. Confidence is down amongst the business community, and who can blame them in light of the uncertainty that this government brings to the nation? Labor cannot be trusted. The Prime Minister cannot be trusted. She has misled the Australian public with her intentions, and this legislation is no different. 'Here is the first instalment but trust us to deliver more,' says the government. 'We will promise more resources but there is no new money.' This government was backed into a the corner on anti-dumping by the coalition and that is why this legislation has come about. What will we have to do to get the rest fixed up? How many more businesses will have to be brought under by unfair dumping before this government makes responsible changes to ensure that they are protected? The coalition has been serious about this issue since it arose as a potential problem. I have stood in this place and raised my concerns on several occasions. We have a task force that is specifically working on our policy so that it is well structured and responsible-not a last minute, poorly thought through decision like we see all too often from this government. Members from the coalition task force are out there visiting businesses like the member for Indi did in my electorate. Where is the government's task force and where are their members sticking up for local business? The improvements outlined in this legislation are a step forward in protecting businesses from dumping, but they are not enough. Labor needs to tighten up this legislation and the minister must divulge how the extra Customs staff will be funded and reveal all the details. I would hope that this government is sincere about protecting businesses and does not just stop at this bill. It would be helpful if the minister revealed the government's plans about more improvements and it would be helpful if this happened soon-not another 12 months down the track. This is another example of the devil in the detail, another example of delays and of acting only after significant pressure from stakeholders and the coalition. (Time expired)",138
238,Mr ROBERT,BILLS," I rise to make a few brief comments on the changes being proposed in the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Improvements) Bill 2011. I make these comments in the hope that the bill will indeed seek to improve the current regime. I make these comments with the knowledge that on one hand the Labor administration is hoping to improve business through strengthening provisions within anti-dumping and in providing some safeguards and some actions on the minister. Yet at the same time and, indeed, in the same breath, the government is seeking to make it instrumentally difficult for business through implementing a carbon tax; the only economy-wide carbon tax in the world being considered and implemented-the words of the Productivity Commission in its latest report. You would have thought that if a government comes to the dispatch box to look at issues that affect business-in this case to stop illegal dumping at a lower price-that there would be a degree of consistency in the values and principles by which they present legislation, and that that consistency would concern what makes it easier for business. But the only consistency we have seen so far is the impost on business. Even the Australian Industry Group is now looking at Labor's so-called Fair Work Bill and saying, 'You know what? It's neither fair nor leading to work.' The carbon tax is now being universally described as a disaster right across the nation in terms of its antibusiness stance and how it affects the basic economics as well as business confidence in manufacturing. So many things this government does are harming business that it is hard to see a narrative about how they seek to help. So it is my hope that this bill will seek to make some improvements, and we shall be watching with great interest over the coming months and years to ensure that occurs. A company in my electorate called JELDWEN Australia is a company that has been through the mill twice on anti-dumping. The first time it was found to be unwarranted and the second time, I believe, the same will be found. It is hoped that these improvements will ensure that companies like JELD-WEN can face fairly and squarely the issues and that they can get the ministerial representation they need. But it is also instructive that a company like JELD-WEN, which owns brands like Corinthian Doors and Stegbar, is experiencing a downturn in some areas of their business by as much as 20 per cent. Something like 80 per cent of our homes, offices and buildings contain at least something that JELD-WEN produces. If a company like JELD-WEN is experiencing such a dramatic downturn, it speaks volumes about what is happening in our economy. If I look at the Gold Coast, at my electorate, there are three key things-three concerns-on people's minds. Number 1 is the carbon tax-the betrayal by the government-and the fact that the government will not listen to them. Number 2 is jobs and the loss of jobs, and number 3 is the increasing cost of living. That a company like JELD-WEN is showing such a downturn in this time of corporate downturn reinforces that people are hurting. The cost of living is increasing, people are not spending and people are worried about their jobs. The carbon tax is simply exacerbating a difficult situation. All I ask for in this place-all we want from this government-is consistency, and the carbon tax shows there is none of that. I think we all agree that the basic purpose of anti-dumping is to allow countries to take action against foreign manufacturers who seek to export a product into Australia at a price which is lower than the price it charges in its home market and/or its costs of production. Whilst there are more technicalities involved in that, including shipping and the averaging of the cost of production if production is across multiple sites, the intent is to stop a major company coming through and exporting into Australia with a loss leader or dumping products that they cannot move and that fundamentally affect Australia's manufacturing or local industry. I think we all accept that that makes sense. However, there is a range of issues with the current arrangements and the way they are implemented and administered. I think it is fair to say that there has been considerable frustration at the lack of timeliness and the effectiveness of the processes undertaken within Customs and the costs imposed on businesses where they are raising cases or seeking to address cases because of the multinational aspect of their business. Our system is widely regarded as being costly and for the most part reasonably unworkable. Perversely, it imposes a greater burden of proof on local industries. Again, it is hoped that these amendments will seek to change that. The introduction of this amendment is certainly a response from Labor to the concerns being raised. Like all things it takes a long time-ironical, as opposed to the carbon tax. Six or seven days after becoming the government-once the final numbers were in-the Prime Minister broke her word, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'. But when it comes to Australian business and Australian manufacturing apparently it takes years. Can I say to the government: the irony is not lost on the bulk of Australia's businesses. It is good to see that the coalition-and I acknowledge Senator Xenophon-industrial bodies, individual businesses and trade unions have said to the government that there needs to be a range of responses to deal with the issues. These reforms will seek to bring in a range of amendments, including a time limit of 30 days on ministerial decision makingwhich is nice-widening the range of factors available for consideration in the determination of material injury and, of course, expanding the list of subsidies against which Australian industries can apply for countervailing duties. On the whole, these changes would appear to be sensible and practical, but like all things time will tell whether they are workable and time will tell whether the ministerial intervention is done appropriately, logically and sensibly. Most seem to interpret the bill as a reasonably positive move that may help to address some of the inherent flaws in the way that business is currently done and the way that anti-dumping is currently looked at. The members of the coalition's anti-dumping task force-I acknowledge the Hon. John Cobb MP, Senator the Hon. Richard Colbeck, my good friend Michael Keenan MP, who is sitting at the desk now, and of course the shadow minister, Sophie Mirabella MP-have done a great job in consistently engaging with stakeholders and getting advice from business and industry associations. The general feel is for tacit support. We believe these moves are in the interest of the nation; let us wait and see how they go. It is our hope that these moves will improve the situation for business-hence the wide-ranging support we are giving to them. I personally hope that these moves will assist companies like JELD-WEN in my electorate, who have been at the receiving end of a range of cases that will assist them to defend themselves appropriately, properly and judiciously. I welcome the bill's introduction to the House. Debate adjourned. NA Selection of Bills Committee",142

Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (18:26): I rise tonight to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011 and to support the comments of my coalition colleagues. I would also like to note that it is very disappointing that tonight the government has pulled all its speakers and seems not to have one single speaker to speak on this important bill. The coalition supports in principle these modest changes to Australia's anti-dumping system. However, we have substantial concerns about the lack of public announcement and detail for this bill. Also, there is a lot of misinformation in the community about this bill. It has been publicised as an attempt by the federal government to stop foreign manufacturers dumping cheap imports in Australia. We need to be very clear about this bill: it is about stopping cheap imports. The definition of 'dumping' is 'the act of charging a lower price for a good in a foreign market than is charged for the same good in the domestic market'. This is often referred to as selling less than fair value. Under World Trade Organisation agreements, dumping is condemned but not prohibited if it causes or threatens to cause material injury to a domestic industry in the importing country. These definitions are, unfortunately, both arbitrary and obscure. What is the normal value of a good? How is this calculated? Is it the price last week; is it the price last month or last year; or, with other commodities, is it the price it will be in the future? How do you calculate the price in the domestic market? What is the definition of a domestic market? With China, for instance, is it the price the good is sold for in Hong Kong, is it the price it is sold for in Shenzhen or is it the price is sold for in Shanghai? Both 'normal value' and 'material injury' are slippery concepts, and little effort is made to define them precisely. Yet another problem that arises with anti-dumping legislation in determining when goods are dumped by foreign firms is when they do not sell the same product in their domestic market as they do in Australia. Today this happens often. Many products that are exported from overseas to Australia are simply not sold on the domestic market. This makes it very difficult for Customs to determine whether the good is sold at a price that is different to the local market. When this cannot be used, there are two alternatives available to Customs: they can look at the price charged by an exporter in another country or make a calculation based on a combination of the exporter's production costs, other expenses and normal profit margins. The agreement under the WTO rules also specifies how a fair not comparison can be made between the export price and what would be the normal price. The problems in calculating anti-dumping legislation are huge. It is simply impossible to know what the price of a good would be if at it were theoretically available on the market; thus, any estimated price used by Customs is purely an arbitrary concoction. These are the difficulties that Customs face in implementing these regulations. If we were to have an effective anti-dumping regime, we would need to give Customs adequate resources to investigate claims of dumping, but we have no explanation from the government of how these measures will be funded and we have no explanation of where these resources will come from. Unfortunately, this is another example of a policy that has simply not been thought through. We must remember that a strict antiit dumping regime, although very important, is not a complete panacea for the difficulties facing our manufacturing industry. Recent examples from the US show this to be true. One example is what happened when the US imposed anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese bedroom furniture. In October 2003, the American Furniture Manufacturers Committee for Legal Trade assembled a group of US manufacturers of wooden bedroom furniture and six labour unions and filed an anti-dumping petition concerning imports of wooden bedroom furniture from China. In December 2004, American customs officials determined that the US bedroom furniture industry was materially injured by sales of imports below their actual value, and the Department of Commerce issued an anti-dumping order on 4 January 2005. The tariffs on Chinese bedroom furniture ranged from 0.83 per cent to 198 per cent. They were enacted in January 2005 to apply to all bedroom furniture imported from China into the US. However, these anti-dumping duties did little to protect domestic jobs in the US. They did little to improve the economic health of hardwood producers during the years 2005 to 2009. In fact, despite these anti-dumping measures being implemented, 36 US wooden bedroom furniture plants closed from 2004 to 2009. In 2001, 44 per cent of all wooden bedroom furniture sold in the United States was imported. By 2004, 68 per cent was imported. But, despite these anti-dumping duties being implemented, imports still grew to 78 per cent of all wooden bedroom furniture sold in the United States by 2009. In reviewing the effects of the anti-dumping tariffs implemented, Commissioner Daniel Pearson stated that the anti-dumping duties had probably created more legal activity than actually benefitted anyone. He said: In this particular investigation, additional and distortions have been added by the use of the administrative review and settlement process, with little evidence that these distortions have yielded any benefits to the industry overall, the US. consumer, or the US. taxpayer. The industry continued to suffer ongoing losses in capacity and employment after the funds were gathered and distributed. The anti-dumping duties placed on Chinese manufacturers of wooden bedroom furniture simply did not stem the tide of imports, but the tariffs, along with rising manufacturing costs in China, caused a rapid shift of production to Vietnam. In fact, the anti-dumping tariffs helped ignite Vietnam's recent boom as a wood-products producer. In 2004, Vietnam shipped $190 million worth of wooden bedroom furniture to the US. However, when the anti-dumping duties were introduced for Chinese production in 2005, shipments from Vietnam to the US increased by 143 per cent. Nearly overnight Vietnam became a major player in wooden bedroom furniture as Chinese companies shifted production to avoid the tariffs, and US distributors changed their sourcing for the same reason. Now even the introduction of anti-dumping tariffs on Vietnamese furniture would simply shift production to other Asian countries. This is already beginning to occur because of rising wages in Vietnam. At the end of the day, even with the imposition of anti-dumping duties, furniture production and the jobs it used to support in the US has not undergone a renaissance. Yet this was the rallying cry used by domestic producers who first brought the case in 2004. There are valuable lessons to be learnt from this case study. It demonstrates that our industries must continue to work to leverage any competitive advantage that they have against overseas manufacturers. This is why costs I have great concerns about the campaign being waged by the leaders of the Australian Workers Union with their Don't Dump on Australia campaign. Certainly we need effective legislation to prevent dumping, but the union's website states: The fate of AWU members rests with the creation and enforcement in Australia of a strong anti-dumping regime. But the truth is that the fate of AWU members rests with Australian industries remaining internationally competitive. If the Australian Workers Union were truly concerned about the fate of their members, they would be making sure that Australian industries do remain internationally competitive and they would be voicing their opposition to a carbon tax. We can have the strongest anti-dumping provisions in the world, but if we have a government that introduces policies such as carbon taxing 500, 1,000 or whatever the number of companies is that operate in Australia but does not apply the same tax to companies that operate outside Australia it will simply place Australian businesses at a competitive disadvantage-and this will cost jobs. Yet we have officials of the Australian Workers Union backing the government and not their union members. More work needs to be done on our anti-dumping legislation. It is important that we have this for the sake of our manufacturers. The coalition is serious about anticompetitive and predatory dumping. That is why we established the anti-dumping task force earlier this year. We pledge that under the next coalition government we will take real action against this predatory practice to ensure the long-term viability of the Australian manufacturing sector.",151
246,Dr STONE,BILLS," whole business about anti-dumping is nothing to do with trying to substitute tariffs for an anti-dumping regime. It is nothing to do with trying to protect industry in Australia. It is all about trying to give all our manufacturers-our food suppliers, our growers of fine foods, grains and fibre-a fair go, because, of course, small and large manufacturing businesses are a major creator of jobs in this country. A definition of dumping is where you have a product imported below the comparable price at home or below the costs of production. As our previous speaker said, and made the point very well, it is often an extraordinarily difficult thing for an Australian manufacturer to prove exactly what the price of the product is at home, especially if there is not a comparable product being offered in, say, China or Greece. Also, how do you demonstrate and research the actual costs of production in a country which has a managed economy-for example, a country like China? A company is expected to have the resources to go out, research and prove that they have had material damage occur and that the cost of production of the product that is being dumped, they allege, is in fact a real belowthe-cost-of-production situation. This legislation being debated today, tries to go a little further in the battle against the problem of dumped product in Australia, but it is a work in progress. As each of the speakers on the coalition side have said, we need to make sure that it is a properly resourced program, and we need to understand that this still does not go far enough in giving us world best practice in terms of an anti-dumping regime which is easily administered, fair, totally transparent, has appropriate time frames and makes sure that there cannot be vexatious activity on the This part of someone who simply wants to reduce competition in their market. In this bill there are four key areas of change. The first is to time limits set for the minister to make a decision after receiving a of recommendation, reducing the overall time frame to conclude an investigation. That is good, as long as the company bringing the action has sufficient support and resources to do the detailed work of proving the action. It is intended that the time limit will provide, subject to extenuating circumstances, for the minister to make a decision within 30 days of receiving a recommendation. The second major change amends the legislation to reflect that the minister may consider any impact on jobs or any impact on investment in the domestic industry producing like goods. This is an important change. In determining whether the Australian industry has suffered material injury, the minister may have regard to any impact on jobs, including new changes to the terms and conditions of employment of the workforce of the relevant manufacturers producing like goods, such as the number of hours worked, the incidence of part-time employment and any impact on investment in the industry producing the like goods. The third major area of change is updating subsidies provisions. There is an amendment updating and reflecting the full range of actionable subsidies provided by the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. These are typically called the WTO agreements. The WTO agreements limit the kinds of subsidies that can be the subject of countervailing measures, and the coalition also supports that change. The fourth area of amendment is to clarify that the definition of 'interested party' includes industry associations, trade unions and downstream industry members, whether or not they are the importer. It is intended that section 269T of the Customs Act will include industry associations directly concerned with the production or manufacture of like goods in Australia. Unlike the existing inclusion of trade organisations, the industry associations would not need to have a majority of members directly concerned with the production or manufacture of like goods. The section will also include trade unions directly concerned with the production or manufacture of like goods in Australia. Unlike the existing inclusion of trade organisations, the trade unions would not need to have a majority of its members directly concerned with the production or manufacture of like goods. Finally, this amendment includes the downstream industry members, being manufacturers or producers that use the goods, the subject of the application or like goods as inputs to the production or manufacture of downstream products. This is an important recognition that dumping does not just injure the party whose products are in direct competition with the dumped goods but that damage is also done to like goods in what is always in Australia a highly competitive market. Lest we think that dumping is not a major problem in Australia, let me remind people that 34 per cent of fruit and 19 per cent of manufactured vegetables consumed in Australia are imported. Australia imports a greater value of processed fruit and vegetables than it exports. We have an enormous volume of imported product. This anti-dumping legislation is not about knocking out competition. It is about making sure that when product comes into Australia it comes in at a fair price and is not priced in a predatory way which is likely to do serious damage or even knock out of existence an Australian product which is priced absolutely according to Australian labour and input costs. Dumping is of course a serious problem. It is not the only problem confronting us in Australia. One of our problems is this government's contraction of the resources available for Customs and for biosecurity and quarantine services. Where we have been told that with this anti-dumping legislation there will be extra resources for Customs-that there will be 14 new staff-it is very disappointing to find that, no, there will not be 14 additional staff; there will be the redeployment of 14 positions somewhere else in the agency to be put into this anti-dumping area. That is a concern because just today we saw the apple fire blight protocol finally presented as a fait accompli by this government and we see there an incredible diminution of biosecurity activity when it comes to making sure that there is a very limited possibility of fire blight getting into Australia on fresh apples. It is the case that the New Zealand government and New Zealand pome fruit industry will be responsible for monitoring and managing the quarantine requirements that this government has put on them-and they are very limited indeed-in exporting fresh apples from New Zealand to Australia. In this area of anti-dumping, one of the greatest difficulties our often very small companies have is how to find the time and resources to go into a country-for example, an economy such as China-and prove that the product that is wiping them out domestically is priced in a certain way in country. Customs will have some additional staff to assist them, apparently, but I have great concern that this is not going to translate into real extra support. A lot of the manufacturers in my electorate are struggling to survive right now and they tell me that a number of things are making it difficult for them. These include the pressures of the supermarket duopoly, where they are pressured to supply house brands in direct competition with their own branded product, which causes enormous difficulty. Their own branded product has to compete with the premium, middle or cheap end of that home-brand product category. They invariably also mention the problems of bringing about a successful anti-dumping case. My food manufacturers have tried with products as diverse as canned peaches from Greece and tomatoes from Italy. The problems they have had in trying to prove those cases, while all the time experiencing the unfair competition in their market, have often led them to think twice and conclude it is just not worth the effort. This is a serious problem for a country like Australia, particularly at present when the dollar is so attractive when it comes to importing product. If you take this inadequate anti-dumping legislation and add the amendments in front of us, which will be passed with coalition support, this country still has an inadequate anti-dumping regime. As I said before, we also have the problem of too much unconscionable behaviour and market power exercised by our supermarket duopoly concerning their suppliers in Australia. Next we will have the carbon tax imposts. These will make the costs of production of all of our manufactures, whether in the food or other sectors, higher compared to imports, that which will not have the carbon tax imposts even though they will have produced emissions during their manufacture in other countries. Of course, we have the ongoing problem in this country of less flexible workplace regulations brought about by this government, which make it very difficult to manufacture product which has to respond to seasonality. It is a very difficult time for our manufacturers in Australia. I had hoped that we would have had with this government a world's best practice anti-dumping regime. I had hoped that we would look at the European, American, Canadian or even New Zealand legislation, picked the eyes out of all of that and produced a system that was transparent, was not open to abuse, was quick and timely and came at minimum cost to those who were aggrieved and bringing anti-dumping action. Unfortunately, what we have is a little bit of tweaking of the legislation. There is a promise of extra resourcing, but I am afraid that promise is not likely to really deliver any great support to vexed parties. We still have not addressed the issue of a reversal of the onus of proof. I would very much like to see that investigated. Instead of our companies, without any real hope of achieving a good outcome, somehow having to demonstrate the cost in the home country of a like item or the cost of production, why shouldn't the party importing the product into Australia have to prove the value of the product or the cost of the production of the product under consideration? We really have not got this right yet. We will have to wait for the coalition to come into government. I just hope that not too many companies are damaged in the meantime, because this is not about protection-it is not about trying to substitute anti-dumping tariffs for subsidies or other tariffs-this is about fair trade and fair practice. It is about trying to produce a level playing field.",154
247,Ms MARINO,BILLS," As we know, Australia is a nation that relies by majority on exports for its economic well-being, but it also needs adequate anti-dumping legislation. As the member for Murray said, the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011 really is a work in progress. There is a lot more to be done. We have a small domestic economy compared to our ability to produce commodities and goods, so we rely heavily on trade. In 2009, during the global financial crisis, our exports were worth $250 billionor one-quarter of a trillion dollars. This was 10 per cent down on the previous year but still a formidable figure. Of this, 41 per cent came from the resources sector, especially iron ore and coal, but the parliament would do well to note the contribution made by Western Australia to the nation's resource exports, especially in oil and gas as well as iron ore. According to the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum, WA produced 68 per cent of the country's mineral and energy exports. Given that the same report identifies that Western Australia holds 70 per cent of the nation's resource exploration and 62 per cent of its private new capital investment, the importance of the west to the nation's economy should not be underestimated, but neither should it be only seen as a cash cow for the Labor government. In addition to the resource sector, $27 billion, or 11 per cent, of Australian exports come from the rural sector, especially in wheat and meat. This bill is one small part of the trade picture in Australia and the ambitions appear to be modest. It is definitely a work in progress, but I do wonder where the members of the Labor government are if they are genuinely committed to anti-dumping legislation. I note that there are a group of 20 Labor backbenchers from manufacturing electorates who are calling for additional assistance for the manufacturing sector. I would ask where they are while we are debating this bill here tonight. Anti-dumping is a very real issue for manufacturing right across the board. Where is the member for Throsby? Where are the members for Newcastle and Deakin? Where is the member for Wakefield and the member for Werriwa? I would have thought this anti-dumping legislation was critical in their electorates. If they are calling for manufacturing assistance, I would have thought speaking on anti-dumping should be very much a part of that. This bill aims to put a 30-day time limit on the minister making a decision after receiving a report, which is a positive step. It also allows the minister to examine more fully the impact of imports on jobs and on domestic industry. I really think this is an important step to examine the impact on jobs and on domestic industry. It expands the definition of interested parties to a decision on trade dumping to include, amongst others, unions-something that we certainly would expect from the Labor government. The bill also addresses issues relating to the WTO anti-dumping agreement and agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures. As we know, dumping is defined by Australian Customs as a form of price differentiation where goods are exported to Australia at a price below their normal value, which of course is to the detriment of the locally produced goods. It includes the use of export subsidies paid to the benefit of a foreign exporter of goods into Australia, be those subsidies direct or indirect. That gives a price advantage to the foreign entity causing or threatening material injury to an Australian industry, and we see this repeatedly. Put simply, anti-dumping measures apply a temporary import duty. It is not about protection; it is about fair process. It is an interim dumping duty on products that are sold below the cost of production and a countervailing duty for subsidised products in order to eliminate that cost advantage that would give the foreign supplier an unfair advantage and damage local production and manufacturing. Many countries around the world provide a form of advantage for their industry and that can include, as I have said, subsidies and tariffs. It can include some low input and labour costs and low levels of necessary government compliance and regulation, which does have an impact on cost of production. These, in turn, provide cost and price advantages to their products in mature overseas markets where local producers often are inundated with compliance and cost issues. In this international marketplace, Australia produces, in spite of that, some of the world's best agricultural, food and manufactured products and extremely high quality manufactured goods. The price disadvantage is unfortunately exacerbated by the Labor government consistently making compliance more onerous and more expensive for Australian businesses. In competing with cheaper foreign products, which are underpinned and underwritten by cheap labour, subsidies or even lower quality control, our producers and manufacturers have to rely on productivity, on efficiency, on quality, on safety and on a perception as well as genuine reputation to that effect. This reputation of quality in Australian products should not be put at risk or underestimated. It should also be noted by the parliament that the Labor government has a poor record of defending Australia's borders and maintaining our customs, quarantine and biosecurity. Australian farmers and food producers rely on our clean and green image called and the capacity to deliver top-quality products to find and maintain markets around the world. Agricultural production in this country drives $155 billion a year in economic production, over 12 per cent of GDP, generating around 1.6 million Australian jobs and $32 billion a year in farm exports. Around the world Australian produced food is safe, clean and green, and it is essential that we maintain that reputation. A lot of that food comes from my electorate. However, this reputation is put at risk by the neglect of our biosecurity by Labor. The clean, disease-free status of Australian food and produce is paramount. That is why we cannot believe the way that this government is continually undermining border security and biosecurity. It is incredible that the government would slash $35.8 million from the quarantine and biosecurity budget and $58 million from the Customs budget, leading to 4.7 million less air cargo consignments being inspected each year and 2,150 fewer vessels being boarded on arrival. Unfortunately, that neglect has set a trend that is continuing in the current budget, with another $32.8 million cut from the operational budget of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, which reduces the capacity of the department to deliver services to Australian agriculture. The Beale quarantine and biosecurity review, commissioned by Labor, called for hundreds of millions of dollars to be spent on AQIS and quarantine annually to provide proper real protection to our nation's borders. Instead of heeding this report, the government has failed to act, except to basically spend the last 2½ years and the last two budgets running down and stripping assets. This is particularly important in this debate because, without price advantage, Australian producers and manufacturers have to rely on quality, safety, productivity and efficiency to compete effectively in the marketplace, be it domestically or internationally, as reflected in this bill. We saw only today the announcement by the government following on from the Prime Minister's personal decision to make an announcement in the New Zealand parliament that she would allow the importation of New Zealand apples into Australia. This means that Biosecurity Australia has been forced by the Prime Minister's statement to abandon the need for adequate protocols to prevent the incursion of serious diseases like fire blight with the importation of New Zealand apples. We saw the result of that today. Let us not be in any doubt: these proposals by Biosecurity Australia are an abandonment of the quarantine principles that have made us amongst the cleanest producers of highquality food in the world. As we know when we look at the anti-dumping measures in this bill, dumping affects like goods as well as those it affects directly. Consistently we have seen the minister hide behind Doha in dealing with these matters instead of producing the type of legislation that would make a difference. We heard previously from the member for Murray about the amount of fruit that is imported and that there is more fruit imported than exported. There are very real issues when we talk about anti-dumping and anti-dumping measures and how the government should be responding. There has been no greater acknowledgement of the lack of equity in trade than the failure of the government to deliver through any of the Doha talks. Debate interrupted. NA",157
248,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! It being 7 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Dental Health Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) (19:00): I rise to speak about the Labor government's decision in the last federal budget to close the chronic disease dental scheme by December this year. This, like many Labor decisions, has not been thought out and will leave a lot of residents in Macquarie without access to much needed dental care. The coalition government introduced the chronic disease dental scheme in 2007. Since then nearly 13 million dental services have been provided to over half a million Australians. Now the Gillard Labor government wants to close it down. The scheme provides $4,250 worth of dental assistance over two years for patients who are diagnosed with a chronic illness, whose dental condition is exacerbating that illness and who are managed under a general practitioner care plan. To close this scheme would have disastrous health impacts on the residents of Macquarie. The chronic disease dental scheme has been very beneficial. It has aided many Australians to access dental care in a timely fashion. Dental care can be very costly, and waiting lists are often longer than those in need can afford to wait. Under the scheme a lot of these challenges have been alleviated. The Labor government have tried on two separate occasions to stop this popular scheme and both times the Senate has disallowed its closure. Labor are now trying to close the scheme for a third time. This is another example of the Labor government thinking they know better than the Australian people. The need for this scheme cannot be disputed. In its first year, 400,235 New South Wales services accessed this scheme. In the 2010-11 financial year this had surged over 700 per cent to 2,859,175 services. This very effective scheme is being shut down by a Labor government desperate to recover some of the billions of dollars they have wasted in their suite of mismanaged policies, whether it be pink batts, the five-for-one people swap or the carbon tax-and, of course, the list goes on. Across my electorate I have found strong support for the chronic disease dental scheme. I have spoken to dentists and patients from suburbs such as Blaxland, Bligh Park and Katoomba and the message has always been the same. The chronic disease dental scheme has allowed many people who otherwise could not have gained access to dental health care the opportunity to do so in a timely manner without the cost affecting their ability to receive treatment. Many local dentists are sceptical of Labor's ability to deliver a viable alternative and have grave concerns about the number of people who, if the scheme is removed, will be sent to the back of a very long public waiting list. Local dentists have highlighted to me how troubling bad teeth can be for your health. To offer a patient a vital lifesaving device or operation and not ensure that their teeth are healthy could potentially undo all of that work. Bacteria and other diseases that are on your teeth and gums can spread throughout your body. Healthy teeth are an important part of a healthy life. I was told stories of how this scheme had affected the lives of Macquarie residents in positive ways. I was told the story of a woman from the Blue Mountains who had lived with no teeth for the past 20 years due to losing them in a shocking case of domestic violence. She had never been able to afford new teeth. Thanks to the chronic disease dental scheme she received the much needed surgery. When she saw herself in the mirror with her brand-new teeth she burst into tears and said it was one of the happiest moments of her life. Another story was of a young person battling to break the cycle of drug addiction. Due to her challenges with this addiction she had, unfortunately, lost all of her teeth. She qualified for new teeth under the chronic disease dental scheme. Thanks to this and her new lease on life she has been able to break the cycle and turn her life around and obtain work. She now works in a local fruit shop. She is back on track with a healthy lifestyle. Being able to access the workforce has made a real difference in her rehabilitation. The dentists I spoke to made one thing very clear to me. Dental assistance is valuable not only for a person's physical health but also for their self-esteem and mental health. The chronic disease dental scheme has helped to improve the health and morale of Australians who otherwise could not have afforded to receive this assistance. We live in a time of economic uncertainty. The cost of living is continuing to rise and more members of my electorate are struggling to make ends meet. This Labor government is now proposing to close access to dental health care that has made, and will continue to make, a difference to the lives of my constituents. India",159
249,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT," I rise in this House tonight to proudly extend my best wishes to the many members of the Australian community of proud Indian heritage and those from my electorate of Holt who, on Monday, 15 August 2011, celebrated the 64th anniversary of India's independence from British rule. On that day in 1947 India became a sovereign nation. When India achieved independence, India's first Prime Minister, Mr Nehru, spoke to the nation. He asked the nation one important question on the first day India became a free country. He asked: are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future? From any objective assessment, India has grasped the opportunity and claimed its birth right. India's economic development, along with its emergence in key institutions like the G20 and other elements of the global political and economic architecture, is testament to the spirit of the people of India, their vibrant optimism, their desire for social prosperity and economic development and for opportunity for their country and their children. The Indian economy is growing at approximately eight per cent. The economic boom has translated into opportunities for its citizens in the way of new infrastructure and industries and has improved the lives of many Indian citizens. India has been one of the fastest-growing large economies since 1994. Indian economic engagement with the rest of the world has increased, particularly in the services sector. It is apparent that the spirit of the people of India still moves people within the country to fight for change, changes that they want to see in their country and in the world. And at this time of profound change and hope for millions of people, India's story stands as a powerful example of what people can achieve through the peaceful pursuit of human, political and social rights. Australia has a very broad and deep relationship with India based on our common interests and shared commitment to democracy, pluralism, human rights and the rule of law. The relationship that exists between our countries is one characterised not only by flourishing trade but profound cultural and social exchange. In 2009, for example, the then Prime Minister Rudd announced a major boost in funding over five years for joint science and technology research projects. This included $50 million that will be matched by India for the Australia-India Strategic Research Fund to support joint research in some of the grand challenges facing the two countries, like energy, food and water security. It is no secret-and I proudly say thisthat Australia welcomes a growing number of migrants, students and visitors from India. They are part of the past, present and future of this nation. In our past, Indian crews from the Bay of Bengal are believed to have come to Australia on trading ships soon after 1788 and others came later, in the 1800s. These members of the Indian community were vital in the early exploration of inland Australia and in the establishment of service and communication links. Today well over 300,000 people of Indian heritage are making an invaluable contribution to Australia's economic and social prosperity. I am continually amazed at the vibrant culture that the Indian community has brought to Australia. In particular it has been heartening to see how the Indian community has enriched the local community in my electorate. They have left an indelible mark on areas in and around my electorate like the Carrum Downs Temple and the Indian Quarter in Dandenong, home of many Indian restaurants and Indian cultural organisations. I visited the Hindu Shri Shiva Vishnu temple in Carrum Downs earlier this year for the Holi Festival. This temple was built by Hindu community members from India, Sri Lanka, Fiji and South Africa. The building itself is a monumental piece of architecture, a credit to the community. One of the great triumphs of the Australian experience is to allow people from every corner of the earth to make this place their home and to share their cultures with their fellow Australians in this country in an atmosphere of mutual respect, tolerance and shared understanding. This was made very clear to me during the Week of Nations that took place at the Courtenay Gardens Primary School on Friday, 29 July 2011. That is where they had a parade of nations, and the acceptance that members of the Indian community had from that particular community was very clear. I wish to end my speech by saying happy Independence Day in celebration of India's achievements. We honour its past and look with hope to what certainly will be a great future. (Time expired) Australian Health Survey Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (19:10): I rise this evening to discuss a constituent's recent experience with a federal government agency, the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Perhaps it has long outlived its usefulness in a modern age, and I will describe what has happened to one of my constituents. Recently, an elderly constituent living in one of the Maranoa electorate's smaller rural communities contacted my office regarding the Australian Health Survey 2011-13 which is currently being conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. She had been randomly selected to participate in the survey, which forces her to answer personal questions about her health and her lifestyle to government bureaucrats. According to the government, this survey is expected to be the most comprehensive research on health that Australians have ever had undertaken. Participants will be weighed and measured and also asked detailed questions on what they eat and drink and their physical activity. Answering these questions is compulsory and, whilst providing a blood and urine sample is voluntary, 50,000 adults and children from around Australia will be randomly sampled to give a snapshot of the nation's health. Those 50,000 people will be compelled to take part in the survey. If they refuse to divulge information on their health and lifestyle to the ABS, they will face a hefty fine. The resident who was randomly selected in one of the communities in the electorate of Maranoa is an 89-year-old woman. After finding an unknown vehicle parked outside her house, she was handed a leaflet about the survey and was informed she was 'one of the lucky ones to be selected'. She told the person that she was not interested in the survey as she was too old and suggested they find someone else. She thought that the ABS person would then go away. Not so. A few days later the lady, my constituent, on returning to her home found that a letter from the ABS had been placed under her door. The letter advised her that the ABS had the power to direct unwilling participants to provide personal information. Operating under the Census and Statistics Act 1905, the ABS can impose a fine of up to $110 a day if the participant refuses to comply after being directed to do so in writing. Can you believe it? Is this a soviet state we live in these days? I hope not. The tone used in the letter-which I have-was both arrogant and confronting. An elderly lady is justifiably concerned about letting strangers into her house and divulging confidential information about her health. These standover tactics are completely unacceptable, particularly from a federal government agency, when it involves an 89-year-old woman. The federal government has just conducted the 2011 Census and will now be spending some $48 million on this survey. Surely that $48 million that is going to be used obviously to make work for the ABS and health department could have been wisely invested in rural communities crying out for better health services, for instance. Queensland is home to one-third of the nation's regional population and my electorate is 42 per cent of the landmass of Queensland, and yet Queensland received only $164 million of the federal government's $1.8 billion for regional health and hospital funding announced in the federal budget. Now, $48 million would go a long way in the electorate of Maranoa or many regional areas, for that matter, across Australia towards better health services rather than conducting ABS statistical surveys which I think are of doubtful value in this day and age. I know my constituents in the town of Mitchell are looking for some funds for an aged-care facility. Half a million dollars of that $48 million would go an awfully long way there. I know in Kingaroy they are looking for better palliative care services. These are much needed and yet my electorate received some $4 million from that $1.8 billion health fund that was announced in the budget. I am extremely disappointed with the conduct of the ABS in regard to this sensitive and private information. I will be writing to the minister and I will also be writing to the ABS. They can do better. This is a statistical service that is no longer required in this day and age, given modern technology. (Time expired) United Nations Security Council",161
250,Dr LEIGH,ADJOURNMENT," In 1994 the genocide in Rwanda shook the world's collective conscience. A mixture of international unwillingness and poor procedure meant that effective action was not taken to prevent the killings. The next year, in what became the largest mass murder in Europe since World War II, United Nations forces in Srebrenica failed to protect those who had sought refuge in a so called UN 'safe zone'. In 1999, fear of a veto in the Security Council prevented UN forces from intervening in atrocities in Kosovo. All of these failures revealed structural defects in the way the international community responds to mass atrocities. Almost since its inception, reform has been on the agenda of the UN. In helping me better understand the various proposals for UN Security Council reform, I am grateful to William Isdale, who interned in my office and worked on this issue. The UN Security Council plays a vital role in world affairs. Except in cases of self defence, the Security Council is the only out international body legally entitled to authorise the use of force. Yet the council currently has two major challenges: membership and procedural effectiveness. The fact that the council's five permanent members are essentially the victors in World War II has riled developing countries, whose member states are often those most affected by UN peacekeeping operations. There is a strong push for greater geographical representation in the council and an emerging consensus that we should boost the number of permanent members and make the deliberations of the council more transparent. Among the countries most often mentioned are Japan, Germany, Brazil and India. Others suggest that the permanent members should include representatives from Africa and from majority Muslim nations. Australia is among the many countries that support India's current bid for a permanent seat, which India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, reportedly declined when it was offered in 1955. A major issue in Security Council reform is the veto. The veto power of the permanent members has always been contentiousAustralia opposed its introduction in the council from the start-and at one stage the conflict on this question threatened to break up the 1945 San Francisco conference at which the UN Charter was drafted. The threat of veto has prevented effective intervention in atrocities as recently as Darfur in 2005. Yet a resolution to remove the veto power would almost certainly itself be vetoed. Bodies like the African Union are aggrieved by the potential that their members will be offered second-class permanency, but additional vetoes in the council could make the body even less effective. If we add permanent members, they should participate without a veto. Indeed, it would be better if the existing permanent members did not veto intervention to prevent mass atrocities. Thanks in part to the tireless efforts of former Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans, the council unanimously affirmed its 'Responsibility to Protect' in 2006 and again in 2009. Where intervention is approved, it should be done swiftly and with minimal casualties. One challenge is that the UN currently lacks its own standing army and instead relies on member nations willing to commit forces. At present, a large number of such forces are provided by developing countries who hope that their soldiers will be trained up in the process. The UN must ensure that it has the best people for the job. The UN also has a way to go in ensuring that the procedures for authorising action on the ground are clear and transparent, as they were not in Srebrenica or Rwanda, and that it builds upon the infrastructure required for such operations. Progress has been made, such as the creation of a UN 'situation room' in 1993, but more could be done to strengthen the UN's capacity to monitor the security situation of countries and predict the likelihood of an outbreak of ethnic violence. In a world of 'problems without passports', multilateralism is no longer a second option, especially when it comes to issues like genocide and other mass atrocities. Strengthening the ability of the United Nations to deal with such crises is in everyone's interests. Martin Luther King once said: Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilisations are written the pathetic words: 'Too late.' Let us hope that reform of the UN Security Council can help avert another Rwanda, Srebrenica, Kosovo or Darfur. Australian Industry Trade College Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (19:20): I rise to speak in general about education and specifically about the Australian Industry Trade College. The AITC is a college dedicated to preparing year 11 and year 12 students for a career in industry and it is based in my electorate of MCPherson on the Gold Coast. Their unique modelling differs from conventional schooling allowing students to complete their senior education and gain significant work experience along with various additional qualifications and skills. This gives students the essential foundations necessary to secure an apprenticeship placement. Over 530 school based apprenticeships have been achieved by the college in over 50 different trade qualifications and around 95 per cent of students graduate with the Queensland Certificate of Education each year. These numbers are impressive when compared to the conventional schooling senior certificate rate of only 75 per cent. Around 92 per cent of year 12 graduates from the college were employed as apprentices in 2010. At any one time there are around 300 students at the college working towards the same goal of an apprenticeship in their chosen field. The AITC takes on 150 year-11 students each year. Currently there are 300 students enrolled at the AITC. However, at any one time, half of them are off campus completing on-the-job training though their work experience program. The remaining students are on campus completing a four-week block of in-class study. The team of educators at the AITC have been selected for their commitment to the unique program and a flexible learning pathway. Together these academics have developed an innovative and creative curriculum model that complies with the Queensland Studies Authority. The core curriculum at the AITC includes English communication, mathematics A or prevocational mathematics, business, information technology and physical wellness, which includes yoga and martial arts. Other fields of study include a certificate III Australian School-based Apprenticeship, delivered off site at a registered training organisation. The AITC also offers the option of additional certificate courses, and all students must engage in community service. The curriculum is delivered in units during the four-week block, and the work component is a separate unit which also contributes points to the Queensland Certificate of Education. The unique learning structure at the AITC gives students the opportunity to graduate not just with a Queensland Certificate of Education but also with significant work experience, a Certificate II in Information Technology, significant networks within the industry of their choice, a first-aid certificate and the completion of up to 30 per cent of a certificate III in their trade qualification. But it is not only the learning structure that is unique at the college. The AITC also has a unique style of teaching and working with students. Each student at the AITC has assigned to them a case manager who provides them with support and advice as they prepare themselves for entry into the workforce. Making the transition out into the real world can be very daunting for young people. Having a mentor on hand makes the transition less stressful for them. One of the tasks students are given to increase their confidence in looking for work is to make their own phone calls in class to prospective work-experience employers. This is a very emotional task for these students as rejection becomes a reality that they must face. Young people sometimes do not realise how difficult it can be to get a job, and this exercise empowers them and strengthens their ability and confidence in arranging their own work experience, teaching them a valuable lesson not usually taught in more traditional models. The college has established relationships with over 1,200 employers from North Queensland through to Tasmania to assist the students in finding work once they have completed their qualifications. The AITC CEO, Mark Hands, and the staff are doing a wonderful job in ensuring young people have access to flexible education and practical experience, particularly for students who would normally leave school before completing years 11 and 12. The flexible model of the AITC works for individuals wanting to pursue a career in industry without missing out on or forgoing the final years of their schooling. I would like to see more educational institutions offering flexible learning options like the AITC to encourage a future skilled workforce- (Time expired) Battle of Long Tan",163
251,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT," Tomorrow, 18 August, is the anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. To commemorate the occasion, services will be held in my electorate of Makin at Henderson Square at Pooraka and at the Tea Tree Gully RSL Memorial Garden. Being in Canberra, I will be unable to attend those services, but I will be represented at both of them by members of my staff. On Sunday, 21 August, I will, however, attend the annual service organised by the Vietnam Veterans Day Council of South Australia at the Torrens Parade Ground in Adelaide, as I have done for several years. The Battle of Long Tan was fought between the Australian Army and Viet Cong forces in a rubber plantation near the village of Long Tan in South Vietnam. During the battle, 108 soldiers from D Company of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, fought off an assault by an estimated 2,500 Vietnamese troops. The battle claimed the lives of 18 Australians, whilst 27 other soldiers were wounded. At least 245 Vietnamese were also killed. In Henderson Square, located in the Montague Farm Estate within Pooraka, a special Vietnam War memorial was established several years ago. On the initiative of Fred Pritchard, himself a Vietnam veteran, who project managed the development of the estate in the 1990s, Montague Farm has been dedicated to Australians who served and died in the Vietnam War. Of the 501 Australian servicemen killed in the Ten Thousand Day War, 62 were from South Australia, and the majority of them have been recognised in the naming of the streets and reserves in the Montague Farm Estate. Henderson Square is named in memory of Warrant Officer Malcolm Henderson, who passed away on 16 December 1967. I note that in this week's edition of the Leader Messenger, the local newspaper, the vice-president of the Tea Tree Gully RSL and Vietnam veteran, Malcolm Love, who I am sure will not mind me referring to him as a mate, was quoted: ""No one does say much about Vietnam … but I saw enough for it to have a pretty big impact on my life. ""We might not talk about it but we all know what it was like and we take comfort from that. ""We support one another and look after one another."" The bond that these Vietnam veterans share is uniquely strong. It is easy to forget today that there was considerable opposition in the 1960s to the Vietnam War and, indeed, to the notion of conscription. Many of those Australians who served in Vietnam were national servicemen. In March 1966 the government announced that national servicemen would be sent to Vietnam to fight in units of the Australian Regular Army and for secondment to American forces. Despite this, many former national servicemen I have come to know now see their national service as a positive phase in their lives. Just as our remembrance of World War I centres on the Gallipoli landing on 25 April, for the Vietnam War it has become centred on the Battle of Long Tan. Not only is this battle significant because of the courage the 100-plus young Australian men displayed fighting off a regimental assault; it also had a considerable impact on the war as it allowed the Australian Army to gain dominance over Phuoc Tuy Province. This week, 45 years after the Battle of Long Tan, former members of D Company, 6RAR, will receive a Unit Citation for Gallantry. The current generation of 6RAR are continuing a proud tradition and have recently returned from serving the nation in Afghanistan. Several 6RAR solders will receive individual medals for their efforts during their recent eight-month deployment. When you consider that the late American President Lyndon Baines Johnson awarded D Company 6RAR the US Presidential Unit Citation in 1968, one could argue that the official recognition within Australia is long overdue. The words contained in the late president's citation conjure up a strong image of what the young Australian soldiers endured 45 years ago. I quote from the citation: The enemy maintained a continuous, intense volume of fire and attacked repeatedly from all directions. Each successive assault was repulsed by the courageous Australians. Heavy rainfall and a low ceiling prevented any friendly close air support during the battle. After three hours of savage attacks, having failed to penetrate the Australian lines, the enemy withdrew from the battlefield carrying many dead and wounded, and leaving 245 Viet Cong dead forward of the defence position of D Company. Last year the last two Australian missing personnel from the Vietnam War, Pilot Officer Robert Carver and Flying Officer Michael Herbert, were brought home. It was an important closure to the war, which ended nearly 40 years ago but which has not been forgotten by those who served there. To quote a Vietnam veteran, 'I left Vietnam in 1970, but Vietnam never left me.' Tonight I take this opportunity to recognise our Vietnam veterans. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (19:31): There is a certain irony in comparing two recent Illawarra Mercury articles relating to BlueScope Steel. If it were not so serious, it would be laughable. The first was reported on 19 July, just gone. The headline says 'Simon Crean likes what he sees at Port Kembla'. The minister is quoted as saying: … after adjustments under the recent Federal Government package to help it cope with carbon pricing, BlueScope is still well and truly in the game. That may well be right in one sense, but it is especially ironic in another. In an article in the same newspaper less than one month later, on 15 August, another headline read 'Carbon tax money may fund BlueScope cuts'. The opening line read: Much of the $180 million in taxpayers' money promised to BlueScope Steel in the carbon tax package could end up funding the company's job cuts, which are expected to start within weeks. BlueScope Steel has also announced that it would be likely to cease production at one of its two Port Kembla blast furnaces. Aside from the direct job losses, there will be considerable flow-on effects impacting on contractors and other small businesses that are organic to the steelworks. The Illawarra Mercury ventured that this could well be the tip of the iceberg. The House would recall earlier this year a motion by the member for Throsby ardently lending his support to a carbon tax on our steel industry. This is what he said: We are taking action to create new job opportunities in a clean energy generation and taking action to help Australia‘s trade-exposed emission-intensive industries. The reality is that jobs are going to be lost despite the delusional thinking of the member for Throsby, as events are revealing. He thought it was a great thing, but those closer to the working class have a different view. He also said: It is beyond question that the Gillard government is not prepared to see jobs go offshore as a result of our transition to a carbon economy. Nor do we want to see the emissions that come with those jobs go overseas. That is exactly what is happening. My former colleague and former member for Throsby, Jennie George, now retired, did a splendid job representing the working class voters of Throsby. We may not have agreed on a number of issues, but she had my respect in the way that she stood up for the welfare of those she was elected to represent, especially BlueScope Steel. I just wish I could say the same thing about her successor, who is ignoring the need of those he was elected by simply to curry favour with his political masters. Bob Harrison is the former state member for Kiama, who served in the New South Wales parliament for over 13 years and is a life member of the Australian Labor Party. He was also former Mayor of the City of Shellharbour. Earlier this year Bob contributed an article to the Illawarra Mercury whose banner read, 'Carbon tax will burn Illawarra'. It was a rejection of what the Labor member for Throsby was advocating. Bob's theme was that this carbon tax would have a significant and adverse effect on the employment prospects for the greater Illawarra region. How prophetic were his words? BlueScope is a major steel product manufacturer in the Illawarra, employing hundreds of workers, including those from the suburbs I represent in and around Shellharbour. Many of those workers are now going to lose their jobs. It is not as if the Gillard government and its supporters were not warned. BlueScope Steel's CEO, Paul O'Malley, said that they could live with the tax provided tariffs are imposed on their overseas competitors who will not have to pay a carbon tax. This was never going to happen, and some manufacturers were already saying they could move their low- operations overseas. This is bringing that scenario closer to reality. BlueScope and OneSteel have said: It's a direct threat to this NSW regional economy and the 12,000 workers and their families … How true. There is plenty of evidence to back up those concerns, but despite all the evidence Labor's cheer squad chooses to remain in denial. The people who allegedly seek to represent the views of the workers in the Illawarra, the Australian Workers Union, have dismissed these concerns as scaremongering, yet the concluding remarks of its head, Mr Andrew Gillespie, as reported in the Illawarra Mercury, acknowledge that many workers were concerned about the talk of BlueScope potentially shifting operations offshore. He said: I keep telling them. I can't give you answers on carbon price, or carbon relief, because it hasn't been done yet. It is done, and this is the result. The motion by the member for Throsby exhorted this House to agree that governments must work with the manufacturing industry and communities to assist their transformation to meet the challenge of a carbon constrained future. The only transformation is the migration of our local manufacturing industries and their jobs to the Asian economy. I will certainly be doing all I can to protect jobs, and if that means crossing swords with the member for Throsby and the unions, so be it. Unlike them, I take seriously my responsibilities and the interests of the people I represent. I despair and say: what a foolish government this country has been cursed with. Economy",166
252,Mr HUSIC,ADJOURNMENT," In March I spoke about the price differentials that exist in relation to products sold in Australia compared to overseas. I did not imagine at the time it would trigger the response it did. I received a wide range of emails and calls complaining about the way Australian consumers and businesses have been, frankly, ripped off. Back then I put the spotlight on a particular company: Apple. I will not go into detail about the differences now, because I did at the time. It was clear that the products they were manufacturing and retailing had a significant difference in price. Even the products of other manufacturers sold by Apple via its website had some massive differences. So I wrote to them in March. Amazingly, at the time. I was quietly warned by IT journalists and consumers not to expect a response. Chase them up I did; my office followed them up a number of times. They promised that by 16 July Apple Australia's Managing Director, Tony King, would personally respond to the concerns raised in March once he returned from leave. In the meantime, Apple began to reduce the prices of the apps it sells via iTunes. I congratulated them for it at the time but indicated I wanted to see where they would head with hardware costs. Yet only a week later it became clear that Apple was not going to move on this issue. Tech website Delimiter reported that Apple was set to hit consumers again. Its new MACBook Air was estimated to cost up to $300 more than US consumers would have to pay and the new Apple Thunderbolt display would cost up to $270 more. July 16 came and went. Apple refused to respond and I am staggered by their behaviour: they've snubbed consumer, media and parliamentary interest in this matter. But they are not the only ones with a case to answer for in relation to glaring price differentials. Some other culprits are PC manufacturer Lenovo, which released their ThinkPad X1 laptop in May and which costs $1,959 here, despite the same model selling in the US for as little as $1,399; Microsoft's flagship cloud productivity suite Office 365 costs 76 per cent more here than in the US; and Adobe's Creative Suite-and this is incredible-which costs US$699 but nearly A$1,200. Gamers pay up to 60 per cent more here for products compared to those in the UK or US. Consumers have noticed this, the media has noticed this and now it appears even the Productivity Commission has noticed this. Here is what it said in its recently released report into Australia's retail sector: The Commission is aware of the long standing practice by which some international suppliers set differential regional prices. This effectively treats consumers in one region as willing, or able, to tolerate significantly higher prices than those in other countries. It goes on to say: Some international suppliers have attempted to defend such price discrimination as due to the cost of supplying a remote and relatively small market like Australia, which in some cases has its own unique requirements. These arguments in most cases are not persuasive, especially in the case of downloaded music, software and videos, for example, where the costs of delivery to the customer are practically zero and uniform around the world. The commission summed it up neatly: the arguments are, in its words, simply not persuasive. It is well known that as a nation we are early adopters of technology, but being early adopters has definitely come with a price. If you are a small business needing the latest software to help keep pace with changes in your business or industry, or to be more productive, you should not be hammered by these price differences. Younger people, with less spending power but with a demand for these products, should not be hit with these variations either. Families that also want access to technology, whose impact has been far reaching in our homes and lives, should not be fleeced for the sake of Silicon Valley's bottom line. These companies would simply not do this to consumers in their home countries. Why do it in ours? I have raised this matter within government and certainly believe that the Productivity Commission's views are compelling. If IT companies are not prepared to be transparent about their pricing decisions, then perhaps it is time for our pricing watchdog, the ACCC, to take up the case for long-suffering consumers and carry out a formal inquiry into why these prices differ so wildly. Longman Electorate WYATT ROY (Longman) (19:40): I would like to thank the shadow Treasurer, the Hon. Joe Hockey, for visiting Longman last week. Joe and I toured the electorate, visited several small businesses and held a community lunch with over 150 local small businesses. I would like to outline to the House some of the realities that are facing the locals in my community. Across my electorate of Longman we have six per cent unemployment. In Caboolture, the largest population base in the electorate, we have 10 per cent unemployment. When you walk down the main street in Caboolture one in ten of the people you meet do not have a job. We have a local economy that is completely dependent on what we on this side of the House think of as the power house and the engine room of the economy-small business. We have a local economy that is dependent on tourism, retail and light industry. The greatest resources in my local community are the work ethic and the willingness of countless locals to get out there and have a go. These locals are willing to get out there and go into business, often in the face of adversity and a difficult economic climate, and to have a go, to say that they want to get ahead in life, to provide for their families and, importantly, to employ people. The concern that was certainly raised when Joe visited, and that is raised with me every single day when I make my way around the electorate talking to small businesses and to these people who are getting out there and having a go, is that life is getting more difficult. Something that the Labor Party and the members opposite have forgotten-or, worse yet, attacked-is this notion of having a go. I challenge the members opposite-there are not a lot of members opposite, but I would certainly challenge any interjecting members-to go out into their communities, talk to these local small businesses and come back to this place and tell me when you have found one small business that says, 'What my business needs to thrive, to employ people, to prosper and to give back to the local economy is higher operating costs.' There is now deathly silence on the other side, but I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that with higher operating costs, greater regulation and a greater burden on the local small businesses in my community they will find it harder to do what they naturally do, and what they naturally do is to prosper and employ people. The natural setting of small business in this country is based on opportunity. I worry when we attack opportunity by making it harder for people to get out there and have a go. I might share with the House a story from the shadow Treasurer's visit to my electorate. We went out and saw a local worker in a manufacturing firm in my electorate. He said: 'If I work overtime, all that ends up happening is that I get taxed more. I have to work harder to then try to pay back that greater tax burden, and there is no incentive for me to get out there and try to get ahead life.' I stress that I cannot find that says, 'A tax makes my business thrive.' I worry sometimes because the members opposite in the Labor Party have this belief that the government has the solution to everybody's problems. I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that the government is the problem. The fundamental truth that we seem to have forgotten in this nation is that, instead of looking to the government for the solutions to our problems, sometimes we should let the government get out of our way so that we can get on with our lives and thrive, prosper and do what we naturally do, which is employ people and provide for our local community. I think it is quite worrying that our country is going down this path where we attack hope, where we attack reward for hard work and where we attack the notion of a society based on opportunity. On this side of the House we understand that the essential ingredients for Australia to prosper once again are to have hope that tomorrow will be better than today, that we will have reward for hard work and that we will have equality of opportunity-that we will provide all Australians with an opportunity to get ahead in life. In conclusion, I would like to say that on this side of the House, in order to deliver on those three essential ingredients we will deliver two promises: under a coalition government you will have less tax and you will have less government spending. The government will get out of the way so that you can get on and get ahead in life. National Disability Insurance Scheme",169
253,Ms BURKE,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to speak on the government's initiative in the area of supported services for people with disability, in particular its plan to introduce a National Disability Insurance in Scheme. I want to speak out in full support one business of this initiative. I also want to take the time to thank the many wonderful disability groups in my electorate who have been behind the push for this development. Yes, the government asked the Productivity Commission to look at this; but this has been a scheme that many community groups, disability groups and individuals have been pushing for for some time. I will just name a few that are housed in my electorate and who have been very quietly advocating behind the scenes: Brainlink Services Limited, the MS Society, Scope, the Oakleigh Centre, Melbourne East Disability Advocacy, Alkira and numerous others in my electorate. They have been behind the scenes supporting this and they have applauded the government's and the Productivity Commission's announcement to finally end this system of chasing money endlessly, and to develop this scheme. The system of disability services is, as we all know, stretched, and has often failed to meet the needs of the disabled in our community, their families and their carers. As the Productivity Commission report said, 'It is unfair, unfunded and fragmented,' and it is certainly overdue for major reform. As the campaign that is currently running says, 'Every Aussie counts,' and we should have a system that does not say that how you got your disability determines your funding level; it is that you are disabled, and we will have a national scheme to ensure that people are covered. The government did ask the Productivity Commission to look into long-term care and support of people with disabilities. One of the growing issues amongst many in my community, and I know this is across the board, is ageing parents who have children with disability in their care. They are terrified of what will happen to that child when the parent dies. Mine is an ageing community and so these are parents who look at their child, who is 40 or 50 and who is still their full responsibility. They are traumatised about what will happen to them. This report says that one of the big funding gaps is in that area of housing and support when parents and carers have gone and that we need to fund that into the future. The Productivity Commission has recommended that, like Medicare, Australians should be insured against significant disability. It means that those Australians with significant disability will get the kind of care and support Australians expect for them. It also means that any Australian who acquires a disability, or whose child is born with a disability, can have confidence that they will get helping hands when they need it. The government agrees that transformational reform of disability services is desperately needed to provide the kind of care and support that people need. To give Australians who might acquire a disability the confidence that they will be given a helping hand when they need it most the government will be working with states and territories, and that will begin this at the COAG meeting to ensure that we have a nationally coordinated scheme. The scheme will provide individually tailored care and support to around 410,000 people with significant disabilities. Many people think that people with disabilities in our community are diminishing. Actually, people with disability in our communities are increasing, and we need to ensure that we have the means to ensure that they are cared for now and into the future. It will be accompanied by a national injury insurance scheme to provide no-fault insurance for anyone who suffers a catastrophic injury. The government acknowledges the importance of taking an insurance approach to provide people with disability with the care and support they need over the course of their lifetime, and is starting the process of reform by establishing an advisory group to assist the task force to provide expert advice on delivering the foundations for reform and preparing for launch and by seeking to establish a select committee on disability reform that would bring together Commonwealth, states, territories and disability ministers to do the work needed to lay the foundations for change. The government is committing an additional $10 million immediately in line with Productivity Commission recommendations to support this work and to lay the foundation for reforms. This is on top of the increased funding this government has provided already in the disability space. I have spoken often in this place of the wonderful organisations in my electorate that do great work, but I had the joy of visiting many over the break-the break from Canberra, not from work, can I just emphasise! Waverley Industries was one that I got to, and where I opened a new kitchen. Friday Waverley Industries is a not-for-profit organisation that provides work for people with disabilities. This is a fantastic new kitchen that has been fully funded by charitable donations. It will now provide a new outlet for disability employment, providing catering and support services in the area. I really want to commend Waverley Industries, and if anybody in Melbourne is looking for a good catering service-please use them. I also had the joy again of visiting IMPACT Support Services. IMPACT Support Services is a great organisation which is trying to help socialise people with disability in the community so we know that they are not different. (Time expired) Bennelong Electorate: Infrastructure",171
254,Mr ALEXANDER,ADJOURNMENT," Bennelong is a region of Sydney that seems to be the beneficiary of all that a modern metropolis, but with all of the challenges. There are state-of-the-art shopping centres-the latest and greatest being Top Ryde City; business parks that are spectacular in scope and size, boasting the Optus headquarters-which is a world in itself; Macquarie Hospital, with medical technologies to amaze, enthral and, most importantly, heal; and Macquarie University, which has just this week been recognised as producing some of Australia's most successful graduates. Many of these graduates begin as overseas students and I have spoken repeatedly of the need for a much greater level of support for these students, who play such an important role in our national and local economy. The boarding houses that have materialised all over Marsfield, leading to the community action group, Marsfield Against Residential Suffocation, have led to a radical change in the nature of this quiet suburb, as well as the mistreatment of students by unscrupulous landlords. Housing developments are aplenty, with something for everyone, but that sometimes seems to be the problem; so many moving into Bennelong and yet so many more funnelling through to the CBD from the fast-growing Hills district. The biggest single issue for some time has been concern regarding overdevelopment, which generates the first symptom of traffic congestion that impacts on our everyday life. This situation is magnified by the lack of public transport development, resulting in the import of more traffic congestion. This is the motivation to push for the well-overdue investment in infrastructure-namely, the North West rail link and the Epping to Parramatta rail link. These two pieces of infrastructure are absolutely vital to take the pressure off and regain acceptable levels of traffic rather than the levels that so drain our productivity and is desirable in quality of life. I have argued recently for appropriate development that will not destroy our leafy suburban amenity. When located at the junction of these proposed upgraded rail hubs, as I have promoted for the proposed development of the Epping town centre, it would appear that no additional traffic will result. Through an acceptance of the inevitability of population increases throughout our nation's largest city, the highrise nature of the proposed development will stymie any lateral spread and therefore protect the nature and quality of life in the surrounding suburbs. Involvement in the redevelopment of the Ryde rehabilitation centre has also produced an improved result through the cooperative nature of the developer, Frasers Property. Macquarie Park also sits there waiting patiently for the promised infrastructure that will not only reduce its people's biggest challenge of simply getting to work in reasonable time but also open up further opportunities to fulfil its vast potential. The City of Ryde has predicted that Macquarie Park will be Australia's fourth largest CBD by 2030, alongside the booming Parramatta. With this knowledge, it is our duty as community leaders at all levels of government to invest in the infrastructure necessary to facilitate this growth. We must ensure that we do not repeat the same mistake made by successive Labor governments, promising infrastructure to get a good headline but rarely turning a sod of dirt or laying a metre of track. The 13-year delay of the North West rail link has seen the project blow out in cost from $360 million to $8 billion. The Chatswood to Parramatta rail link was set to cost $1 billion; half of it was built 10 years later at a cost of $2.4 billion. The crucial connection from Epping which would link the two burgeoning CBDs of Macquarie Park and Parramatta was announced by a desperate Gillard government in the dying days of the election campaign, with a promise of a further $2.1 billion. Bennelong's voters did not believe this promise, and I am here as a result of that today. Their insight seems well founded following successive broken promises on everything from a carbon tax to asylum seekers and now the surplus. The people of Bennelong would certainly appreciate it if the government kept this one promise. It is interesting to note that the Epping to Parramatta rail link failed to rate a single mention in the thousands of pages of budget documents, despite every other nationbuilding project that was announced in the MYEFO being confirmed in this year's budget. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport gave me a verbal reassurance that this promise stands. The people of Bennelong are watching closely to see if his word is worth more than that of his Prime Minister.",173
255,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to say a few words this evening. I will just paint a quick picture of what might be. In Australia, for a long time now, we have not been able to grasp a vision of what might be for our country. There was a very great man who built a bridge in Sydney called the Sydney Harbour Bridge; Dr Bradfield was his name. He won an international prize for engineering-not for the bridge, actually, but for the underground railway system, which was considered to be the most superior underground railway system in the world at the time. He also built the Story Bridge in Brisbane, the University of Queensland's sandstone buildings, Burrinjuck Dam and Hume Weir. An electorate of the House of Representatives is named after him. The highways over the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Story Bridge in Brisbane are named after him as well. Dr Bradfield conceived the scheme of taking a tiny bit of the vast waters of the superwet belt of North Queensland and turning them back into Lake Eyre. The revised Bradfield scheme conceives not of taking that water and turning it into Lake Eyre but using it on the great inland plains of Queensland. He proposed an alternative of digging a ditch up from Spencer Gulf, which has been costed recently at about $4½ thousand million. It would fill Lake Eyre and would put 30 million megalitres of evaporation water over the Murray-Darling system. The Murray-Darling system has 22 million megalitres of run-off. It is blown up against the inside of the Great Dividing Range, and I think it is reasonable to accept that it would be precipitation. Modelling has been done which indicates that that would not occur. These scientists have to explain to me where the water is going to go! If it blows from the ocean up against the Great Water Dividing Range on one side, it rains. If it blows from this side, surely it should rain as well. I am not talking about the Bradfield scheme now. I will just switch to three water development schemes in North Queensland. There is the Pentland scheme, and we thank the federal government and also the opposition very much and very sincerely for their enthusiasm for the Pentland scheme, which will produce 1,000 megalitres of ethanol a year to replace our dwindling oil supplies and produce petrol at an affordable rate, as is done in the United States and Brazil. It will also produce 400 megawatts of baseload power. For those who are not familiar with the figures, we have capacity produce about 40,000 megawatts in Australia, and this would produce 400 megawatts of power. So it is a marvellous scheme. That scheme can be doubled on the Gilbert River, which is nine million megalitres of water all running into the ocean each year in a quick flood. People sometimes envisage that when we put a dam across we somehow stop our rivers from running in North Queensland. You will never stop the rivers from running no matter how many dams you put down; and later in the year, no matter how many dams you put down, you will not be able to make them run either. So we really do not change the ecology much at all with these proposals. Three times the size of the Pentland scheme is the Burdekin River scheme. There is also the Mitchell River, Australia's biggest river, now bigger than the Murray-Darling. Those three schemes together will provide six million megalitres and 600,000 hectares of irrigation, which will take only two per cent of Northern Australia's water, and only one per cent of North Queensland's land will be taken up by these schemes. Yet they will yield $8,000 million for the Australian to economy each and every year forever. I might add that I am not an advocate of clean power, but the schemes would produce very, very clean power indeed. Eight thousand million dollars, of course, translates into 80,000 jobs for regional Australia and the desperately needed lift that will turn around so much of agriculture in our country and rescue the sugar, cattle and grains industries.",174

The first chapter of the bill is on the merger law provides: A corporation shall not acquire, directly or indirectly, corporate where the acquisition is likely to have market for goods or services. Let us be clear: when two firms merge, what in competition with each other get together What mergers actually do is take conduct consumers-and our laws make such conduct illegal, that same conduct legal.

Both of that the committee went about its work way. I thank them for that leadership. It was important because, as everyone in this of Australia know, the management of the issue for the future of this country. It is a ever since 1915, I believe, when the first River have been ongoing negotiations, discussions the Murray River and the Darling River. It is a long drought we had beginning in the late 1990s NA through to 2006-07, caused a lot of grief to because of the drought that we have come to trying to find sustainable solutions for the The committee's work was initiated by the Basin Authority. There has been a lot of criticism that would ultimately be presented to the justified, I say from the outset that it is my purpose. It triggered the most intensive scrutiny aware of-scrutiny by government departments, government jurisdictions; scrutiny by irrigators, each of the catchments throughout the basin. interest sector were put on the table and, beliefs were exposed and far more The guide also highlighted a lack of communication had responsibility for river water management. assumptions were seriously challenged by credible experience and understanding of the basin. basin waters had been managed until more recent critical and good management of waters by take place.

The relationship between the 23 extractions from one catchment does not necessarily catchment area. What is indisputable, however, have increased. Extractions have increased by 6,000 gigalitres then to about 12,000 gigalitres increased by 100 per cent from about 3,000 gigalitres In Victoria, extractions have also increased in the 1960s to around 4,000 gigalitres today. extracted in 1960, today draws some 600 or 700 licences were capped in 1969 and extractions The volume and impact of diversions is since the 1960s the diversion of waters away into the Murray-Darling system.

Indeed, the system catchments is not clear-for example, reducing add an equal amount of water in another is that since the mid-sixties extraction rates 100 per cent since the early 1960s from around today. In New South Wales, extractions have around 1960 to 6,000 gigalitres today. by about 100 per cent from about 2,000 gigalitres And Queensland, where there was little water gigalitres. Interestingly, in South Australia have hardly changed since that time. also not well quantified or understood because from rivers into dams has impacted on inflows to the system is critical to its sustainability. NA How that is achieved is dependent on who you proposals and options put on the table by communities volume of water that needs to be returned depends high rainfall years current extraction rates are case. Complicating the issue is that inflows inflows in one valley necessarily flow on extractions are best managed on a valley-by-valley basis. The science around volumes of water that should Not surprisingly, we have had figures mooted of water that should be returned to the system. Again, not only do average inflows vary across of very little value or of very little use unless not possible, extraction rates will need to be each of the catchments. The alternative is to and that would unnecessarily constrain productivity The use of adjustable allocations, as has been into the future. The use of allocations could by-year basis with relatively little impact For the basin to remain sustainable we must the basin communities will also die. Now that through and we must get it right. In fact, it do that. We must commit to what is required and of the recent rains. With a growing world population, also be of concern. The Murray-Darling Basin huge potential for growth.

In fact, I am not aware that committee-certainly not in my time in this deadline to try and report by the middle of reporting time frame out by several months, authority reports to the government. It was interesting, though, and relevant to messages reflected in most of the communities urgency about resolving a plan for the Murray-Darling within the basin communities as to what would within the plan. So it is my view that the sooner plan on the table, the better it will be for speak to because there have been a number of right across the basin. Of course, the on annual rainfall and, in turn, inflows. In sustainable; in low rainfall years that is not the vary between catchment valleys, and nor do to the next, as I have said earlier. Therefore, be returned to the system is also not clear. of anywhere between 3,000 and 7,600 gigalitres Figures are also based on average inflows. the basin but, importantly, average inflows are all the water is able to be stored.

It is that kind of innovation that of the committee's work was to try to come up be embraced firstly by the Murray-Darling The committee worked through the inquiry in a any committee has worked as intensely as this parliament. We did so because we set ourselves a this year. The authority has now extended its and it will be interesting to see just what the the point I am making, that one of the very clear we went to was that there was a sense of Basin Authority and that uncertainty be in the plan was contributing to insecurity the authority reports, the sooner there is a communities throughout the basin because they will NA have certainty, and with that certainty they certainly do not want to see the good work could say was rushed, but it was rushed for whilst others report back to the government. I want to briefly talk about the situation Australia has some unique issues. I said earlier licences in the 1960s. Effectively no new amount of water that has been extracted from addition there has been a huge amount of investment South Australia. South Australia did not cause mismanagement of the Murray-Darling Basin little of the federal government's One of the issues that was clearly raised was raised more by communities in the eastern Lower Lakes is a contentious issue. There should best be managed. I do not accept, however, the problems with respect to water allocations system could be managed simply by tearing something similar. The reality is, as I said earlier, system, and since the installation of the system has dramatically changed. There was a submission, however, from southern lagoon of the Coorong directly to the and ought to be looked at. I also believe that much water is returned to the river system Australian border and ultimately reaches the South Australians. Quite frankly, I wait with that respect. This is a matter that I have spoken about continue to do so and I am sure I will speak presented. In the last few seconds left, I not worked with in the preparation of this report-the this morning, as are the member for Riverina, Braddon-for the cooperative way that we worked staff who supported the committee in what we the inquiry for us.",196

I do not accept the argument that the down the barrages at the Lower Lakes or that the whole system is no longer a natural locks between, I think, 1922 and 1935 the whole Mr Ian Mott, which talked about connecting the sea. It is a submission that I believe has merit for South Australia the issue is not so much how but rather how much water crosses the South Murray mouth. That is the real question for interest to see what the authority recommends in in this parliament on other occasions. I will on the matter again when the authority's report is only thank the members of the committee whom I member for New England is in the chamber the member for Barker and the member for together but also particularly thank the did, every step of the way, and who organised First off, let me say that I totally agree I think the submission by Ian Mott as an of the Coorong and the Murray mouth should be government. Anyone who has looked at that to the chair of the Murray-Darling Basin that it does warrant as a possible cost effective has only to look at what has been done at West see that, on a smaller scale, it has worked quite NA well. I plead with the government: at least this could work, because it creates big possibilities I also support the observation by member worked.

For example, in December we went earlier they were dry, but when we were there change had been brought about not by think Mother Nature is a lot cleverer and to speak with the people of Broken Hill, and their irrigation, was an important start. at the bottom of the system. We went over the every member of the committee a hands-on and how important they are. Again, I agree with is not the answer. It is one of the fallacies if we just let the sea into the lakes. I think it Lakes have never been naturally saline except most estuaries they are mostly freshwater but saline for perhaps weeks at a time-certainly not It is very much a very minor thing. it was in 2006, when the federal government found that there was a real concern with I remember the Premier of South Australia with 'peace in our time,' saying, 'We're going millions at the proposed site, but no weir has they could eventually, perhaps, build a weir. I right answer. Perhaps a lock of some sort might weir as proposed by the government. I am very in and stopped the pressure to build the weir at Australia, all of Lake Albert and half of Lake basically goes through the middle of Lake so I suppose you could say that one side of the for Mayo and the other side is represented by the last election campaign that the candidates we thought the biggest issues were.

Water supply is so our capital city Adelaide and for our industries part of our community, but the fact is that allocations of the water that is diverted from takes about six per cent and the rest is basically I have never taken the parochial view that because the Murray-Darling does not recognise states.

Not a lot changed a result of being part of this committee, and a bit of controversy with that report, but the that we made then were borne out. History often and I think in this situation we were pretty knowledge of people who had previously been generally, because most of those seemed to was important that we had that corporate knowledge committee that we did. In my electorate, water that goes without saying. We have had some irrigators that are struggling to keep their that are affected by the flow-on effects of, Some people have said it is the worse drought the Federation drought from 1895 to 1903 was days we did not have the locks and we did Basin that we have now. So I think the effects humans have done over the last 100 years. Please do not get me wrong on that-because that works pretty well-but we were found showed that we needed to take some serious river system. in South Australia is an iconic issue for me important, not only for our communities but for that rely on the Murray. It is a very important South Australia only takes six per cent of the the Murray-Darling Basin.

Many regard for her efforts throughout World War her name is held in as high regard as that of not recognise the absolute regard with which is a true hero in a time when the term 'hero' real deal.

It has been a long decade since June NA 2001 when COAG met and established the Ministerial of establishing a ministerial council on energy In 2002, the energy market review released efficient energy market. The review A statutory National Energy Regulator should be COAG to be the independent energy regulator in all encompass the energy-related regulatory roles Commission, the National Electricity Code Administrator It has taken a decade, because it was only government finally passed its National Energy bill received royal assent on 17 March, which ahead. The effect of this bill will require Why is this bill so important? As stated the member for Groom, having a competitive economy. We need reliable, efficient, affordable, security also. The one thing that is being confidence in investment. That is affecting Australia. There is nothing in Australia, no way, shape or form on energy. Each and every legislation, because the purpose of this legislation operate across state borders, and who therefore legislation and regulation. The ambition and more retailers will enter the market and experience, increased competition By way of background, while talking about after the Rudd government was elected, electricity an average of 50 per cent and gas prices have addition to that, water and sewerage rates have costs, such as hospital, dental and pharmaceutical per cent; education costs, such as school fees, and rent by an average of 21 per cent. The thing in pursuing this bill, which the government government wants to introduce a carbon tax minimum of 10 per cent in the first Competition in the energy sector is what burdens on and setting prices through a carbon the key aspects in relation to our energy market generation is owned by state governments. have taken a hit on their bottom line with increasingly difficult, as indeed will private to upgrade. This is not good for the security addressed by the imposition of a carbon tax. I agree with what the shadow minister said, national energy retail law and the other bills Council on Energy.

Putting cost tax will actually reduce competition. One of in Australia is that most of the electrical As the shadow minister said, state governments the devaluation of their assets and will find it existing energy generation, to seek further loans of energy. In fact, competition will not be that as of now, having the effect of this associated with it, what we need to truly NA understand the energy requirements and needs been long talked about but it is much needed. indeed state government instruments any level have a clear understanding across a national what are the impediments, what are the opportunities. to take up the opportunity and spend taxpayers' would probably cost a lot less than the glossy need for a carbon tax, after the Prime Minister funds on political advertising. But the need understand planning and investment and Price, as I have said, is a driver to our the price of electricity, which is the whole the establishment of this carbon tax, by increasing consumption and therefore provide this great Mr Deputy Speaker, that between 2000 and 2008 board rose by 55.9 per cent.

You would think that by just driving up matrix of evaluation that has been incorporated in the cost of energy you would drive down environmental benefit.

So with the great up energy prices to reduce consumption and save the past decade has not delivered that, so I fail carbon will deliver the outcomes. goal: five per cent by 2020.

Both were the subject of competition the energy sector, the Gillard government is Howard government's reform agenda, albeit policy direction to do with the carbon tax. telecommunications there has been a complete government has effectively abandoned competition. where there has been a continued reliance on government building new assets, where companies based upon their current ownership structure rather where existing players have been structurally integrated companies into generation, transmission argument we hear in the telecommunications separation is to build a brand-new company energy sector there has continued to be comparison is not a favourable one.

It is the case that we have somebody who was absolutely true to her vision that she won the inaugural Mosman Art Prize in of painting-in particular, in the latter stages she is so widely appreciated and known-it is a feisty character that Margaret Olley had. It is her contribution and reflect on her life as a to be. As the Sydney Morning Herald said, she appropriate assumption or guess that that is as Australian and has been recognised as for services.
