1,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether the greater part of the military forces quartered at Victoria Barracks, ney, paraded on a recent occasion in protest against the proposed abolition of the canteen, and, if so, whether the Government will do its best to afford information as to the object and character of military canteens as instituted in Australia?",13
2,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I .have no information with regard to the incident referred to, but I shall make full inquiries, and communicate the result to the honourable member, probably tomorrow. NA ARTILLERY.",13
3,Mr WILSON,WARRNAMBOOL FIEL D,"I wish to know whether the Minister representing the Minister of Defence has seen the report which appeared in the Age and Argus today, and the Warrnambool Standard o i yesterday, relating to the proposed course of instruction for the Warrnambool Field Artillery, and whether he will bring under the notice of the Minister the difficulty that will attach to the fulfilment of such a course by men who have to earn their living by daily labour?",13
4,Mr EWING,WARRNAMBOOL FIEL D,"I have not had an opportunity of reading the statements referred to, but I shall bring the whole matter under the notice of the Minister. I am quite satisfied that no unreasonable action will be taken. TRADE WITH SOUTH AFRICA: RECIPROCITY.",13
5,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WARRNAMBOOL FIEL D,"I wish to know whether the attention of the Prime Minister has been directed to the report furnished by the Commercial Agent of New South Wales with regard to reciprocal trade with South Africa, which indicates that everything is in readiness, and that the people in South Africa are merely awaiting action on the part of the Commonwealth. My reason for asking the question is that I received a letter, of which, I think, the Prime Minister has also received a copy, stating that contracts entered into under certain conditions had been cancelled owing to Australian products being subject to a higher duty than similar, goods imported from England under the reciprocity treaty with the mother country.",13
6,Mr DEAKIN,WARRNAMBOOL FIEL D,"The information that I_ have received goes to show .that reciprocity is to be established only under certain Sydconditions. With some of these conditions T am already familiar, but with regard to others a doubt exists, which I am now endeavouring to resolve. I hope that within a week ox ten davs I shall know exactly what are our opportunities in the direction indicated. NA CONFERENCE.",13
7,Mr HUGHES,IMPERIAL SHIPPING,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the importance of uniformity with regard to the legislation which is to be considered at the forthcoming Imperial Conference upon matters affecting shipping, - he will suggest to the Imperial authorities the desirableness of arranging for the representation of Canada and South Africa at the Conference ?",14
8,Mr DEAKIN,IMPERIAL SHIPPING,"I recognise at once the pertinence of the honourable member's suggestion with reference to Canada, which has a very considerable mercantile marine, and also the reasonableness of the proposal that anv legislation agreed to should applv to South Africa, as well as to other parts of the Empire. I shall give the matter my best attention. NA SERVANTS.",14

The honourable member is asked to postpone this question pending the consideration number. of the measure relating to life insurance under the consideration of the Government. 3.

13,Sir JOHN FORREST,LI FE ASSURANCE BY PUBLIC,"Swan-Trea sersurer) [2.39] - This is the second Budget speech that I have had the honour of delivering to this House, but on eleven previous consecutive occasions I discharged a similar duty in the Parliament of the State 1901, which I , in conjunction with other honorwould able members, represent in this House. than Therefore this is the thirteenth time",14
14,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LI FE ASSURANCE BY PUBLIC,Thirtee n is an unlucky number.,14
15,Sir JOHN FORREST,LI FE ASSURANCE BY PUBLIC,"This , there is the thirteenth occasion upon which I have submitted a Budget to a Parliament in Australia. My honourable friends opposite say that thirteen is an unlucky I hope that it will not bring now ill-luck to 'this side of the Chamber. On the eleven occasions on which I preprosented the Budget in the Legislative Asit sembly of Western Australia, the duty I life had to perform was very different from it that which lies before me today. This the Parliament, unlike that of Western Australia, in which I held office, as Premier and Treasurer for over ten years, has not the control of the lands, the mines, nor the railways of Australia, nor can we, unless with the consent of the States,-enter to upon any large schemes of national development. We have no power reserved to us under the Constitution unless with the - consent of the States to undertake any ^beneficent development worko such as the Coolgardie waterworks scheme, the Fremantle harbour works, or railway construction throughout the States such as I used to have the pleasure of proposing in the .State Parliament. The Federal Budget is limited by the Constitution, and during the :first ten years of the life of the Commonwealth it must be limited also - by section .87, popularly known as the - section."" We have full power to impose - taxatiom. but I do not suppose that power - could be popularly exercised unless in the - direction of taxing others than those who so readilv express an opinion upon it. Even if we indulge in Customs and Excise taxation during the continuance Braddon section, we have .£4, when we require 'This disability will pass away at the - end of 1910. Thereafter the power of the Parliament, in regard to the distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue, will be materially extended. I hope, that long before that time arrives, we shall have come to an understanding will be fair and satisfactory - Commonwealth and States. just closed has been a very prosperous one. It was the most prosperous year that we nave had since the establishment of the Constitution. I do not propose to unduly weary honourable members with figures, be-cause they will all be found in the Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure and in the Budget papers. I think it will be found that the Budget papers are full and complete. A great deal of trouble has been taken to make them even more complete than in. former years, our desire being to give as much information as possible on - every relevant subject. In addition to the ordinaxv statistical information with the Estimates, and also with the progress of the Commonwealth, there will be found the full report of a scheme prepared by me. and approved by the Government, for solving the financial problems of the Constitution. That will be found at the end of the Budget papers. the total revenue received was £11.879,343, being an increase of ,£413,745 above that received in the previous year. This increase was made up as follows:-From and .Excise, .£199,955; from the Post Office, .£191,631 : from patents, £13.377 ; and from miscellaneous items, This revenue was collected in the States in Sir John Forrest. the following amounts:-In New South Wales, £ 4 , 3 3 . 7 7 9 > Victoria, £3,292,202 ; I Queensland, .£1,550,025; South Australia, £ 9 8 7 , 6 2 0 ; Western Australia, including £77,666 from its special Tariff, ,£1,286,878; and Tasmania, .£448,839. Dealing with these sums in the order. I have named, I find that the Customs and Excise revenue for 19056, including £77,666 from West""Braddon ern Australia's special Tariff, was £8,999,485 , being an increase of £ i 9 9 , 9 5 5 over the receipts for the previous year, which were £ 8 , 7 9 9 , 5 3 0 . It may be remembered probably by some honourable members that last year's Estimate was based upon a. reduction of £ 6 5 , 0 0 0 of the in the receipts from Western Australia's to raise special Tariff, .£50,000 on sugar and other only £1. reductions, which amounted altogether to £117,000. Notwithstanding these estimated reductions, the result was an' increase of £ \ 9 9 , 9 5 5 on the receipts for the previous year, instead of a decrease of however, £ 1 1 7 , 0 0 0 . It may be remembered, too, that last year we passed an Act to prohibit the which importation of opium. That necessitated both to a loss of £ 2 2 , 0 0 0 to the revenue last year, The year because it was in operation for only a part of the period, but in this year it will involve a loss of £ 6 4 , 0 0 0 . We estimate that the loss will f all upon the States in the following proportions :-Ne w South Wales, , £ 1 6 , 0 0 0; Victoria, £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 ; Queensland, £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 ; South Australia, £ 7 , 0 0 0 ; Western Australia, £ 4 , 0 0 0 ; and Tasmania. .£1,000. I , therefore, estimate that the loss of revenue consequent upon the prohibition of the importation of opium will be £ 6 4 , 0 0 0 during the year. The increase in the revenue from Customs and Excise was arrived at in the following manner. In New South Wales there was connected an increase of £ 2 0 0 , 3 0 5 ; in Victoria, of ,£48,228; in Queensland, of £ 8 7 , 7 6 9 ; and in South Australia, of £9,160-making the total increases in those four States ,£345,462. But there were decreases in two States. In Western Australia there was a decrease on the ordinary account of Last year £ 7 6 . 3 6 8 , and' on the special Tariff account-whic h is being gradually reduced under the sliding scale-of £ 6 4 , 8 8 3 . In Tasmania the decrease was £ 4 , 2 5 6 . So Customs that there were decreases in these two States amounting to .£145,507. Deducting those decreases from the increases in £8,782. the other four States, there is left a total increase of £ 1 9 9 , 9 5 5 . I now come to the Post and Telegraph Department. facts which I shall be able to give to the Committee . in regard to it are very satisfactory. The year has been a very prosperous one. The revenue for 1905-6 amounted to £ 2 , 8 2 4 , 1 8 2, being am increase of £ 1 9 1 , 6 3 1 over the revenue for the previous year, which was ,£2,632,551. The increase was made up as f o l lows : - - In New South Wales the increase was £85,467; in Victoria, £ 5 2 , 0 1 3 ; in Queensland, £ 2 7 , 9 8 1 ; in South' Australia, £ 2 5 , 2 0 8 ; and in Tasmania, ' £ 5 , 8 0 0 . There was an apparent decrease in Western Australia, amounting to £ 4 , 8 3 8 . There were extraordinary payments made during the year 1904-* 5, principally in Western Australia, for savings bank work States, amounting to £ 1 8 , 0 0 0 . this, the total increase on account of the Post and Telegraph Department would have been about £'209,000 instead of £191,631. The revenue from patents last year amounted to £ 2 3 , 9 3 6, being an increase of £ 1 3 , 3 7 7 over the revenue for the previous year, which amounted to £ 1 0 , 5 5 9 . There were also a number of small increases, totalling £8,7'82. The total increase of revenue in 1905-6 over 1904-5 was, as I said before, £413,745. The past is very interesting, but it is not so interesting as the future. We know the past. We have to estimate the future. I therefore have not spent very much time in dealing with the past. Honourable members are aware of what has been going on in this country. An intelligent press takes an immense amount of trouble in placing information before the people of Australia, and that information is constantly being read by honourable members. Returns are published as the year proceeds, and at the end of the year, so that what I have been saying is. to a large extent, contained in information that is generally available; though it was not possible for me to do otherwise than to refer to it again. I now come, however, to estimate the revenue which I anticipate will be received during the present financial year. The revenue of the Commonwealth for 1906-7 is estimated at £11,969,500, being .£90,157 more than we received last year, when we obtained £11,879,343 . I have no doubt that honourable members who haye studied the finances and who are in a position to judge of the future, will think The that the estimated increase of £ 9 0 , 1 5 7 is a very small amount, seeing that: last year it was £ 4 1 3 , 7 4 5 . I may inform honourable members at once that the amount would have been greater, but for a matter I shall refer topresently. The revenue is made upof Customs and Excise, £9,115,000, including ,£15,000 from the Western Australian special Tariff, which comes to anend on the 8th October this yearAfter that date the intercourse between all the States of Australia will be absolutely free. From the Post and Telegraph Department we estimateto receive £ 2 , 8 1 3 , 0 0 0 ; from patents, £ 2 2 , 5 0 0 ; and from miscellaneous sources, £ 1 9 , 0 0 0, making the total revenue for by the 1906-7, as I just now stated, £11,969.500 . But for It is anticipated that the revenue will be , obtained in the several States as follows: - New South Wales, £4,493,409 p Victoria, £3,327,256; Queensland, .£1,502,525 ; South Australia, .£982,473;. Western Australia, including the £ 1 5 . 0 0 0 from the special Tariff, £1,223,082 ; Tasmania. £ 4 4 0 , 7 5 5 ; making the total, as estimated, £11,969,500 . In regard to the Western Australian revenue, the special Tariff expires on the 8th October this year. But I desire to place on record that the special Tariff for that State, up to the 30th June, 1906, realized £ 8 5 2 , 1 8 7, andi it is estimated this year to realise £15,000,. so that the Treasury of Western Australia has, by the provision of section 95 of the Constitution, known as the sliding scale, benefited to the total amount of £ 8 6 7 , 1 8 7. Now that the special Tariff is about to come to an end, I feel that I may congratulate myself on having been the means of, at any rate, helping the Treasury of Western Australia during the last few years.",14
16,Mr MAHON,LI FE ASSURANCE BY PUBLIC,It would have been far better to have had a - transcontinental railwav instead.,16
17,Sir JOHN FORREST,LI FE ASSURANCE BY PUBLIC,"We cannot always iudge correctly, what is for the best: if we were wise men always we should be invariably right. The Customs and Excise revenue for 1906-7 is estimated at £9,115,000, including the special revenue of £ 1 5 , 0 0 0 from Western Australia; and that is £115,515 more than was received*in 1905-6, when the revenue was £ 8 . 0 9 9 , 4 8 5 . If certain sums which, were received last year had been available this, year, the revenue from the Western Australian special Tariff would have been-C62,666 more. In addition, the amount of £ 3 1 , 6 8 8 , 99° Budget. received as a sugar windfall, the result of a decision in a law case, and a further sum of £ 4 2 , 0 0 0 from opium, which, together with the increase of £115,51.5 we are to receive as compared with last year, would have made the total increase for this year £251,869. That is to say, that if we had the sanie conditions in regard to those items as existed last year, the estimated revenue for 1906-7 would have exceeded the actual amount received last year by £ 2 5 ^ , 8 6 9. That is a considerable increase in a year, but I think that the estimate is fully justified, having regard to the .good season in most parts of Australia, though, I am sorry to say, not in every part, because in the north-western part of Australia climatic conditions are not at all favourable this year. In most parts of Australia, however, the season is good, and the prospects have very much improved. I am, sanguine that this estimate, which, if analyzed, will be found to be a liberal one, will be realized. There is a,n important matter to which I should like to refer in regard to the revenue of the different States, and that is the Inter-Stale Customs and Excise adjustments under the Constitution. In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, duties of Customs and Excise are credited to the State in which the dutiable good's are consumed.

The receipts from Customs and Excise per head of population were distributed as follows :-Ne w South Wales, £ 2 3s. 4d'.; Victoria, £ 2 is. 8 d . ; Queensto land, £ 2 4s. iod. : South Australia, 16s. 4 d . ; Western Australia, £ 3 14s. i o d . ; tion of the Commonwealth will Sir John Forrest. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Budget. If duties of Customs and Excise are paid in one State on dutiable articles consumed in another, the State in which the articles are consumed is credited with the revenue. It will be apparent, from the figures before honourable members, that the two great cities of Sydney and Melbourne are, as was naturally to be expected, becoming every year to a greater extent distributing centres for the rest of the States. Owing to their large populations, and the consequent volume of importations, freights from all parts of the world to these centres are necessarily lower than to smaller centres. The result of this has been that during the past financial year, New South Wales 'was debited with £ 1 3 3 , 3 9 6 , and Victoria with £ 3 6 6 , 4 1 1 , making a total of £499,807 on imported dutiable goods transferred to other States for consumption, as against £ 7 5 , 6 0 7 and £ 1 9 6 , 1 52 respectively, or a total of £ 2 7 1 , 7 5 9 in 1902-3. It is therefore, clear, therefore, that, although not very rapidly, a process is going on under which these two great centres of Sydney and Melbourne are gradually increasing as distributors of imported Roods to the rest of Australia. During the past financial year the States credited with the amount debited to New South Wales and Victoria were Queensland, £ 2 1 4 , 3 5 8 ; South Australia. £36,940; Western Australia, £ 1 3 5 , 9 1 7 ; Tasmania, £ 1 1 2 , 5 9 2 ; a total of £499-- °7- 8 INTER-STATE CUSTOMS AND EXCISE ADJUSTMENT.

This return is, of course, approximate, because there has been an increase of population in some of the States, especially in Western Australia, and this fact, combined with others, may, to some extent, influence the present condition of affairs. I now come to a very important matter. It affords me great pleasure to announce that the Government propose to recommend Parliament to establish penny post throughout the Commonwealth and the Empire on the ist October next. We propose to also extend penny postage to all foreign countries that will agree to deliver our letters. My honourable colleague, the Postmaster-General, recommended that the time hxd arrived when this benefit should be accorded to the people, and I am very glad to say that the Government approved of it. As Treasurer, I have satisfied myself that funds are available, and I hope that the amendment of the law necessary to insure the establishment of penny post will be unanimously agreed to by Parliament at the earliest possible moment. My estimate of the post and telegraphic revenue for the current year would have been £ 2 , 9 7 0 , 0 0 0, but, owing to"" provision having to be made for penny post, I have reduced my figures by £157,000 , viz., to £2,81,3,000. My estimate of the loss covers only nine months, because one-fourth of the year will have passed before the reduced postage comes into operation. If the loss extended over the whole year it would, according to my estimate, amount to £ 2 0 9 , 0 0 0 . I may say that my estimate is not so sanguine as that of the Postmaster-General, who will, in a day or two, submit his proposals. The estimated loss of £ 1 5 7 , 0 0 0 for the nine months will be distributed among the States as follows :New South Wales, £ 5 8 , 0 0 0 ; Victoria. £14,000-Victoria , has for some time past adopted the penny postage; Queensland, £29,000; South Australia, £ 2 3 , 0 0 0 ; Western Australia, £ 1 9 , 0 0 0 ; and Tasmania, £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 . It is encouraging to know that penny post has been successful' in all British countries in which it has been tried. I have not recent statistics relatinsr to New Zealand, but I believe that the system has proved very successful there. The penny post was established in Canada in iqoo. and the Minister of Finance, Mr Fielding, speaking on the 22nd May last, said :It is but a few years since Canada had i£d. domestic letter rate and a to Great Britain, and even with these heavy postal rates the Post Office Department absorbed Sir John Forrest. all the revenue it could collect, and at the close of the year some ^120,000 or ^140,000 was usually required from the Public Treasury to make good the deficiency and keep the post office running-w e have no longer a i£d. rateCanada has penny post within her own borders and penny post with the mother country. The Post Office Department no longer absorbs all its own revenue, no longer calls for ^120,000 or ^140,000 from the Treasury. After affording the people a very liberal postal service, after giving reduced rates, after establishing the blessing-for it is not too much to speak of it soof penny post, the Postmaster-General comes, at the close of the year, asking nothing from the Public Treasury, but tenders the splendid sum of J£I8O,OOO to assist the other public services of the country. It was not possible that the different rates of postage existing in the various States could for long continue. It is absolutely inconsistent with the principles underlying Federation that the people of one State should enjoy privileges at the hands of the Government which those of other States are denied, or that the people of the cities and towns should be charged one-half the rate charged to the people in the country. Almost since the establishment of the Commonwealth the people of Victoria have had the benefit of penny postage within their borders, and I believethe people of Victoria would not thinkvery highly of the present Government if we declared that we intended to .level up instead of levelling down in regard to their rate of postage. What would they say if we recommended to equalize the postage rate all over Australia, but, instead of making it a penny, we proposed to make it twopence? I ' am inclined to think (that there would be a howl of oppositionfrom one end of this State to the otherHonorable members will be afforded an opportunity to discuss the details of our proposal within a dav or two. The Postmaster-General has looked into the matter most carefully, and when he introduces! the Bill-whic h he probably will do at once-to authorize the adoption of the penny postage system, he will beprepared to .give honourable members full information in regard to the matters to which I have referred. I need scarcely point out that we alreadv eniov uniform duties of Customs and Excise. Weenjoy uniform telelgraph rates - except in the case of Tasmania - and* we now propose a uniform system of penny postasje, not only throughout the Commonwealth, but throughout the Empire, and"" rate on letters throughout foreign countries which are willing to deliver Australian letters. Upor» this occasion I do not propose to say more than to express my satisfaction that this .great advantage is to be conferred upon everybody in Australia and throughout the Empire. I have no doubt whatever that it will become an accomplished fact, because I believe that honourable members will be only too glad to vote for the adoption of our proposal. I most heartily congratulate my honourable friend and colleague, the Postmaster-General, upon the fact that it is to be accomplished during his term of office, and upon his recommendation. The fact that he has - made such a proposal shows that, after travelling in other parts of the world and rubbing shoulders with men charged with responsibility, he has returned to us more - convinced than ever of the need for this 1 advance in postal facilities for the people. I can assure the representatives of Tasmania that I have always advocated' that we should do all within our power to give - consideration to that State. I recognise that, as one of the smaller States, its Treasury has laboured under difficulties as the result of Federation; and that the revenue it has. received since the - establishment of the Commonwealth is £ 9 9 8 , 1 1 2 below that which it would have received-o n the basis of its returns for 1900-unde r its own Tariff. In these cir-cumstances, I have pleasure in intimating that the Government have decided to re-duce the rate in respect of telegrams to Tasmania from is. 8d. to is. per mes-sage of sixteen words. In order that this - may be done, provision is made on the Estimates for a payment, at the rate of £ 5 , 6 0 0 a year, fo the cable company. We - guarantee the cable company ,£5,600 a year, but no payment has been made under that guarantee since the extra charge of jkl. per word has hitherto been imposed. ""This additional | d . per word-as compared with the rate prevailing in other parts of the Commonwealth-ha s returned more than the guaranteed amount of £ 5 , 6 0 0 . Under - our present proposal, the people of Tasmania will secure that to which they are - entitled. They should have the same concessions, rights and privileges as are given the people in other parts of the Commonwealth with regard, not only to postal and telegraphic communication, but to every other Federal service. think it was ever intended J o differentiate between the States ir. regard to telegraphic - communication. It is an anomaly that - one should be able to send a telegraphic - message of sixteen words from Thursday Island, vid Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth, to Wyndham, Western Australia, a distance of 7,000 or 8,000 miles for is., when a message of the same number of words cannot be sent from 'here to Tasmania for less than is. 8d., owing to the fact that a stretch of 150 miles of sea separates that State from the mainland. I am very glad indeed that this 1 anomaly is to be removed, and that the people of Tasmania will thus be benefited. There will, I believe, be but little loss of revenue consequent upon this change, because the increased traffic as the result of the reduced rate will be sufficient in a year or two to recoup it. I am also glad to say that on these Estimates the Government propose to deal with the increased subsidy of £ 7 , 0 0 0 for the mail service between Melbourne and Launceston, in the same way that we have dealt with other ocean mail services, and that is, to charge the amount - per cafita amongst the States. Prior to Federation New South Wales had a mail service' from Sydney to some of the Pacific islands, and under that contract it paid a few thousand pounds a year-. After Federation the contract was renewed with other conditions, and the extra amount paid was considered as "" o the r "" expenditure, and charned f e r cafita amongst the States. That is exactly analogous to the case of Tasmania. Prior to Federation, that State had a service for which it paid £ 6 , 0 0 0 a year. Since Federation a. contract has been made for £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 a year, and, as in the case of New South Wales, we intend to charge the difference of £ 7 , 0 0 0 as "" o the r "" expenditure f e r cafita. For the future Tasmania will only pay her share f e r cafita of the additional cost of £ 7 , 0 0 0 , and this will also obviate the necessity of making any mileage payment to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, as was done last year. The estimated revenue, as before stated, from the Post and Telegraph Department for 1906-7 is £ 2 , 8 i 3 , o o o . If it had not been for the introduction of penny postage, if would have been £ 2 , 9 7 0 , 0 0 0. The revenue is estimated to be obtained in the following manner :From telegraphs, ,£587,000 : telephones, £382,000; postage, £1,687,000 : and miscellaneous items, £ 1 5 7 , 0 0 0 . If the I do not provision had not been made for a penny post the estimated revenue for the Department would have shown an increase of £ 1 4 5 , 8 1 8 instead of a decrease of £11,182. After making an allowance of £157,000 for the loss of revenue in connection with penny post, it is estimated that the postal revenue for 1906-7 will be contributed by the States as follows:-Ne w South Wales, £1,075,000; £751,000; Queensland, £347,000; South Australia, £284,000; Western Australia, £245,000; Tasmania, £111,000; total, £2,8x3,000. These amounts show an increase on the revenue received for 1905-6 foir New South Wales of £9,382, and - Wales.

Last year the total expenditure was £4,494,841, being £ JIII , 4 3 2 Jess than the Estimate. . The amount which the Commonwealth had a legal right to spend, under the Constitution, was ,£5,324,766, whilst the amount actually expended was .£4,494,841. Consequently, we returned to the States ,£829,925 more than was constitutionally obligatory. In other words, if we had spent that sum of £829,925, which we had a right to do under the Constitution, the States would have received that much less from the Commonwealth. I only mention this to show that the facts do not bear out those charges of recklessness and carelessness which are often levelled against this Parliament by ill-informed people who criticise us. If this House wanted to get kudos for itself by spending as much as it could on necessary works throughout the different States, thereby gaining to some extent the approbation of the people, we could have spent very much more than we did. But, instead of so doing, we havehanded over to the States an immense sum during the pas* f>\ ivears, allowing the States Governments to spend the money, and therebv to gain anv kudos that might be attached to the-expenditure . Mr JosF.ru COOK - We could not. help ourselves.",18
21,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMS AND EXCISE,"I beg the honare orable member's pardon; we could easily have spent the money ourselves. But year we were able, by economy and fulness in our management, to return the States £829,925 more than it was ligatory upon us to return. Therefore, say a.gain, the facts do not bear out criticism often directed against this Parliament. The facts show that this House has always been most economical, and that has at all times given full consideration the interests of the States. I may, however, say that the time is fast approaching when new obligations entailed upon the Commonpenditure only. wealth will make it impossible to return the States more than the three-fourths Customs and Excise revenue to which are entitled under section 87 of the tution. The estimates of expenditure 1905-6 were very closely adhered to, there were underdrafts on various items, none of which were very large, amounting was £318,488, of £ i 5 9 . 7 3 to £161,379 ; and there were overdrafts, amounting to £49,947.

33,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGE OT THE TOTAL RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMS AND EXCISE,"The works for as which the money is proposed to be approtary priated are all necessary. I come now an important matter, in which I , and honourable members generally, take a great interest-the Naval Agreement. Our contion, tribution under that agreement is ,£200,000, while New Zealand contributes another £40,000, so that Australasia pays in ,£240,000 to the Admiralty towards Naval defence. It was understood, when the agreement was made, that the Imperial Government would provide as much that again; but we have been informed by His Excellency thei Admiral that the Admiralty expends on the Ausable tralasian. Squadron between £650,000 £700,000 a year, which' includes 5 per cent, on prime cost, while considerably more expended on the Australian station than the Commonwealth contributes. Of the ships on the station, the Challenger three drill ships carry 461 Imperial that is, men brought from England, 518 Australians and New Zealanders; while, on the 30th June, 1906, there were and the three drill ships. in the Australian Naval Reserve seven offiment cers and 316 men, or 323 altogether. squadron consists at the present time one first-class cruiser, three second class cruisers, and five third class cruisers, one sion. The report deals with our land sloop,, and one surveying vessel. first and second class cruisers, and two the third class cruisers, are in full commisthe siarn, the remaining three third class cruisers being used as drill ships. It is gratifying to know that His Excellency the Admiral has advised the Government that he has received very favourable reports. from his officers as to the intelligence and good behaviour of the men. The enrolment Military of Australians and^New Zealanders began on the ist May, 1904-onl y two years agoand I think that I am justified in saying that our expectations as to the adequate ning of the squadron by Australians and Zealanders will be fully realized. I been informed that there are difficulties the wav of training men here for the ratings, because there are not in. existence in Australia the technical schools necessary The to impart the required knowledge; but these difficulties are likely to be overcome by' sending men to England for instruction in. the same way as officers are being sent. everyThose who desire to remain in the Naval service will have an opportunity to qualify, themselves for the higher ratings by proceeding to England and there undergoing a course of instruction in the same way is provided for the officers of our MiliForces who are sent Home every year.. to In order to make the agreement more workable, we require to have more Australiansand New Zealanders employed on the staand it is also desirable that we should! have more Australian officers on the ships. I have no doubt that these improvementsall will be brought about in due time. The difficulties that had to be surmounted in the beginning are gradually being removed' as we gain experience, and I have no doubtduring the next two years relatively much greater progress will be made thai* hitherto. It must be gratifying to honormembers to know that so many men of and good character are willing to enter the Navy. At the time that'the agreement wasis under consideration, it was feared by some that Australians would not accept servicein the Navy, but that statement has; and been controverted by the fact that: men, already 518 Australians and New Zeaand landers have been enlisted, and are now doing duty on HMS. Challenger The Governhave had under consideration the reThe commendations of the Imperial Defenceof Committee as to the best means of protecting Australia from invasion or aggres1 The forces, and also with our harbour and 1 of coastal naval defence. I regret to say that document is confidential, but the Government hope to be in a position to communicate its contents to the House very shortly. They have taken steps in thedirection of obtaining the necessary authorization. In the meantime, the matter is being: carefully considered by the Naval and' authorities. It is often said that Federation costs an enormous amount, and* in conformity with the practice that has been established, I desire to give honourable manmembers some information. It will New be remembered that at the Adelaidehave Conference it was stated that the exin tra cost of Federation would amount tohigher ,£300,000 per annum. Last year the "" other"" expenditure, as distinguished? tfrom transferred expenditure, amounted '-to ,£827,355. If we deduct from 'that amount the provision made for mew works in the transferred Departments ,£318,488, New Guinea £20,000, sugar bounty and expenses £154,706, ""and the Queen Victoria Memorial £25,000, we arrive at a net amount of £309,161, equal to is. 6d. per head' of the population.

When Federation was established, it was never supposed that such a large amount over and above the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they were entitled would be returned to the States. It was generally felt that the Commonwealth would avail itself of the whole of the income at its command, but that has not been the case.

Honourable members will recollect that amongst bounties which we propose tp offer is one of _-d. a lb. upon canned or tinned fish. That proposal is contained in the Bounties Bill. Provision has been made upon the Estimates for the purchase of a trawler to explore the fishing grounds on the Austablishing tralian coast, and thus assist the industry. Our object' is to encourage the fishing dustry and help our fishermen. The payment of the bounty, we hope, will encourage fishermen to embark capital in the entermate prise. The sum of £8,ooo has been apart for the purchase of a trawler and equipment, and the intention is-as I said before-to explore the fishing grounds along stitution. the coast of Australia. I am quite sure that a good reward awaits our labours that direction. So far, very little in the way of systematic trawling has been undernexion ? taken in Australia, and it seems to me that any expenditure by which new industries may be established is wise. remind honourable members that over £300,000 annually is sent abroad for the thing purchase of preserved fish. As a proof lighthouses. tectionist, I should like to see that sum houses required, There spent in providing employment for the, the Estimates for the expenditure fishermen of Australia. In Great Bri- £1,500 tain, the consumption of fish per head and to collect information regarding the of the population is five times that of. tralia, the reasoni being no doubt that fish is cheaper there than it is here. United States spend £100,000 per num upon their fisheries, whilst Canada has disbursed £600,000 upon fish bounin ties, and an additional £,32,000 annually in assisting the industry. In the country, 80,0,00 persons are employed the fishing industry, and the plant in is valued at £2,000,000. The lobster Sir John Forrest.

38,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"The amount question is to be devoted exclusively to ocean lighthouses. For instance, there is latter a light very much needed upon the Gler.nie in Group, west of Wilson's Promontory. Anuse other small one is urgently required at inPoint St. Albans, in Backstair's Passage, Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Then a lighthouse is needed upon Eclipse Island, lations. near King George Sound, and another is necessary at Point D'Entrecasteaux, beof tween King George Sound ' and Cape Leuwin. No doubt there are some others needed between Wilson's Promontory and Cape York. B.ut those to which I referred I have personal knowledge in gard to, and'they have also been brought under my notice by the captains of mail steamers.

The Government have not yet definitely decided what they intend to do. in this direction during the current year, but we are convinced that this wonderful invention should be utilized by the Commonwealth as it is utilized by other countries, and especially in providing for the protection and safety of shipping. The connection of Australia with New when the facts are known and understood Guinea by this means will at once appeal to honourable members. There we have a settlement containing 642 white residents, men, women, and children, and 375,000 Papuans, and so far there is no ready means of communicating with the mainstocked. land. It seems to me that that fact needs only to be mentioned to show the neduce cessity of establishing communication means of wireless telegraphy with that largely populated country. Then we have to consider the safety of ships approachof ing our shores. The time has almost rived-it will probablv have arrived before the Treasurer has the honour of submitting his next Budget statement-whe n all the mail steamers coming to Australia will provided with wireless telegraphic instalAre we to sit idly by and do nothing in this direction when the safety the lives of our people and of their property may be in jeopardy ? What would happen to any of these vessels if her shaft were broken? It would be absolutely unhave wieldy, and would not be able even to get resteering way on.

44,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"Quite so. Wherever there is no means of communication-eithe r upon land or sea-and the wireless telegraphic system can be brought"" into operation at a much less expenditure than would be involved in the laying of submarine cables or the erection of telegraph lines, we should avail ourselves of it . I now wish to say one or two words in regard to population, and I regret that I have not very satisfactory statement to make concerning its increase throughout the Commonwealth. During the past five years our population has increased by 286,662. That increase is practically accounted for by the excess of births over deaths. During o v e r has the population of last year, and it was conmade up by an excess of births over deaths, amounting to 61,427, and an excess of arrivals over departures of 6,672. The Government, and also the Parliament, I believe, have been very anxious to assist emigrants of the right class to come to Australia. The determination of the Ministry to encourage industries of all kinds, and so to provide remunerative employment for the people, must do good, and I believe""that 1 in the old country and elsewhere, the effect of this policy will be beneficial. The Government have no desire to bring to Australia a number of people to compete in the labour market when it is sufficiently What we desire is to encourage the settlement of our lands, and to inpeople to come here, either with strong by arms and stout will, or with small capital, and to throw in their lot with us in the cultivation of the soil and the establishment manufactures and industries. These twit arenterprises must go together; they are necessarily beneficial to each other. No one can believe that a population of 4,000,000 is sufficient for this vast continent. I am be not carried away by the cry of some oi6 - Budget. [REPRESENTATIVES.] persons that Australia is capable of carrying a population of many hundreds of millions. I know very well that the, interior is arid, and that we have to depend as a rule upon our lands within the influence of rivers running down to the coast, and also upon our mineral resources. There is no doubt a great deal to be done in this direction, but it will not be accomquote plished by our remaining idle and failing to attack the question. We know what we need. We require an increased population, and we need a population, of a certain kind. We do not want the. dregs of other lands. We need the young and the enterprising, and if we set about the work of encouraging immigration in a proper way, I am sure we shall find our wishes capable of realization. We can do very little without the co-operation of the States. They have the land, the mines, and the means of transit, and if they can be brought into line and will work with the Government, we are willing to - co-operate with them in the most generous manner with a view to encouraging population to settle Australia. The Government have endeavoured to do something in this direction, but the results are for the future. A sum of ,£5,000 has been placed on the Estimates to enable us to advertise for and secure suitable immigrants. We think that if we established a central office in London, in which all the States would be represented by their agents, it would work well. If the scheme for solving the financial problem which I have placed on the table today be adopted, immigration will be one excellent object to which to apply the proceeds of a specific Customs and Excise tax, and if the States would co-operate with us, I believe that good results would follow Under this plan the immigrants could be selected by the Commonwealth in concert with the States and landed in Australia, where required by the States, who would provide for their reception, employment, or settlement. The Commonwealth could arrange with, the immigrant, but no direct pense would be imposed on the State until the immigrant arrived in Australia. Until he lands in Australia it should be a Commonwealth! matter, so far as is consistent with State assistance in choosing immigrants. After the immigrant lands, the States would alone deal with him, and find him his home. Under the proposals I have submitted, it is not intended that the bookkeeping system should be continued after the 31st December, IQTO ; but during the existence of the bookkeeping system each State would have to Budget. pay the whole or part of the passage-money of immigrants landing on its shores; but when the bookkeeping'system comes to an end, or if an arrangement were made before that time with the States, the Commonwealth would be alone responsible. I have already referred to the position of Papua, and I should like at this stage to a few statistics for the information of honourable members. The estimated revenue of Papua for 1906-7 is £ 3 8 , 3 6 3 . The Commonwealth makes an annual grant of ,£20,000, and the Customs revenue amounts to £ 1 5 , 2 0 0, so that this leaves only £ 3 , 1 6 3 to be obtained from all other sources.' In looking through these figures, it has occurred to me that with Papua, as yet, it is the ,day of small things. It would be not only satisfactory, but little short of marvellous,- if we could control the Territory and do our duty in respect of 375,000 natives for less than £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 a year. The estimated expenditure for Papua for 1906-7 is £39,113) and of this £'6,000 represents expenditure on the Merrie England. The white population, according to the latest statistics I have been able to obtain, consists of 500 males and 142 females, making a total of 642. Of this number 48 are male officials. The black population is roughly estimated at 375,000. The imports for 1904-5 were of the value of £ 6 7 , 1 8 8 , the principal imports being:-Foodstuffs , ; £ 3 > ° 9 5 ; building material, £ . 3 , 0 9 2 ; to2 bacco, £ 6 , 1 0 2 ; wines and.spirits, .£3*555i drapery and clothing, £ 7 , 8 9 3 ; machinery, £2,012; hardware and ironmongery, £ ' 6 , 5 2 6 ; boats and launches, . £ 4 3 0 ; and miscellaneous, £ 1 4 , 4 8 3 . The principal exports consisted of gold valued at - £ 5 J 3 ; sandalwood, £'71873; 6 6 2 and copra, £ 5 , 6 7 1 . Miscellaneous exports were valued at £ 6 , 5 2 9 , making a total of £.76,435. It would seem that such a large population should be able to provide labour for industries, and to make Papua flourishing and prosperous. The ex- country must be fairly good to be able to sustain such an immense population, and I think that, with a wise and liberal expenditure, very good results would be obtained. But we have spent very little money yet on public works. We need to cut tracks and roads through the country. It is of no use for any one to think that we can colonize and properly settle this immense Territorv without expending a considerable sum. It is impossible to bring an estate into cultivation and establish farmers thereon unless a considerable expenditure is made for that purpose. In Papua I believe a great deal of the country is jungle, and the means of getting from one place to another, except by narrow paths, is very difficult. What we ought to do-that is, if we take a real interest in the matter-is to spend a hundred thousand pounds in opening up, and making the Territory self-supporting and prosperous. The pastoral industry in Australia is flourishing. The value of wool produced last year was £20,125,900, being the largest amount that has ever been received. The sheep increased in number from 65,822,000 in 1904 to 74,706,000 ir. 1905,-' being an increase of 8,882,755 in twentv-one months. It is a splendid record that in a period of three vears and nine months, sheep have increased ir. number by 22,000,000. Australia had her largest number of sheep in 1891, namely, 1.06,000,000. We.require an increase of 32,000,000 sheep to equal that number. But I am glad to say that'the return from sales of wool was greater from 74,000,000 sheep in 1905 than from 106,000,000 sheep in 1891. very .satisfactory indeed. When in London a short time ago, I made some inquiries concerning the question of silver coinage and currencv. Judging from the interviews I had with the Imperial Treasury officials, there is no desire to' prevent Australia from having a coinage of her own if that is desired. Their wish is to meet our desire, and I think that we should have probably had a communication to that effect if there had no.t been a change of Government in England.",36
45,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,They have already made a communication.,38
46,Sir TOHN FORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"I mean not the present Government, but the previous one.",38
47,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,The previous Government made a communication.,38
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"The question was not settled. Some communication from this Government was not answered at the time the change of Government occurred, but the question was almost decided. I had a conversation on the subject with Mr Austen Chamberlain, late Chancellor of the Exchequer. When a scheme to allow Australia to do just what she liked in the matter was placed before Mr Austen Chamberlain for approval, he said that he wished to have a little"" more time in which to consider it, because he desired to ascertain whether there was not some other means by which Australia could be satisfied, without establishing a system of coinage different from that existing in the mother - country. I was assured by those with whom I conversed that the question of securing .the profit or. the silver coinage for Australia does not influence the decision, and that the Imperial Government is quite willing that any profit which accrues from such coinage should go to Australia. There are, however, other questions in connection-with the maintenance of gold to be considered. The result of rriy interviews was communicated on my return from London to the Prime Minister in the following terms: In regard to silver coinage the difficulties in the way are :(a) The Treasury officials fear that the withdrawal of a larger value per annum than j£ioo,ooo would result in considerable loss, and even at that rate it would take twenty years to withdraw the ^2,000,000 of silver in circulation in Australia. The continuance of two silver coinages in circulation during that period would be unsatisfactory. (*) The maintenance of the gold coinage of Australia at its full standard weight, which is now borne by the Imperial Mint, would, if the existing silver That is currency were withdrawn, become a burden on Australia, and it would have to be ascertained and decided as to how much of that coinage the obligation would rest upon. But in addition to the foregoing considerations is the question as to whether the establishment of a different silver currency might not be in the direction of widening rather than tightening the bonds of Empire. Such a currency would require very careful watching to avoid its being either depreciated by reason of an excess issue of silver, or the public being inconvenienced through an inadequate quantity being in circulation, the difficulty being increased by reason of the smallness of the population. It was, therefore, thought worthy of consideration whether some other means could not be devised other than establishing a distinct and separate silver currency. There would appear to be no likelihood of the United Kingdom establishing decimal currency in the near future, and the general opinion expressed was to the effect that any interference with the value of the people's penny would lead to widespread dissatisfaction and resentment. . Having regard to the foregoing considerations, it was agreed that the question of silver coinage and decimal currency should be one of the subjects to be submitted to the Imperial Conference to meet in London next year, and in the meantime fuller consideration could be given to the question.",38
49,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"I think that the Minister is mixing the question of coining, our own silver.and the question of establishing a different currency.",38
50,Sir JOHNFORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"I do not think so. I now come to a very important matter, and that is the position of the sugar industry. The determination of the Commonwealth to make a great effort and monetary sacrifice in order to maintain the "" White Australia "" policy appears to have been thus far very successful. The amount payable in bounties is increasing. This year provision is made for the payment of £ 2 7 8 , 5 0 0 , which represents a production of 139,000 tons of sugar, as against a production of 69,000 tons last year. At first I hesitated to accept the departmental estimate. It is estimated! to make an immense increase - from 69,000 tons to 139,000 tons produced by white labour in one year. But I have been assured that the estimate is based upon probabilities, and I have accepted it. mated that the acreage of sugar-cane cultivated by white labour this year will be 116,750 acres, and that the area cultivated by black labour will be 37,150 acresmaking ,a total of under cultivation. The production this year is estimated to be-suga r produced by white labour, 144,236 tons, and sugar produced by black labour, 54,614 tons; making the total production 198,850 tons. I think that if that estimate, which has been obtained after a good dteal of trouble and care, is borne out at the end of the year, and if we produce 144,236 tons of sugar by white labour, the result cannot but be regarded as very satisfactory ioxdleed. The number of sugar-cane growers in Queensland employing white labour in 1902 was 1,521. It is estimated that at the end of 1906 the number of growers employing white labour will be 3,393, making an increase in four years of 1,872 growers employing white labour. On the other hand, in 1902 the growers in Queensland employing black labour numbered 975, and in 1906 they numbered 837, showing a. decrease of growers employing black labour of 138, In New South Wales in 1902 there were 1,005 growers of sugar by white labour, and ira 1906 there were 1,450, showing an increase in the four years of 445 farmers employing white labour. In 1902 there were in New South Wales 115 growers employing black labour, and in 1906 there were 110. the four years there has been a decrease of five farmers in New South Wales who employ black labour. It is estimated that at the end! of 1906 there will be 4,843 growers of sugar-cane by. white labour in the Commonwealth, as compared with 947 growers employing black labour. have been taken during the year to find > out how many persons are employed in the sugar industry. The Customs authorities have obtained information that on the 31st of December, 1905, there were 20,162 white persons so employed. That is a very satisfactory statement to be able to> make, and a fine result to have attained. There were only 8,452 coloured persons employed in the industry. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - That is in the industry as a whole; not merely in growing.",38
51,Sir JOHNFORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"In the sugar industry, taking into consideration everything connected with it . The total number of persons employed in the industry at the date mentioned was 28,614. There were 17,937 white persons earning bounty; and there were 2,225 white perI t is esti- sons and 8,452 coloured persons who were not earning the bounty. In regard to cultivation, since 1904, and up to the end of 1906- a period of two years-it is estimated that the area cultivated by white 153,900 acres men will have increased in Queensland from 45,424 acres to 96,000 acres-a n increase of 50,576 acres. The figures with regard to cultivation in New South Wales are hot so satisfactory. In the same two years it is estimated that the increase will be from 19,114 acres to 20,750, an increase of only 1,636 acres. The total increase in the area cultivated by white men in the Commonwealth in the last two years amounts to 5^,212acres. During the same two yearsthe area cultivated by black labour decreased in Queensland from 74,375 acres to 35,000, a decrease of 39,375 acres; and in New South Wales the area cultivated by black labour decreased from 2,411 acres to2,150- a decrease of 261 acres. The total decrease in acreage where black labour was. employed in the two years was 39,636 acres. That result is most satisfactory. I never expected to have such satisfactory figures to convey to honourable members in regard to the policy which we have been trying to carry out. Since 1902- a period of four years-the estimated production of sugar by white labour increased in Queensland from 12,254 tons to 125,000 tons-ar t increase of 112,746 tons.",39
52,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"Why ""estiSo that in mated "" ?",39
53,Sir JOHNFORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"I cannot speak of these figures as actually realized, because the period is not yet complete. They cover the period from 1902 to the 31st of"" December, 1907. The figures have beendefinitely ascertained up to the 31st DecemSteps ber, 1905, but I wish to give the definite and the estimated figures together. Irr Queensland, as I have said, the increaseamounts to 112,746 tons. In New South Wales, however, it is estimated that the production by white labour will have decreased from 19,434 tons to 19,236 tons.",39
54,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,That is a very good thing. There will be less bounty to pay* and the persons are more profitably engaged.,40
55,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"The result is - not so satisfactory as the honourable member supposes, because we shall be paying bounties andi getting very little in return. The total increased production by white labour in the four years is estimated at 112,548 tons. During the same period the estimated production by black labourin Queensland has decreased from 65,581 tons to 53,000 tons-that is to say, by 12,581 tons ; while in New South Wales, it has, I regret to say, increased from 1,526 to 1,614 tons, or, in other words, by 88 tons. There has been a total decrease of 12,493 tons of production by black labourin four years. Honourable members are aware that, under - section 87, known as the Braddon section, of the Constitution, the Commonwealth receives one-fourth of the excise revenue. At present, the excise is £ 3 per ton, and therefore, the Commonwealth receives 15s. per ton, and has to pay £ 2 per ton as ""bounty, losing thereby £ 1 5s. on every ton produced by white labour.",40
56,Mr FRAZER,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,Is the excise not £ 4 ton' ?,40
57,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"That excise will begin to operate at the beginning of next year. Making the payment a bounty instead of a rebate-whic h was done by Act some time ago-ha s resulted in the Commonwealth receiving 15s. for every £ 2 it has to pay, out of its one-fourth of the - Customs and Excise revenue, on every ton of sugar produced by white men. the ist January, 1907, the excise will be increased to £ 4 a ton and the bounty to .£3 a ton. The Commonwealth's one-fourth - of the £ 4 excise will be £ i , and the bounty to be repaid will be £ 3 , so that the Commonwealth, out of its one-fourth, will have to pay £ 2 more than is received. While the States revenues will receive £ 3 out of NOTE Drawbacks and Refunds have been deducted, Year. 1902-3.. . 83,822 1903-4 80,586 1904-5.. 29,147 1905-6.. 18,221 1906-7 (Estimate) 17,000 the £ 4 excise, the Commonwealth will have to pay the bounty of £ 3 , and thus lose £ 2 on every ton produced by white labour.",40
58,Mr GLYNN,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"Possibly , it does not matter much to the States in the long run, because the balance is not much upset by the change to a bounty.",40
59,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"The honourable and learned member may be speaking offhand, but I am sure he will realise that it is becoming a heavy charge against the one-fourth received by the Commonwealth from Customs and Excise.",40
60,Mr GLYNN,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"Not in the aggregate, though it makes a difference to some States.",40
61,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"This does not appear to be a good bargain or a profitable arrangement for the Commonwealth, and the matter must receive consideration with a view to making, if possible, the payment a rebate, or otherwise the Commonwealth's one-fourth may not be able to bear the charge. The bounty payments are attaining large proportions. In 1902, the bounty paid to Queensland was £ 2 4 , 4 9 3 , a r , d to New South Wales it was £ 3 6 , 3 3 3 , or a total of £ 6 0 , 8 2 6 . It is estimated that in '1906-7^ per the bounty paid to Queensland will amount to £ 2 4 0 , 0 0 0 , and to New South Wales to £ 3 8 , 5 0 0 , a total of .£278,500, showing an increase of £ 2 1 7 , 6 7 4 in four years. It is estimated that the bounty paid to canegrowers by the end of 1906-7, including .£ 5>537 a* the expense of supervision, 2 will, in Queensland, amount to £ 5 3 2 , 8 2 6 , and in New South Wales to £ 1 9 2 , 3 5 8, a total of £ 7 2 5 , 1 8 4 .

In New South Wales it is estimated that by the end of 1906 the sum of £ 1 9 2 , 3 5 8 will have been paid in bounties, including expenses. I regret to say that the payment of this large amount has not resulted in an advance of white employment or of much increased cultivation-it is an absolute present to the cane-growers of New South.

Wales is that bounties must be general, and, therefore, all sugar-growers have to participate. I think that some of the representatives of Queensland and New South Wales who object to those States assisting in great national works in other States may fairly be astked to remember that other States are willingly paying immense sums in order to carry out a great national policy in this direction.",41
63,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,The other States are not paying immense sums in New South Wales. It must be remembered that some of the New South Wales members opposed the bounty.,41
64,Sir TOHN FORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"The sums paid are immense for small States like Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia.",41
65,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,Some of the destrongest opponents of the bounty were New South Wales members.,41
66,Sir JOHNFORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,I am only stating a fact.,41
67,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,But the fact I have mentioned should also be remembered.,41
68,Sir JOHN FORREST,THE STATES TREASURERS WITH THE AMOUNTS WHICH,"If we regard the position of the whole question of sugar growing by white labour, I think there is good cause fojr satisfaction. When the policy, was introduced many qi us, and I , amongst the number, had great doubts as to whether white men would be able to work in this industry in the tropics. I had had some experience in the north-west .tropical parts of Western Australia, but, so far as can be gathered from the figures, it seems that the policy established has beer. ,thus far absolutely successful. It may be that finality has not been arrived at in dealing with this question, but I think we may all look' to time and experience to finally place the question in a satisfactory position. The next question associated with the sugar industry is the repatriation of the Kanakas, which has to take place almost immediately. I know I am only expressing the wish of 'the Government and of every member of this Parliament when I say that we all hope the greatest care will be taken in returning these men to their own country - that every kindness and consideration will be shown, and that every hardship that it is possible to avoid will be avoided. The Government have provided £25,000 for the purpose of the repatriation. The Queensland Commission, which recently sat, estimated the cost of the deportation at £53,454. The members of the Commission state that there are 5,280 islanders liable to be returned, and they anticipate that not more than 4,500 will be deported. The Pacific Islanders' Fund, of which we have heard so much from time to time, and which is in the Queensland Treasury, has, I am informed, only £10,619 t 0 'estimated that, of the 4,500 who are likely - to be deported, 900 will be sent away by the end of the year, and the remainder as soon as possible thereafter. The deportation of these Kanakas is a part of the White Australia policy, and must be persevered with. I am glad to be able to inform honourable members that satisfactory communications are going on with the Queensland Government for joint action in carrying out the law in this respect. I come now to a very important matter, the external trade of the Commonwealth. I refer, not to the Inter-State trade, but to the trade in imports and exports with countries beyond the seas. The value of our imports has not greatly varied during the last three years. In 1903 it amounted to £38.8^5,682. The value of our imports in 1905"" is much about the same, the value of imports free of duty amounting to ,£14,072,061, and of dutiable goods to £24,274,670, or a total of £38,346,731. The figures show that 36.70 per cent, of our imports consisted of articles free of duty, while 63.30 consisted of dutiable articles. In 1900, the year before Federation, the value of our exports was £45,956,882; in 1905 the value of our exports had increased to £56,841,035, an increase in five years amounting to ,£10,884,153. The value of our imports per head of population for last year amounted to £ 9 9s. 3d., and of our exports to £ 1 4 os. 6d., making the total trade of Australia per head of population ,£23 9s. 9d. I have prepared the following table of imports for 1:905, showing the value of the imports received under - each ad valorem percentage, under the fixed duties exclusive of narcotics and stimulants and from narcotics and stimulants, with the amount of duty paid under each 1 head: Ad valorem.

Our trade with foreign countries during 1905 increased to the extent of 2.75 per cent. In 1905 our trade with the United Kingdom was 52.29 per cent.,<=- British Possessions 18.81 per cent., and with foreign countries 28.9 per cent., so that our trade with the United Kingdom and British Possessions 1'ast year was about 71 per cent., as against about 29 per cent. with foreign countries. Our whole trade, in cluding imports and exports, in 1901, was, with the United Kingdom 54.74 per cent., British Possessions 18.20 per cent., foreign countries 27.06 per cent. The division of - trade is practically the same now, although the movement is towards an increase in the trade with foreign countries. ten years ago, the percentage of imports was - From the United Kingdom 71.61, from British Possessions 11.46, and from - Capitals PrincipalTowns* 'Country Total 1,491,763 1 * Includes 12 towns in Now South Wales, 7 towns in Victoria, un Western Australia, and S towns in Tasmania.

Dealing with, the Inter-State trade, I may :say that it amounted last year in value to £37>6i3>75o. I have prepared a table which shows the value of goods imported by each State from all the other States, and also of goods exported from - each State to the other States, with the balance in each case. From this return, it will be seen that Queensland sends to the New South Wales Victoria - South Australia Western Australia - Queensland Tasmania Total - Queensland sends away £8,480,764 to other States, and receives only ,£3,535,695 back. Tasmania sends away £3,239,441, and receives back only £1,913,629. The - other four States do the opposite. I come now to a very important matter, and that is to my recommendations with regard to the financial problems of the Commonwealth under the Constitution. I am .glad to say that I have been able to submit these recommendations with the full concurrence of my colleagues in the - Government. The desire of the Government is to act as far as possible in accord with the wishes of the 'States. When I became Treasurer, I felt that it was my duty not to follow, but to endeavour to lead, in this - crucial matter. I felt that it was the duty of the Commonwealth Government, and, If with all diffidence I mav sa>v so, the - duty c*f Parliament as well to lead the way rather than to leave it to others to discover a suitable road. Acting upon this ciple, the Government have taken the responsibility of propounding a scheme with that object in view. I do not for a moment say that we have arrived at finality, or that the scheme I have propounded, and which has been approved by other States goods to the value of £8,480,764, and receives from them goods to the value of .£3,535,695. Tasmania sends to the other States goods to the value °f £3> 39>44 > d receives from them 2 I a n goods to the value of £1,913,629. The figures for the other four States tell in the opposite way.

But I do say that I am convinced that the plan I have proposed is a good one, that it will meet the circumstances, and give satisfaction, not only to the Commonwealth, but also to the States. It is a difficult matter with which to deal, as we have to continually keep in mind the terms of the Constitution, the interests of the Commonwealth, and the interests of the States. These three considerations must be constantly borne in mind, and I felt that it would be of no use to propound a scheme unless I were fairly certain that it would be acceptable to the people. It would be most undesirable, as well as difficult, to attempt to force upon the country the viewsof the Government or even of Parliament. The desire of the Government is to arrive at a fair and reasonable arrangement with the States, and the best way to begin is to propound and recommend, as has been done, a scheme, to prin- be criticised by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and of the States and by the people of Australia. It is not expedient that the Government should hesitate to take the lead in this matter. Nearly six vears have passed since Federation was 1 inaugurated, and that time has been fully. occupied in arranging the various Departments of Government and passing the laws necessary to give effect to the constitutional changes involved. three Conferences of Premiers have been held in which this question has beer, raised, and, although some advance has been made towards a settlement, there is yet no finality. In four years' time-o n the 31st December, 1910-sectio n 87, the Braddon clause, becomes alterable. liament will then have the responsibility of deciding what amount of surplus Customs and Excise revenue shall be returned to the several States, and on what basis the return shall be made. I do not fear that the States will suffer injustice under this arrangement. This Parliament represents the people of the States, and will, I feel sure, always recognise the obligations and responsibilities of the States Governments. They have to carry out great works in settling people on the land, in building railways, providing water supplies, and giving all the other facilities which are required for the settlement and inprovement of the condition of the people, the provision of which does not come within the province of the Commonwealth. My confidence is somewhat shaken, however, when I notice that resolutions have been passed in Conference and in Parliament asking for a per capita distribution, under which the State of which. I am a representative would suffer a loss Of about' £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. But, .although I have never seen any disposition on the part of the members of itHis Parliament to act - otiher than fairlv and generously to the several States, I recognise that it is not right that the financial position of the States should be uncertain or unsafe, and dependent upon the annual votes of this Parliament. We should, therefore, begin to prepare at once fori the time when the. Braddor.' provision will become alterable. I felt, on taking office as Treasurer, that the question was one of the chief obligations resting upon me, and have kept it in view ever since, and I went to London specially to obtain information i i i regard to the matter. In considering it . I have tried to meet the views expressed by the Premiers of the States - in Conference at Hobart, and to complv as nearly as possible with the terms of the Constitution. The proposals submitted have, as I have alreadv Sir John Forrest. said, received the approval of the Government, as a scheme most likely to meet with the support of those best acquainted with Still, our constitutional and financial circumstances, and honourable members will find in the Budget papers the full proposals, with complete returns and tables which will be found useful in thoroughly investigating the position. The proposals of the Government embrace the taking over of the Par- 'debts of the States, the amount of the debts to be so taken over, the continuance of section 87, the Braddon section, the amount and basis of the annual paymenrs to the States-, the bookkeeping system, the future borrowing by the States, some concluding remarks and a summary. I do not intend to deal with the scheme in detail now, as the full report is submitted for the information of honourable members. I have not consulted any one outside Australia in regard to matters between the Commonwealth and the States, because I am of opinion that those who possess full information and local knowledge are better able to deal with ihetn than any one else. But, with regard to the taking over of the States debts and the substitution .of Australian stock for the States' stock now existing, I /felt that great financial authorities in England could give valuable information, and I was not disappointed. Amongst those whom I had the privilege of consulting were the governor, deputy-governor, and officers of the Bank of England, the directors and officers ofi the London and Westminster Bank, the brokers for those banks, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the permanent Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Sir Edward Hamilton. I also had the honour of an interview with Lord Goschen, who, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, carried out the great scheme under which nearly ,£600,000,000 worth of British stock wasi converted. In adjdition to having a long interview with Lord Goschen, I had a number of interesting conversations with Sir Edward Hamilton, who was his right-hand man throughout the negotiations referred to,, and who was then, as he is now, the principal financial Secretary to the Treasury. I ' also had the pleasure of meeting Lord Revelstok'e, one of the governors of the Bank of England, and the head of the firm of Messrs. Baring Brothers. The conclusions I have arrived at after carefully considering the opinions expressed by those whom I have had the privilege of consulting are contained in a memorandum I addressed to the Prime Minister as follows :Commonwealth Treasury, Melbourne, 9th July, 1906. The Honourable the Prime Minister. On the 25th September last I submitted to you a memorandum (copy herewith) after setting forth, more fully than I had in the Budget Speech of the 22nd. gust, my views in regard to the annual returnof Surplus Revenue to the States, and the extension of Section 87 (the Braddon Clause) of the Constitution. 2. Since that time, having given attention to the subject, I now venture to submit the result, in the hope that it may not only be useful in arriving at the best means of dealing with the important matter of the taking over by the Commonwealth of the State Debts, but also in dealing with, the otherfinancialproblems of the Constitution. 3. I propose to deal with the whole subject under the following heads:A - Takin g over the States Debts. B - Amoun t of State Debts to be taker. over.

During my recent visit to London I had the opportunity of consulting leading financiers and directors of financial institutions, as well as the Permanent Financial Secretary and other officials of His Majesty's Treasury, and the result of such consultations fully satisfies me that it would be financially advantageous to Australia if the transfer of the State Debts to the Commonwealth, as authorized and' intended by Section 105 of the Constitution, were undertaken as soon as possible; ar.d further, I was assured that such proposals to transfer would be well received in financial circles in London. 5. It is not reasonable to suppose that any single State of the Commonwealth can for long be able to either raise, redeem, or convert loans on such favourable terms as the [7T] Commonwealth, with its exclusive powers of taxation through Customs and Excise, and with the security behind it of the whole of Australia. Those who argue that State securities are likely to continue to be as valuable as Commonwealth securities, take a very sanguine, and, I think, not well founded, view of the situation. 6. The conclusions I have arrived at carefully considering the opinions exdone pressed by those whom I have had the of Auprivilege of consulting are(1) That by having one denomination of stock firmly established on the London market, secured on the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth, a considerable advantage and saving to Australia must eventually result. (2) That a favourable opportunity for the establishment of Commonwealth Stock would be at a time when a considerable amount of State Stocks was within a reasonable period of maturity. (3) That as the existing State Stocks from time to time are approaching maturity, provision should be made for their conversion or redemption (or in some cases, of such portion as is not provided for by a sinking fund) by the issue of Stock secured upon the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth, to be called ""Australian Consols."" (4) That such Stock should be issued at 3 per cent, interest per annum for a fixed! term of, say, thirty years, but interminable after the expiration of that term except at the option of the Government, on giving six months' notice to the holder. (5) That until "" Australian Consols "" are firmly . established on the London market and become popular (which it is anticipated would soon be the case) it is inadvisable to proceed with conver: sion of State Stocks until they are approaching towards maturity. (6) That "" Australian Consols "" would in time (if not immediately) command a higher price than State Stocks of the same denomination and currency, and it that so soon as that takes place conversion on terms favourable to the Commonwealth would no doubt be found to be advantageous, and consequently would be desired by' existing Stockholders. (7) That upon all ""Australian Consols "" issued for the conversion or redemption of State Stocks or Otherwise, a sinking fund of not less than \ per cent, per annum should be provided; and such sinking fund, together with all net interest arising from its investment, should be vested in trustees for the purposes of the final redemption of such Stock. Any existing sinking funds in connection with any of the State debts taken over by the Commonwealth, should, subject to the existing trusts in each case, become the property of the Commonwealth, but solely for the purposes of such trusts and the redemption of such debts. (8) That all net profits arising from any conversion or redemption of existing loans should be credited by the Commonwealth to the State concerned, and the annua! payment by that State reduced accordingly from time to time 7. Nothing in the foregoing proposals would in any manner affect the indemnity given to the Commonwealth by the States under Section 105 of the Constitution, but it would be advisable for each State to pass a special permanent appropriation providing for the payment to the Commonwealth from time to time of any deficiency that might arise. I would, however, particularly point out that for many years to come, under the plan proposed, the Commonwealth would have ample funds in hand belonging to each State to fulfil its obligations in this respect to each State (vide Tables C and D, herewith, showing approximately what would be the position at the end of 192.0. B - AMOUN T OF STATE DEBTS TO BE TAKEN OVER. 8. I recommend that legislative provision 1 be made for taking over by the Commonwould wealth of the whole of the existing State Debts, which amounted ir_< the aggregate on 30th June, 1905, to £236,680,1.39 ; but, as by Section 105 of the Constitution Sir John Forrest. the State Debts "" as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth,"" which on the same date amounted to ,£201,983,386 (vide Tables D and F herewith), can be legally dealt with, and, as it must take some time to obtain an amendment of the Constitution, I advise that the legislation should provide for dealing with the £201,983,386 at once, and that the balance °f £34>697»353 be dealt with so soon as the required amendment of the Constitution is obtained. By adopting this course the conversion or redemption of loans approaching maturity could be dealt with at once by the Commonwealth. The procedure and conditions of taking over the State Debts to Le as follows:(1) That a law be passed enabling the whole of the State Debts to be converted before maturity, or redeemed at maturity by the Com-, monwealth (subject in regard to . debts incurred since ist January, 1901, to the necessary amendment qf the Constitution), by such successive operations as may be thought fit. ' (2) That until conversion or maturity of the State Debts, as the case may be, each State continue to pay its own annual interest and sinking fund (if any). - (3) That on conversion or at maturity of the State Debts, as the case may be, the Commonwealth become solely liable for the annual payment of interest and sinking fund as well as for the redemption of the Stock. (4) That the Commonwealth deduct each year from the amount to be paid to each State the expenditure made on behalf of that State for interest and sinking fund, and, if such amount is insufficient in any case, the deficiency be paid to the Commonwealth by that State. The financial authorities whom I consulted in London were unanimous in the opinion that it would be disadvantageous to place the Commonwealth brand on State Stocks before conversion, as such action prevent the possibility of any profitable conversion,, and would be making to the existing holders a present of any increase in price caused by the additional only Commonwealth security. C - CONTINUANC E OF SECTION 87 Braddon Clause). 9. Under Section 87 of the Constitution, known as the "" Braddon Clause,"" it is provided that "" during a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until' the Parliament oherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure."" It is not generally realized that this section, which was intended for the financial protection of the States, has never yet come into practical operation, as the Commonwealth has not expended in any year by a considerable sum the one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue it was entitled to expend. ,10. I do not recommend the continuance of this clause beyond the 31st December, 191 o, the date on which it becomes alterable, as provided' by Section 87 ; indeed, if the States would agree, I should advise, in the interests of both Commonwealth and States, its repeal at once and the substitution of a plan by which a specified annual payment should be made to the States. During its continuance it has never been of any advantage to the' States, while it has hampered the Commonwealth and prevented it dealing with important questions of policy. The one fact that if additional revenue were required from Customs and Excise, whether for general or specific purposes, it would be necessary to raise four times as much as was required, shows the unpractical character of such a provision, and renders its permanent continuance impossible. For instance,, if , say, an additional million were required from Customs and Excise for general purposes, it would necessitate raising four millions; or, if an additional million were required for a specific purpose, such, for instance, as for Immigration, Defence, or Old-age Pensions, and a special Customs tax were imposed on certain articles with the object that the proceeds should be ""ear-marked"" for such specific purpose, it would be necessary to raise four millions instead of the one million required. Such a procedure is impracticable. A periodical adjustment on the basis of a proportionate return of the whole of the net revenue from Custom's and Excise suffers from the same difficulty, as it would practically prevent additional revenue being obtained from Customs and Excise for any [71]- 2 °i5 (The general or specific purpose without compelling the Commonwealth to raise four times as much as was necessary. D - AMOUNT AND BASI S OF ANNUA L PAYMENT TO THE STATES. 1 1 . Realizing fully, therefore, that a return by the Commonwealth to the States of a fixed proportion of the whole Customs and Excise revenue annually received would leave the States in a position of uncertainty as to the amount they would annually receive, and would also be embarrassing to the Commonwealth, I am convinced that the most satisfactory solution of this question would be that the Commonwealth should undertake to make to the States annually a specified fixed payment, with an additional annual payment should the total net revenue from Customs and Excise increase, and that the whole of any additional revenue derived from any new - or existing items of duties from Customs and Excise which may be levied after 31st December, 1910, and appropriated for a specific purpose may be ""ear-marked "" and retained by the Commonwealth solely for such purpose. 12. The effect of this plan would be that the Commonwealth, having arranged its taxation so as to provide sufficient funds to pay annually the required contribution to the States, and also sufficient to provide for all its own general and special expenditure, would then be free from any further financial obligation to the States. The States, on the other hand, would be free from uncertainty as to the amount they were to annually receive from the Commonwealth, while both Commonwealth and States would know their exact financial positions and obligations, and would have the burden separately placed upon them of making both ends meet. This is not the case at present, since any extra expenditure by the Commonwealth means a diminution of trieamount returnable to the States. This proposal of a. return of a specified amount annually has already received the support of the Premier of New South Wales (Mr Carruthers), vide para. 9 of my letter dated 25th Sentembe'r, 1905 (copy herewith, Appendix A ) . 13. I would suggest that the period during which the Commonwealth should undertake to guarantee an annual payment to the States (on the basis hereinafter mentioned) be ten years, viz., after 3.1st December, 19TO, up to 31st December, 1920, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides. By that time we should have had twenty years' experience of Federation, and would necessarily have acquired during that period a greater and wider knowledge of the question, which would assist the Parliament in making arrangements "" on such basis as it deems fair "" for the future. The guaranteed annual payment to each State to be on the following basis:(1) To pay annually to each State for ten years after 31st December, 1910 (the date on which. Section 87 (the Braddon Clause) becomes alterable), a fixed sum equal to the average annual' amount of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise which that State has contributed during (say) the five years preceding such 31st December, 1910 (not including the special revenue in the case of Western Australia). (2) If three-fourths of the total net revenue received by the Commonwealth from Customs and Excise in any year after 31st December, 1910, exceeds the amount of the annual fixed sum guaranteed to all the States, any such sum in excess to be distributed among the States per capita. (3) Provided that after 31st December, 1910, the Commonwealth mav impose additional Customs and Excise duties for specific purposes, and may specially appropriate and retain and ""earmark"" the whole of the revenue(a) Derived from any new (b) Derived from any addiIf any surplus remains in anv year after providing for such specific purposes from the revenue derived from such special appropriations, three-fourths of such surplus to be annuallv returned to the States i>er capita. These aranffemer.ts to continue for ten years, viz.,'after the.3 ist December, 1910, up to 31st December. iq2o. and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides. Sir John Forrest. E - THE BOOKKEEPING SYSTEM. 14. Under the foregoing proposals the bookkeeping system would terminate at the same time as the ""annual fixed payment"" system would come into force, viz., 31st December, 1910. The effect of this termination would be that the Commonwealth expenditure would be dealt with as a whole, irrespective of State divisions; though it - need not prevent the Commonwealth expenditure in each State being approximately commensurate .with the revenue derived from that State. It would also simplify the keeping of the. Public accounts, and give financial responsibility as well as financial independence to both the Commonwealth and the States. We must not. however, forget that both are supplying the wants of the same people, and that in each case the expenditure is intended to be equally beneficial to the same 'people. F - FUTURE BORROWING BY THE STATES. 15. The Commonwealth, should be empowered to raise loans for the States on terms and conditions to be agreed upon. aggregate 16. It is, I think, inadvisable at the present time to ask the States to undertake for all time not to borrow on the London market except through the Commonwealth. In order, however, to firmly establish or. the London market ""Australian Consols"" with the object of obtaining better terms and making greater savings through the conversion or redemption by the Commonwealth of their existing stocks, the States should undertake not to borrow in the Londori-mar1 ket, except through the Commonwealth, up to 31st December, 1920, the date on which it is proposed that the amount and basis of items of duties imposed the annual payment by the Commonwealth solely for specific pur- to the States may be reconsidered by the poses ; Parliament. The States should limit their borrowing during that period to the Austional duties on existing tralian market, and each State would of items of duties imposed course be solel'y responsible for any new solely for specific pur- debts it incurred, together with all interest poses. and sinking fund on such debts. G - CONCLUDIN G REMARKS. 1.7. I submit the foregoing recommendations for adoption. If a comparison be made between my proposals and those made by the Premiers on 15th Februarv, 190.S. at the Hobart Conference {vide Appendix B, with annotations), it will be found that there is nothing in them inconsistent with 'any of the proposals recommended by the Premiers. 18. Only two sections of the Constitution are affected, viz., Sections 94 and 105, and if these recommendations are favorablyviewed by the States, there should be little difficulty in obtaining the consent of the electors to the required amendments at the ensuing General Election, especially as the proposed amendments would not in any way prejudice State rights; or it might be considered sufficient to obtain "" the concurrence of the Parliaments of all the States "" to an agreement with the Commonwealth based on these proposals, under the powers contained in Section 51, sub-sec. xxxviii. of the Constitution, and if this can be legally done there need not be any amendment whatever of the Constitution. 19. I have purposely not referred in this memorandum to the question of "" Transferred Properties,"" because my recommendations on that subject have beer, already presented to Parliament (vide page 1800, Parliamentary Papers, vol. 2, Session 1904, Appendix A i ) . H - SUMMARY . 20. The following is a summary of the recommendations contained herein: (1) That the State Debts, ""as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth,"" amounting to about 202 millions (as provided by Section 105 of the Constitution), be taken over as soon as possible (vide par. 8). (2) That the balance of the total existing State Debts, amounting to about 35 millions, 'be "" taken over,"" so soon as an amendment of Section 105 of the Constitution, enabling it to be done, is obtained (vide par. 8). (3) That Section 87 (the Braddon Clause) be not continued beyond the 31st December, 1910 (vide pars. 9 and 10). (4) That after 31st December, 1910, up to 31st December. 1920, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides, the net Customs nnd Excise revenue the divided between the States and the Commonwealth as follows: The States to have(a) A guaranteed fixed annual payment for ten years to each State on the basis of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise which that State contributed (excluding the special revenue in the case of Western Australia) during (say) the five years preceding such 31st December, 1910 (vide par. 13, sub-par. (b) If three-fourths of the total net revenue from Customs and Excise in any year (not ""ear-marked"") exceeds the aggregate of the guaranteed fixed payments to all the States- a per capita return of such excess (vide 'par. 13, sub-par. (2). (c) A per capita return of three-fourths of any surplus of "" ear-marked "" net Customs and Excise revenue (new or additional) after providing for the specific purposes for which it was specially appropriated (vide par. 13, sub-par. (3). The Commonwealth to have(d) Subject to the annual paymen of the guaranteed' fixed sum to the States one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue (not "" ear-marked"") (vide par. 13, sub-par. (1). (e) Any new or additional net Customs and' Excise revenue, '' ear-marked "" for specific purposes (vide par. 13, sub-par. (3). (/ ) One-fourth of any surplus of "" ear-marked "" net Customs and Excise revenue, after providing for the specific purposes for which it was specially appropriated (vide par. 13, subpar. (3). (5) That the bookkeeping system should cease on 31st December, 1910 (vide par. 14). (6) That the States undertake not to * borrow on the London market, except through the Commonwealth, up to 31st December, 1920 (vide pars. 15 and 16). (7) That Sections 94 and 105 of Constitution be amended or agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and States (vide par. 18). JOHN FORREST, Appendix A. COPY OF A MEMORANDUM BY SIR JOHN Constitution FORREST, DATED 25TH SEPTEMBER, 1905. The Honourable the Prime Minister. In my Budget speech of the 22nd Auwealth."" gust, I said"" Unless some arrangement can made under which a fixed sum shall be returned to the States each year, it seems to me that have no alternative but to continue the bookkeeping method-at any rate until the expiration of tion 87 of the Constitution."" (Hansard, p. 1211.) And again"" I am of opinion that the bookkeepsurplus ing system will never be acceptenable able as a permanent system to people of Australia. It ham'pers both States and' Commonwealth, speechand, although it has beeri serviceable and will do good service for years to come, it cannot be looked upon as a permanent arrangement."" (Hansard, p. 1211.) And again"" My judgment leads me to believe that it will be found advisable to consider whether it is not possible to adopt the Canadian plan some scheme which will be able and acceptable, under which' it might be agreed that a fixed' amount, subject, if necessary, to thatperiodical adjustment, should be annually returnable to each State. If some such proposal oould be given effect the Commonwealth and the States would be in a position of.financialindependence, and would be able to work out their financial 'problems in their own way."" (Hansard, p. 1217.) 2. The more I have considered this question the more I am convinced that the plan outlined in my Budget speech, and now Sir John Forrest. the proposed by the Premier of New South an Wales (Mr Carruthers), is the only one that will be permanently satisfactory to the the Commonwealth and to the States. 3. It is scarcely likelv that the Federal Parliament will continue the Braddbn Treasurer. Clause beyond the 31st December, 1910, and, therefore, after that date, the whole Customs and Excise revenue will be at the disposal of the Commonwealth, subject only to the provision in Section 94 of the that "" the Parliament mayprovide on such basis as it deems fair for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Common4. The taking over by the Commonbe wealth of the State Debts is not necessarily connected with the return of any surplus revenue to the States, as, whether we the Debts are taken over or not, the States will have to pay the interest. The necessities of the States in this respect cannot, Sechowever, be ignored by the Commonwealth, as they have at the present time to pay £8,400,000 annually in interest on their Public Debts, and largely rely upon the returned' by the Commonwealth to them to do so. There cannot in any the case, I think, be any doubt as to the accuracy of the statement in my Budget "" That the Commonwealth, with its great and exclusive 'power over Customs taxation, is .in a far stronger and better position to deal with this great financial matter than are the States, either collectively or separately."" (Hansard, p. 1216.) 5. But the taking over of the States or Debts under Section 105 of the Constituequittion will in no way limit the spending power of the Commonwealth after the 31st December, 1910, as Section 105 provides "" The States shall indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the debts taken over, and thereafter the interest 'payable in respect of the debts shall be deducted and retained from the portion of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth, payable to the several States, or if such surplus is insufficient, or if there is no surplus, then the deficiency or the whole amount shall be paid by the several States."" It will be noticed that the Constitution even, seems to infer the possibility of there being no surplus returnable to the States by the word's used, viz., "" o r if such surthatplus is insufficient, or if there is no surplus then the deficiency or the whole amount shall be paid by the several States."" 6. Unless, therefore, some mutually - satisfactory arrangement is arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States before the end of 1910, the States will have to rely solely upon the Commonwealth Parliament, and not upon any legal obligation, in respect of the return of surplus revenue. 7. That being so, it is manifestly a very urgent and important matter for the States that no time should be lost in endeavouring to make a binding arrangement with the Commonwealth in regard to the amount to be annually returned' to them after the end of 1910. 8. The duty of the Commonwealth and the States is, of course, to do that which is best for Australia as a whole, and viewing the question solely from that stand-point, the proposal foreshadowed in my Budget - speech, and now submitted by the Governtherefore, ment of New South Wales, seems to me the only possible satisfactory Dasis for future in the interests of both-the monwealth and the States. 9. The proposals of the Premier of South Wales (Mr Carruthers) are(a) The return of an adequate fixed contrary amount of the Customs revenue tion. to each State on the expiration of the Braddon Clause. (b) The continuation of the bookkeeping period to the end' of 1910 NA (THE BRADDON CLAUSE) ENCE, 15th FEBRUARY, 1905. 1. That pending a better provision being embodied in the Constitution to secure the States against, deficiency, the 87th section of the Constitution Act should be amended by the omission of the words, "" during a period of ten 3'ears after the establishment of the Commonwealth, until Parliament otherwise provides,"" in .order to secure the constitutional right of the return to each of the States of three-fourths of the net revenue - of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise, as provided by that section. 2. That, subject to the foregoing of the State debts be taken over by the Commonwealth - can be made. (the expiration of the Braddon Clause). 10. The effect of this proposal would be (1) The States would' be no longer under any financial obligation to, the Commonwealth, and would know exactly what amount they were to annually receive. (2) The Comomnwealth would have the responsibility of making its own financial arrangements, and of raising what revenue it required to carry out its obligations. (3) Both the Commonwealth and the States would have the burden of making both end's meet, and not as would be the case in the future if no arrangement is come to, that burden being altogether (as it is at present) placed upon the States. 11. The solvency and prosperity of the States must always be of vital importance to the Commonwealth Parliament, and, although it may be thought by some that in giving favourable consideration the to the proposals of the Premier of New ComSouth Wales (Mr Carruthers) the Commonwealth is relinquishing some of its New powers, I am of opinion that to do so will be to the advantage of Australia, and I also believe that to do so will not be acting to the real spirit of the ConstituTOHN FORREST, Treasurer. 25th September, 1905.

I submit that fhey are fair both to 4,738.575 184,435 the States and to the Commonwealth, and 217,137 that they are concisely put and easily under3f.0,885 stood. 8,037,570 322,234 It will be noticed! that, although 1,499.530 60,681 I propose that the scheme may be termi737.398 nated upon the 31st December, 1920, there 9,746 645 328,297 will be no occasion to bring it to an end 6.701,973 237,181 unless Parliament decides to do so. It 508,355 4,441.050 173,752 may continue indefinitelv if it is regarded as 522,705 suited to the circumstances. My reason 6,379,726 218,113 for not making any proposal of a perma4.526,010 136,012 nent character is that I do not believe' it 7.356,573 255,697 possible at the present time to formulate 1,144,524 235,555 7,174 a plan that would be acceptable for all 1,914,350 63,181 time to both the Commonwealth and the 2,518,257 75,728 States. The difficulties in the way at pre62,431 2,297 sent are too great, and we are only begin8,814,266 f82,190 ning to think federallv. 3,804,100 I think, how133,144 ever, that by the end of 1920, when 9,686,300 387,452 1,450,653 53,456 we shall have had twenty years' ex12,500,000 375,000 perience of Federation, we shall be in a far better position to again deal with the matter, if it is considered necessary to do so. If we were to attempt to make a permanent arrangement now, it would no doubt be necessary to amend the Constitution, and there might be obstacles to our success in that direction. There is plenty of room for criticism and for differences of opinion in this matter, and all I desire is that those who do not agree with me will suggest some better scheme. The honourable member for Mernda has had several conversations with me upon this matter, but I am sorry to say we are not in accord. He has in preparation a scheme which I hope he will allow me to place upon the table of the House in a few days, in order that honourable members may give it their full consideration. I have not seen the final draft of it, but honourable members know the .reputation of the honourable member. He has had a long commercial experience, and I believe that his scheme-whic h I will not venture to criticise at the present moment-aim s at securing finality immediately. I am sorry to. say that I do not think his desire can be attained. His proposals are much more ambitious one than the proposals I have submitted, and I am quite sure that it will receive from honourable members every consideration. I thank the honourable member for what he has done, and regret I do not aeree with his views. I wish that some other honourable members, possessed of similar knowledge and experience, would do the same. I submit my proposals with confidence, and in the hope that they will prove acceptable to the Governments of the States and the people of Australia. I suppose it is characteristic of me that, while I do not make up my mind in a moment, when once I have made it up I am not easily turned from mv resolve. Probably that is the reason why I am sometimes credited with being an autocrat.",42
69,Mr CARPENTER,CAN BE,The States Treasurers will be opposed to the right honourable gentleman upon his proposal to terminate the Braddon section of the Constitution.,67
70,Sir TOHN FORREST,CAN BE,"I do not propose to terminate that section immediately. Under my proposal, it will be practically perpetuated till 1920, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides.",67
71,Mr CARPENTER,CAN BE,Le t us hope that they will see it in that light.,67
72,Sir JOHN FORREST,CAN BE,"I am also glad to say that the proposals now submitted are practically in accord with the views expressed by the Premiers of the States at the Hobart Conference. As a matter of fact, they are more generous to the States than were the proposals of the Premiers. For instance, I do not suggest that the States should for ever forego the right to borrow on the London market except through the Commonwealth-as was agreed to at the Hobart Conference - but I propose to make that question an open one after 1920. In no way are the present recommendations of the Government less liberal to the States than were those submitted by the Premiers themselves at Hobart. If honourable members will look at Appendix B they will see that I have annotated the recommendations of the Premiers, so as to show clearly where they differ, and in what respect our proposals are more liberal or less liberal, than those submitted by the Premiers. Our proposals will give-subjec t to certain limitations - financial freedom alike to the States and the Commonwealth. The last subject with which I am called upon to deal is the Tariff. I am not in a position to submit proposals for an amendment of the Tariff with my Budget statement. Had I beeni able to do so, it would have been most desirable, because I should then have been in a position to indicate the financial effects of the proposals. Up to the present time, only the operation of the excise duties has been reported upon by the Tariff Commission, and considered by the Government. It is impossible for me to announce the * probable effect of any proposed duties until more reports have been received from the Commission embodying their recommendations in regard to Customs, and until their general effect upon the revenue has been ascertained. I should like to point out - no doubt it has occurred to honourable members-that any proposals for an amendment of the Tariff must take effect immediately they are submitted. That being so, their consideration will require to be proceeded with, without delay, until the final decision has been arrived at. That is a very important point, which honourable members should thoroughly weigh. In dealing with Tariff reform, we ought not to commence the consideration of any proposals we cannot finish. What would be our position if , after levying duties during the next month or two, it was found that we could not conclude the consideration - the Bill authorizing them during the present Parliament ? I thinlk that we should compelled to return all the money that had collected under the proposed duties unless we could pass legislation to legalise the collection of the duties until the.new Parliament has time to pass the necespigs.. sary law-and that might be difficult, sides being unprecedented. It will thus seen that great difficulties would arise, The Government recognise the great portance of the interests affected, and most anxious to afford whatever relief possible to any injured industries at liest possible moment. We desire to complete the. work of the session by the end of tember, and will deal with all reports the Tariff Commission, which we have per time to consider, within the time available. It would, of course, have been preferable if the whole of the proposed amendments of the Tariff could be dealt with at one time, in order not only that effect upon the revenue might be but also that any extra expenditure upon defence caused by the proposals consideration, and others not yet ripe for submission, might have been considered in the licrht of the revenue likely to be able. I have now dealt with all the subjects that occur to me. In Committee, Ministers about .£3,000,000 in charge of the various Departments will be only too anxious to give full information upon every item which appears in the mates or in the Budget papers. The Goincluding vernment have no secrets. We - have skeleton in our political cupboard. We sire to take honourable members into our fidence upon every public matter in respect of which it is reasonable and proper for to do so. In conclusion, I would ask orable members to try to realise what 4,000,000 of British people in Australia have done and are doing. They have £107,000,000 upon deposit at the banks, of which over £23,000,000 are in coin bullion. They have deposits in the Savlast ings Banks of over £37,000,000, and the number of depositors is 1,152,506. have produced minerals to the value of granary of the world. .£636,000,000, of which £24,766,000 were produced during 1905. Of .£636,000,000, the sum of ,£462,439,000 represents the production of gold, and that quantity £15,500,000 worth was gold producer of recent times. produced in 1905. Perhaps I be pardoned for saying that more than half of the gold production of that year came from Western Australia. of They haye 9,380,000 acres under cultivar tion not including grass and fallow lands. be During the last two years they have prowe duced wheat valued at ,£18,766,000, and have exported butter valued at .£4,792,000. They have 75,000,000 sheep, 8,000,000 cattle, 1,600,000 horses, and 1,000,000 Their sheep have increased during be the last three and three-quarter years by be 22,000,000, and the value of the wool produced is now over £20,000,000, haviming increased during the same period by are .£7,000,000. In 1906 their oversea trade is represented .£95,000,000; their imports the earbeing of the value of £38,000,000 and their exports of the value of ,£57,000,000. SepI am glad to say that 71 per cent, of this of trade was with the people of the British proEmpire-ou r own people-the remaining 29 per cent, being with the people of foreign countries. The value of their imports is ,£15,000,000 less than those of Canada, but their exports exceed in value their those of Canada by .£13,000,000, and of known, South Africa by .£25,000,000.",67

If the farmers of Australia rely upon this Bill as a stimulus to the agricultural and sociated industries throughout the Continent they will be somewhat severely disappointed. The policy of bounties is one that we not to launch without being fairly sure the limits of its application are likely be adhered to, and that it will probably successful. In nearly all cases bounties are continued after the period during which they were intended to apply, and in most they are increased. The position the same, whether it be a bounty or tective duty. In 1789, when Madison in his troduced his first Tariff, and placed a duty of 7^ per cent, on cotton in order to stimulate the industry, he said that it was to be imposed for only a few years, and that the industry, being once established,-could continue without adventitious aid. But the duty was increased to 35 per cent, in 1812. Cotton is one of the lines which, under this Bill, is to be stimulated into productivity in Australia by means of a bounty. I may also point to the experience of Canada. Although I do not wish fo specify the articles' in respect of which the bounties were given, we know that the original policy, both with regard to period and amount, was never adhered to. Some of the commodities that are to be the subjects of bounty under this Bill have already had the bounty system applied to them in Australia. I think that fifteen or twenty years ago Queensland granted a bounty to stimulate the cotton industry. In 1892 some 700 or 800 acres there were under cotton, and produced over 200,000 lbs. of ginned cotton. According to recent information, the industry has not progressed. It is now practically non-existent, or, at all events, insignificant, so that we have practical experience as regards the effect of granting a bounty on cotton produced in Australia.",69
77,Mr EWING,CAN BE,"It fell very much, in price.",69
78,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,"We are not going to get an assurance of high prices or regularity in prices in the future any more than we did in the past. As regards cotton, within the last fifteen or twenty years there have been' serious fluctuations in price, to but they are likely to continue. Between Bill, i860 and 1870, owing to the American there were bigsrer fluctuations. But and as regards the future, it must be rememWe bered that during the last ten years the demand for cotton has fluctuated a good on the whole, it has beer., on the increase. Considering that certain parts of New South Wales and Queensland have been declared to be fairly well suited for as the oroduction of cotton, that the price is good, that cotton goods production and their exportation are increasing ought in England, there is every inducethat ment to private enterprise, even withto out a bounty, to enter into the cotton be industry in Australia. With, a bounty it has not beer, a success in the past. I mentioned that in Enel-ind the demand for cotton is increasing. The figures for last is year show that, notwithstanding the allea progation of Mr Chamberlain and some of followers, the cotton industry there is particularly strong. The actual profit made by the industry in Lancashire last year was estimated at ,£668,000. very big demand for cotton within the Empire itself if it can be produced here. Let me take some of the other items. To a large extent, coffee production depends for success, not so much on any bount\'-and certainly not on the bounty offered in this Bill-bu t on the quality of the article. This is a bounty on production, and not a bounty on quality. That is, I think, the. experience of the commercial world. Coffee is now produced in Australia, but the small amount offered here as a bountv is not likelv to induce a much larger production. Coffee of fair qualitv-and I have drunk some of it-is , I understand, produced in Norfol k Island. I believe that it is produced in parts of the Commonwealth. What we want to do is to get a reputation for coffee, and that will depend upon its quality. The offer of this bounty - which , if it does anything, may perhaps draw into the industry a few small men, who generally fail-is not likely to lead to a very great stimulus in production. On many lines we have had bounties in operation in the States. I r i South Australia, for instance, there was a bounty on the production of olive oil. It will show how unequal bounties are when I mention that practicallv that bountv was drawn by one or two men. I think that one man derived the principal advantage from it. It has beer, in existence in South, Australia, and I do not think that the fact that the Commonwealth offers a bountv which, under the terms of this Bill , could not last for more than a year, would act as a stimulus to production. I do not know what the draftsman was about when he drafted the Bill. It seems to me to have been drawn' by an amateur rather than by a professional draftsman. I believe that olive trees do not bear until about nine years affter they have been planted. The bountv which is to indiice oroductior. is to expire at the end of ten years, therefore it will last for only one year.",69
79,Mr EWING,CAN BE,Did not the Minister explain that he intended to make the bounties operate for five years from the time of the trees bearing?,70
80,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,"Of course, if the Minister intends to amend his Bill out of recognition it is not worth our while to discuss it.",70
81,Mr EWING,CAN BE,"He will only do what is right. There is a Mr Glynn - I have not had an opportunity of reading his speech. Unfortunately, I was not in the Chamber when it was delivered- I could not be here-bu t I have read the newspaper reports.",70
82,Mr EWING,CAN BE,The Minister will not be deaf to any reasonable suggestion made by honourable members.,70
83,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,"Our amendments might be so numerous as to occupv more space than the text of the Bill , and the policy, as a policy, would, in effect, disappear. I understand that the Minister has given up the proposed bounty on chicory production, and now we are told that the terms of the bountv on olive oil, which is utterly incapable of affording, an incentive under the text of the Bill , because it would last only one year, are to be amended.",70
84,Mr EWING,CAN BE,The Minister is not going to give it up.,70
85,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,"Either the bounty must be given up or the Bil l must be remodelled in that regard. There is one objection to the whole scheme. Bounties ought to be given for the production of commodities which are likely to be produced over a fair area throughout the Commonwealth. In other words, the benefit df Ithe bountv ought to be fairly well distributed throughout its territory. It is a great mistake to introduce bounties, the benefits of which can be enjoyed by only one State, or, at most, by one or two States. This is a subvention chiefly to the industries of Queensland and New South Wales, if to any extent it is likely to be availed of.",70
86,Mr EWING,CAN BE,"The honourable member does not mean that, surely ?",70
87,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,I do. I believe that the bulk of the articles mentioned in the schedule are not likely to be produced by three of the States.,70
88,Mr EWING,CAN BE,Take ' South Australia.,70
89,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,"Tb e honourable member alludes to rice, I suppose?",70
90,Mr EWING,CAN BE,"No ; to fibres, fish, milk, and oil.",70
91,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,"Milk is produced already, and I do not think that the industry, as regards production., requires to be stimulated. The panacea which has been urged has been protection.",70
92,Mr EWING,CAN BE,Suppos e that we take in the Northern Territory?,70
93,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,"The honourable member proposes to give a bountry on the production of certain commodities in the Northern Territory with white labour. There lies the difficulty. A bounty on cotton production' would amount to absolutely no stimulus in the Northern Territory, where the plant grows wild and in abundance",70
94,Mr EWING,CAN BE,"The honourable member's statement was that some of the States would not participate, and my replv was that in South Australia almost all of these articles could be produced.",71
95,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,"I quite understand the statement of the Minister. But I repeat that the bounty would be availed of largely, if not exclusively, by New South Wales and Queensland. Certainly, the articles mentioned by the honourable member are produced at the present time.",71
96,Mr EWING,CAN BE,And the rest of them can be produced in the Northern Territory.,71
97,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,"I beg the Minister's pardon, the conditions under which they are to receive the bounty are not existent in the Northern Territory. It is of no use to offer a bounty for the production of cotton in places where it could not be produced by white labour. The honourable gentleman offers a bounty with one hand, and practically takes it away with the other. Within the settled district's of Australia, so far as bounties are likely to be effective, they would operate chiefly in Queensland and parts of New South ""Wales. The reports say that cotton can be produced here; but, leaving out the Northern Territory, I have not seen in a report a reference to any other part of Australia where the cotten industry is likelv to be successful. We have had from the Treasurer today figures showing that in bounties on sugar production alone Queensland and New South Wales have received, in the last five years, over .£700,000, and that there has been an average shrinkage of ,£100,000 a year from imrjort duties on sugar. So that, in connection with the sugar industry, those States have received a subvention of over £1,200,000; and the operation of this Bill will be, although in a comparatively small way, in further aid of industries in those territories. I am not seeking to draw any distinction between the States. What I submit is that bounties ought to be given in respect of such commodities as are likely to be produced over a fairly wide area of the States, or, at all events, be applied to commodities the production of which would not be confined to one or two States. Because, so far as production was likely to be confined to one or two States,, those States could produce the article unaided. This is an Australian policy, or it is nothing. But if a bounty on the production of commoditieswhich are almost peculiar to a State be desired, then that State, with the consent of the Commonwealth, has the power to make the necessary provision. The duty rests upon the Stales to stimulate certain classes of production. Talking of the probability of the success of bounties, I said in the beginning that in manv cases they have failed. I remember reading in the report of the Tobacco Commission that the bounties given in the State of Victoria for the production of tobacco had failed. The amount was, I think, 3d. per lb.; and 1 for reasons which one may or may not accept, given in the Commission's report, and for causes which are also explained in Coghlan and other authorities, the bounties were not a success. That, at all events, suggests that we should be cautious before launching out on a system of bounties, the extension of which is almost certain to be demanded.",71
98,Mr ISAACS,CAN BE,The excise killed the tobacco industry in Victoria.,71
99,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,"Perhaps so. But, at all events, bounties could not keep it alive, and we cannot afford to forfeit excise for the sake of bounties on tobacco. I do not quite understand the scope of this Bill. The Minister of Trade and Customs mentioned, and' clause 3 describes, what bounties shall be given in respect, of the goodswhich the Minister is to find to be "" of a merchantable quality."" This is one of those' Bills which prescribes a number of duties that necessitate the Minister being an expert. Under clauses 5 and 7, for instance-and in the latter clause, although the Governor General is mentioned, the Minister is meant-the Minister is to docertain things. He is to find what is the standard rate of wages in a particular industry. Paragraph b of clause 7 prescribesthat he is to determine the market value of certain commodities, All that I can say is, that if the Minister efficaciously discharges the duties imposed on him by the Bill, he must become an expert. Then thebounty is to be given to' a number of persons. It is to be given to the grower or producer of the goods in question ; but we also find in clause 4 that the owner, occupier, or lessee of any land or factory in which the goods were pr^uced. or in which they may 'have gone for any process of manufacture, shall be deemed to be a producer. If the bounty is .to be given to the grower or the producer, and also to all the persons mentioned in clause 4, who are also to be regarded as producers, it seems to me that the amount which each of them will get must be very small. Some portion of it will go to persons who have absolutely nothing to do with the production of the commodities. There seems to be something wrong, either in the draftsmanship or in the policy of this Bill. Surely the,lessee of land as well as the owner ought not to share in the bounty. The lessee may be the producer or he may not. The owner may be the producer or he may not. But you cannot have both the owner and the lessee as producers of a particular commodity-excep t under the definition of this Bill. We ought to be careful before we consent to the system proposed. It is not likely to be attended with any benefit to the genuine producer on whose behalf the Minister professes to be so solicitous, and its benefits will be less than the producer had a right to expect, after reading the platform generalizations of the Prime Minister as to what he was going to do for the agricultural industry. The Bill and the policy which it represents are not likely to lead to that extended production throughout Australia which we have been led to expect, and if the farmers have any such hopes, they are likely to be falsified.",71
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CAN BE,"Parramatta) [5.44] - On Friday last the Minister of Trade and Customs promised that before this Bill was proceeded with he would make available for honourable members certain documents from which he quoted. There was a clear and definite statement on that point. The Minister made that the excuse for shortening his remarks, and certainly for shortening his quotations. Why has not that information been made available?",72
101,Mr ISAACS,CAN BE,"The Minister said, "" I propose to have the information printed and distributed amongst honourable members,"" but he did not say that that would be done before the debate was proceeded with.",72
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CAN BE,There was a distinct understanding that this Bill would not be proceeded with until the documents were printed.,72
103,Mr DEAKIN,CAN BE,"I did) not understand that there was a definite promise, but there was an understanding that before we got into Committee the information should be available.",72
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CAN BE,And the Minister went on to-promise that there should be every speed in the printing of the documents.,72
105,Mr DEAKIN,CAN BE,"That is so, but of course the Budget papers had to be printed first. This is really a Committee Bill, and we will not ask honourable members to go into Committee upon it before the documents have been distributed.",72
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CAN BE,"Then I am afraid that I shall have to proceed. My recollection does not accord with that of the Prime Minister. However, we are accustomed to__that; and we are also accustomed to the constant absence of the Minister of Trade and Customs when he has business before this Chamber. It is about time that some protest was made against the. absence of the Minister so constantly when he has important Bills before the House.",72
107,Mr DEAKIN,CAN BE,He has a great deal of important business in Sydney.,72
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CAN BE,"I know that he has a great deal of important businessprincipally in connection with his electorate. The Prime Minister need not apologize for the absence of his colleague, because we know quite well where he is. He is doing what we should all like' to be doing, and for the same reason. He is electioneering, and he is doing that persistently; but I submit that whan a Minister brings down important proposals to this House, such as the Minister of Trade and Customs has done in connection with the Anti-Trust Bill and this Bounty Bill, he ought to be here to see those measures through. He ought to be here until our business upon them is completed. But we find this honourable gentleman throwing Bills down on the table of the House, reading some statements in support of them., which very often he does not understand-and when asked for information he cannot give it. For instance, when discussing the growth of cotton the 1 other day the Minister quoted some figures, and when interrogated by the honourable member for North Svdney as to whether he was referring to raw cotton, or otherwise, he had not the slightest idea. He could not tell us whether he was speaking of raw cotton or any other kind of cotton. Honourable members, who would have undertaken to speak today, have gone away, expeGting that, as usual, the Opposition would keep the debate going. I think it is about time this kind of thing was stopped. So far as I am concerned, I shall decline to proceed in view of what I regard as a direct breach of the understanding arrived at on Friday.""",72
109,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CAN BE,"North Sydney) [6.0] - I am very much astonished at the attitude taken up by Ministers. The Minister of Trade and Customs decidedly left the impression on honourable members' minds that he would provide the information on which he had based the Bill, so that we might discuss it, not at one stage, but at every stage.",73
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CAN BE,I call attention to the want of a quorum. \Quotum formed.},73
111,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CAN BE,"When interrupted by the call for a quorum, I was saying that it was distinctly understood by honourable members on this side that the figures which the Minister of Trade and * Customs did not put forward in full, but merely alluded to as his ground for introducing a measure of this character, would be placed in the - hands of honourable members before they were called upon to continue the debate. Had it not been for that understanding. I am sure honourable members in all parts of the House would have insisted on the Minister giving the figures in full. The Minister said that the figures contained important information which it had taken twelve months to gather, and which had induced him to introduce the Bill. Not only so, but it was suggested by honourable members on this side that, in order that the information might be available in time, it should not be handed to Hansard, but should be printed as a separate document. We now find ourselves called upon to discuss the Bill ; and to that I should not have objected in the least had the promise been fulfilled. We are asked to resume the debate without the information which is the basis of the measure, and which the Minister promised to supply. I cannot believe that if the Minister were here, he, knowing what took place on Fridav, would not recognise the position - at once. It cannot be said to be the fault of honourable members that delay has taken place in the printing of the documents. So much was I satisfied with the Minister's nromise. that, like the denuty-leader of the. Oopositiori, I have waited for the information before coming to any conclusion on the Bill. At the present moment, not only have we not the necessary information, but we have not our ownfiguresprepared, because we have been waiting for what the Minister had to place before us, naturally anticipating that he would have figures from the best source to enable us to consider a measure of the kind. I hope that the Prime Minister, in the absence ot the Minister of Trade and Customs, will see the desirability of carrying out the understanding arrived at, and not insist on a second reading debate in which, while considering the necessity for the Bill, we have to deal, not with its details, but with its methods.",73
112,Mr DEAKIN,CAN BE,Wit h the principle of the measure.,73
113,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CAN BE,"Not merely with the principle of bonuses; because, whether an honourable member is, or is not, in favour of bounties or bonuses as a principle, he must consider whether the Bill proposed deals with items that require a bounty-whic h will most benefit by a bounty-o r whether there are included items which are not deserving, or which should come second when such a question is being considered. That is the information we anticipated obtaining from the figures referred to by the Minister. It looks to me like taking advantage of honourable members to promise such figures and then fail to supply them. Had the Minister not made that Dromise we should doubtless have required the figures to be quoted, in order to satisfv us as to the desirability or otherwise of the Bill. I am prepared to resume the debate in a sort of way without the figures, but I am sure every honourable member will admit that, with the information available, he would be in a much better position to consider the question.",73
114,Mr DEAKIN,CAN BE,"If I may interpose for a moment, without interfering in any way with the right of the honourable member for North Sydney to speak further, I should like to say that, although personally I heard my honourable colleague during the greater part of his speech, I did not hear the undertaking mentioned. But since honourable members press themeaning they attached to the remarks of the Minister of Trade and Customs, I suggest that, as the next measure to be proceeded with is not immediately available, vou, sir, under the extraordinary circumstances of today, might see your way, with the consent of the House, to leave the chair, and resume it at the usual hour after dinner. Such a course would relieve the honourable member for North Sydney from speaking on the measure before he is' prepared to do so.",73
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CAN BE,I should also like to interpose,74
116,Mr SPEAKER,CAN BE,"This is all out of order; still, I think that, under the circumstances, the honourable member may be allowed to proceed.",74
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CAN BE,"I do not ""like to see half-an-hour of our time wasted. I should like to point out that I terminated my speech on the second reading, and mav thereby be debarred from again addressing myself to the measure.",74
118,Mr DEAKIN,CAN BE,That difficulty may easily be overcome by the honourable member for North Svdney submitting an amendment to the motion for the second reading.,74
119,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CAN BE,I ask leave to continue my remarks on a f uture occasion. Leave granted. Debate adjourned.,74
120,Unknown,CAN BE,Sitting suspended from 6.10 p.m. to - DESIGNS BILL. SECOND READING.,74
121,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [7.30] - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. In this measure Parliament is asked to further exercise the powers which it possesses under section 51 of the Constitution to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect toXVIII . Copyrights, pa'tents of inventions, and designs and trade marks. This Bill is really one of a number of measures dealing with the subiects referred to in that sub-section of the Constitution. We have already passed laws dealing with copyright, patents of invention, and trade marks. The only power remaining under the sub-section which we have not vet exercised is that relating to designs. The Bill is rather urgent, because certain practical difficulties have arisen in connection with the operation of the other measures to which I have referred which necessitate the passing as soon as possible of a law dealing with this branch of the subject. A Convention between several leading European countries was signed at Paris on the 20th March. 188-?, and in the following year Great Britain gave her assent to it. Article 2 of this International Convention providesThe subjects or citizens of each of the Contracting States shall in all the other States of the Union as regards patents, industrial designs' or models, trade marks, and trade names, enjoy the advantages that their respective laws now grant or shall hereafter grant to their own subjects or citizens. Consequently they shall have the same protection as the latter, and the same legal remedy against any infringement of their rights, provided they observe the formalities and conditions imposed on subjects or citizens by the internal legislation of each State. Of course, it is our desire that in the matters of patents and industrial designs our people shall enjoy the benefit of this international agreement, but in order that they may do so, it is necessary that we should legislate upon all of these subjects. The House is accordingly asked now to give its assent to this Bill, which has alreadv been passed by the Senate.",74
122,Mr HIGGINS,CAN BE,Hav e not the States passed Designs Acts already ?,74
123,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,Yes .,74
124,Mr HIGGINS,CAN BE,Will they not be covered 7.30 p.m. by the Convention?,74
125,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"The difficulty is that as a Commonwealth Parliament we have dealtso far only with patents, trade marks, and copyright, and in order to get the benefit of the Convention, it is necessary that we should exercise our power to deal with this other branch of the subject as well.",74
126,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,How does the Minister propose to differentiate between a trade mark and a design?,74
127,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"A design is intended only for the ornamentation of goods, and may have reference to the particular configuration of an article. It is a pattern or plan as distinguished from a trade name which a person acquires by virtue of the excellence of the article which he manufactures.",74
128,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,But a trade mark may also be a design.,74
129,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,A design is distinguished from a trade mark in its object and purpose. I will deal with that presently if the honourable and learned member will permit me to refer to some other matters first.,74
130,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,Clause 5 of the Bill defines the matter clearly.,74
131,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"Yes , it is all defined. The Drinciple of this Bill generally follows that which we have laid down in the Patents and Copyright Acts which we have alreadv passed. On the issue by the Governor General of a proclamation in pursuance of this Bill, the administration of the existing States Acts will be transferred to the Commonwealth. As a result, whatever executive powers are now possessed by the Governors of the respective States under the States Acts will then be exercisable by the Governor General or the Governor General in Council of the Commonwealth. All the records, registers, and so on kept in the various States under the States Act will pass over to and become the property of the Commonwealth. Under clause 6, it is provided that, after the proclamation, there shall be no further registration under the States laws, and subject to a saving of the rights under existing States Act, the administration will proceed on the principles laid down in this measure.",74
132,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,Does this differ from the Imperial Act?,75
133,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"No ; this measure is based on the English Act. The English law on the subject is to be found in the Trade Marks Act of 1883 and amending Acts of 1888. This Bill embodies the principles of the English law, and applies the machinery we have already adopted in connection with the other Acts to which I have referred to meet the circumstances of the Commonwealth. The administration of the law will be in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs. It isi provided that there shall be a Registrar, but it is not intended to create any new office. The administration of this Bill will be in' the hands of the present Commissioner of Patents, and there will therefore be no increased cost in that respect as the result of passing this measure. There is power given in the Bill to appoint deputy registrars, the intention being that if it should be found necessary in any of the States, there may be such an officer appointed for the purposes of this Bill.",75
134,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,I hope the deputy registrars will keep up the records. In the States offices they do not keep up the records in connection with patents. That is a very important matter.,75
135,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"That is a matter of administration. It is intended under this measure to establish a Designs Office at the Seat of Government. Following the lines of other legislation upon kindred matters,, there is to be a sub-office in each State, and a seal of the Designs Office. The Bill deals with, copyright in designs, and its machinery is intended to protect such copyright. In clause 4 it is provided that ""design""means an industrial design applicable, in any way or by any, means, to the purpose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration, ofan article, or to any two or more of those purposes, while "" article"" means "" any article or substance."" What is protected is the copyright in a design as distinct from the article to which a design is applied. Under the English law, the protection of designs covered originally only designs applied to certain classes of fabrics, such as cotton; but it was afterwards extended to designs applied to other articles, and now relates to all designs applied to articles of manufacture. The design is distinct from the article to which it is applied. For instance, the pattern printed uppn cotton goods is something apart from the goods themselves, being the result of an effort to produce something to take the fancy and capture the taste of the public. In some instances, the design is the configuration or shape of the article to which it is applied. For instance, a design of the shape of a lamp shade has been held in a leading case on the subject to be protected.",75
136,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,What is the difference between copyright in such a design and a trade mark?,75
137,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"A trade mark is a mark or a word used to indicate that the article to which it is applied is the manufacture or production of a particular person or firm, and carries with it a certain reputation. A design is different from a trade mark.",75
138,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,"In some cases it is, while in other cases it is not.",75
139,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"Of course, a man may have his design registered to protect his interest' in the design in relation to a certain class of goods. Clause 5 provides thatA design shall be deemed to be applied to aa article when(a) the article is made from or in accordance with the design; 01 (b) the design is applied, in any way or by any means, to the purpose of the ornamentation, or pattern, or shape, or configuration, of the article, or to any two or more of those purposes. The copyright, when registered, .is protected, under clauses 13 and 26, from the date on which the application for registration is lodged, the protection being for a period of five years, or so long as the tration remains in force. Clause 28 proThe vides thatThe owner of a registered design shall, within two years after registration, substantially use the design or cause it to be substantially used in Australia in the manufacture of articles, and if he fails to do so the copyright in.the design shall cease. , Provided that if such design is used in any manufacture abroad the period aforesaid shall ""be limited to six months.",75
140,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CAN BE,Is that clause similar to the English provision?,76
141,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"It is a modification of it, the English provision being that If a registered design is used in manufacture in any foreign country, and is not used in this country within six months of its registration in this country, the copyright in the design shall cease.",76
142,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CAN BE,Does Bill shorten the period during which registration will protect?,76
143,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"No ; but it requires the owner of a registered design, if he wishes to have protection for five years, to use it within two years after registration, and there is a proviso, which was inserted because of the provision in the English law, to the effect that, if the design is used in any manufacture abroad, the period within which it must be used here shall be limited to six months. The author of a design is to be regarded as its first owner; but if a design has been made on behalf of any person for valuable consideration, that person shall be deemed to be its author, and the author of an unregistered design may, by instrument ih writing, assign it, and the right to make application for its registration. The person registered as the owner of a registered design is to be regarded as the owner of a copyright in the design, while the registered design will be personal property, capable of assignment, and of transmission by operation of law; but the assignment must be in writing, and signed by the registered owner.",76
144,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,"Is it not desirable that assignments shall be registered? Mi. GROOM - Clause 38 provides for the entry of assignments in the register. Coming now .to Part IV., which deals with the registration of designs, clause 17 provides thatAny new and original design, which has not been published in Australia before the lodging of an application for its registration, may be registered under this Act in respect of all or any of the articles included in one or more of the regisclasses in the prescribed classification. classes of articles so prescribed under the English Act are as follow:1. Articles composed wholly or chiefly of metal not included in class 2. 2. Jewellery. 3.

Printed or woven designs on textile piecegoods. 14. Printed or woven designs on handkerchiefsand shawls.",76
145,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,Will all those details beset out in a schedule?,76
146,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,They will be prescribed! by regulation.,76
147,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,Will the copyright run. for the same length of time with respect toall the articles enumerated?,76
148,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"Unde r clause 18, it will' be necessary to make a separate application in respect of each class. For instance,, if a man desires to register one design for paperhangings and another for carpets, he will have to make a separate application in* each case.",76
149,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,But will the copyrightextend over the same period in each case?,76
150,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"Yes ; it will extend for five years in all cases. Then the Bill setsout the procedure to be followed in the registration of designs"". Clause 19 provides that, after an application for registration has been lodged, the design may be published and used without prejudice. Thenfurther provision is made that certain conditions shall be fulfilled before registration isgranted. If these conditions are not complied with, the Registrar will have power to refuse registration. Then an appeal' - will lieT:o the Law Officer of the Commonwealth, which means the Attorney-General' or the Crown Solicitor.",76
151,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,rl s there no appeal from the Crown Law Officer?,76
152,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,Application may be made under clause 39 to have the register rectified.,77
153,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,"But , supposing that it is desired to insert something that is not tained in the register?",77
154,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"We can rectify by inserting, as well as by omitting.",77
155,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,"I do not think that rectification means that. Mr GROOMj - If the honourable and learned member will read clause 39, which follows the wording adopted ""in the Imperial Statute, he will see that the necessary power is given.",77
156,Mr HUGHES,CAN BE,Yes ; but even by adopting the wording of an Imperial Statute you cannot convert a cow into a horse.,77
157,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"To rectify means to put right, and you can rectify a register by inserting something that has been improperly omitted from It . Part V. deals with the remedies for infringement of copyright or design. The person who infringes a copyright is liable to an action fbr damages, or for penalty, or to have an injunction issued against him. But it is not intended that a penalty shall be imposed upon, or damages awarded against, an offender unless it is shown that He has knowingly infringed a copyright.",77
158,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CAN BE,It is not proposed in this case to put the onus of proof upon the offender?,77
159,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"We are now dealing with a class of cases quite different from that which the honourable member has in his mind. Part VI . deals with the register of designs. There is to be a register in which proper entries shall be made, and there is the usual provision that trusts shall not be noticed in the register. Other ""' clauses deal with the inspection of the register, and provide for penalties for making false entries, and also for the correction of the register. In minor matters, the Registrar may, upon request, amend or alter the register by correcting any error; but in important matters the Court itself must be appealed to. TEe miscellaneous clauses include provisions which give power to make regulations and to deal with certain offences. Clause 47 is worthy of notice. Registration cannot be obtained for a design if it has been previously published. At public exhibitions it is veiy often desirable to display designs for certain purposes, and clause 47 provides that designs exhibited under such circumstances shall be protected. Under clauses 48 and 49 the Commonwealth will be empowered to take advantage of the Conventions to which I have already recon- ferred. The measure is based upon English legislation, which went through several changes before if reached its present stage. We have in the six different States conflicting laws with regard to the registration of designs, and this is one of those matters in which, above all things, it is desirable to bring about uniformity, in order that' one registration may give protection throughout the CommonweaJth.",77
160,Mr GLYNN,CAN BE,The Commercial Congress urged that provision should be made for uniformity throughout the Empire.,77
161,Mr GROOM,CAN BE,"As far as possible, our legislation will fall into line with the Imperial law, and will substantially secure uniformity. We did the same thing in regard to our copyright and patent laws. The desire is to, as far as possible, insure Imperial uniformity, and I think that this measure will carry out that intention.

178,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is quite poetic!,78
179,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I cannot understand the attitude of honourable members who, cause they have not pluck to stand up in their places, and say they are against the construction of a transcontinental railway, wish to postpone the evil day by voting a survey which they pretend does not comBav mit them. The Treasurer has already stated his view of this matter. No ; I wrong in saying that, because the afterwards wished us to believe that he had by scarcely used the words attributed to him. I am sure, however, that honourable memthe bers will see that the moment they assent be to this Bill the people of the western State will say to them, "" You have voted for the survey, and for an expenditure of ,£20,000 of public funds, and,now you are honopposed to the verdict of your own",78

181,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I wish to test the bona fides of the gentlemen from the Western Australian gold-fields. The honourable a member for Coolgardie spoke eloquently in this House of the necessity to inaugurate a service of motor cars from .to Kalgoorlie, and the construction of a special track over which that tvpe of conveyance could move with its customary celerity. That honourable member pointed out that the difiiciiltv lay in the fact that the Commonwealth could not construct a line through any one State without the consent of that State, and that Western Australia would be opposed to an Bav line through its territory. The opposition of Western Australia, as a to whole, to the proposal for a railway from Esperance Bay, lies undeniably in the fact that it would lead to the gold-fields market taken being largely supplied from the eastern States. Over a transcontinental line the coastal farmers of Western Australia know full well that not a ton of produce from the eastern States could find its way into their market in competition with their proOn the othen hand they know that if a line from Esperance Bay were built the cost of freight would be very considerably lessened to the eastern producers, and for ! that very reason they are anxious at all It was for that reason that the honourable member for Coolgardie suggested in a very able speech the method of transit to which I have just referred; and I wish to begive that honourable member a chance to stand to his original protestations. To show that the people on the western gold-fields are not altogether unrecognisant of the for great advantages of having an Esperance line, I shall quote from the report of a civic welcome which was tendered to the am leader of the Labour Party when he visited Treasurer the gold-fields last May.",78
182,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I rise to a point of order. I desire to know whether the honourable member for Wentworth is in order in submitting an amendment in the direction indicated, seeing that leave has only been given to introduce a Bill to authorize - the survey of a railway between two specific places.

183,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,On the point of order,79
184,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am quite prepared to give a ruling. I am of opinion that the amendment is out of order. I should like to point out that if such an amendment were allowed there would be no finality to the Bill, because it would then be open to honorabe members to move an amendment authorizing the survey of a line from Perth to Port Darwin or from Perth to Sydney, and so on. I am of opinion that the amendment is distinctly out of order, and not within the scope of the Bill. only way by which such an amendment could' be moved would be by an instruction from the House td the Committee.",79
185,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I should like to ask for some information for mvself, and for honourable members. The leave in connection with a measure of this character is necessitated by that part which deals with the expenditure of public money. It will be open to me to submit my amendment when the next clause is under consideration. So far as the expenditure of public funds under this measure is concerned the' inclusion of names in the title of the Bill does not in any way affect the sum of money to be voted, because the House may still choose not to exceed the large amount of ,£20,000.",79

' I do not think the amendment can be ruled out of order, and I commend it to the attention of the"" Committee. I feel somewhat at a loss in approaching this subject in the absence of the esteemed assistance of my right honourable friend the Treasurer. I had hoped to .have had his aid in making the terms of my proposition clear. The amendment is practically to test the bona - fides of my honourable friends the representatives of Western Australia in yet another direction. On this occasion I wish to test the value of their protest that this line will pay, and that the survey will show that it will pay to such ani extent that the House will not hesitate, upon receipt of the report of the surThe veyors, to proceed with the work. Honourable members have scouted the idea that the survey will be in any way detrimental to the construction of the line. Holding that view, they can hardly fail to support this amendment, which asks Western Australia or South Australia-o r both of tbem, should they see fit to combine-to undertake to refund to the Commonwealth the cost of the survey in the event of its not being satisfactory. My honourable friends who are so satisfied that the line would be a success can hardly object to my amendment.",79

189,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"An absolute ""dead bird.""",79
190,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What is a ""dead bird ""?",79
191,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Something like what I hope the projected railway will be very soon. On a former occasion honourable members addressed themselves to an almost similar amendment in a frame of mind that seemed to indicate that they thought it was merely a method of shelving the work. It is obviouslv not that, for the very best advertisement the raihvay could have would be a clear indication that these honourable members are prepared to back the bona fides of their own assertions. If they are not it is about time the Bill was put in the waste-paper basket. We have had this Bill sprung upon us on many occasions. Its consideration to-night has actually taken the Treasurer by surprise, and so put an additional difficulty in the way of honourable members properly understanding its scope and alleged necessity. I have told honourable members exactly what the amendment is intended to do, and I hope they will support me. Let them prove their bona fides in this direction--let them say that, in the event of the Commonwealth failing eventually to construct the line, Western Australia or Western Australia and South Australia combined should refund the expenses of the survey, and I shall have no further objection to the passing of the measure. I give honourable members this opportunity, and I can see that the honourable member for Gray is coming over to my view. While I am dealing with this subject, I should like to point to yet another peculiarity, which makes my amendment still more valuable. Those who have read the reports on this proposal know that there will probably be some difficulty in inducing South Australia to agree to the route advocated by some Commonwealth engineers, and which would possibly be advocated by this House. It is obvious that if a deadlock ensued owing to South Australia's tyrannical objection, the Commonwealth would have absolutely sacrificed the expenditure of £20,000, which we are now asked to authorize. In these circumstances, the Committee, as a business body, must see that, before this clause is passed, the taxpayers of the Commonwealth are safeguarded to the extent I have proposed.

192,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wentworth) [8.24] - The . next amendment I have to propose is one which has been circulated in the name of the honourable member for New England, and which is of a most important nature. I move That after the word '.'may,"" line 1, the f o l lowing words be inserted :- "" (provided that the States of Western Australia and South Australia shall place under the control of the Commonwealth all Crown Lands for a distance of 'twenty-five miles on each side of the said railway from terminus to terminus, and that all moneys received from the rental or sales of such land shall be utilized for liquidating the interest on cost of surveys and the balance of - interest on cost of construction and working account after deducting earnings of the said railway)"" I do not think that there is any necessity to reduce the area of territory required by the amendment. On a former occasion the Treasurer-whos e absence, by the way, I have again to deplore-accepte d in spirit this proposition. It was on that occasion first voiced by the honourable member for Parkes, and the Treasurer said that he had wired to the Government of Western Australia to get their acceptance of it. He afterwards induced the House to support the survey proposition, very largely because of such acceptance.",80
193,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The betterment principle.,80
194,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is a slight difference between the amendment as circulated last year, and the amendment as now proAYES. posed. The former simply dealt with land adjacent to the route of the proposed railway in Western Australia, and, as the honourable member for Wannon was able to prove on a former occasion, the value of NOES. the actual area proposed to be set aside in that State would not cover a third of the yearly deficit which is expected by our experts to accrue from the construction of the line. Any honourable member who is anxious to see the exact figures which he quoted can look up the report of his remarks. He was able to show that the maximum rental value of all this land in Western Australia is IOS. per thousand acres, and that if every acre of the land were taken up at the maximum rate, still this alleged concession Cook, Hume on the part of Western Australia would not wipe off more than, I speak, from memory, a third of the estimated annual deficit. My amendment differs from the former amendment, inasmuch as it also asks South Australia to give a similar undertaking to the Commonwealth. It has often been said that the proposal for the construction of the - railway is put forward in the national cause, and is not submitted from any selfish, narrow, or provincial feeling on the part of South Australia or Western Australia. Therefore I confess I anticipate no objection whatever from the Western Australian representatives to this amendment. They have already accepted it in principle, because they have told us that their State is prepared to agree to its application. ing accepted it in principle, they cannot' reasonably object to that principle being inserted in this measure. Their word, 1 feel quite sure, is as good as their bond, but we are here in a business capacity as trustees for the Australian taxpayer. My proposal is one which no Western Australian can reasonably refuse to accept, that is, if it is intended by them to deal fairly with the Commonwealth.",80
195,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wannon) [8.31] - 1 hope that the Minister will see his way to entitled accept this amendment, because it embodies to a principle for which honourable members though the money in this House and in other Parliaments have fought for many years. It embodies what is a plank in most liberal programmes. It is a sensible application of the betterexpenditure ment principle which has been advocated over the British Empire. To my mind it would be a mistake if , when this Federal Parliament, had an opportunitv of tfliis kind, it refused to adopt the betterment principle. A Government professing such the construction of the line. markedly liberal tendencies as that now office would be wise to accept it in order show that it is in touch with democratic thought. Even in Russia the land question has assumed enormous dimensions. This this Bill . amendment, in its humble way, also deals with that important question. mean that anv increase in value given the land by the expenditure of the Comsufficient monwealth will be secured for the benefit of the raihvay line. That is a principle which I believe every member of the sent Government has advocated on platnot forms innumerable; and for the life of T cannot understand why it should not meet with the most cordial acceptance from Minister of Home Affairs. I urge him to consider whether the Government cannot, in accordance with its previous declarations, accept the amendment, and prevent therather appalling change'of front which would come about if on. a division its members were found to have voted against it.",81
196,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Moira) [8.34] - I hope that the Government will give attention to the request that has been preferred. It may be that, under the existing condition of affairs, when neither Government nor individuals seem to think it necessary to give serious attention to the finances, it is not of much use to appeal to them-es pecially after the statement which has been made today, that our expenditure has Hav- jumped up by half-a-million pounds a year, and that it is proposed to forego charges for services rendered which will approximate to something like £250,000. In view of such facts, an expenditure of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 does not seem to be of much concern.",81
197,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"-Then this amendment is moved with the object of killing the Bill , is it?",81
198,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have not said so, but the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is to his own opinion as what its effect will be. A l involved in this Bill is merely such a sum as might be paid out of one's waistcoat pocket, so to speak, yet it would commit this Parliament to an of over ,£5,000,000. It might, all therefore, be as well to exercise a little foresight. Of course, it is true as already stated that until both South Australia and Western Australia give their consent, the survey is all that can be undertaken towards But, in my in humble judgment, nothing like a complete to survey, showing the possibilities of the vast tract of country concerned, can be made for anything like the sum set down in Our experience of railway surveys in the States^ which are It will our only reliable guide, do not bear out to the assumption that .£20,000 would be for a complete investigation of approximately 1,000 miles of country. But, assuming that the Government is warpreranted in undertaking the survey, we are doing too much, in providing that those me who are most vitally concerned, the. States through which the line will pass, shall give the some assurance of their bona fides. Personally, I think that there is no warrant for the construction of the railway, and that the best interests of Western Australia would be served by tapping the country nearest to a seaport from the large and import centres cn the gold-fields of Western Australia. But from the point of view of vested interests such a proposal might not be politic.",81
199,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The gold-fields people are as enthusiastic about this railway. as are the Perth people. Mr KENNEDY. - When people expect to obtain a benefit at the expense of some one else they will naturally reach out for it. That is a characteristic which is as inherent in the Victorian as in the Western Australian miner. It is human nature the world over. But that is no justification for Parliament committing itself without due consideration. I hope that the Government will safeguard the position by requiring thei two States concerned to give us some assurance of their bona fides. That they can do by transferring the land abutting on the proposed line to the control of, the Commonwealth. It may be that the land is not of great value now, but if, the line is constructed, it will have a value; and we should have some guarantee, because the estimates which we now have show that there will be a considerable loss if the line is built. The first thing required is the assent of the two States which are cliieflv interested in this proposal to the construction of the line. The assent of Western Australia is not in question, but we know from the correspondence which has taken place between the Commonwealth and the Government of South Australia that the latter State will not assent to the construction of the line, even at the expense of the Commonwealth, unless a particular route be followed. Assuming, therefore, that a survey, - be made of another route, which does not meet with the approval of South Australia, what will be the result? The money expended upon the survey will have been practically wasted. That is a further reason why the Government should have some assurance from these States that the Commonwealth, will be safeguarded if the railwav be constructed. If they declined! to vest in the Commonwealth an area of 25 miles, upon each side of the line, perhaps they might be willing to grant to the Commonwealth alternate blocks. At anv rate, it would be an evidence of the belief of South Australia and Western Australia that the undertaking would eventually prove to be a profitable one. In short, it would be a guarantee of their good faith. I feel, however, that, rightly or wrongly, the Government intend to undertake this survey. I realise that it is almost useless to appeal to them not to do so. I do hope, however, that, in their saner moments, they will-befor e the Bill is finally disposed of-tak e into consideration the view which I have presented. It is a strange coincidence that every Government which, has been in power has seen fit to submit a Bill dealing with the proposed line. But in this, as in most other matters, numbers count for everything, and we know from experience that the Government command the requisite numbers. At the same time, they must recognise that it is only the righteousness of a cause which will enable them to hold the numbers together. I ask them why they cannot accept the amendment? Do they intend, by means of their majority, to force this undertaking upon an unwilling country ?",82
200,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a strong statement to make.,82
201,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I feel positive of its accuracy. Only at the last election it was the trump card used by the leader of the Opposition in Western Australia. His cry was, "" Vote for Reid and the transcontinental railway.""",82
202,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And he did not get a single supporter there.,82
203,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is strange that he saw the necessity of going to Western Australia and making that statement, and it is a .peculiar circumstance that other leaders have done the same thin"".",82
204,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The man who did not £0 there received the largest, measure of support.",82
205,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The undertaking was part of the policy of the first Government of which the present Prime Minister was a member. The Barton Administration practicallv introduced a Bill to authorize the construction of the line itself. Since then Ministers have toned down somewhat, because they realized that in the absence of all information they could not face the country if they committed such an outrageous act. Mr GROOM! (Darling Downs-Min ister of Home Affairs^ [8.46] - I recognise that the honourable member for Moira is opposing this Bill in the belief that it is not a. righteous proposal, and I am sure that he will give the Government credit for believing just as firmly that it is, and that it is a proposal which Western Australia is entitled to have considered upon its merits. The honourable member has dealt with this measure in a different way from that adopted by some honourable members who, by means of a series of amendments, have endeavoured to block its passage.",82
206,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I rise to a point of order. I should like your ruling, sir, as to whether the Minister is in order in imputing motives to members of the Opposition. His statement is certainly calculated to detrimentally affect the prospective success of the amend'ment ?",83
207,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I did not catch the words of the Minister, but certainly if he has attributed motives i o any honourable member he is not in order, and should withdraw his statement.",83
208,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I apologize and withdraw. It now appears that the honourable member for Wentworth is desirous of assisting in the passage of the Bill . He has already voted against it, but has now repented of his folly. I am glad that he has become converted. I ask the honourable member for Moira not to assist in inserting in the Bill an amendment which is utterly alien to its provisions. The measure simply seeks the authorization of Parliament to the expenditure of a certain sum upon the survey of a route, whereas the amendment proposes that, in connection with that survey, we shall permanently appropriate part of the estate of Western Australia. When it was pointed out to Western Australia that it was desirable that they should reserve the land abutting upon the line from .sale, pending the passing of this Bill, both Houses of its State Parliament passed the following resolution :That, in the opinion of this House, the Government should at once reserve from sale all rural Crown lands for twenty-five miles on each side of the proposed route of the transcontinental railway, between Kalgoorlie and the eastern boundary of the State, with a view of facilitating the construction of the said railwav, and that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth be so advised.",83
209,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will that have of reserving these lands from sale? Mr GROOM.' - At this stage, honourable members are merely asked to authorize the survey of a route. When Western Australia is asked to sanction the construction of the line, it will be for her to take whatever action she may deem to be necessary. The honourable member is seeking to introduce a series of inconsistencies into the Bill to make it more difficult for the Government to get it passed. The Western Australian Parliament have throughout, in connection, with this matter, dealt with us in a fairly generous spirit, and in connection with such an important measure we should treat them in a similar way. Honourable members should consider that at this stage we are asking merely that an investigation shall be made. When it is made, and we have ithe survey of the propostedl line from point to point, we shall be in a better position to consider the advisability of taking any further action in the direction of meeting the wishes of the people of Western Australia. We are entitled to treat the people of that State withsome courtesy. They made no bargain about this matter; they came into the Federation freely, but believing, at the same time, that certain inducements held out to them would be fulfilled. It would appear now that some honourable members desire that we should make a bargain with them in connection with the construction of the proposed line; that we should say that we will agree to the survey of the line only i'f they will agree to do this, that, and the other thing. They are asking that these conditions shall be imposed even before we know the nature of the' route, andi before the advisability of constructing the line has been considered. I think that we can rely upon the good faith of the people of Western Australia, as expressed in the resolutions carried in their State Parliament.",83
210,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Would any sane business man have done otherwise than is contemplated in the telegram referred to, in view of the possibility of the line being, made ?",83
211,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The resolution passed by the Western Australian Parliament shows that, although the people of Western Australia are not required to do it, they are prepared to meet the Commonwealth as far as possible.",83
212,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They have undertaken, also, to duplicate the line between Kalthe effect goorlie and Fremantle.",83
213,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They have passed a Bill in their State Parliament providing that,, in the event of the standard gauge of 4 f t . 8J in. heing adopted, they will impose uponthemselves the additional expense of duplicating the line on a uniform gauge straight through from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle.. They have also, in addition, provided for certain indemnities to South Australia.",83
214,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They have promised to act generously in connection with any loss on the working of the line.,84
215,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,In every possible way they have shown their willingness to act generously.,84
216,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They have offered too much.,84
217,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I will not say that they have offered too much, but they have treated us generously, and we should be generous in our treatment of them in return.",84
218,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wentworth) [8.54] - The Minister has told us of the enormous sacri J (ices which the people of Western Australia are prepared to make in this matter, but he concludled by saying that they are not prepared to put their undertaking into writing in the terms of my amendment. The honourable and learned gentleman has greatly over-estimated the extraordinary nature of the surrender proposed by Western Australia in this regard. This line will pass through 450 miles of Western Australian territory; that, multiplied by fifty miles, will give an area of 14,400,000 acres. If all this land were taken up at the maximum rental obtained' in the West for similar country, it would yield a revenue of only £7,200 per annum. The experts intrusted with the matter by the Commonwealth have estimated that the deficit to be expected from this line, arising from the excess of working expenses and interest charges over gross revenue, will amount to £70,000 per annum. Therefore, the great sacrifice which Western Australia is prepared to make, and which the Minister thinks should be sufficient to induce us, as the trustees of the payers of the Commonwealth, to withdraw all other objections to the proposal, is a sacrifice equal only to one-tenth of the actual annual loss which the taxpayers of the Commonwealth will have to bear in connection with the running of the line.",84
219,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They do not propose to sacrifice the rental value. They say only that they will not alienate this land until such time as the line is made when the value of it will possibly be enhanced.,84
220,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I was assuming that they would act up to the spirit behind the offer made, but I admit that, as the honourable member for Moira points out. there is no guarantee that they will allow the Commonwealth to secure the advantage of any enhanced value given to this land by the construction of the line. The Treasurer, whose presence I welcome, has on some. occasions expressed profound distrust of the methods proposed by certain sections of Australian political parties.",84
221,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the right honourable gentleman follow the honourable member?,84
222,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have something better to do. »,84
223,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I refer to certain closer settlement proposals. Here we have an opportunity to start afresh. If the amendment is accepted, no graduated land tax will ever be necessary in connection with the area involved, because we shall retain the enhanced value given to this land by the construction of the line. The Commonwealth is being pledged to an expenditure of nearly £5,000,000, and it is only reasonable that we should ask for some guarantee in return. The Minister is not prepared to give any guarantee. He is a representative of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, and not merely of Western Australia, who are no doubt anxious, if they can, to get some one else to bear their burden; and yet he has absolutely refused to agree to insert a simple provision of this character. He informs honourable members that it is entirely foreig.ni to the measure.. If it is, the blot is upon the measure itself, because the more safeguards we have the better in dealing with a measure of this kind. I regret that it has been necessary for me to rise again to urge upon the Minister the advisability of accepting my amendment. I feel sure that if the honourable and learned gentleman will not accept this amendment he will accept taxsome' proposition of a similar nature. I hope that honourable members will help me to divide the Committee on the amendment, and to see that every possible safeguard shall be provided for.

224,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA," In the final report of the Engineers-in-Chief the following passage occurs:We understand that the Gawler range route is regarded unfavorably by the South Australian Government; while the Tarcoola route is preferred, .owing to the prospect of probable future development of the district, and as best serving the traffic which will result. For these reasons we have put on one side the further consideration of the Gawler range route, although it might prove to be 60 miles shorter, and presumably proportionately less costly. That statement leads me to move That after the word ""may,"" line 1, the following words be inserted :- "" So soon as the States of South Australia and Western Australia have given an undertaking to permit and facilitate the eventual construction of the line by the Commonwealth over whatever route it may select."" My object is to enable the Commonwealth to decide, on the advice of its engineers, what route shall be taken. We have been told over and over again that the main reason why the Commonwealth, should construct the railway lies in the national character of the undertaking, and, If that is so, its route should be determined by the Commonwealth authority.

225,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Moira) [9.14] - I wish to know what ground the Minister has for the assumption that the expenditure of ,£20,000 upon the proposed survey will result in our being furnished with reliable data in the light of which we can consider the proposal for the construction of the line. The experience gained in various States with regard to railway surveys would lead us to conclude that the amount proposed to be expended will scarcely cover the cost of a flying survey. In Victoria, something like ,£400,000 has been spent upon flying surveys. That amount has been absolutely wasted, because a flying survey does not enable any one to form even an approximate idea of the cost of constructing a line, or the possibilities of the surrounding country. I have looked : through the reports in connection with the proposed survey, and I have failed to find any statement by a reputable authority that the expenditure of £20,000 upon a survey would lead to our being supplied with reliable data. We know very well that alternative routes have been suggested over a considerable portion of the distance between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta, and I presume that close investigation will be neces... 2 sary to enable us to arrive at a conclusion ... 27 as to which of these will be the better one to follow. Consequently, I think it is only right that honourable members should know 2 5 whose advice has been followed in fixing upon the amount of ,£20,000.",85
226,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [9.17] - The sum of £ 2 0 . 0 0 0 was fixed upon the advice of the Chief Engineers of the States, who had previously reported upon the proposed railway. That was the best advice that was available to us> and I have no doubt that the sum provided for will prove sufficient.",86
227,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wentworth) [9.18] - I should 1 iike to know what will be done in the event of the cost of the survey exceeding the sum provided for in the Bill . Will the Minister ask Parliament to make a further grant, or will he abandon the survey ?",86
228,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [9.19] - The strongest endeavours are always made to keep the expenditure within the sum voted by Parliament. As I have stated, we have been advised by experts of considerable standing that ,£20,000 will be sufficient. If any further money is required, the authority of Parliament must be sought before anv additional expenditure takes place. assure the honourable member that every effort will be made to keep the expenditure within the sum provided.",86
229,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Moira) [9.20] - It is not my intention to "" stonewall "" this measure, but I think that I am justified in expressing my opinions. Having looked up all the available information on the question, and having had some experience in regard to the cost of contemplated works in other directions, I know that,-although Parliament may vote only £ 2 0 , 0 0 0, the work, even if it costs .£.100,000, must be carried to a completion. It is strange that no engineer has stated that £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 will be sufficient.",86
230,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Mr Kernot has said so.,86
231,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What has been said is, in effect, that for the money proposed there may be a flying survey.",86
232,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We ' shall lot for £ 2 0 , 0 0 0, which is £ 2 0 a mile.",86
233,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No doubt we shall get a lot, but we should get a lot more for £100,000.",86
234,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We do not require ,£100,000.",86
235,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member for Moira can move to increase the amount.,86
236,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"T shall not H because I know it would be absolutely [72] useless. What I sav is that one of the most experienced men we have ir. Victoria, in regard to this particular class of work, has stated, after careful investigation, that £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 would be a reasonable sum to expend in obtaining the information necessary in regard to this particular route.",86
237,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That was the way mone\ used to be spent in the good old days in Victoria, but we do not do that over our wav.",86
238,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know that work can be done much more cheaply today than it could twenty years ago, either in the way of survey or in carrying out public works such as the construction of a railway. I desire to direct attention to the fact that what is known as a flying survey is not a reliable guide today as to the cost of the construction of a railway. I object to the Government proposing to spend £20.000 when it is apparent to any man of experience, or of a practical turn of mind, that we cannot get for that amount the inforI can mation necessary to guide us. Anv reputable engineer would, I think, tell us .that £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 is not sufficient, and that, before we.get the information, the cost will be at least £ 8 0 , 000. So far as T am concerned, I have no further remarks to make. Mv whole opposition to the Bill is based on the ground that the survey should be made by the States concerned. As to the other proposal, I shall deal with it after the survey has been made. From reliable information, I feel confident that if this survey is undertaken, this or some other Government will have to ask for an increased amount.

239,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Swan-Trea surer) [9.26J - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is to amend the Audit Act IQOI . There are several matters dealt with that so, are of some importance in the keep0 ing of the public accounts, but I do not think that any of .them need sold cause much discussion. Clause 3 merely proand vides for a change in the term "" public countants."" It appears that the Incorporchases ated Institute of Accountants protest against the use of this term, which is generally to describe persons who hold high qualifithe cations in accountancy. By clause 4 it desired to take authority for establishing a guarantee fund. There is such authority at present in the Public Service Act, does not apply to members of the Defence Forces,' and to other persons exempt from the provisions of that Act. Clause 5 is provision to save exchange. Under this clause postmasters will be authorized use money, received for money orders, payment of salaries and other expenses, instead of remitting the money to head-^Federal quarters. Proper adjustment will, of course, be made by paying the amount such payments into the money order acWages count at head-quarters. That has been done in several of the States already, a.nd is found to be a convenient plan, which saves the transfer of money, and, therefore,.saves the cost of exchange. Clause 6 is to meet a difficulty which has been experienced making payments in distant parts of the States. Clause 7 deals with lapsed votes in regard to the Militia. At present, votes lapse on the 30th June, and any money which is earned by the Militia, and which is on that date in the hands of the comofficers manding officers for payment to the has to be returned to head-quarters. To place the commanding officers again in funds after the 30th June would take time, and before it could be. done many of men would make unsuccessful claims for their pay.

The principal clause of the Bill clause 13, which is to legalize certain counts which have been in existence for in some time.

In connection with all of these, material Sir John Forrest. to members of rifle clubs and others, the proceeds of the sales are paid! into acthe accounts,- in order that the fresh purmade by the Government mav be paid for out of such proceeds. A strict used reading of the law would probably require proceeds to be paid into revenue, and the is fresh purchases to be charged to a vote of Parliament. Such a course would, however, show the expenditure of the Commonbut it wealth as much more than the amount which is really borne by the general taxation of the people; and it is thought that a these special receipts should be devoted wholly to the purpose of replacing the to goods sold. This practice was followed in by Victoria and Queensland before the Defence Department was transferred to the control. The Government Printer's Account is also a trading account, but is of used principally as a suspense account. and material are paid for from the account, and, .when the work is complete, it transfer entries are made in the books, charging the votes of the various Departments and relieving the Trust Account.

If , for inslance, a sum of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 were appropriated for a specific purpose, but proved insufficient, and a vote in respect to another purpose were in excess of requirements, would the Treasurer be at liberty under this provision to transfer the amount in excess of the sum required from the one purpose to the other ? Sir JOHN FORRES T (Swan-Trea surer)'[9.37] - Unde r the Audit Act the transfer of one item to another in the same subdivision of the Estimates is permissible. This clause 30A is not intended to meet such' cases. As I understand it , the intention is that when a Department applies to the It is Treasurer for an increase in respect to an I may item or for any expenditure not under the Appropriation Act, and the Treasurer approves of the amount so required being charged against the Treasurer's Advance, that amount, instead of being kept in a separate account against the Treasurer's Advance, may be debited at once to the sub-head or vote in the Estimates to which it relates.",88
245,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What would be the position if there were no vote on the Estimates?,88
246,Sir TOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In that case we should have to create a vote from the Treasurer's Advance. That is done towards the end of the financial year. The books are closed on 30th June in each year, and where cases of this kind arise the amounts have to be advanced by the Treasurer out of what is known as ' Advance to the Trea- 1 surer."" They have then to be debited to the particular sub-heading to which they relate, in order that the public accounts may be so presented to the House as to show properlv the expenditure under every heading. That system has always been f o l lowed. It is now proposed to make a short cut, rather than to wait until the end of the vear. In Western Australia we always charged the item at once to the vote or sub-head. Under the Federal system, however, that has not been customary. It is much more simple and sensible to charge the item against the vote at once.",88
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Ye s j tout why has it not been done?,88
248,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Because there was some question as to whether, under the Audit Act, it could be done legally. It is now proposed to take the necessary power for that purpose. Without telling tales out of school, I think I can sav that, as a matter of fact, it has often been done. It is the right thing to charge the vote straight away rather than keep a separate account of the advance, and at the end of the year allocate it, because it will save double work.",88
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parramatta) [9.41] - 1 could quite understand what the Treasurer says if this were a direction to expend votes which had been appropriated, but it relates to expenditure in excess of specific appropriations.",89

274,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wentworth) .[9.46] - I hope that the Treasurer will bear with me while 1 endeavour to carry out a promise I made to the honourable member for Lang to move an amendment to the proposed new section 36c. The object of the amendment is to bring about a healthy state of financing, by which the House will know definitely for what purpose it is voting money. In his report for the year ending 30th June, 10-05, the Auditor-General saysA number of repayments and recoveries amounts, included in the expenditure of previous years, and amounting in the aggregate to .£2,000, were made during the year 1904-5. The Treasury departed from the practice hitherto force of crediting these receipts to revenue, placed them to the credit of the then current votes corresponding to those of previous years. This alteration of practice amounted. to an appropriation in aid of votes, or in reduction of expenditure, without parliamentary authority, and upon exception being taken, the Secretary to the Treasury advised that an amendment of the Audit Act would be sought to authorize such credits. Undoubtedly the object which is sought to be attained by this Bill is to authorize such credits. The Auditor-General, who is an independent arbiter in these matters, has said that the alteration of the practice virtually amounts to an appropriation in aid of votes, or Ln, reduction of expenditure, without parliamentary authority. I think that the Committee should be extremely careful before it takes a step of that kind. The honourable member for Lang, who unfortunately is unable to be here today, has asked me to move an amendment. The Bill has been, reached so unexpected Iv to-night that I have not had an opportunity to look through his voluminous notes, but I commend the amendment, which is in print, to the attention of the Committee, especially the Treasurer, who, I have no doubt, will be able to accept it. It is as follows:Clause 8. In proposed new section 36c, omit all the words after the word ""closed,"" with a view to the insertion of the following in place thereof : "" shall be crediterl to revenue on account of appropriation of former years. Provided, however, that any amounts credited to expenditure during the financial vear mo;-6 may, with the consent of the Treasurer, after favourable report from the Auditor-General, be allowed - to remain in credit. The effect of the adoption of this amendment would be to compel unexpended sums in any one year to be re-credited to revenue, except in cases in which the Auditor-General would permit their expenditure in the ensuing year. Under the scheme to be legalized in this Bill this vear we mav vote £ 1 , 0 0 0 for the carrying out of a particular work. Only ,£200 may be expended this year. It may be that the work is a new post-office, and that it is discovered that £ 1 , 0 0 0 is more than sufficient. But, although £ 8 0 0 remains unexpended, the Government may next year come down with ""an item on the Estimates of £ 1 , 0 0 0. Members of Parliament may then overlook the fact that a previous vote of a similar amount has been made for of the same - purpose, and may not be aware that a portion of the money has been unabout expended. In that way, the Auditor-Genin eral points out, votes may be obtained pracand tically without the authority of Parliament.",90
275,Mr HUME COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Estimates always show re-votes.,90
276,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But the unexpended balances in one year can be used in the next. I am not at all sure that an unexpended balance could not be used for an entirely different purpose. It is an important point, and one which I hope the Treasurer will be able to meet.",90
277,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Swan) [9.52] The matter in question is not an important one, but there is a little confusion in regard to payments towards the end of the year as to which it is impossible to get in the accounts in time. A case in point would be wbere a State-say , Victoriapays a sum of money for the purpose of mails to New Zealand. Perhaps a good deal of that money should be paid by New South Wales. A credit is given on account of New South Wales, which would lessen the expenditure of Victoria if it were received iDefore the close of the financial vear. But if it is not received before such close, Victoria is charged with the whole expenditure, and afterwards gets a payment from New South Wales as revenue. Therebv the expenditure and revenue account is fictitiously enhanced. The difficulty could only appear at the end of the vear, when it is impossible to get in accounts in time to credit expenditure properly. As the balances are arranged at the end of every month, it is convenient, in order that the revenue and expenditure may not be fictitiously increased to have a provision whereby payments from the other States mav be taken in reduction of similar servicas for the ensuing vear. The difficulty has been found to be troublesome. The provision is not a very important one, but I think that what it attempts to do is reasonable. ,",90
278,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"North and Svdiiey) [9.55] - The Treasurer has pointed "" six."" out one of the purposes for which this provision is designed, but the question is whether, if we give this power, it will not only cover the case mentioned, but also apply to others in which it will be less sirable to extend such power to the Treasurer.
