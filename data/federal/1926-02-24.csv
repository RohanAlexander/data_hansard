MV. RODGEBS - Will the Prime Minister say whether full facilities are available for the export of apples sprayed with the usual solution for the prevention of codlin moth and.other pests? If objections that may not seem well-founded are taken against apples exported, will the right honourable gentleman bring under the notice of the oversea authorities, and particularly the British authorities, the fact that, whilst it has been the practice in this country for years to spray apples with an arsenic solution, no death has ever been reported as a result of it?",14
1,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"In 1903 a royal commission in Great Britain recommended that the consumption of apples imported into that country should be prohibited if they had on them more than 1-100th of a grain of arsenic per lb. of fruit. A regulation to that effect has been in force since then, and has not caused any difficulty. But recently certain apples from America, which contained a great deal of arsenic, were considered the cause of eases of illness, and the British Government announced its intention to apply the regulation rigidly. The Commonwealth Government has been in communication with the British Government on the subject. In no instance have Australian apples caused harm, and we are confident that there will be no trouble in connection with their exportation; but it is necessary in the interests of the producers that steps should be taken to prevent the possibility of trouble. Consequently, a rigid inspection of apples intended for export is beinfc carried out in compliance with the suggestion of the British Board of Health, and when apples bear a trace of arsenic spray, steps will be taken to remove the deleterious matter.

Mr D. CAMERON - In view of the statement made by Archbishop Duhig i Brisbane within the last few days, that Australia is being flooded with atheistic and immoral literature from abroad, I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to say exactly what power his department stigma cast upon it? has to prevent the introduction of such literature, and what is being done in that direction by the department?  been drawn to the remarks to which the honourable member refers. Section 52 of the Customs Act prohibits the importation of blasphemous, obscene, or indecent literature or works. There has been drawn up by the department a fairly long list of prohibited literature, and from time to time recommendations in the direction of prohibition come to the department, and are generally acted upon. The department will welcome any help in connection with the administration of this very difficult matter, as books and publications to the value of over £1,000,000 arc coming into the Oommonmaster-General wealth every year. If specific publicataken tions arc indicated, or other help in this interrupted ? direction is given by outsiders, the department will rigidly administer the law. TUBERCULOSIS. Ds. SMALPAGE'S TREATMENT.",15
4,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Will the Minister for Health kindly give the House the names of the medical men who have been appointed to select cases for the test of Dr Smalpage's treatment? Will he also whether any medical man may send a case for treatment, and, if so, to whom?",15
5,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,Unknown,"I shall be very pleased to mention the names perIslands sonally to the honourable member. I have ratified? been asked by the specialists not to publish their names, because to do so would, cause them to be inundated with letters. I , myself, receive some hundreds of the subject every week. If the specialists had to deal with a similar correno inspondence officers would have to be appointed to. assist them to deal with it.

AUSTRALIAN"" COMMONWEALTH LINE OF STEAMERS. SALE OF VESSELS-""BAY "" LINERS. Mr Charlton SCULLIN) asked the Prime Minister, upon notice In regard to the 54 vessels taken over hy the Commonwealth Shipping Board on the 1st September, 1023, will he state1. The names of the vessels sold to date, to whom sold, and the price paid for each ? 2. The names of the remaining vessels in commission, and those not in commission ? 3. Whether efforts are being made to sell any more; if so, what are the names of the vessels intended for sale, and the names of the vessels not for sale ? 4. What prolit has been made by the "" B a y "" liners to date?",15
12,Mr BRUCE,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"I have communicated the honourable member's questions to the Australian C o m m o n w e a l th B o a r d for advice, ancl hope to be i u a p o s it i on to give him the desired in for m at i o n at an early date. On the 18th F e b r u a r y , the honourable member for Hume Moloney) asked the following questions :1. How many vessels of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers have been disposed of? 2. What was the sum realized for each boat? 3. What was the original cost to the Commonwealth of each of these vessels? 4. How many vessels still remain in possession of the Government? I now desire to in for m the honourable member that the replies to his questions are as f o l l o w : 1. Forty-three vessels have been disposed of by the Commonwealth Shipping Board. 2. and 3. The Commonwealth Shipping Board considers it undesirable to quote in detail the sale and original cost prices of each ship, as this might prejudice negotiations at present proceeding.

Whether the rifles at present issued to rifle clubs are of a miscellaneous pattern! 2. If so, will he consider the advisability of issuing rifles of uniform pattern to rifle clubs? - Sir NEVILLE HOWSE - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. Rifle clubs arc supplied with magazine Lee Enfield Mark I . * rifles, but it has been necessary owing to these weapons not being available in sufficient numbers for members of rifle clubs to use a certain number of Martin i Enfield rifles. 2. Approval has beeu gi,ven to issue a limited number of short magazine Lec Enfield rifles on loan to clubs, but it is not practicable at the present, juncture to set aside a sufficient number of these rifles to enable the issue of a uniform pattern to rifle clubs to 'be made.

Has the Board of Trade made any recommendation to the Government re financial assistance towards the establishment of a textile school at Geelong, as reported upon by Professor Barker ?  mendation ?",16

Provided that such order may only be made before, or within three months after, the expiration, of any period of imprisonment to which the offender has been sentenced for the offence, or, if the offender was not sentenced to imprisonment, within three months after his conviction for the offence. The Attorney-General may make an order before the term of a man's i m prisonment has expired or with in three months after it has expired, and the man may then be deported.",16

16,Mr SCULLIN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Yes . But under the latter portion of the proviso, although man's offence may not have been thought by the judge sufficiently serious even warrant imprisonment, if a conviction is recorded against him he may be deported. I bring this fact under the attention honourable members in order to show how be deported. drastic this legislation is, and urge that these machinery clauses which cover the whole of the deportation provisions of bill be rejected.",17
17,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Maribyrnong) [3.15]. - As I have already said, the Attorneythe General has thrown into this chamber and the country the apple of discord. Prothousands posed section 3 0 N will impose a penalty of £100 on a ship-owner who refuses to provide a passage for any person who ordered to be deported. I am sure that trouble the British .seamen belonging to the union controlled by Mr Havelock Wilson would refuse to carry away from Ausindustrial trouble "" ? tralia any person ordered to be deported for having taken part in an. indiistrial trouble. I believe that even the Lascars engaged on British boats would turn against legislation of this kind.",17

19,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"The honourable member need not worry about rebels. This bill adds twenty new offences to the.crimilia. nal code, and the excuse for this is that it is the duty of the Government to carry out its mandate from the people. I deny that the Government has received a to mandate to introduce this class of legisnot lation. I am certain the people would not sanction it .",17
20,Mr LATHAM,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"This clause deals three classes of offences only, namely, those under proposed new sections 30c, 3 0 J , and 30Q.",17
21,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,It applies to those connected with industrial trouble. The Attorney-General admits that he is creating in this bill twenty new offences.,17

23,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"If the Government attempts to deport men for participating in industrial disputes, it will involve it self in trouble with seamen from every part of the world, including coloured seamen. Sailors sometimes convey objectionable cargo and passengers under a protest; but if the Attorney-General tries to deport the men whom this bill will to make criminals, both foreign and British sailors will refuse to man the ships that it is intended shall carry them. I am not of appealing on behalf of men who ought to Mr Cooic - Does the honourable memthe ber think that anybody should be deported ?",17

26,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Unfortunately , the Attorney-General has the right of deciding what constitutes a reason for deportation. I wonder what the Commonwealth will do with the seamen who decline to carry some of the passengers whom the Attorney-General will put upon their ships.",17
27,Mr FOSTER,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,The seamen decline now to carry merchandise away from Austra,17

The great war would have been won by the Allies without the aid of the mercantile marine, and some of the men who were imprisoned it) with the recent strike had served on transports that were torpedoed. Even the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr . Marks) protested against the harsh treatment of those men. I shall not allow any honourable member to revile the sailors, whether they be Australian or British.",17

32,Mr LATHAM,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,And I have said many times that the b i ll does not empower us can the honourable member have? to do that.,18

I was a young man when the great maritime strike occurred, and I would not have hesitated to do then many of the things for which, bill, I could be deported.",18
34,Mr COOK,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,Would the honourable member hinder others who were attempting io load the farmers' produce?,18
35,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"I would have hindered, or helped others to hinder, blacklegs who were taking the places unionists. I would have tipped them into the Yarra, or been tipped in by them. Honourable members do not realise what extensive powers they are giving to Attorney-General. Prior to the election, the editor of the Age denounced the those responsible for our election. Labour party, and wrote up the Nationalthe ists for all he was worth, but now, sitting calmly in his editorial sanctum, he is giving sound advice to the Attorneylation General. He is pointing out that when whole of the people? industrial trouble occurs and an attempt is made to deport the leaders thousands of men will be involved. All the trade election to this Parliament unions will rise to their support, so the seamen, and the Government will be at war with unionism in the mass. Not enough ships will be leaving Australia to take away all the men whom the Government will have to deport if it attempts to operate this law. I believe that Havelock Wilson, #ven though he is at loggerheads with Tom Walsh, will protest when this Government attempts to deport one of his countrymen.",18
36,Mr MARRS,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"If a man does any of the things specified in the bill as punishable by deportation, should he not be sent out. of the country?",18
37,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"If the honourable* member for Wentworth wishes to defend 1 the measure, and particularly the proposed sections to which I am objecting,, why does he not do so? It would bemore fitting to do so than to endeavour to trounce me by interjections. Perhaps the honourable member for Wentworth is r merely drawing attention to the fact that he is once more in the House.",18
38,Mr MARRS,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,That is not fair .,18

42,Mr MAKIN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Hindmarsh) [3.33] The bitterness displayed by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) shows how utterly futile it is to expect calm reasoning and common sense to prevail in the discussion of such an important of measure as this. The honourable member for Wakefield and other supporters of the Government are not amenable to reason. It would appear from the interjections the of honourable members opposite that wo have no right to express the opinions of Are members of the Government and their supporters the only persons who should have a voice in, framing the legiswhich has to be obeyed by the The members of the Opposition will exercise their rights on behalf of those responsible for their The prow ill posed new sections, which subvert the ^principles of British, justice, have a far-reaching effect. Neither the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) nor any other honourable member opposite will dare to assert that this Parliament has the right to discriminate between British subjects as is proposed in this bill. I am an Australian native, but as I . have the blood of an English mother and an English father coursing through - my veins, I realise the perils to which other Britishers are likely to be subjected by a measure such as this. I could not be regarded as a true Australian if I permitted such a discrimination ito be made without offering a strong pro"" test. I remind the honourable member for Wentworth that it is almost certain "".that, although the court may not impose .even a fine, the Attorney-General will .have the power to deport.",18

Persons found guilty of forself to that proposed new section. gery, splitting bank notes, larceny, and even murder cannot be deported; yet 'those who are in any way associated industrial unrest, which may have been caused by the unreasonable attitude of employers, may be brought before the court, and, if found guilty, deported.",19
45,Mr LATHAM,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"That is not provided i r.he bill. Mr A l AKIN - Then the Attorneythan General should explain the provisions the measure' more clearly. Certainly, he has not convinced the House that is not the strict principle underlying this legislation. I am not pared to give the Government the power to treat industrial offenders in a drastic way. A person guilty of gery, murder, or some other serious - crime may be fined or imprisoned; but an honest, hard working man who desires to improve the conditions of his fellowlaw. workmen may be subjected to the pains and penalites of deportation, which equivalent to civil death. Up to the prejurisprudence sent, the Attorney-General has not adciently duced any arguments which will weigh with reasonable men and those who desire that common sense shall prevail. Our laws should be such that they will be respected, and not held up to contempt as a measure such as this is likely to be.",19
46,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Batman) [3.40] The criticism that has been levelled at the whole of this clause has as its basis what I conceive ta be a very sound principle; that is, that the administration of the criminal law should not be influenced in any way by party political passion and prejudice. That simple statement of the case cannot be repeated too often, or with too great an emphasis. I can assure honourable members that there w i ll be constant repetition of it , and that it will be emphasized with all the force that we on this side have at our command, in order to make it clear that we reprobate that class of legislation. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr . n the Marks), in an outburst of enthusiasm that was as entertaining as it was unexpected, sought to justify the provisions we are now discussing by harking back to the proposed new section 30c, relates to unlawful associations, and makes an offence certain acts of violence by any citizen, including, it may be, the devotees of a particular political I have previously addressed myIts selection for his apologia by the honourable member for Wentworth is significant. with Apparently he believes that the provisions with which we are now dealing can be justified only in relation to the offences that are particularly enumerated in that proposed new section. The Labour party in both industrial and in n ternational matters favours reliance upon the force of argument and reason rather upon physical force and bloodshed. of It is open to argument whether persons who have been accepted by this country this as citizens, and have for a number of years discharged the duties of citizenship, prewhether they be British subjects or have undergone the process of naturalization, such are not as much our responsibility as forthose born in Australia. It is monstrous that men who have resided in Australia for many years should be liable to deportation under the operation of the criminal If such persons commit offences against the law they certainly should be is punished. Under our system of criminal the arm of the law is suffilong and strong to deal with them without resorting to the crude and brutal practice of exile, which was associated with the early history of this continent, and besmirched it with a stain of which it has not since been able to completely r i d itself. In the majority of instances those who were exiled from. Great. Britain puobably did not deserve that punishment. Thebetter class of Australian citizen desires to forget that men were brought out here under those conditions. We may leave the consideration of the proposed new section 30c, to which the honourable member for Wentworth displayed such fidelity, and devote our attention to those provisions that are at present before us, especially proposed new section 30L , which provides thatThe Attorney-General, may by order under his band direct that any person not born in Australia, convicted of any offence under section 30c, 30J, or 30'Q of this act shall be deported from the Commonwealth. It then sets out the time and the conditions under which such an order may be made. Taking that in conjunction with the proposed new section 3 0 J , it will be seen that a man may be imprisoned for a year, and afterwards deported on the order of an Attorney-General, swayed, as he must necessarily be, by that party prejudice and passion which, we must confess,' more or less influences every man in the stress and strain of political encounter. Whilst the committee was considering certain phases of this matter last Friday, the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) waxed indignant at criticism that I had passed upon him. I merely endeavoured to bring home to him the consequences of his vote npon these provisions. Honourable members opposite argue that if a crime is committed it does not matter whether the offender is an industrialist or any other member of the community. I am prepared to admit that the active trade unionist must obey the laws of this country equally with any other man, and that he is not entitled to protection, privilege, or immunity because of his membership of a trade union. If he does any act to advance the cause of his trade union, he is entitled merely to have that act examined under the searchlight of public policy and in its relation to the law. If he commits an offence he should be called upon to suffer for it . That is a general principle. But what view does the Government hold ? First of all it says that it reserves toitself the right to declare that there is in existence a. state of> serious industrial disturbance prejudicing; trade and commerce, &c. That is to be. the first condition in the administration: of this criminal law. The discretion in. regard to the issuing of such a proclamation will rest with the government of they day. If , for political considerations-, agovernment does not desire to apply these* provisions to certain persons who havec been involved in the commission of amoffence, all that Ministers will have to dowill be to "" sit t i g h t "" and say that no proclamation shall be issued. The veryfoundation of this legislation is corrupt..'",19
47,Mr BRUCE,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,Not corrupt!,20
48,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"It is corrupt. Whenever the administration of a criminal law rests upon the act of a government that is, or may be presumed-to be'; influenced by political considerations, it"" has a corrupt foundation.",20
49,Mr MATHEWS,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,At any rate if is tainted.,20
50,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"At its inception it is tainted sufficiently to raise at least a. strong suspicion. I ask the Attorney General (Mr Latham) to remember howf sensitive British courts have always been upon the subject of bias. Even asuspicion of bias is sufficient to arrest theaction of a judge or any other person, administering justice. There is no escape from this simple fact, that any member of any organization may be involved in the particular class of dispute contemtemplated by this proposed new section. A trade unionist, having laid' down the instruments of his toil after his day's work, and being present at a meeting of his trade union in the evening, and recording his vote with his fellow members, may, by so declaring that the rewards for the work in which he is engaged, or the conditions under which he is employed, are such that he will decline to accept them any longer, cause a stoppage of work. The acts of trade unions, it must be remembered, are always the acts of unionists acting in combination. There can be no unionism without combination, nor without loyalty on the part of the minority. The minority in trade unions must always act in that spirit of manliness which impels a man to give up his individual views and individual rights to achieve the greatest good for the greatest"" number. It does not require any stretch - of the imagination to see that atrade unionist, by recording his vote in this orderly and lawful manner- a vote based upon the highest principles of morality, justice, and self-sacrifice-ma y bring himself within the provisions of this proposed new section.",20
51,Mr MAKIN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,The honourable member  seem to worry about that.,21
52,Mr FOSTER,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,I have heard it all before.,21
53,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"No doubt; but it has not yet percolated through the honourable member's brain. At any rate, it seems to go in one ear and out of the other. I am not at all complimented by the fact that it is necessary to keep hammering away at this one point, that any trade unionist voting in such circumstances, and with such results, may become a felon and liable to imprisonment. In the past our arbitration courts have imposed punishment for .certain offences; but, generally speaking, it has heen upon organizations and not upon individuals. The penalties have been based upon this fact, that when arbitration for the settlement of a dispute is proceeding, it is unfair for one organization concerned in the matter to withdraw from the proceedings and use another weapon; that cannot be claimed as a true process of arbitration. Under this new proposal, however, the individual trade unionist who took part in a strike under certain circumstances would be liable to impriisonment' f OT twelve months, and at the conclusion of his sentence he might find the Attorney General waiting at the door of the prison to serve upon him an order for deportation from the country, notwithstanding that he may have acquired more right to citizenship here and have done more for the country than this leisured gentleman, this non-producer, whose signature is sufficient to bring about his deportation. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) seems to regard this as ludicrous.",21
54,Mr FOSTER,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,I do.,21
55,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Onl y those in his frame of mind could do so. The honourable member is incapable of taking a serious view of a serious subject, so we do not look for anything different from him. He thinks he can support this proposal, because he is one of a large majority; but not even he can afford a cynical smile about it. The honorablfc member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) invited a little criticism. I have tendered it.",21
56,Mr MARRS,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,I invited criticism of proposed new section 30c.,21
57,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"The honourable member must admit that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Fruit must be judged, not by the parts that are sound, but by those that are decayed. Even if there are some parts of this proposed new section that are fairly defensible, they do not justify the parts that are fundamentally wrong, and, in the opinion of honourable members on this side of the committee, vile. But the Government must take the responsibility for its proposals. Its docile followers are prepared to stand by and see the thing done.",21
58,The CHAIRMAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Mr Bayley) The honourable member is not in order in using the word "" docile"" in that connection. Mr BRENNAN' - I am surprised at that, sir; but I shall accept your ruling. Had I searched the whole dictionary, I feel sure that I should have failed to find a softer or gentler word than docile. I amend my remark by saying these obedient, these placid, followers of the Government.",21
59,The CHAIRMAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,Order ! The honourable member may not impute unworthy motives to other honourable members.,21
60,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"I withdraw my remark, sir. I shall not suggest that either placidity or docility characterizes those honourable members who support the Government. They may be depended upon, however, to assist the Government to place this iniquitous measure upon the statute-book. We, who speak for the workers and the expert handicraftsmen of this country who keep the wheels of industry going, shall oppose the proposal. It is regrettable that the Prime Minister, who could not have made his triumphal tour through the land without the help of the trade unionists on the trains, trams, motor cars, and every other means of conveyance, has acted so ungenerously as to revile the men who helped him.",21
61,Mr MAKIN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,The Prime Minister was not helped on the occasion of the contemplated trip down the bay recently.,22
62,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"-On that memorable occasion, certainly, he considered it discreet to remain in his office, and not risk being left ignominiously on the wharf, though his friends were in very unhappy circumstances - folde d up, I suppose-and succeeded",22
63,Mr MANN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"But none were so upset as the Labour members, among whom was the honourable member himself.",22

73,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Batman) [4.161:Even if it were possible to depend upon the magnanimity of the Prime 'Minister not to move the closure, have no desire to initiate at this stage a further general discussion regarding merits of this bill. But as its general principles are now, by the forms of the House, open to discussion, I desire to say It is obvious that if we are not acting the within the ambit of our constituFifty tional powers, everything that we have done is futile . Much that we have done is, in any case, mischievous. It has already been sufficiently argued from many points of view that it is objection- able. I do not propose to challenge the constitutional validity of this bill. So far as I am competent or equipped to form an opinion, it appears to me that the Government has, with a somewhat carefulness, filled up the various n chinks and interstices which were so evi) , dent in a measure which was before us in the last Parliament, and which rendered that legislation so utterly abortive. I can only express the hope that if the powers conferred by this bill are to be used to affect vitally the. liberty of the subject, as was the case with the legislabe tion to which I have referred, a little more care will be exercised than was manifested in connection with' that legislation. I must express my profound dis- appointment that the Attorney-General has thought fit to treat honourable members on this side with so little courtesy as to disregard altogether their arguleft ments on the second reading, and 'to - offer the not a single word in reply. Tha't, in any circumstances, would be somewhat unof the usual, and would show a want of regard for the best traditions of the House; but it is particularly so in view of the fact that when discussing a parallel bill on the which floor of the House previously, I deliberately charged the Attorney-General with having, either with grave carelessness, or wilfully, misled members of this House, and the country.",23
74,Mr SPEAKER,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND, The honourable member must not accuse another honourable member of having wilfully misled the House.,23
75,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"On e of the alternatives having now been removed, I am driven to say that the Attorney-General, with gross carelessness, misled members of this House and the country-member s of this House on the floor of this House, and the country in speeches which he delivered to his constituents. I charged I him with having referred in apparently considered terms to what is known as the the Irish Envoys case, with having quoted Mr Justice Isaacs in connection with that case, and - with having added that four judges concurred in the decision. Was it not a fair criticism to say that the only inference oue could draw from the Attorney-General's remarks was that those four judges had concurred in the statement quoted by him from the judgment of Mr Justice Isaacs! pointed out-and I was amazed to make the discovery-that , so far from that being the case, the decision of Mr Justice Isaacs on that point was a minority one, and was overborne by the majority of the court. That entirely but reversed the effect and force of the Minister's argument, turning it upon himself instead of allowing it to support his quotation. Unless the honourable gentleman treats members of the Opposition with contempt, and wishes it to be understood the people outside will take it for granted that learned counsel know more than general practitioners and laymen about this matter, one might suppose that the charge was worthy of refutation, if it could be refuted, and necessitated an explanation and an apology if it could not. The Attorney-General, however, preferred to take refuge in silence. Silence is said to be a virtue under certain circumstances; but in the face of a charge of that kind it may easily be understood to be something quite different. The Prime Minister, in speaking at various places, with more enthusiasm than knowledge of this subject, said that, after all, the legal luminaries of the Opposition had not had much to say upon the constitutional aspects of that measure while it was before the House. They were silent, he said, and he paid me the compliment of specially mentioning my name. The Attorney-General knows well, although, perhaps, the Prime Minister does not know it, that as a rule general practitioners defer upon questions of constitutional law to the experts and specialists who are assumed to have superior knowledge because they are making nice refinements on those matters almost every day of their lives. I confess to have been sufficiently influenced by the traditions of my professionwhich I , probably, should not be in politics - to accept as sound the views expressed by the Attorney-General and by the ex-Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom); but I regret to have to state witih emphasis that the views of both those distinguished gentlemen were found to be. radically wrong and misleading. They, were wrong in proportion to the emphasis and unction with which, these honourable gentlemen declared I themselves to be certain that they were right. And so I have to confess, in the first place, with due contrition, that to a certain extent I was "" bluffed "" and misled by those learned gentlemen. It is a humiliating confession to have to make, it is true. Still, independent judgment has come into play, because a little later I enjoyed the privilege of speaking on this subject in various places, notably before a large and enthusiastic gathering of university students; Their newspaper, Farrago, of the 11ththat September, 1925, contains the following, report-of my speech:Mr Brennan went on to say that he pro* posed to criticize on two grounds the Deporta* tion Act, which the Government had placed on the statute-book. There was the political and' human objection to the bill, and there was the legal and constitutional position to consider. Taking the latter question first, the point at issue was the legal power of the Commonwealth to permit immigration and to expedite the emigration of undesirables-or , in the language of his own electorate, "" to. let 'em in "" and to "" chuck 'em out."" The Government's power tb eject individuals who had been domiciled in Australia was seriously in questiou, and a more exact definition of its authority in this regard might be reached in the course of the proceedings now under way in Sydney. The speaker referred to the case of the Irish envoys, who were deported for sedition in 192a, as bearing on the cases of Messrs. Walsh and Johnson, inasmuch as the opinions of the learned justices of the High Court on that occasion seemed to indicate that the Commonwealth's powers of deportation extended only to persons who, in returning to Australia) could not be said to be returning "" home.?' It will be understood, of course, that this is an abridged report of my. speech. I do not accept it as being absolutely correct, but it is sufficiently accurate for my puca pose. The report continues The Government, hy its new act, hadabolished the three years' probationary periodin force prior to this year, thus making its powers more arbitrary, and resorting to force, instead of discussing the legal issue in a reasonable manner. Mr Justice Starke had'said', in 1022. that deportation was an instrument which sliould be employed only against persona ""who did not belong to the people of Australia."" The law aimed at and hit immigrants, and not members of the Australian community. It will be seen, therefore, that in rny oublio address to those university students I emphasized the effect of what appeared to be the main feature of the High Court's decision so far as it had application to the very men whom we knew perfectly well the Government was endeavouring to deport. As a matter of fact, at that very moment the Deportation Board was sitting. I need only add that it is noted with the utmost veracity that at the conclusion of my address I was loudly cheered. That would naturally be expected. About the same time - to be exact, on the 3rd September, 1925- I was honoured with an interview by a representative of the Melbourne Herald. I had forgotten that I had been so famous as to be given this space in the He r a l d ; but my attention was directed to the fact after the Prime Minister's observation. The interview was headed, "" Act valid. Real issue-Who is an immigrant? Mr Brennan's view."" That sums up the situation, let me say, in a nutshell. The statement that I then made was published before the High Court gave jits decision, and stated that the real issue was, "" Who was an immigrant?"" The report of the interview reads as follows:Specifying that iie was neither speaking for tlic Labour party, nor giving a legal opinion, Mr Brennan, M.H.R., said today that he believed the validity of the Deportation Act was established, so far as immigrants were concerned. "" But the question here,"" said Mr Brennan, "" is whether the persons concerned in the summonses are immigrants within the meaning of tin; aet. "" The Commonwealth's powers in this case seem to rest on the meaning of the word immi'rration in the Constitution. '-' The most striking High Court decision the point was that relating to the two Irish envoys. The point was then discussed as to what constitutes an immigrant, and whether ' once an immigrant, always an immigrant.' "" Mr Justice Higgins seemed to express mild surprise at finding himself to be still an immigrant; but, nevertheless, there are dicta (with persuasive power in future cases) in the decision of the Chief Justice which appear to show that the condition of being an immigrant is affected by duration of residence. The Chief Justice applies, as a test, the question, is the person entering the Commonwealth "" returning home""? and later on suggests that the three years' limit, during which proceedings, at that time, could be instituted, was a probationary period after which the immigrant became, established as a member of the community. Applying these considerations to the cases now under review, continued Mr. A'r. I'rrnvnv. Brennan, it would seem to strain the powers of the Commonwealth to their utmost to say that a Britisli - subject of 35 years' residence in Australia is still an immigrant within the meaning of the act giving deportation powers. The Commonwealth undoubtedly has very great, if riot unlimited, powers regarding who may come and go. And the best Australian view-point is that the"" greater the powers of the Nationalist Parliament the better for Australia. Certainly the Labour party does not welcome limitations on Commonwealth powers, imposed by judicial decisions, whether in law, right or wrong. I may add that that statement represents the view of the Labour party. We were less concerned with the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth under the Immigration Act passed last year than with its political implications and moral aspects. Our particular duty was to examine the act from those view-points rather than from the view-points of the niceties of constitutional argument. S t i ll I hope that I have made it abundantly clear that honourable members on this side have not been silent upon the' constitutional aspect of the act. Although I have never pretended to set myself up as an exponent of constitutional law, and have never, up to the time that the Prime M in ister challenged me in this regard, made any claim whatever to have said, "" I told you so "" or anything of that sort so far as the legal position was concerned, yet, since the challenge was made, I think that I have shown clearly that honourable members on this side were right, while the legal luminaries of the Government were absolutely and fundamentally wrong. For the life of me, I cannot to this day understand how honourable gentlemen opposite, when on the platform during the election campaign, deliberately on conveyed to the electors that Parliament had undoubted constitutional power to deport certain persons, knowing, as they must have known, what the position in tliose cases, and in particular the case to which I have referred, imported. During my second-reading speech I challenged the Attorney-General by asking him had he ever known a case in which, acting outside our constitutional powers, we had seized and imprisoned a man in this country. The Attorney-General preferred to make a* personal quip of the matter, and said that though my voice was loud, he did not hear me. I believe that he heard me, but it suited him not to reolv to my question. Any government that proposes to lay hands upon one of the subjects of the K i ng in this country must do it , just as the police force does, at its peril; it must have the lawful righ t to so act. No man should be thrown into prison in this country by an act of lawlessness, to be excused afterwards by the members of the Cabinet saying, "" We did not know that it was an unlawful act u n t i l the High Court decided that we were acting unlawfully."" The ordinary citizen is presumed to know the law. He acts at his He may not say, when charged with having broken the law, "" This is an obscure provision in a statute of which I have previously not heard, and about which I have had no legal advice."" A man acts at his peril.",23
76,Mr MAXWELL,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,It was not an unlawf u l act until declared to be so by the High Court.,26
77,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Does the honourable member really put forward that argument? I invite him to support that prinhave ciple of law and morality on the platable length, form , in this House, or elsewhere. I that it was an unlawful act. The H i Court does not make laws, but declares what the law is. It decides in cases doubt affecting persons what the Conthe stitution and what Parliament by its legislation import. The act of this vernment in seizing those men under those circumstances was lawless, and, more than that, it was done with a total disregard the law. It was done either carelessly and callously, or else wilfully, because, the members of the Ministry had opened their eyes to the legal position as already laid down by the courts, they must have known that they were doing something, the legality of which was, at least, doubtaspect f u l . That was the gravamen of my charge against the Government regarding the Immigration Act passed last year, and it is also related to this measure. Under the bill it is proposed to seize a man and to impose heavy penalties upon him, having done that to impose the further heavy penalty of exile from his own counthe try. I hope that the Government w i in future pick its steps with greater thereon. care than has characterized it in the readspast. I regret that this bill is to become part of the law of this ten country. It will remain so, I supthe pose, until the Labour party is returned to power. It will then be our proud privilege to strike from the statute-book this odious measure, under which honourable members opposite, and their friends, could be put in the same pillory as they intend to put the workers in ; but we shall not do that. The Labour party, I can safely promise, true to its principles of justice upon which democracy rests, will remove this measure from the statute book, and return to those elementary conditions of justice under which trade unionperil. ism in this country has expanded-trad e unionism, which means a fair deal between employer and employee, and which safeguards the right of the individual to work out, as a free man, his own destiny in his own country without acting in peril of being thrown into prison because he records a vote in favour of his wife and family, and fellowmen, assessing the value of his services and stating the price at which he will render those services to the person who wants them.",26
78,Mr SCULLIN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Y a r r a ) [4.39] - We discussed this bill, not at considerbut fair l y full y in this House, say and throughout the discussion the Gog h vernment has stubbornly opposed every suggestion put forward by honourable of members on this side in the interests of people of this country. It has refused to listen to any reason at all, and Gohas tried to bludgeon through a measure which it is determined shall be placed upon the statute-book, I believe, purely of and simply for political purposes. The final stage of this bill we shall further if resist. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has clearly in t i mated the view of the Labour party. He has repeated the opinions that he previously expressed on the constitutional of the bill. I do not propose to touch upon that subject, nor to deal in detail with the bill as a whole. I take this final opportunity of registering f u r ther objection to a measure which I believe will be regarded as a blot upon the and statute-book of this country. I was struck yesterday on taking up a copy of Ballarat Courier by a report of a rel l cent trial in Sydney, ancl some comments The paragraph I refer to In Sydney last week, a man was sentenced to years' imprisonment for attempted murder, presiding judge describing him as a brute in human shape and brutally regardless of the life of others. The prisoner was born in Holland, and came to Australia before 1914, in which year he was tried for wilful murder and acquitted. Seven years later he was charged witli attempting to kill, and owing to the nonappearance of the principal witness the prosecution collapsed, and he was acquitted. Now lie has heen brought up again, and sentenced to ten years' The newspaper from which I quote the paragraph goes on to ask the question whether this individual is liable to be deported or not. That is a very pertinent question. So far as I understand thp. existing law of this country, and the Crimes Bill now before us, there is no power, and there will be none when this bill is passed, to deport such a man if he is a naturalized British Under this bill, new crimes are to be created, such as the splitting of banknotes for the purpose of fraud; but there is nothing to provide that persons of the type of the man referred to in the paragraph quoted shall be deported, if they are naturalized British subjects, and have been in this country for three years. line of demarcation is drawn clearly and distinctly by the Government offences committed by bodies of working men fighting for better conditions, and those criminals who commit the vilest of crimes. Under certain the former can be deported, the latter can not. If there is anything which might show the political and industrial bias of the Government sible for the measure now under sideration, it is such a case as I have quoted. ""We have an immigration under which men can be deported, whether they are criminals or persons who advocate criminal acts; but men cannot be deported under that law if they have resided in Australia for three years, provided they have become British subjects. That is the qualification they require to be regarded as citizens of Australia who must be punished in Australia under our laws. No matter what crime has been committed murderous, brutal man of the type referred to in the paragraph I have quoted, if he is a naturalized British ject, with three years' residence, cannot be deported under any law we have, or under this bill when it becomes law. I could understand the ment saying that they would introduce a Mr SiaiHin. law to enable them to punish such persons by deportation, but they do not. do so; they maintain the distinction drawn in the existing law which says that no matter what crime a man may commit, if he has been three years in the country, and is a British subject, he must be punished imprisonment. in this country. That is what the Government stands for in regard to the punishment of criminals of the worse type; but when it is a question of dealing with men who commit, not crimes as we understand the term, but offences, in connection with industrial affairs, it takes up a different position. A man may get upon a platform, .and urge a body of men to strike for better conditions. The court trying him may decide that his subject. offence was so trivial as to be met with a fine of a few pounds; but the Attorney-General may under this diabolical law deport him from this country for the term of his natural life. That is what could happen under this bill. It indicates what we have come to in this country when honourable members oppoA site sit calmly behind the Government and say that they will stand for that. between But, they add, the law will not be put into operation if men do not break it . "" Y o u are champions of rebels,"" said the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr . conditions, Foster) to the honourable member for and Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). We are not champions of rebels or of criminals. The offence of stopping work committed respon- by men in combination fighting for betcon- ter conditions of employment is regarded by the Government as the worse crime law, that can be committed. Honourable members opposite say that men should not go on strike, becaues there are tribunals to deal with their grievances. In many cases we have no tribunal to deal with their grievances. In many cases naturalized such tribunals are denied them, not by the Labour party, but by the party opposed to Labour in this country. There are parts of Victoria where industries are being carried on, and where those emby a ployed in them have not the protection of a wages board or an arbitration court These means of protection have been deliberately denied to workers in these insubdustries by anti-Labour governments he Should these workers go out on strike in their fight for better conditions, they will be liable under legislation of this Govern- description. The other day the Prime Minister addressed a number of employers, and be asked them, """"What are you doing to preserve industrial peace?"" There was hope in an address of that description to employers that the Prime Minister was capable of considering both sides of the industrial question. I want to address the same question to the Prime Minister and his Government. What are they doing to preserve peace in this country ? They have done many things to disrupt it , aud nothing is more calculated to do so than the bill, the third reading of which we are now considering. Let me draw an illustration from what has occurred under a department of the Federal Government. The point I wish to make might be illustrated by a reference to an incident that occurred here recently, but which I shall not traverse now because it has been settled, and I have no wish to raise the question again. But I may refer to an incident in connection with a department of the Federal Government that has not been settled, and in connection with which a strike is impending. If in this particular case a strike occurs, it will be due to the administrative act of an official of the Government; I refer to the complaint of men who are working on the railway between Quorn and Oodnadatta, taken over by the Commonwealth. If those men go on strike, and they talk of doing. so, the Government may put up an industrial political stunt and issue a proclamation under this measure. The men have been working under certain conditions secured by proper constitutional means. The question now is not whether they are getting more or less than they are entitled to, but whether the Prime Minister and the Attorney General will say that men enjoying certain conditions under a South Australian award, on a railway taken over by the Commonwealth, shall have one of those conditions altered without reference to any industrial tribunal. Will any honourable member opposite say that that should be done? We talk in this .chamber about lockouts and strikes. We cannot find a man guilty of :a lockout because employers do not need to lock out their men. take direct action by altering the conditions under which their men called upon to work. They them to work under conditions which are objectionable to them, or to go on strike. Under a State award, the men on the railway from Quorn to Oodnadatta worked under certain conditions on Sunday trains, and without consultation or conference with the men, and without submitting the matter to any tribunal, the Commonwealth Commissioner for Railways by simply issuing a by-law, which he has the power to do, has materially altered the conditions. The Commissioner suggests that the conditions they have been enjoying are ridiculously generous. That is not for him to say, but for some industrial tribunal in this country. If he wants to alter the conditions under which the men have been working, why does he not, as a representative of the Government, adopt the constitutional method of asking the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court to vary the conditions? He has not done that, but has taken direct action by the issue of a by-law. His direct action does not lock out the men; but if the men resist it , and say lhat they will not work under the conditions he imposes, their action will amount to a strike, for which they may be liable to punishment under a law such --.s that we have now under consideration. This is the kind of thing that is occurring inside and outside the Public Service of Australia. What does the Railway Commissioner say in reply to the representations of the union in this case ? He says that if the men are not satisfied, let them file a plaint before the Arbitration Court. Is that not a fine state of affairs ? Here are men who have been working under the conditions of an award"" of the State, whose conditions have been altered without any consultation with them. As a matter of fact, a request by the men for a conference was point-blank refused. Their recent representations remained unanswered. The first representation made was answered by the Commissioner saying, "" If you are not satisfied with the conditions, file a plaint with the Arbitration Court."" Why should they be forced to file a plaint with the A r b i tration Court to get something which they already have under an award of a board, but which it is proposed to take from They them ? That is not the procedure in arbitration and industrial matters in this are country for which we should stand. The force procedure should be that p.ijsmg conditions should stand, no master by what tribunal they were awarded, arc? \ is : for those who desire to alter them to apply to an industrial tribunal for their variation. The Commonwealth Commissioner for Railways has reversed that procedure. The result is that a resolution been passed by the men that first time a Sunday train is proposed to be run from Quorn to they will refuse to run it under the altered conditions. That resolution is backed by the Federal Union of Railway Employees of Australia. What is the Government going to do when that stage is reached ? If the men go out on strike they will be just as guilty of breaking this law as any other men who are likely to be brought under it and They will have committed no offence beyond standing by au award under which they have worked for many years. cite this as an illustration of the way in which men may be provoked to strike in this country. When conditions which men have been working are altered to their disadvantage without tion with them, the only course left when arbitration is denied them, as it is in many cases, is to refuse to work under what they consider objectionable tions. Any of the semen can walk out and refuse to work, but if in combination they refuse to work, that be an offence under this In practice, men do not fight singlehanded if they can fight in combination. They do not take the weakest way of resisting things which they regard as an encroachment on their rights, but in combination they are prepared to resist every such encroachment. hundred years ago, the iniquitous bination laws of England were repealed and trade unions were legalized, right to combine and organize with it the right to act in in a fight for better conditions. working men have not parted with the right to strike; they have merely given up the desire to strike. Instead of striking, they are willing to arbitrate, and I venture to say that 98 per cent, of the men in our organizations today are willing to abide loyally by the decisions of an arbitration court. But bring those men up against a situation such as that which has just been brought about by the Commonwealth Commissioner ways, and they would have no choice but to say, "" If , without summoning Mr SciiWn. appear before a tribunal and bringing about a change in our working conditions in a legal way, you, by your direct action, alter the rules, regulations, and has conditions under which we work, we the also shall take direct action by declaring that we shall not work your trains under Oodnadatta the altered conditions."" No Sunday trains have yet been run on the Commonwealth railways under the altered conditions, but immediately it is found necessary to run them the men will refuse to work them, and a strike will be declared. The Government will then be able to deal with the men by issuing a proclamation under this statute. If it chooses deported. it can put them in gaol, and deport those who have not been born in Australia. I have given only one instance I among many to show how strikes are provoked by the employing classes themunder selves. I have never declared that the workers are always right and the emconsultaployers always wrong, but I have never yet heard the admission from the other side that the employers are ever wrong. I have experience of a quarter condi- of a century in the Labour movement, and I know that, in the overwhelming majority of cases, bodies of working men will do not lay down their tools and suffer measure. the consequences of that, action unless they have a real and just grievance. There is need in this country, as well as elsewhere in. this world, for peaceful conditions in industry. No country can prosper unless employers and employees work together in harWhen, a mony. There is in Australia a growing com- feeling throughout the trade union movement and among the employing the classes that our industrial system should carried be a little more humane, just, and haTcombination monious; but, as the honourable member The for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) has said, the Government has sought to counteract that feeling and bring about discord by the introduction of this bill. I know the psychology of the working man. The men with whom I mix are sound, logical, and reasonable men, who would fight to - the death in a class struggle; but at any moment they are willing to sit at a round-table conference and adjust all questions at issue in a sound, reasonable, of Rail- and logical way to arrive nt a peaceful conclusion. They are more likely to us to resent this type of legislation than are those whom honourable members are meet pleased to terra extremists. This legisdustrial lation will postpone for more years one can contemplate the day when shall get both sides to come together. It avoid victimization. will not accomplish what honourable members desire. It will be futile. I really big industrial upheaval occurs i Australia, the jails may be filled, but still there will be more to go hundreds may be deported, but still will be others to take their places. While we are striving to secure a bigger share of the fruits of industry for those who produce the wealth of the country, the growing desire in all sections of community to re-adjust conditions by conare stitutional and peaceful means will weakened, and in some minds' destroyed. By the introduction of this bill, the Government has not rendered a service to the community, and it will accomplish nothing by its enforcement. M T. MAKIN (Hindmarsh) [ 5 . 1 . ] regret that a measure which is a menace to the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth, and which, indusclass, trially, puts back the hands of time least 25 years, has advanced to its final stages. The Government shows a desire to revert to the old times when acts intimidation and fear of punishment by As despotic employers acted as a restraint and brighter upon those who desired to improve their working conditions. Although I may seem young in years, I have had bitter experienjoy ences as a unit in industry. I have known the tyranny of the employing class, and although my soul has not been empeople. bittered to the extent that I cannot see any redeeming features in the employers, I know how easy it is for managers and masters to impose upon those serving them tyrannical conditions that no person with any manhood or sense of honour would be prepared to tolerate for moment/. On one occasion, after moving a vote of thanks to parliamentary candiand dates, I was asked by my employer to power have been attended accept a wage reduction of 3s. a day. course, he merely desired me to refuse reduction, and leave the town. I obtries tained employment in another town 25 miles away. The same candidates admaximum dressed a meeting there, and on this occareward, sion I took the risk of seconding a vote of thanks to them. Immediately I was asked to take indefinite leave, and I have never been asked to return to the job. At times I and my fellows have had in secret to discuss political and in matters in. regard to which our than ideas were at variance with those of the we employers. Only in that way could we Honourable members will readily understand that emf a ployers of a certain class will use all the n economic power at their disposal to create circumstances which will make men liable in ; to punishment under this new law. there Remember, at all times the employing class is able to impose its will upon the workers. The economic weapons of unemployment and starvation are used to keep the workers humble, and any emthe ployee who gives expression to ideas that calculated to arouse his fellows to seek be an improvement in their conditions becomes at once subject to suppression and victimization.",26

The responsibility for the industrial unrest and dissatisfaction toof day lies mainly with the employers. the workers obtain a broader outlook, they desire to further improve their conditions, so that those dependent upon them may more of those amenities of l if e which a young and rich country like Australia should be able to provide for its Is such an endeavour to be regarded as a crime? Will the attainment of such an objective interfere with the prosperity and development of this great continent ?

In those counwhere the workers are' still downtrodden, and are obliged to yield the of effort for the minimum of industrial and general advancement is slow; the conservative and in humane employer, not only keeps his workers in subjection, but retards his own progress and prosperity. I reiterate the to warning given by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) regarding the way in which even a government dissatisfaction and precipitate an industrial crisis. The honourable member referred to the employees loaned to the Commonwealth by the South Government for work on the railway between Quorn and Oodnadatta. fairly well that country, and the trying conditions under which those men are required to work. Employees country are deprived of the comforts and amenities zation, and are separated from homes and families. They merely ask of the Commonwealth the same conditions as were awarded by a Australian tribunal to railway doing that class of work. If a cessation of work occurs there, not through any fault of the men, but because of deliberate interference by the Commonwealth with conditions awarded by a properlyconstituted tribunal, the status and accrued rights of these men in the South Australian service will be The Government should hesitate committing itself to a reduction of wages which may mean a serious injustice to employees who have been loaned by the State Government. If this were the only instance of the present Government's lack of consideration for the workers, we might repard it as a mere oversight or error; but only a fortnight ago honourable members of the Opposition had to complain in this House of a reduction of the wages of men employed by the Department of Defence, through the issue of a departmental lation which was in conflict with an award of the Arbitration Court. Only after considerable trouble, and several were the employees able to secure justice. I ol'ten wonder whether these disputes are caused by men who are trying to curry favour with their superiors. stand that the employment of officers "" is extending from the realms of private enterprise to Commonwealth vernment undertakings. I suppose that the industrial officer, in trying to justify his position, consciously or unconsciously invades the rights of other people. isters should accept a more direct responsibility in connection with these they should make themselves conversant with the conditions which their employees work. Do we not Mr Makin. remember that two years ago certain can cause Commonwealth public servants took their grievances before an arbitrator appointed by the present Government. The very circumstances of his appointment and his Australian dependence upon the Government of the day for au extension of his term of office I know must have made him unconsciously partisan ; yet even he awarded the j>ublic servants certain improvements of wages and in that conditions. Immediately the Public Sermany of vice Board reclassified the whole of the of civili- duties covered by the arbitrator's award. their The Government confirmed the act of the Public Service Board in depriving its own employees of the increased emoluSouth ments ancl improved conditions awarded employees by the Public Service Arbitrator. Notwithstanding this, and. other similar acts, the Government wonders why there should be industrial unrest and dissatisfaction, and why it should lose the services of some of its best officers; but there need be no expressions of surprise, because the Government does endangered. not appreciate its responsibility towards before its employees. Under regulations issued, men are to be deprived of additional emoluments for the performance of Sunday work, and if they are compelled to take the extreme step of going on strike in endeavouring to maintain the present standard, I shall support them. I shall fight for them, both on the floor of this House> and before the people. There are not only the men to whom I have referred, but there are others in the Commonwealth Service who are being most regu- unjustly treated, and whose means of redress are being restricted in every possible way. In any industrial unrest conferences, which threatens the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth, the interests of the employees are always disregarded, and those of the kings of comI under- merce, who, in the opinion of the Govern""industrial ment, are paramount to the king of the realm, are most closely conserved. My Go- indignation at legislation of this description cannot be adequately expressed in the language at my command. I have endeavoured to meet the situation in a Min- calm and temperate manner, but, as a representative of the people, I cannot allow matters; such unfair, unjust, and un-British legispersonally lation as the present bill to pass without under expressing m y strongest disapproval, and I shall always protest strongly when I consider that the rights and privileges of the people are seriously menaced.",30
81,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Maribyrnong) [5.19] The Attorney-General (Mr Latham) must be surprised at the somewhat unusual course adopted in further discussing the bill at this stage. The provisions of the measure, however, demand the fullest possible consideration. It is quite likely that when the Attorney-General replies he will refer to the statements made by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) concerning the attitude the Minister assumed on another measure which was so ignominiously pitchforked out by the High Court when it considered its constitutional aspect, and the manner in which it was administered.",32
82,Mr LATHAM,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,I propose to say some- retard it . thing about that.,32
83,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"We are told that a measure such as this is necessary in order to remedy some of the ills from which the community is suffering today, and that under the present Constitution we have the power to legislate in this way. If we have the power, why is profiteering and the exploitation of the public going on just as it has been for many years? I believe that on a previous occasion when I made a similar statement. I was challenged by the Prime Minister, who said that if the Commonwealth Parliament did legislate on certain specific matters, the legislation would probably be held to be unconstitutional. I member the late Mr Thomas Eyan - a legal authority of no mean repute, who - successfully upheld legislation before the High Court and the Privy Council-in forming the Prime Minister of the day that he could d r a f t a measure for dealing with such offences which he knew would be held by the High Court to be constitutional. The Attorney-General cannot recall the maritime strike, but as a youngster I can remember that great industrial upheaval, which affected not only the capital cities of the Commonwealth, but also the main provincial centres, and notwithstanding the unsettled industrial conditions which then existed, there was have a bad time. no mention of deportation. mild expression, the workers time were in a state of seething insubordination, and, as a result of that great industrial upheaval, which dispute that? was undoubtedly caused by the action of employers, the political labour movement was established. The site upon which the Melbourne Trades H all is situated was practically given to the trade unionist movement by the Victorian Government. Since then many measures affecting industrialists have been passed by the Commonwealth and State Parliaments, and there are only a few which can be regarded as dark blots on the statute-book. There is, for instance, what is known as the Irvine Coercion Act , which was, as I predicted, repealed by a succeeding Government. Similar legislative action was taken in New South Wales, where the result was the same as in Victoria. In stead of encouraging trade unionism and allowing it to develop to its fullest extent, this Government is doing everything to The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), and the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) referred to this measure as futile, and I believe it will be, because it will be found inoperative when an attempt is made to enforce it . Does the Attorney-General think that ' the trade unionists of Australia are likely to abandon their old system of organized effort? Trade unionists will always have their leaders. Reference has been made to the holding of secret ballots. As a member of a union for many years, I . know that certain matters are decided by a secret ballot of the members of the organization. Sometimes a ballot is preceded by a meeting of unionists, and, well re- if the meeting decides in favour of a secret ballot, such a ballot is held. The last secret ballot with which I was associated was on the question whether our union should vote a sum of money to help the Labour party at the recent elections. There is no need to ask how I voted on such a question.",32

92,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"That may be so, the Minister pooh-poohed the idea of member of a union being paid by an that organization supporting the Government. When a man joins a union, he is not pelled to hold a particular political opinion.",33

94,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"So far as I know, is.",33

I assume that in the legal profession every member has the right to move f o the amendment or the repeal of any rule of the organization. The Attorneyattached General (Mr Latham) may desire to have one of the rules amended. If he did, he would give notice of his intenpaper. tion to move that amendment. When it came forward, he would urge it with all the forensic ability that he possesses. But a majority of his brother legal men might not agree with him . If they feated his proposed amendment, he would have to abide by that decision.",33

98,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"I do not know of a better way than .the ballot for ascertainWhen ing the will of the majority. Mr Scullin,-Does the General propose to bring down legislation to prevent unionists from subscribing political funds?",33
99,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"I do not know whether the thoughts of the leaders of the National party are similar to those of some members of the Conservative party in Great Britain . So far, the Prime Minister of Great B r it a in (Mr Baldwin) has resisted the pressure which has been to induce him to legislate in a way that will prevent trade unionists from contributing to the funds of the Labour party. At a conference of the Conservative party that was held recently by in Great Britain , one of its foremost members announced that, if the Prime Minister would not introduce such a bill, he, as a private member, would do so. The but leaders of the National party, in Ausa tralia closely watch the various moves are made in Great Britain , and in recent years they have adopted similar commethods to attain their ends. I am a thorough believer in the organization of both employers and employees. A well organized community is easily governed. I need mention only two great organizations to demonstrate that point; they are he the trade unions and the friendly societies. Since I was married, I have had to start life afresh on about four occasions. I lost a government position because, as a member of the board of management of to my union, and a member of the Trades H all Council, I took a prominent part in The reason given for my dismissal, and that of other men, was "" the imperative necessity that existed for retrenchment."" A week later r I was re-employed as a casual hand. I u that capacity, I lost the privileges that to my permanent employment. The honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr . Scullin) has endeavoured to run a newsWe both can testify regarding the systematic boycott that is exercised against those who, in a newspaper, give expression to certain opinions. On one occasion, I stood for a metropolitan seat dein the State Parliament. The manager of the firm by whom I was employed said to me, "" As a matter of course, you can in your resignation, and I will hold it. When the election is over, if you are not successful, you can come back to your old position."" I did not w in the seat. I applied for my position, the manager said to me, "" I am very sorry, AttorneyFenton, but the directors do not care for your political opinions, and therefore your to position is filled."" Banking institutions exercise an influence upon their clients, many of whom have suffered pecuniarily because of the opinions that they hold.",33
100,Mr MANN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,The employers are not singular in exercising such an influence.,33
101,Mr SCULLI N,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"But the difference is that if an employee exercises it , he is liable to be punished under the Crimes Act.",33
102,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,Employer s can give numerous reasons for dispensing with the services of their employees. An employee may be promoted this month and be earmarked for dismissal the next.,34
103,Mr MANN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,There are hundreds of similar cases among the employees.,34
104,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Case s of 'that kind among employees are few compared with those among employers. There are in our community persons who exercise an influence upon some honourable members in this House, and who would hark back to the conditions that prevailed in the days before unionism was established in Australia. They would be delighted to have the opportunity to deal with every man individually. It is interesting, at times, to quote the opinions of spiritual leaders. At au Anglican congress that was held some years ago Dr Gore, then Bishop of Oxford, counselled churchmen to support trade unions, and to encourage agricultural labourers to obtain improved conditions. The Archbishop of York, Dr Cosmo Gordon Lang, at the same congress, attributed much of the indust r i a l unrest to "" the idle rich, whose selfishness and luxury are more responsible for the bitterness and discontent than are the agitators at whom they sneer."" Those are true words. I remember reading a paper, portion of which was published in the daily press, thatr was read by Mrs Carrington at an Anglican congress held in Melbourne eighteen months ago. Speaking of Australia, she saidThe arrogant methods of the rich did more to create bolsheviks in this country than any other influence she knew. That bore out what had been said by Dr Cosmo Gordon Lang. The Attorney-General makes the pretence that employers will be dealt with under this legislation because the word "" lockout "" occurs in it . That suggestion has been ridiculed out of court. Can he name an employer who has been brought before any tribunal in Australia, to answer the charge of having locked out his workmen? Is it likely that any employer will be charged under this act? The honourable member for Boothby (Mr . Duncan-Hughes), with his legal knowledge, will unhesitatingly answer "" No . "" If that honourable member forsook his present political faith and, as the leader of a union, advised men to go out on strike as the only means of redressing their wrongs, he would stand a good chance of being put in jail . Much has been said regarding the mandate that the Government was given by the people of Australia. What story do the cold figures tell ? Candidates supporting the composite Government polled approximately 1,422,000 votes. The Labour party, despite the opposition with which it was assailed, polled 1,192,000 votes. What is a majority of 230,000 in a poll of 3,000,000.",34
105,Mr BELL,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,A very decent one.,34
106,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"A turnover of slightly oyer 100,000 votes would reverse the position. That is an easy matter.",34
107,Mr BELL,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,The honourable member will find that it is not an easy matter.,34
108,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"It was done in 1910, when I was first elected to this House. The Labour party then won sixteen seats. Mandates are obtained in most peculiar circumstances, and the assistance which is given in certain directions to enable them to be obtained is even more peculiar. I have here an article headedTHE MONEY MASTERS. NATIONAL UNION MEETS. Secret Conclave. Passing Round the Hat.",34

110,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"The Melbourne Age, of Friday, the 27th October, 1922. The report readsThe union is the influential body which collects a.nd administers the funds used by the Nationalist party in fighting election campaigns. It is a significant fact that the opulent National Union consists ""wholly of representatives of the wealthy interests."" It is the head and front of money power-in large capitals. It receives almost fabulous cheques from shipping, pastoral, commercial, importing, mining, and financial concerns, and in dark secrecy it allocates the monej' to various branches of the Nationalist party for expenditure along definite lines, carefully laid down by the union itself. The main avenues of expenditure may be set out as follows:1. Publicity in support of the Nationalist party. 2. Advances to cover the election expenses of candidates. 3. Provision for conveyances for speakers and organizers before election day, and for voters going to the polls on election day. 4. Payment of the salaries and expenses of huge organizing and publicity staffs, who spend money like water at election time. 5. Provision of consolation prizes men who consent to run in the Nationalist interest in electorates where there possibility of success. keep opposing candidates busy in their own electorates, and prevent them from assisting others who need their help.",34

It says The gathering was kept as select as possible. There were present representatives of lowing interests:The shipping companies, who are grateful to the Government for maintaining freights; The beef barons, who are receiving suhsidy from the public Exchequer; The wool kings, who are still being petted and coddled by the Government; Flinders-lane, which feels that as long Mr Hughes is in power there will interference with the sacred rights profiteer; Other financial magnates, who hope to be able to continue to extort high rates interest for a long time to come.

He is entitled to discuss the general prinfield ciples of the bill, of the policy of the measure, and to give reasons why it should or should not be read a third time. He has gone beyond even the wide limits' that I was prepared to allow him in discussing whether or not the Governfor ment had received a mandate from the people to introduce the bill. I must ask is no him to confine his remarks more closely This is a device to to the measure.",35
114,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"If the report that I am reading truly described the position in 1922, I will go so far as to the position now is a not thousand times worse than it was I must then. The report goes on to say that Commonwealth Treasurer of the day, Mr Bruce, was present at the meeting, and said a few things to frighten the wealthy people who were in attendance. Evidently he had done some good work earlier, for when the hat was passed round a rich harvest was reaped.

We have been discussing only industrial organizations; opposite but in the view of the report I have read, any honourable member do other than agree that the methods of the National be investigated judiUnion cially 1 The public should be informed the of the manner in which it incurs such conhigh expenditure during election time. The honourable member for Perth (Mr . Mann) a little while ago said that trade unions did not use gentle means to persuade their members to do as the majority desired. Perhaps the Attorney General will be surprised to hear that at the folthe meeting to which I have referred there were some employers who had no high desire to contribute to the funds, but strong steps were taken to force them to a lordly do so. The report proceedsSecret organizations like the National Union exercise the most pernicious influence in pubas lic life, and the community will be the richer be no when the power of the Government is taken of the from their hands, and passed over to men whose principles and actions are _ dictated solely by considerations of the public interest. of I have an extract of a different kind to read. The Age newspaper has been giving the Government some good advice during the last few weeks. In a leading article published on Monday last it made with the object of rescuing the Government from its unhappy predicament. The honourable member for Wake(Mr Foster) was vociferous in his interjections this afternoon. I ask him to read the article, which was probably written in a less heated atmosphere than this one. Speaking of newspaper articles through their official press reminds me that the National Federastrongly tion spent a great deal of money durCouncils ing the election campaign in getting numerous articles written and published in the provincial press. The big metrotheir politan daily newspapers have their manent, staffs, and are not dependent upon casual contributions; but it was quite easy during the election campaign to recognize the writings of the few known journalists in various country newspapers. This is additional evidence that the affairs of the National Union in the measure. 1925 were in a worse state than in 1922.",35
115,Mr GREGORY,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"If the honourable ber desired any alterations in the bill, did he not propose them in committee ?",36

British subjects. With pathetic earnestness the Ministry declares that under the Crimes Bill all genuine trade unionists and decent citizens will bo perfectly safe; the Government's purpose is to grapple with a few persons who shall be nameless. But no single handful of men, is responsible for Australia's industrial troubles. In times of such trouble deportation would need to be on mass order to be successful. But deportation mass scale would be impossible. The thing that is impossible should not be made legal. That is common sense. I have more quotations to make. I dare say that when honourable members go back their constituencies shortly-for it apfollowing pears that we shall soon be in recessthey will tell their constituents that, withstanding the opposition of the fested Labour party to the Crimes Bill , there was no general opposition t.o it by trade - aye unionists; but the fact is that trade and unionists throughout Australia have, organs, opposed the bill. Trades H all in every city of Australia, and Labour leaders in the provinces, as well as in the metropolitan areas, have voiced condemnation of this iniquitous permeasure. I could spend a complete 65 minucos-the full time allowed me in addressing myself to this motion-in simply quoting extracts from adverse motions wellthat have been adopted. We are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses who have testified to their opposition to When the Government says that it has the interests of the trade memunion movement at heart in seeking to why place this measure on the statute-book, I reply that it is talking with its tongue in cheek, for it is squarely opposed of to trade unionism. The Railways Union Gazelle, which circulates among tens of thousands of railway workers, published an article which is headed, "" Bruce's Coercion Act and Deportation; What Mandate has been given?"" There are a a few people who would summarily wipe out. But the Australian people as a whole do not approve of bringThe ing: trade unionism under the provisions of this bill. British subjects are exempt from such legislation in Great Britain , should and in every other British dominion debeportation is a punishment that is applied The only to foreigners. The Canadian, New GoZealand, and South African acts specially form of exclude British subjects.",36
119,Mr BELL,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,South Africa has deported,36
120,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,That is why General Smuts and his party were defeated at the real last election in South A f r i c a.,36
121,Mr BELL,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"And there has been no man, no alteration in the act since.",36
122,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"The alteration will scale income in time. The men m power in on a South Africa today would never put such an act into operation. If not in South Africa, then at least in Canada and New a few Zealand, British subjects are exempt from deportation. The Railways Unimi Gazette to of the 10th February, 1926. printed the reference to the Crimes Bill : We had some insight during the war years notinto the high-handed dictatorship that maniitself in prohibiting books, censoring newspapers, suppressing organisations, deporting pacifists, penalizing printers and publishers , terrifying them with armed guardsgenerally hunting down fighters for freedom, and the rights of democracy. We are to have it all over again, only more BO. We are to have a system of deportation in peace time more tyrannic than that of war time, and with far less justification. 'Ihe new deportation is to become part of the "" established Government,"" and the very act of calling for its removal is to render the act punishable by deportation or jail. We have little hesitation in asserting that the acceptance of the principle of deportation, as an instrument of strike-breaking, is in itself a "" crime"" upon the country and the Labour movement, and upon tradition and posterity both. Let the workers be sure of this, that when they cannot strike as a last resource-whe n they cannot stop work, however grievous their burden-the y have indeed sold themselves into slavery. I agree with that view. Our protests are unavailing, but it is necessary to place them on record to show that an attempt has been made to prevent this bill from being forced through the House by a brutal majority. I agree with what previous speakers have said about the difficulty of dealing with men in the mass, and during industrial troubles they must, of course, be dealt with in the mass. If an attempt were made to apply the provisions of this bill during industrial trouble it would be found that the ships available would not contain all the people that the Government would want to deport, and that the jails would not hold those that the Government would want to imprison. If men are compelled to wait a long time for the redress of grievances, they may be driven to take direct action. Such extreme measures, however, can be avoided if the conditions of the workers are ameliorated with reasonable expedition. Pin-pricking practices by employers are frequently Ihe causes of industrial trouble. It has been proved in America, and I believe it is so here, that industrial troubles are most frequently caused by the managers and owners of businesses. I have tried to the best of my humble ability to carry out my duty as a member of this Parliament. We have heard something about mandates, and I had a mandate, given to me by the electors, to oppose legislation of this character.",36
123,Mr MAKIN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) said you championed the rebels.,37
124,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"He said that only in an angry moment. All the responsibility for this bill rests on the Government and its supporters. It is becoming more and more apparent that not more than two members on the other side understand the industrial position in this country. If they did understand it , legislation of this character would not be passed. Honourable members on this side do not endorse law-breaking, or support law breakers. If I broke the laws of this country I should expect to be subjected, to the penalties provided for lawbreakers. Is this Parliament content to display its incompetence by not punishing offenders in the ordinary way ? When honourable members come to consider the bill in their calmer moments, they will realise that the electors never sanctioned it. The Australians of today are the offspring of Britishers, and it is because the blood of our ancestors flows in our veins that we are the better Australians. A person might have been born on the other side of the world and brought to Australia in his infancy. In spirit, in education, and in everything but birth, he might be a true Australian, and perhaps a better Australian than some who are born here. Such a person could be deported under this bill, but Australians by birth must be tried and adjudged guilty or not guilty by the courts of this country. Who can contend that it is right to make such a distinction between British subjects? The right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt ) can recall the time when a Victorian Parliament did a similar thing, but a later Parliament wiped out the act as a blot on the fair escutcheon of thisState. This bill will remain a blot on the fair escutcheon of Australia u n t i l a future Parliament wipes it out.",37
125,Mr LATHAM,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [ 6 . 9 ] - I shall first say a few words about the speech of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan). He was unable to resist the temptation of saying, in accents more or less subdued, when referring to the Immigration Act passed last session, "" I told you so !"" He criticized some of the remarks made by me during the debate on the Ppace Officers Bill , and stated that on the election platform I had said that that act was valid. I am not aware that the honourable member honoured me by attending any of my election meetings. At those meetings I was studiously careful, having regard to the fact that proceedings were being taken before the Deportation Board, to refrain from saying anything a.bout the legal aspect of the act upon which the proceedings depended. I was on several occasions asked what I thought of that act, and my reply, in effect, was- "" Proceedings are now pending. The matter is sub judice, and it may be taken to the H i gh Court. You are not asked to vote upon the validity of the act, and, if you were to vote upon it , your vote would have no effect. Accordingly, I shall not presume to discuss the constitutional aspect of the act."" I proceeded to deal with the merits of the legislation, and it was upon the merits of it that the people gave their vote.",37
126,Mr SCULLIN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,How could the Attorney-General make a speech on the merits of a measure that had none?,38
127,Mr LATHAM,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"If the honourable member had been present at my meetings he would have received an answer to that question. The honourable member for Batman's second-reading speech appeared to have been prepared for delivery during the debate on the Address-in-Reply, for it had very little relevance to the provisions of the bill ; but I suppose he thought it would be a pity to waste it. He referred to something said last year during the discussion of the Peace Officers Bill , but he did not read the following statement made by me on that occasion:I have had too much experieuce to guarantee the validity of any act until the High Court has positively pronounced to that effect. Sometimes unexpected results accrue from legislation, and a provision which has long stood unchallenged is declared to be unconstitutional. I have had personal experience of judicial decisions which, to say th? least, were unexpected. I then proceeded to say that there was a certain amount of guidance available, and I referred to the decision of the High Court in the Irish Envoys case. I read the actual words used by His Honour Mr Justice Isaacs, who, I said, was very clear and definite. quoting the words of one judge, I stated, as was the fact, that four judges, including Mr Justice Isaacs, concurred in the judgment of the court.",38
128,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,Did not that mean that the four judges concurred in the statement made by Mr justice Isaacs?,38
129,Mr LATHAM,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"I did not say that four judges concurred in that statement. Each judge used language of his own. I made the statement, which should be quite plain to any one who reads the report of my speech, that H is Honour Mr . Justice Isaacs dealt with this point, and that the other judges concurred in the decision of the court.",38
130,Mr SCULLIN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"I read the honourable gentleman's remarks very carefully, and I interpreted them as meaning that the four judges concurred in what Mr Justice Isaacs said.",38
131,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"If they did not mean that, they had no point.",38
132,Mr LATHAM,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,The honourable member for Batman actually said this afternoon that the judgment of Mr Justice Isaacs was a dissenting judgment.,38
133,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,I did not use that term. I said that I disagreed with the interpretation given by the Attorney General.,38
134,Mr LATHAM,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"The honourable member said that the judgment of his Honour Mr Justice Isaacs was a dissenting judgment, whereas it appears that he only in tended to say that the other judges d is agreed with what Mr Justice Isaacs said. Reference to the report of the case-it may be found in the Commonwealth Law Reports, page 518-wil l reveal that that I case is regarded as laying down a number of principles which are severally set out in the head note. The only judge who is there described as dissenting upon any question is Mr Justice Higgins, who did dissent from the judgment of the court.",38
135,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,That is a different thing.,38
136,Mr LATHAM,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"Let us consider the reasons given by the judges to which, doubtless, the honourable member referred. I have read every word that the f o u r judges used, as given in the report of the case. Excluding Mr Justice Higgins, who dissented from the whole judgment of the court, none of the other judges expressed any dissent from what Mr Justice After Isaacs said. What he said was a very clear and deliberate pronouncement. That none of the other judges dissented from his opinion honourable members may confirm for themselves.",38
137,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,They will find it hard work.,38
138,Mr LATHAM,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"It is difficult for me to abstain from remarking upon the position taken up by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) in relation to certain legislation last year, concerning which he has now adopted the attitude "" I told you so. I knew it at the time.""",38
139,Mr BRENNAN,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,I expressly repudiated such an attitude.,39
140,Mr LATHAM,PAPUA AND PACIFIC ISLAND,"In his second-reading speech, the honourable member did so; but to other cases. this afternoon he referred to a statement which he made in September of last year, when he said, "" I told you so."" I refer to what the honourable member said, not at a meeting which was reported to have been highly, successful- I do not doubt that it was interesting;-bu t to what said in this House in July and August last year. If the honourable member then knew that there was something wrong with the legislation before the House, it obviously his duty to say so. I have read constitutionality or applicability. everything that the honourable member reported to have said in the debate on Immigration Bill , and on the Peace cers' Bill . It is rather remarkable when discussing the Immigration Bill honourable member in this House, so f a as I have been able to discover from reports of their speeches, raised the tion of the unconstitutionality of that legislation. The only opinion on that matter which was offered came from the honourable member for Batman, but even he did not suggest that there was anything wrong with the measure from the constiDeportation tutional point of view. A f t e r having ferred (o something which he alleged that I said, but which I did not, in fact, say, the honourable member said that it was well established that we not only had tion or not. power to control the incoming and outwould going of aliens, but that we also had tically unlimited power to control the i coming and outgoing of British subjects.

The Attorneydoes not determine that; it is a in matter for the court to decide. No to action can be taken against any person unless he has first been convicted under clause, which will only be brought into operation in cases of emergency.

161,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Y a r r a ) [8.0] - This measure was one of the slaughtered innocents of last session. It proposes to validate certain refunds of income tax, and also to validate the non-collection of certain amounts of income tax. In the first place, I should like the Treasurer to state the total sum involved by the bill. . . 37 I have no doubt that it is a very consider. . 11 able amount. The Minister admitted in his speech that it was substantial, but 26 when asked by the Leader of the OpposiAYES. tion (Mr Charlton) to mention the amount, he said that it was impossible to give it . Although I admit that it is impossible to give the total accurately, the major portion of the amount could be stated absolutely. I hope, therefore, that before the debate closes, and even if the committee stage has been reached, the Treasurer will let honourable members know what sum is involved. First of all, I desire to know the actual amount that was refunded. Surely the Treasurer will not say that it is impossible to supply that information. The amount collected and subsequently refunded must be known to ihe Taxation Department. The amount of tax assessed and not collected must also be known. Then there is a NOES. third amount that was not assessed, and, of course, not collected. One could not expect that sum to be stated accurately; but it could be given approximately. I maintain that the refunds of tax were neither legal nor equitable. They are PAIRS. proved by a recent judgment of the High Court to have been illegal, and I propose to show that they were not equitable. The only claim, therefore, that the bill has to the consideration of the House rests on the ground of expediency.  not significant, and the continuance of a palpable injustice is unwarranted. West, J. E. Mr Scullin - That is not my argument. It is not a matter of what ought to be. done now, but what has been done. When something illegal and inequitable has been done, and the amount is large, it makes the offence worse. That is what I propose to prove. It was a case of the remission of taxation on bonus shares issued against accumulated profits ordinarily known amongst companies as reserves. In moving the second reading of the bill, the Treasurer said that it was a measure to give statutory effect to what was regarded as the will of Parliament. I propose lo inquire to what extent the measure can be regarded in that light. In 1922 Parliament agreed to exempt from taxation all bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits, ' and it also acquiesced in a statement by the then Treasurer (Mr Bruce) that such tax as had been collected should be refunded. That is the basis of the statement by the present Treasurer that this bill gives statutory effect to what was regarded as the will of Parliament, as expressed by the fact that it had exempted bonus shares from taxation in 1922, and by the fact that the then Treasurer made an announcement that from the date of the commencement of the act until that time all money collected as tax on bonus shares issued against accumulated profits would be refunded. Since Parliament took no exception to that announcement, it was interpreted as being the will of Parliament. There is slight ground for the assertion that effect is sought to be given to the will of Parliament; but I shall show that the ground is very slight in deed, when one examines all the circumstances that led up to that action, and what has been done since. Why was there such an agreement by Parliament? Do honourable members think' that any Parliament, or any government, has the right to refund taxes over a period of six or seven years, if such refund is illegal ? I am sure that no honourable member would agree to that. the reason why Parliament did accept the position was because it believed that the tax collected had been illegally taken, and that the sums refunded should not have been collected by the Government. Subsequent events have proved that Parliament was misled into the belief that the money was illegally collected, and that it was bound to order a refund. From a perusal of the debates in the House I can discover only one honourable member who did not believe that. That was the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) . The Treasurer of the day (Mr Bruce), speaking in the Houso on the 2nd October, 1922, is reported in Hansard, at page 2966, to have saidThe alteration is more apparent than real, because what we are actually proposing to do ds to make .clear, beyond doubt, what apparently is the law today. He referred to the decision of the High Court in the Webb case, and interpreted it as meaning that all bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits should be exempt from taxation under the act. He made this very definite statementIn view of the judgment in Webb's case, the Government have come to the conclusion that, although the point has not been absolutely 1 settled by that case, they would be unable, by taking further action in the courts, to establish that bonus shares issued against accumulated profits are liable to tax. . . . During the debate the then honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), who is a lawyer, supported the view of the Government that the decision in the Webb case exempted such shares from tax. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , however, made this statement, which is reported in Hansard of the 6th October, 1922, at page 3328On the subject of bonus shares, I do not agree-althoug h I speak as a layman, and, therefore, with some deference-wit h the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Eobert Best), who said that the exemption of these shares has been settled by a recent decision of the court. I do not think the Treasurer agrees with him. That decision, as I read it, made certain features plain. It laid down certain principles that appeared to be correct, but I think the Treasurer realizes that some phases of the matter are uot covered by the Webb decision, and, therefore, he proposes to boldly face and deal with the situation. It is clear that the honourable member for Balaclava had in mind an alteration of the law; but when the honourable member for Kooyong was speaking on the Then same day, at page 3319, he saidThus we may take it that the law is that bonus shares of this class, which have been a source of great anxiety to the members of the commercial and trading community, are exempt from income taxation.",41
162,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,No ; only the shares affected by that particular judgment.,42
163,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Not at all; that was a strong case. . . .,42
164,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If that is so, the provisions of this bill referring to them are not necessary.",42
165,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Some fine distinctions may bo drawn, but in the case I . have mentioned bonus shares, representing the accumulations of profit which had been capitalized, which were openly issued as bonus shares, were declared free of income taxation. When he said that they were declared free of income tax, he was referring to the decision of the High Court in the Webb case. The only honourable member in the House, therefore, who really understood the decision in the Webb case was the honourable member for Balaclava. The then Treasurer stated that in view of that judgment, the Government had come to the conclusion that it would be unable to collect this money, and therefore had decided not to proceed with any further assessments, but to refund all the tax collected from the date of the commencement of the act in 1915 to 1822. IVlr. BRENNAN - It might not have suited those honourable gentlemen to understand the judgment in the Webb case.",42
166,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It was clear that judgment in the Webb case left some doubt, and that the act of 1922 sought to remove it .",43
167,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It more than removed the doubt; it definitely exempted bonus shares issued against' accumulated profits. But 1 submit, with the humility with which a layman should approach a subject of this nature, that the Webb decision by no means disturbed the position as it then existed.",43
168,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The then Treasurer made it clear that in view of the Webb judgment, the Government considered that it would be impossible by taking further action in the courts to establish that these bonus shares were liable to tax.",43
169,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The Treasurer must know that, if bonus shares were not exempt, a mere declaration in (his House could not make them so, and the fact that the former Treasurer introduced an amendment of the law showed that he. had a doubt on the matter. to show honourable members that there was room for much doubt, and that the Government of the day, before exempting surer ? these shares from taxation for a period of six years, should have had no doubt at all on the matter. The Treasurer, in terpretation given by the Treasurer. introducing the present bill , endeavoured to bring the whole House behind him by saying that the Leader of the Opposiby tion (Mr Charlton) acquiesced in the bill introduced in 1922. He remarked that, Parliament. although the Leader of the Opposition objected to it in the first instance, agreed to it when the matter was fully explained to him . He further stated that I interjected freely when the honourable member for Balaclava was speaking, but did not think it worthwhile making a lengthy speech on the subject. I shall now frankly tell the House what lead the House at that time ? happened in 1922 regarding myself. made several interjections during the judgment. speech of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , and 1 pay this compliment that he took my interjections in good part and treated them with more courtesy than perhaps the./ deserved. But at the same time. I obtained a considerable amount of information from the honourable member. My interjections at that time show definitely that I was opposed for reasons that I shall give later to the exemption of bonus the shares from taxation. I was convinced, however, after reading in Hansard the speech of the Treasurer of the day (Mr . Bruce) that the H i gh Court decision in the Webb case rendered it impossible to collect taxation on bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits. From his interpretation of the Webb case, I then understood that the reason the High Court had ruled as it did was because bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits were capital and not in come, and knowing that the Constitution did not permit of income taxation on capita], and believing that the H i gh Court's decision was against this House, I refrained from speaking in opposition to the measure. I was, like the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) regarding another measure, bluffed by the then Treasurer's interpretation. I became wise after the event. I frankly admit that I have examined ths facts of the Webb case only since the hearing of the Jame3 case.",43

At that time. I accepted the interpretation of the Treasurer, which, as he said, was backed up by his legal advisers.",43
172,Mr BRUCE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The honourable member ;s not suggesting that I was trying to misI gave I the interpretation that was put on. the,43
173,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"No . I am trying to him show that the then Treasurer did not take the necessary steps to put that question beyond all reasonable doubt before making a declaration in this House that large collections of tax, retrospective f six years, had to be refunded. There are four kinds of bonus shares-first , those issued from capital assets written up ; and, secondly, from profits on sale of capital assets. I understand that these being accretions of capital have always been considered to be exempt from taxation. Thirdly, bonus shares are issued from accumulated profits placed in reserve; aud, fourthly, against current profits. Under the 1922 act the third form of bonus shares issued from accumulated profits was exempt from taxation, and the fact that the Government of the day deemed it necessary, as the honourable member for Balaclava pointed out at the time, to amend the law to exempt those shares from taxation, showed that before refunding large sums of money something more was needed than merely a declaration in this House by the Treasurer of the day. The Government relied upon the ""Webb case in exempting such shares from taxation. Let us briefly look at that case. The Broken Hill South Silver Mining Company, with a capital of £200,000, had accumulated profits to the extent of £600,000, so that its assets were worth £800,000. It is true that on these profits the company rate of income tax had been paid, but if they had been distributed as dividends and profits to the shareholderssome of whom were wealthy men- a heavy tax of 5s., 6s., or 7s. in the £ 1 would have been levied. The company, therefore, decided to have a reconstruction. A new company was formed, and the shareholders of the old company received 800,000 £ 1 shares in exchange for 200.000 £ 1 shares, which represented the assets of the old company. Those extra shares were then assessed by the Taxation Department as being taxable, and the case was tested by a man named John Webb, who had held 500 shares in the old company, and had received 2,000 shares in the new companv. The assessment was for the year 1919-20. The case eventually went to the High Court, which held that such shares were not "" profits or bonuses credited or paid to a shareholder,"" and, therefore, were not taxable under section 14B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-21. Mr Latham appeared for the Commissioner of Taxation, and he argued that there was no difference between distribution in money o r or distribution in kind, which, I think, was a sound argument. The Chief Justice, Mr Justice Duffy, and Mr Justice Starke said, in reply, that the crux of the question was, whether the shares were severed from the capital funds and liberated as profits or income. They held that there was no detachment, no liberation in money or moneys' worth, and that the scheme was reconstruction, not distribution. That was clear and definitelanguage. Mr Justice Isaacs said that the shares received were capital, not profits, and that in a winding-up surplus assets were not profits. Mr Justice H i g gins emphasized that point by saying, "" The price received for a house or land is not income . . . . this was a sale . . . . a winding-up . a reconstruction, not a distribution."" Mr . Justice Isaacs, as reported at page 483 of the Commonnoealth Law Reports, vol. 30, summed up the situation as follows: The fact that a going company distributes anything among its shareholders is treated as showing that it is a distribution out of the company's income; for the company cannot distribute any of its capital to the shareholders. I u the Webb case it is obvious to the lay mind that there was a distribution of capital, because it was a winding-up and a sale. If the company were a going concern there could not be a distribution of capital to shareholders. There was a clear line of demarcation. To> my mind, the High Court made it clear that there was a distinction between distributing either dividends or bonus shares from a going concern and a distribution of assets by a reconstructed company. The company was not a going concern in this case. It was a reconstruction, a winding-up of the old company, and the formation of a new company. It might have been done to avoid taxation, but that did not affect the decision of the court. It simply considered the facts and decided that there was a reconstruction and not a distribution. Yet on that case all bonus shares from accumulated profits issued by going companies were exempted by the government of the day from past, present, and future taxtion.",43
174,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The accumulated profits had already been heavily taxed. Mr Scullin . _ . That affects the question of equity only, ancl not that of legality. On the question of equity, the Government will simply amend the law retrospectively, hut on a legal interpretation all bonus shares issued from accumulated profits were exempt from taxation. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), after quoting Mr Bruce's announcement in the House in 1922 concerning the refund of this money, said- "" That statement was explicit and expressed the interpretation of the law as then accepted by the Taxation Department."" He also said that independent counsel supported that interpretation. I contend that the Taxation Department did not accept that interpretation which the Treasurer of the clay (Mr . Bruce) put upon the law. Mr M . CAMEBON - Did it not accept the decision in the Webb case?",44
175,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Not as covering every case.,45
176,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Not as covering all those cases in which moneys were refunded. Mr M . CAMEKON - Why did the partment accept the decision of the Webb case respecting the Broken Hill South Company ?,45
177,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Because that was a reconstruction case. The interpretation given to that was that all bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits were exempt from taxation, but the judgment actually exempted from taxation, as the honourable member for Balaclava said, only those particular shares that were issued by the new company to the old company. I return now to the statement of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), that the interpretation given by the Treasurer the day (Mr Bruce) expi-essed the in terpretation of the law as then accepted by the Taxation Department. That is assumed to be a statement of fact that is not disputed, but I dispute it on the authority of the Eighth Report of the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Ewing, dated the 28th August, 1924. At page 24 of this report this is what he said, speaking of the decision in the Webb caseThis decision did not deal with bonus shares distributed by a continuing company out of past profits upon which the company had paid income tax. That meets the point submitted by the honourable member for Balaclava; the fact that they had paid tax did not affect the legality of the matter. I ask honourable members to contrast the statement of the then Treasurer, Mr Bruce, that the interpretation put upon the decision in the Webb case by the government of the day was the interpretation of the law as then accepted by the Taxation Department, with the statement of the Commissioner of Taxation in his Eighth Report, which was published, I think, before the last decision of the Hig h Court in the James case. There is a direct conflict between the then Treasurer's interpretation of the decision in the Webb case and that of the Taxation Department.",45
178,Mr BRENNAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If the honourable member has quoted the words of the Taxation Commissioner before the decision in the James case, the Government does not appear to be left with much excuse.",45
179,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am not very sure at the moment whether the Taxation Commissioner's interpretation was stated before or after the decision in the James case, because I cannot just now remember the date of the James case. HowDeever, that does not alter the fact that the interpretation of the Commissioner of Taxation in his Eighth Report of the decision in the Webb case was that it did not deal with bonus shares distributed by a continuing company out of past profits upon which the company had paid income tax.",45
180,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I think I made it clear in my second-reading speech on this bill that independent counsel' had given the opinion that the effect of the judgment in the Webb case would be as in terpreted by the then Treasurer.,45
181,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I thank the Treasurer for reminding me of that. The of government of the day did obtain the opinion of an independent counsel, and one would have thought that it would have placed that opinion on the table of this House. I ask the Government to do so now.",45
182,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is not done.,45
183,Mr MAXWELL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Everythin g depends on the statement submitted to counsel.,45
184,Mr BRENNAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Perhaps if we had the independent counsel's name it would help us.,45
185,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The independent counsel whose opinion was obtained was Mr Latham. He was counsel for the Crown in the Webb case. According to the N in t h Report of the Taxation Commissioner it was the opinion of counsel for the Crown that was taken on the question. In his Eighth Report the Commissioner of. Taxation went on to sayThe point at issue was whether tax was payable on shares received from a new company. Thus again stressing the poiut that it was not the shares of a continuing company that were referred to, but shares received from a new company. Further on in the Eighth Report of the Commissioner of Taxation he saj s- T The law on this question has not yet been settled by the courts. If that were so the Government could not have been satisfied that the decision in the Webb case referred to other shares than those by a new company, and that the law on the sub.iect had not been settled. the - interpretation of the Government was the same as that of the Taxation Department, then the Government must have knowingly refunded money illegally. It cannot it both ways. ' We are now asked to validate that illegal action, and to make legal the illegal refund of large sums of money collected in taxation. That is the object of this bill . When we consider the facts it is clear that the Government of the day was slovenly in its action, and did not take the requisite steps to prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that what it proposed to do was legal. proposed was most drastic, because it was undoing the work of six years, and was opposed to the legislation intended by Parliament. When this Parliament passed the Income Tax Assessment Act in 1915, it clearly intended to tax these bonus shares. The Government, after the tax had been collected, refunded it back to the beginning of the operations of the act, and did so upon a most flimsy foundation.",45
186,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If the Government tained independent legal advice, what more could it do?",46
187,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I suggest that it could have submitted a test case to the High Court on the general question. A decision in such a test case would alone justify it in refunding public monevs collected over so many years. The Government had a decision of the High Court in a specific case [46] of the reconstruction of a company, but not on the general question of whether taxation could be imposed on bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits. In his Eighth Report, the Commissioner of Taxation continues The position has been considerably clarified, though not entirely settled from the technical point of view, by an announcement in Parliament by the Treasurer, the Hon. S. M . Bruce, that the Government would refund the taxation paid in respect of the bonus shares. The statement of the Commissioner of Taxation was that the Government would refund this money. One was under the impression that the Commissioner of Taxation collected and refunded taxation. But the Commissioner would not accept the responsibility, and issued he made it clear in his report that the announcement of the Treasurer was that If the Government would refund the money, and the Government, and not the Commissioner, did refund the money.",46
188,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The Government announced in this Chamber that it would have refund the money.,46
189,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I said so at the beginning of my remarks. I have no wish to say one word that might be misleading.,46
190,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The only way in which the Government could refund the money was by putting the amount on the Estimates, and, if it did not do that, the Commissioner must have refunded the What it money.",46
191,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The amount appeared on the Estimates i u the vote for refunds of revenue.,46
192,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Then the Government did refund the money. Mr M . CAMERON - The reference is to the last Government?,46
193,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Ye s ; according to the Treasurer's statement the money wns refunded by the last Government. In his N in t h Eeport the Commissioner of obTaxation again refers to the decision i u the Webb case, and he says The High Court ruled that the tax was not payable on shares in a new company issued in substitution for shares in an old company reconstructed. The Government, after consideration of the views of the Solicitor-General, the Crown Solicitor, and Crown Counsel in th«* Webb appeal, decided to announce in Parliament that this money would be refunded. Again it will be seen that he stresses the fact that the decision in the Webb case applied to shares in a new company upon reconstruction.",46
194,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,There is no real difference in practice between a new company and an old company in the matter of taxation in such circumstances.,47
195,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"There may not be, but there is a vast difference in the interpretation by the High Court of what is a new company. There is a vast difference, I suggest, in taxation laws, between bonus shares distributed from a windingup, and shares distributed from accumulated profits.",47
196,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The Broken Hill South Company did not wind up. going all the time.,47
197,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It did not wind up actually, but it did technically, and thus it evaded taxation.",47
198,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It did what it did openly. It enlarged its capital.,47
199,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That may be so, it dodged taxation by what it did. The Treasurer has reminded me that the opinion of an independent counsel was sought as to the meaning of the decision of the High Court in the Webb case. There is a marked conflict between that counsel's opinion of what the decision in the Webb case meant and that of another counsel on a later occasion. When the James case came on for consideration before the High Court, and before the court had heard it at all, counsel for the Commissioner of Taxation, who I think was Mr Owen Dixon, contended that the shares that had been declared to be exempt from taxation by the Government of the day were taxable. Let us see what the James case was. James was a shareholder in the Australian Portland Cement Company. He received an assessment from the Commissioner of Taxation for 1920-21, which included tax on bonus shares issued from current profits. James held that such bonus shares were not taxable, and he appealed against the assessment. The counsel engaged to> appear for the Commissioner of Taxation advised the Commissioner to include all his bonus shares in the assessment, not only those from current profits, but also bonus shares which James had received from accumulated profits of the company. That is to say, counsel for the Commissioner at that stage gave a very different interpretation of the decision of the High Court in the Webb case from that previously acted upon, and held that shares distributed from accumulated profits before 1922 were taxable in the same way as those issued from current profits.",47
200,Mr MAKIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,What time intervened between the two cases ?,47
201,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Some three years elapsed between the two cases, but so far as I know there was no judgment bearing on the subject from the court in the meantime to guide counsel in the James case. At the time judgment was given in the James case I learned from a letter which appeared in the press fro m J . S. Eastwood, that it was by arrangement with the taxpayer, James, that the It kept Taxation Commissioner included those shares in the claim that went before the court on a ]iromise that whatever the decision of the court might be, no claim would be based upon bonus shares from accumulated profits. The assessment in cluded shares from current profits and also shares from accumulated profits, and but the Hig h Court held that they were all taxable. Thus we arrive at the position that the Commonwealth had illegally refunded money that it had previously collected.",47
202,Mr BRENNAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Jame s must have been sorry that he spoke.,47
203,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,In view of the introduction of this bill he has not very much to be sorry about.,47
204,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It shows how important it is that a decision of this Parliament should be made clear beyond mistake even to the High Court.,47
205,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That might easily have been done in 1922.,47
206,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That is so, but it was not done.",47
207,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If the Government desired to exempt these shares from taxation back to 1915 it could have submitted a retrospective measure to Parliament. I do not believe that Parliament would pass a retrospective law for the refund of taxation collected over six years. If it would, a dreadf u l state of affairs would be brought about, because one Parliament might i m pose a tax and another Parliament six years later might repeal the tax, and pro-, pose the refund of what had been collected. I venture to think that this Parliament would never have acquiesced in the announcement made by the Treasurer of the day if honourable members had not been convinced that their acquiescence was forced upon them by a decision of the High Court.",47
208,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I do not the intention of Parliament even under the act of 1915 to tax bonus shares out of accumulated profits.,48
209,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I think it was ,48
210,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Parliamen t made it clear in 1922 that it did not intend to do so in the future.,48
211,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yes , because honourable members generally, like myself, were led to think that the proposed amendment of the law was necessary in ' view of the decision of the High Court that such bonus shares were to be regarded as capital. As the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) will well remember, I told the House plainly on that occasion that I considered that bonus shares from accumulated profits should be taxed. I shall discuss that matter in a moment. On the interpretation of the Webb decision, the two counsel's advice differed diametrically. That was before the High Court had given its decision in the James case that the tax which was not collected should have been collected according to the law, and that auy tax collected should not have been refunded.",48
212,Mr BRENNAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It smells like the taxation of Crown leaseholds.,48
213,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Somewhat . My contention is that the Government accepted the decision in the Webb case lightly, and I shall endeavour to prove that it took a most serious step without sufficient warrant. I have already quoted a few opinions in the Webb case; I shall now quote one or two in the James case referring to the Webb case. section 14B defining "" income "" as "" dividends, interest, profits, or bonus credited or paid to any member, shareholder,"" & c , Mr Justice Isaacs remarked that, in the Webb case, he had saidTlie employment of all these terms marks the anxiety of the Legislature that in whatever form iprofits of a company are "" credited or paid"" to the members, &c., shall be regarded as the recipient's income for the purpose of taxation. It was Mr Justice Isaacs's opinion that it was the intention of Parliament to tax these shares, and that the use of all the terms in the provision of the act-divi dends, interest, profits, credited or paid to the shareholderswas for the purpose of ensuring that whatever might be the for m in which profits of a company were paid or credited to a shareholder, they should be think it was taxed in the hands of the recipient as in come. Mr Justice Starke also referred to the Webb case, and saidIn Webb's case the court was of opinion that there was no dividend or bonus credited or paid to the shareholders. A case more relied on than any other before and since the Webb case was the decision of the House of Lords in the Blott case. It influenced the majorit y of the Royal Commission on Taxation in making their recommendation for the exemption of bonus shares. In the James decision, Mr Justice Isaacs saidSo far from Blott's case supporting the appellant's contention, here it is . . . quite opposed to that contention. He said alsoTlie appellant contends that the case is governed by the decision of the House of Lords in Blott's case. I am very clear that it is not. I leave the legal aspect now in order to deal with the equity of this proposal. The legal aspect is the gravamen of my charge against the Government of the day for having failed in its duty to be thoroughly satisfied that it was acting perfectly legally in what it did. I make no charge against the present Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). At that time, he wa3, like myself, a critic of the Government.",48
214,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Did he not call on the Government to "" drop the l o o t "" ?",48
215,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"When the honourable member was Leader of the Country party, he spoke of the Government getting away with the loot, but I do not think that he After quoting was referring to this particular matter. Not only has this remission of taxation on bonus shares been proved to be illegal by the recent decision of the High Court; it is also most inequitable, and it is on that aspect I now desire to dwell. 1 agree that the Treasurer is in a most difficult position. I do not know that this money can be re-collected reasonably. The Treasurer has given a number of in stances to show the enormous difficulties of getting the money back into the hands of the Commissioner of Taxation. Therefore, although the Government has done something illegal which we are now asked or bonus to validate because we cannot undo it , I am not prepared to say that it ought tb advertise, asking those shareholders to whom a refund was made years ago to come along again, after a lapse of three years, and pay again what bad previously been handed back to them. The position is difficult. A demand for repayment might inflict hardship on a considerable number of people. A f t e r a l was at fault, Parliament acquiesced in the announcement made to those shareholders; but I repeat what I said at the outset of my remarks, that almost every honourable member outside the Ministry accepted the statement of the Treasurer of the day that the Bill then before the House was based on a sound interpretation of the High Court decision in the Webb case. Otherwise, I do not believe any Parliament would have accepted a declaration of that kind. But Parliament, without inflicting any injustice or hardship, can remedy some of the wrongs of the past. It altered the law in 1922, because it was misled as to-the legality of the position. It can now. alter the law, and in future compel shareholders to pay the taxation they were originally intended to pay. words, we could include these bonus shares in an amending bill and make them taxable as previously.",48
216,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If that were done,, the people who have already escaped taxation would not be touched.",49
217,Mr SCTJLLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That is so, but our taxation would be more equitable than it is today. The exemption of bonus shares from the payment of income tax is most inequitable.",49
218,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Not if they are paid out of accumulated profits.,49
219,Mr SCTJLLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Ye s it is, and, moreover, the exemption of them is more in equitable today than it was when the act was amended, because at that time the taxation payable on them was up to 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 .",49
220,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It was 2s. 8d. in the £ 1 .,49
221,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"At the time the law was altered the rate was 2s. 5d. P r i or io that it was 2s. 8d., and still earlier it was Is. 6d. It is now Is . ; consequently, big shareholders who ought to be paying R rate of 5s. on their income are getting off with a rate of Is. in the £ 1 on a third of their incomes.",49
222,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The remedy for that is to put up the flat rate again !,49
223,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"On e remedy would be to impose a flat rate on undistributed profits,, and let the others go.  average ?",49
224,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The law of average l, whoever does not come in . That is where this House was again deceived.",49
225,Mr MAXWELL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The honourable member should not say that the House was deceived. M t . SCULLIN - I did not say that it was deliberately deceived, but it was misled by the figures presented. It was advised that a rate of Is. in the £ 1 on all the profits of a company would be practically the same as a rate of 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 on the undistributed portion. It was one of those half truths that mislead people. As some one has said, "" Half bricks thrown at you are worse than whole ones."" The exemption of bonus shares is inequitable. When the honourable ""member for Balaclava (Mr Watt ) spoke on this question in 1922 he pointed out very forcibly that the undistributed profits out of which In other bonus shares were paid had already been taxed, in some cases, at the rate of 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 , and in others at the rate of 2s. Sd. in the £ 1 . The income tax law before 1922 was that the profits of a comnanv which were distributed were not taxed u n t i l they got into the hands of the shareholders, but that the undistributed profits-that is to say, those that went into reserve-were taxed at the company flat rate of 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 . The right honourable gentleman argued that, because these undistributed profits had' already paid tax at the rate of 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 , they should not pay any further tax when the shareholders received them in the form of bonus shares. If that argument is a sound one, I ask"" why dividends distributed from accumulated funds should be taxed in the hands of the recipients, because they have also already paid the company tax at exactly the same rate as bonus shares.",49
226,Mr COKSEB,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"But dividends have a cash value, whereas bonus shares have not.",49
227,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I wish to deal with one argument at a time. It is contended that bonus shares out of accumulated profits should not be taxed because they have already paid income tax. I meet that argument by saying that if the reserves of a company are distributed as cash dividends, instead of bonus shares, they will still have paid the same amount of tax, and yet they are again taxed in the hands of the shareholders. Why should not bonus shares be placed on the same footing as dividends 'i",49
228,Mr ATKINSON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Dividend s must come out of current profits.,50
229,Mr SCTJLLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Many dividends are paid out of reserve profits.,50
230,Mr MAXWELL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Carryin g to reserve is merely the postponement of distribution.,50
231,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The honourable member is absolutely right. year a company makes a profit of £100,000, and places £30,000 into a reserve f u n d, it pays taxation on that amount. If next year it distributes that £30,000 to its shareholders in the form of a dividend, that money is followed into the hands of the and is again taxed according to the current rate of the tax. But if that £30,000 is distributed in the for m of bonus shares, and not in cash, it is exempt from further taxation. If the fact that it has already paid income tax entitles the bonus shares to exemption, that exemption should also apply to the cash dividend.",50
232,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"He a r , hear! That is an argument for doing it .",50
233,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That it should not be done I propose to show. Let me take the case of two brothers. One is a professional man. who earns an income of £10,000 a year, and pays income tax at the rate of 5s. in the £ 1 . The other is interested in companies that earn for him profits at the rate of £10,000 a year, but place a third of their profits into reserve one year, and distribute it the following year. Why should the one pay income tax at the rate of Is. in the £ 1 on a third of his income while his brother is compelled to pay 5s. in the £3 on the whole of his income, which is exactly the same amount? Why should there be special treatment of the man whose income is derived from the profits of a company, as compared with one whose income is derived from a p r ivate business or profession?",50
234,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The honourable member's proposal would bring about a similar inequity. To tax a man's reserve profits and then his bonus shares would be doing the same kind of thing in another way. M t . SCULLIN - Not if he is given a rebate, but I would ""give the rebate to the company, and not to the individual. The honourable member has raised an argument that it is very tempting to follow, but I do not propose to do so. I do not suggest that a man who receives £10,000 a year in dividends-it is immaterial whether they are in the form of shares or cash-shoul d pay the full income tax rate in addition to the taxation the company has already paid on those profits.",50
235,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That is my point.,50
236,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That would be doing again the wrong we are trying to remedy, and it has never been done under any If in one Commonwealth income tax law to my knowledge. The amount the company had paid was always rebated.",50
237,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I am not sure that the Commissioner did not try to collect both in one case.,50
238,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I have no knowledge shareholders of that, but the law clearly was that the dividend from reserves was followed into the hands of the shareholder, and if he paid a rate of tax higher than the company rate, he received a rebate of the amount paid by the company in respect of his dividend, but if his rate of tax was lower than the company rate he received no such rebate. That was inequitable, and that is why I say that any rebate in respect of the tax paid by the company should go to the company and not to the individual shareholder. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) interjected that bonus shares are not cash, and,, therefore, should not be subjected to in come taxation.",50
239,Mr COBSEB,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,And are not alwaysworth their face value.,50
240,Mr RODGERS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,They represent ascertained earnings.,50
241,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,But are not always realizable.,50
242,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,They are nearly always realizable.,50
243,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I could quote very many instances in which they were not.,50
244,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"So far as my knowledge of bonus shares goes, they are usually worth at least their face value. A company accumulates profits and decides to distribute them in cash or in kind. Those profits should contribute to the revenue because they represent income to a certain number of persons. If the company distributes its accumulated profits in cash instead of bonus shares, the individual shareholders will pay tax in respect of them. But the company may at the same time issue new stock and in vite the shareholders to purchase it with their dividends. If they do that they are in the same position as the man who receives bonus shares and has previously paid taxation on a cash dividend. receiver of bonus shares can convert into cash. The bonus share is scrip worth at least its face value.",50
245,Mr CORSER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Capita l is l e ft in a busiof the recipient. ness for the purpose of earning more venue.,51
246,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Quite so, and the shareholders will derive more profit the additional revenue.",51
247,Mr CORSER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,But not if the profits are distributed in cash.,51
248,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I do not urge that they should be distributed in cash, but do say that when profits are distributed recipients should pay income tax spect of them. A well-to-do shareholder with income from other sources may deiu cide not to accept any dividend in cash, but to wait u n t il he can receive his share of 1922. of profits in the form of bonus shares. By so doing he will be increasing his in terest in the company, and w i ll not pay any taxation in respect of those shares beyond the company rate of Is. in the £ 1 . _ (Extension of time granted.) We ments for the year 1920-21. are told that bonus shares are not cash, and are not always realizable. I suggest to the honourable member for since. Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , who has more experience of companies than I have, that bonus shares disti'ibuted from accumugether lated profits are usually worth bonus shares distributed from current profits. Yet although the latter are not cash, aud are not always as realizable the period from ""1915 to 1922. as the shares distributed from accumuwere lated profits, they are taxed.",51
249,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Because taxation has not previously been paid in respect of them.,51
250,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The only tax upon lated company profits under the present law Is. in the £ 1 , and that is the dividend in cash or in kind is taxed in the hands of the recipient. right honourable member must not enfrom deavour to make the House believe that these profits are doubly taxed.",51
251,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I wish to avoid duplicathat tion.,51
252,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It is avoided when the company tax is rebated. Bonus shares distributed from current profits since have previously paid the same tax as in 1922. those distributed from reserves. point which the right honourable member is urging is: that bonus shares distripassed. buted from reserves have already been taxed in the hands of the company, and should not be again The in the hands of the shareholders. them Bonus shares distributed from current profits upon which the company tax had not been paid were taxed in the hands Under the law of toreday all company profits are subject to a tax of Is. in the £ 1 , but under this measure bonus shares distributed fro m from current profits will be taxed, but those distributed from last year's profits which have been carried to reserves will not be taxed.",51
253,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The honourable member I said that the Hig h Court's judgment in the the James case lumped them together in reand made them all taxable.,51
254,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,No ; the judgment the James case related only to the law as it existed prior to the amending act,51
255,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I am not too sure of that.,51

259,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The bill deals with If that not so, this bill would have to validate the collection of taxation since 1922, but the present law quite clearly exempts bonus shares distributed from accumuprofits, whioh, according to the deis cision of the Hig h Court, were taxable rebated when uuder the old law.",51
260,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Is the honourable member The opposed to this bill on its merits apart the past history of this taxation ?,51
261,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am pointing out that the bill has bad antecedents, and the House was led by a wrong interpretation of the High Court judgment in the Webb case to acquiesce in the revision of this taxation both by re1923 funds and by an amendment of the act I have already said that I The cannot shoulder the .responsibility of declaring that this bill should not be The Government's responsibility is to convince the House that this legislation is necessary and just, and the taxed only ground upon which it can be justified is that of expediency. It certainly cannot be justified by considerations of law or equity. Money was refunded illegally; otherwise this validating bill would not be necessary. The House was misled into sanctioning the refund, and also to amend the act in relation to future assessments. Whilst I do not say that the Government should require the shareholders to pay again taxation previously collected and reftindcd, it is the duty of the Government to give Parliament at least another chance to declare whether bonus shares shall be taxed in future.",51
262,Mr BRENNAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Hav e these refunds been made ever since 1922? Mr SCTJLLIIN"" - I understand the department has refunded all moneys claimed by men who had paid taxation in respect of bonus shares from 1915 to 1922.",52
263,Mr BRENNAN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Why did not Government deal with this indemnity long ago?,52
264,Mr SCULLIW,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The decision in the James case was given only last year. This bill was introduced last session, was amongst the slaughtered innocents when the session was hurriedly terapplying minated prior to the general election. Two members of the royal commission on taxation reported in favour of conholder tinuing to tax bonus shares issued from accumulated profits, but the majority recommended that they be exempt, and that recommendation was acted spect upon by the then Treasurer (Mr certificate Bruce). A careful reading of the report discloses, however, that the majority's view was influenced very largely by decision of the House of Lords in the Blott case, which, Mr Justice Isaacs has declared, had no bearing upon Comclava monwealth legislation. The House of Lords gave its interpretation of the wording of a section of the English whereas the Australian act clearly stated that income in the form of bonus shares was taxable. Let me deal seriatim with ihe three reasons stated in the commisto sion's majority report for the exemption of these shares-(1 ) Bonus shares are capital, and therefore should not be taxed; (2) the receipt of bonus shares does not increase the proportionate terest of the shareholder in the company; (3) the receipt of bonus shares does increase the shareholder's taxable capacity. In regard to the first reason, I submit that bonus shares are first profits, which then become income, because, mark you, the law refers only to bonus shares issued out of accumulated profits, and not to such shares issued from capital by a writing up of assets.",52
265,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If profits are stored up, they become capital.",52
266,Mr SCUXLIW,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yes , but they were income first.",52
267,Mr MAXWELL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Why not tax handsomely the profits of a company and be done with it?,52
268,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"We used to do that up to 2s. Sd. in the £1. thai Mr SCULLIiSr - Onl y on undistributed profits, and then we gave a rebate to the shareholder when those profits reached him in the form of dividends.",52
269,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That was because we the taxed at the destination, and not at the source. Mr SCULLLTN"" - I do not think we should tax at the source. We should tax at the destination, and each individual but should pay in proportion to his income. The English act taxes at the source, the maximum rate to all profits of a company, and rebating the whole amount when the profits reach the shareas dividends. Every shareholder in England who receives a dividend warrant gets also a notification that a certain amount of taxation has been paid in reof it, and, upon presentation of that at the Treasury, the amount stated thereon is refunded to him. That is certainly the most equitable way; the whether it is simple or not is another question. Bonus shares, we are told, are capital. The honourable member for Bala(Mr Watt) says that they are profits which become capitalized, and flow back into the capital of the company. If act, the honourable member invested one-half of his salary in a company the day after he received it , it would be capitalized the moment he invested it, but he would have pay income tax on the amount so invested. He could not go to the taxation department, and say that he had received so much in income last year, but had invested one-half of the amount on which inhe required an exemption. He would be laughed at if he made such a suggestion. not Such a concession, however, is made to a shareholder in a company with respect to some of his profits which, I submit, is not an equitable proposition. If we to make reductions in income taxation rates because it is considered that are too high, we should make reductions all round, and not give special treatment to those drawing incomes from shares in declining to do so. companies. W hy should the shareholders in companies receive special favours The second argument of a majority of tion. the Taxation Commission is that the procompany portionate interest of the shareholder a company is not increased by the receipt of bonus shares. W it h due respect to members of the commission, I think that that is a stupid argument.",52
270,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"He a r , hear !",53
271,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am glad to have the honourable member's approval. If is to be argued that by the receipt of bonus shares the proportionate interest a shareholder in a company is not i creased, and therefore, he should not taxed, it could also be argued that the receipt of a cash dividend his interestthe £ 1 . is reduced, and he should receive a bonus. The proportionate interest is reduced when a cash dividend is paid.",53
272,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,No . Mr G. FRANCIS - The sum of his i terest is reduced but the proportion the same.,53
273,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If that is the interis pretation to be placed upon it , it makes the recommendation of the commission more ridiculous. The third reason submitted by the commission is that ceipt of the bonus shares does not increase the taxable capacity of the shareholder. That is a point which I referred in reply to the honourable member for (Mr Corser). It gives as much taxable capacity as is given to a man who ceives his dividend in cash, and who once invests it . As far as taxable city is concerned, he is in exactly the same position as a man who puts his cash dividend into other shares, or some i vestment that returns income. If he does not wish to retain it as capital, he can dispose of it , and his taxable capacity is the same.",53
274,Mr WATT,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If the honourable member derive greater benefit. were to put 100,000 shares in a company represented on the market, he would see what would Earle happen.",53
275,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,That amount of tax is not the full face value of the shares. are The maximum would be 25 per cent. Dr EAR LE PAGE - The Commonwealth they Taxation Commissioner will not accept shares in payment of income tax.,53
276,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"He is very wise in When the amendment of the 1922 act was passed, bonus ? shares were exempted from income taxaI n 1923 an amendment of the rate was also passed, which can in be regarded as one of the worse things done in regard to company taxation. The the company rate was reduced to Is. in the £ 1 , while the rate to be paid by individuals run up to 5s. or more in the £ 1 . It is unfair and unjust. Under this law one-third of the profits go into reserves, and as the result of this only the comi t pany rate is paid. The next year the bonus shares issued are not taxed beyond of the Is. in the £ 1 already paid, and n - later they can be redeemed by the combe pany distributing cash, although they by have not been taxed beyond the Is. in",53
277,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Does not the honourable member think it right to encourage public companies ?,53
278,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yes , and to enn - courage good business men and others; is but the department should adequately tax the men who are forming companies to avoid the higher rates. The Government encouraging a lot of persons to convert their businesses into companies, and thus evade the income tax law.",53
279,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,We should amend the rethe law to include them.,53
280,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The Government tried last year to include holding comto panies which are robbing the department of revenue, but I doubt very much wheWide Bay ther it has succeeded.",53
281,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,There is no reason rewhy we should discourage the legitimate at joint stock companies which are necessary capato encourage development.,53
282,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I do not wish to discourage the formation of legitimate joint n - stock companies, but whilst we allow a company rate of Is. in the £ 1 , and leave the individual rate at 5s. in the £ 1 , we are inducing a number of persons to turn their businesses into companies, and thus The farmers by the Treasurer (Dr Page) and other honourable members are too busily engaged in tilling the soil to have an opportunity to obtain legal advice as to the advantages to be derived from converting their farming businesses into companies, and thus avoiding taxation. The Treasurer cannot be unaware of the extent to which companies have increased, but I shall give some figures later to show that this low company rate is an incentive to persons to act in the way I have mentioned. The Treasurer said that the law should be amended, and last year introduced a bill to overcome the difficulty, but it is very questionable whether it has had the results desired. When companies pay a rate of Is. in the £ 1 while individuals have to pay 5s. in the £ 1 , it is merely placing a big temptation in the way of certain persons. In the report of the commission dealing with the amendment of the act, it was stated that a company rate of Is. in the £ 1 on all the profits of a company would lead to a simplification of the work. That was stressed in the House at the time. In Mr Ewing's last report which was tabled a few days ago, he said, "" It has considerably increased the work of assessing the shareholders."" ' Mr Ewing points out that whilst it has simplified the assessing of companies to a small degree, it has considerably increased the difficulties of assessing individual shareholders. From the point of view of the Federal Taxation Department the present system is much less satisfactory and less economical than the former practice of taxing companies only on the undistributed income. That is the considered opinion of the Taxation Department after its experience since 1923. In section 21 of the act provision was made to deal with holding companies. Concerning this the Taxation Commissioner says, "" It is not yet possible to state whether it has proved satisfactory."" Honourable members wil l remember that the Treasurer introduced a measure last year to prevent the department from being cheated the formation of holding companies. The procedure followed is very simple. An investing or holding company, which does not do any business is formed to hold the shares of the trading company. The bulk of the shares of many trading companies are held by holding companies. The representative of a trading company in forms the Commissioner that two-thirds of its profits have been distributed. The Commissioner follows the dividends and finds that they have been paid to holding companies which pay a rate of only Is. in the £ 1 . That was sought to be avoided by an amendment of the act last year. I . pointed out that by the transfer to a number of holding companies the profits of a trading company that would be taxable were diminished. The Prime Minister said at the time that that could not be avoided, and it cannot be while the law remains as it is. The position could be. met by reverting to the old law. because even under it a flat rate of 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 was imposed, although in some cases it was less.",53
283,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"There has been a reduction of 25 per cent, in the general rate since then.",54
284,Mr SCTJLLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,But even that would not bring it down to is. in the £ 1 .,54
285,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"To about Is. 9d. in the £ 1 . Mr SCTJLLIN"" - Honourable members fact should consider the abnormal increase in the number of companies since the act was passed under which a company rate of Is. in the £ 1 was imposed. For the yeara 1920-1 to 1922-3 the number of companies returning income tax returns was reduced by 219. Between 1922-3 and 1924-5, when the Is. in the £ 1 rate was introduced, the number of taxable companies increased by 1,469. I submit that that is an abnormal growth, and shows how revenue is being lost by the conversion of private trading concerns into companies. It is an easy matter to form a company in which 95 per cent, of the shares are held by one person and the other 5 per cent, by the members of his family, and thus the payment of the individual rate is avoided. With this increase in the number of companies, there has been a marked reduction in the number of individual taxpayers. I am not u n m in d f u l of the fact that the increase in the exemption is an by important factor. A glance at the statistics will show that the number of individual taxpayers has been considerably reduced, whilst the number of taxable companies has considerably increased. This shows that individual taxpayers are formin g themselves into companies in order to evade their share of taxation. This action of the Government has been solelv in the interests of rich shareholders, because no refunds have been made to persons with small incomes. The lowest man was on an eighteenpenny rate. The bulk of this money was refunded to men whose incomes were not less than £4,000 a year. Those persons have been given hundreds of thousands of pounds, and it has now been proved that that money was illegally refunded. A great deal of the profits that were distributed in the shape of bonus shares was made from war profiteering. The stock was watered, and the capital increased out of the accumulated profits. shares were issued the individuals who received them should have paid income tax at the rate provided for individuals. Acting upon a most doubtful decision the Government made refunds. A list of the persons who received those refunds would make interesting reading, but I do not suppose that we can hope to get it . We should, however, be informed of theaggregate amount that was refunded, the amount that was assessed but not collected, and an approximation of the amount that was not assessed. The Government surely has not been given a mandate to validate this act of lawlossuess!",54
286,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The validating bill was before the people prior to the elecTreasurer tion.,55
287,Mr SCULLIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"If that is so, the vernment will be claiming to have reimpossible ceived a mandate with respect to quite number of other niatters. In this in - to accept the position. stance the Government has brought down a bill to legalize an unlawful act, not penalize any one because of it , as i case of the Crimes Bill . I admit that difficulties would confront the Treasurer if this money had to be re-collected. There would be hardships, but they could be mitigated under certain sections of our law. I want an assurance from the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) that after much more careful consideration than was given to the Webb case, the Government is satisfied that it cannot collect the they are insurmountable. money which it illegally refunded. I it is impossible to re-collect it , the f of having refunded it without proper warrant is emphasized. The Treasurer, when introducing the bill, said that ParHouse liament had approved of its provisions. That approval was given only because the interpretation of the Webb case which Parliament at the time had before i Doubtless the Government, and certainly this Parliament, were misled. A huge blunder - was made because of the bad legal advice that the Government received, and public revenues have suffered in consequence.",55
288,Dr EABLEPAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"In what way does the honourable member suggest that it could have been obviated ? Neither the Government nor the Commissioner of Taxation has any other means of obtaining an interpretation than that which is afforded by an appeal on the part of a taxpayer. When the Mr Scullin - B e for e the Government jumps to any conclusion as to what the High Court means, it should submit a test case to that court.",55
289,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The Government cannot get to the High Court unless a taxpayer lodges an appeal. Mr Scullin"" - The decision of the High Court in the James case was consistent with that which it gave in the Webb case. It is useless for any honourable member to try to ' ' put it on "" the' judges.",55
290,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,Some learned counsel thought that they were quite inconsistent.,55

If we can be satisfied that it is to re-collect this money witha out confusion and hardship, we shall have But surely the onus is on the Government to prove that to that is so! The Treasurer has not so far n the done that. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) has the advantage of having been a Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and he is thus in a better position than most of us to judge of the difficulties that confront the Treasurer in this matter. The little knowledge that I possess in regard to taxation compels me to admit frankly that there are difficulties; but I am unable to say whether Honourable f members should listen very carefully to o l l y the debate. I shall certainly do so. The wrong interpretation which was placed upon the Webb case not only led this into acquiescing in the remission of money that had been collected, but also of into sanctioning exemption from such taxation. In the light of the latest det . cision of the court, the Government should come down with a bill which will give this House an opportunity to decide whether those taxpayers should, in future, be exempt. The present position is that an illegality has been committed, and are now asked to legalize it .",55

A new was formed to purchase the whole of the assets of the old company, each shareholder of the old company being allotted four shares in the new company.
