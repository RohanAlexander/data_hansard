0,NA,Unknown,"the report of the Joint Committee on Constiman tutional Review. This report recommended 10 per cent tolerance, but the honourable difficulty member for Holt conveniently did not quote this passage of that report. It states: The Committee was assisted in its task by the Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth, Mr L. Ainsworth, who also obtained the views of Commonwealth Electoral Officer and the Surveyoroutback General for each f the States. The preponderance that opinion was clearly in favour of retaining the 0 marginal allowance at the existing The report continues: Undoubtedly, it would be easier lo apply a one-fifth margin than to work within the limits of tenth marginal allowance from quota. Nevertheless, the Committee is satisfied thar the problems of ing a one-tenth margin are quite manageable. The Committee members did say that but, of course, they were not the experts in the field and therefore their opinion would not be as sound as that of Mr Ainsworth and those of the Commonwealth Electoral Officers in the States. In considering the desirability of a 10 per cent tolerance instead of a 20 per cent tolerance surely the Minister must have taken section 25 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act into account. It provides that whenever one-quarter of the divisions of the States are out of balance-that is one-fifth above or one-fifth below the quota- a redistribution may be held. So it is clear why those people who had the closest working knowledge of the problem-the Electoral Commissioners-favou r the 20 per cent margin instead of the 10 per cent margin which is provided in this Bill. In regard to the third point I raised initially, that is the proposed guidelines for the Commissioners, in 1965 the Government amended the Commonwealth Electoral Act to set clearer guidelines to assist the Distribution Commissioners in their task. This was done to achieve uniformity in the redistribution process between the States. These amendments have had a far and widespread effect on the outcome of redistributions, not simply favouring the rural areas, but taking into account the great spread of population and the growth of population in the marginal city areas. To remove from consideration such factors as area, remoteness and sparsity of population is flying in the fact of common sense and, to use the Minister's own words is 'making a mockery of democracy'. Only a who represents an electorate of 3 or 4 a square miles could fail to understand the of representing people in large electorates where distance, remoteness and sparsity of population make the task frustrating and difficult. Only those who have experithen enced the privations of remoteness, the tyrthe any of distance and the loneliness of the really understand the need for these of factors to be taken into account when drawone-fifth fraction. ing boundaries. The guidelines contained in the Bill completely wipe aside these considerations leading a one- to a situation whereby those already large electorates like Kennedy, Kalgoorlie, Grey, applyMaranoa and Darling could well be fixed well over the quota. In other words the Commissioners may be forced to make them even larger by adding people from other communities to an electorate where in fact they may not have a community of interest. If ever there was a half baked, half cocked Bill that shows complete contempt for the great outback pioneers of this nation, this is the masterpiece. It is an incredible hotpotch of inpractical notions, unfair contentions that would lead us to a crazy situation of having one redistribution on top of another. Neither does it achieve one vote one value as a principle, nor does it offer a practical workable proposal to Distribution Commissioners in a time when population mobility can cause enormous fluctuations from place to place in 12 months. Nor does it treat with understanding and sympathy the problems of people living in the remote areas of Australia. Other honourable members have spoken about New Zealand. It is futile to compare Australia with New Zealand or with any other country which has so vastly dissimilar characteristics. The Electoral Act as it stands acknowledges these facts.",60
1,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,60
2,Dr KLUGMAN,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker, I suppose it is fitting that you should be in the chair at the present time since your seat, according to the latest census figures, contains the smallest population in New South Wales. It is a pity that the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Hewson), who is a Country Party member and strongly supports that Party and who, judging by his maiden speech is probably also a member of the League of Rights, is not in the House at the moment because he strongly supports the present system of distribution of electorates and the present system of voting. I intend to seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the figures for the Division of MCMillan. The figures show that the honourable member for MCMillan received 8,282 primary votes in the last Federal election which amounted to 16.63 per cent of the vote in the Division of MCMillan. Mr Corbett-Who won in the finish?",60
3,Dr KLUGMAN,Unknown,"He won in the finish. However, it is interesting that the honourable member received 8,000 votes and won whereas a person like myself had to get 36,000 votes to win. Mr Corbett-Congratulations .",61
4,Dr KLUGMAN,Unknown,"Than k you very much. I assume that if I were a member of the League of Rights I would not have received 36,000 votes; I probably would have received less than 8,000 of the votes cast in my electorate. I seek leave to incorporate the figures for the Division of MCMillan in Hansard.",61

6,Dr KLUGMAN,Unknown,"I congratulate the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly), who is at the table, for introducing this Bill so early in the session. I think it is an important Bill. It is a Bill that quite clearly distinguishes us from the Australian Country Party. I think the significant advantage of introducing this legislation so early is that if the Senate should decide to reject the Bill and then to reject it again in August, or whenever the 3 months period is up, we should be able to have a double dissolution at a time when the Senate elections normally would be due to take place. I congratulate the Minister for not delaying the introduction of this proposition. One of the interesting things about the discussion of this Bill, of course, has been the complete difference in attitude, though probably not in voting on the measure, between the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party. The Country Party pooh-poohs the proposition of one man one vote and believes that this is certainly not the sort of thing that one should support. The Country Party has decided, quite correctly from its point of view, that this principle would act to its disadvantage. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) speaking on this Bill last Thursday evening, in regard to one vote one value said: I do not reject that concept but I say quite specifically and unequivocally that there is no time at which that can be achieved in all its pristine purity. He went on to say: It is therefore necessary to realise while it may be a fundamental objective lo be sought it must be understood to be incapable of actual achievement at any time. Nevertheless the law should do what it can to as near as practicably achieve it. I think the important point made by the Leader of the Opposition is that he does aim to achieve it and it is not surprising that he First Percentage should aim for this because the Liberal Party Preference to formal in many ways is in fact the Party that is most votes votes discriminated against under the present setup. 24.14 The figures showing the total area of 3.113 6.25 electoral divisions held by each political party 8.282 16.63 in each State, Territory and throughout 3,583 7.19 Australia as a whole are interesting. I seek 45.78 leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out these figures. 52.40% 47.60% Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order ! Is leave F. LEY, Chief Electoral Officer granted?

7,Dr KLUGMAN,TOTAL AREA OF ELECTORAL,"We find that the Australian Labor Party holds in 6 States, excluding the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, 62.81 per cent of the area. If we include the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory we come down to about 52 per cent of Australia as a whole. This is approximately the proportion of votes that the Labor Party received at the last election, and it is approximately the proportion of representatives we have in this House. So that is fair enough. I am not complaining. The Liberal Party, on the other hand, holds only 9.98 per cent of the total area in the 6 States and only 8.22 per cent of the total area of Australia. The Country Party holds 27.21 per cent in the 6 States and 40 per cent of Australia as a whole, if one includes the Northern Territory. I feel that the Leader of the Opposition, when speaking undoubtedly for the Liberal Party alone and not for the Country Party, NA IN EACH STATE, TERRITORY AND TOTAL AUSTRALIA Electorates held by Australian Labor Party Liberal Party Country Party Total NA 211,712.1 10,710.9 87,011.0 309,434.0 2,900.4 22,329.4 62,920.2 88,150.0 202,613.0 10,617.0 453,770.0 667,000.0 195,389.0 184,681.0 380,070.0 897,953.1 15,741.9 62,225.6 975,920.0 26,382.0 26,382.0 1,536,949.6 244,080.2 665,926.2 2,446,956.0 520,280.0 520,280.0 939.6 939.0 1,537,888.6 244,080.2 1,186,206.2 2,968,175.0 PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL-PE R CENT 68.42 3.46 28.12 100.00 3.29 25.33 71.38 100.00 30.38 1.59 68.03 100.00 51.41 48.59 100.00 92.01 1.61 6.38 100.00 100.00 100.00 62.81 9.98 27.21 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.66 100.00 51.81 8.22 39.97 100.00 Service from information obtained from the Commonwealth put up a reasonable argument that he is in favour of one vote one value and that this Parliament should legislate to achieve this end as nearly as practicable. In his speech on the Bill last Thursday night he said: The Liberal Party believes that our purpose in shaking this legislation should be commenced by 4 basic principles. Firstly, that parliamentary democracy must be preserved and be seen to be preserved; secondly, electorates should as near as practicable, be equal in numbers through the expected lifetime of the distribution; thirdly, to prevent excessive sectional representation in the Parliament; and, fourthly, to prevent the gerrymandering of electoral boundaries. I certainly would not disagree with him on the propositions which he put forward. He went on to say: Our purpose is to maintain, as far as is practicable and fair, the principle of one vote one value. The Liberal Party believes that the electoral commissioners when drawing up a distribution should have sufficient tolerance above or below the average to enable them to judge population movements to achieve equality about mid-term. I think the important point to rememberand 1 hope that the Distribution Commissioners will remember this-is that the Liberal Party and the Labor Parly, the parties in this House which represent the vast majority of the people of Australia, agree that the main approach in redistribution should be on the basis of population and the main variation within the 10 per cent or 20 per cent, whatever it may be at the time of the redistribution, should be on the basis of expected population changes during the next few years. 1 think it is important to recognise this. The Labor Party obviously is disadvantaged at the present time. The tables attached to the Minister's second reading speech show that in New South Wales- I am dealing only with New South Wales today- 9 of the 10 electorates with the highest population are held by the Australian Labor Party. In order of highest population they are Werriwa, Chifley, Cunningham, Mitchell, Grayndler, Prospect, Parramatta-the only seat that is held by the Liberal Party-Macarthur , Sydney and Macquarie. Nine out of the 10 are each represented by one single Labor Party member in this House and only one by the Liberal Party. The Priine Minister (Mr Whitlam), representing Werriwa as he does, on 30th June 1971 represented a population of 142,568, nearly twice as many people as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, represented in this House- a total number of 80,475. Since then the position would have worsened from our point of view because Werriwa's population is increasing and the people of Lyne are leaving that electorate. Even though the electoral commissioners will distribute electorates on the basis of actual electors 1 hope they will also look at the matter from the point of view of the total population, realising that we represent not people who will have a vote at the next election but also people who do not have a vote either because they are too young or because they are not yet naturalised. Last week we had the spectacle of the Country Party and the Liberal Party fighting in this House and voting against one another over the relative salaries of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Australian Country Party. We were assured that this argument was a purely symbolic argument. We were told that the Leader of the Australian Country Party, of course, did not need more money but that he. was only symbolically trying to show how important the Country Party was. 1 do not think that anybody in this House listening to the debate on electoral redistribution would believe for one moment that this matter is a symbolic argument so far as the Country Party is concerned. It would not care a hoot about symbols on this issue. All it is concerned about is preserving its small electorates. Mr Corbett-Small electorates? Where did you get that from?",62
8,Dr KLUGMAN,SQUARE MILES,"I mean small in terms of population. I think it is important that we do not finish up with extreme gerrymanders. This applies whether we are talking about State Houses or the Commonwealth Parliament. I suppose the most extreme gerrymanders from opposite sides have occurred in Queensland. We can see the sorts of people they have produced as Premiers. Firstly we had Vince Gair as Premier as the result of the Labor gerrymander. Currently Mr Bjelke-Petersen is the Premier, again because of an extreme gerrymander. I think few people in this country will dispute my proposition that this sort of gerrymander does not bring to the top the best people as Premiers in that State.",63
9,Unknown,SQUARE MILES,Sitting suspended from 6.J4 to 8 p.m.,63
10,Dr KLTJGMAN,SQUARE MILES,"Before the suspension of the sitting we were discussing the Commonwealth Electoral Bill, which, basically, has 2 aims. One aim is to change the present 20 per cent population margin between electorates which can be allowed by the Distribution Commissioners. The second aim is to remove the proposition that distance and size of an electorate should be the main factors considered in giving effect to the 20 per cent margin. I was pointing out that there was a significant difference-in fact, there is a comonly plete opposition-betwee n the points of view expressed by the Leader of the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Australian Country Party, both of whom have spoken in this debate. The Leader of the Countrv Party strongly opposed the proposition of one vote, one value. The Leader of the Liberal Party, as Leader of the Opposition, when speaking last Thursday strongly supported the proposition of one vote, one value and said that the main factor to be taken into account by the Commissioners at the next redistribution should be the likely changes in the population of the electorates during the next 3 to 6 years. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition on this point; I think all members on this side of the House would agree with him. I wonder whether some compromise cannot be reached between us. I am not sure that much compromise would be required because most of us on this side of the House would agree that if the 20 per cent margin exists purely for the purpose of allowing for changes in population, that margin should be applied. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt), who spoke before 1 did this afternoon, did not pretend that the difference between the Liberal Party and the Country Party today was a symbolic difference. That may have been so last week on the question of the difference in salary as between the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Lynch) and the Leader of the Country Party. Last week, honourable members may recall that we were told that a symbolic difference existed between them. It was maintained that, in fact, the Leader of the Country Party could buy us all and that the question of money was only a question of symbolism. The honourable member for Gwydir and, I think, the other members of the Country Party who have spoken in this debate, have shown quite clearly that no symbolic question is involved in this issue, but that they are worried about losing their seats. The honourable member for Gwydir referred to the 2 new electoral divisions which are to be formed in the western suburbs of Sydney and he made the categorical statement that they would replace 2 rural seats. 1 hope that that is so, but if we looked at the figures for the Sydney metropolitan area I think we probably would find that only one of the scats that would be abolished would be a rural seat and that the other would be from the inner area of Sydney. I think we mu.st again pay tribute to the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly), who introduced this Bill, and point out how unselfish he has been on this issue because his seat is one of the seats that has a relatively small population. Jt is almost approaching the population of the major Country Party seats and certainly is on the way down in regard to population. The honourable member for Gwydir also macle the point that the principle of one vote, one value does not exist anymore. If the honourable member was referring to individual electorates, I agree with him. The principle of 100 per cent one vote, one value could not operate. But if there were proportional representation for an entire State or for the Commonwealth, we would have one vote, one value. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) attacked the Government on the rather shallow proposition that in South Australia and Western Australia there existed a gerrymander much worse than the one which exists in the Commonwealth today. 1 do not fully understand the honourable member's proposition but 1 think the implication was that there were Labor governments in South Australia and Western Australia and yet this sort of gerrymander existed in those Stales. Surely it is quite obvious that the gerrymander in those States was introduced by Liberal-Country Party governments. Those Parties control the upper Houses in both South Australia and Western Australia and it is impossible for those Labor governments to change the position. It certainly is not in the interests of the present governments in either South Australia or Western Australia to continue the gerrymander and with the extreme loading that exists in country electorates in these 2 States. Another point of interest to me was that when the honourable member for Moreton was talking about the electorate of Kennedy he made the point that there was no community of interest between Mount Isa and Kingaroy. I assume that Kingaroy is outside the electorate of Kennedy at present; Mount Isa is in the electorate. This seems to be a far fetched sort of argument. What is the proposition? In the case of huge electorates or even an electorate of medium size, such as the one represented in this Parliament by the honourable member for Gwydir. there obviously would be no community of interest between areas that are some distance apart. Probably no community of interest exists in the Sydney metropolitan area between residents of Vaucluse and Paddington. There may be community of interest on the matter of transport to the eastern suburbs, but even there I doubt whether people in Vaucluse would adopt the same attitude as would those in Paddington. Certainly, the sort of people who live in Vaucluse and the sort of people who live in many areas of Paddington do not have a common interest. The proposition that apparently wa9 put up by the honourable member for Moreton is that there must be a complete community of interest to have one electorate. I completely disagree with the honourable member. In fact, in a pluralist society like Australia it is difficult to argue what community of interest exists between any 2 people or number of groups of people and whether, at any point, the people are completely opposed in regard to community of interest. I have about one minute remaining to me to speak on this Bill. Earlier I mentioned the case of the honourable member for MCMillan and somebody came to me and asked me to repeat what I had said and, for the benefit of those present, I will repeat it. The honourable member for MCMillan is a newly elected member of this House. He has made speeches in which he has strongly supported the present system of election to this House and the present form of democracy which exists in this House. The honourable member for MCMillan now is nodding his head. T am not surprised that he supports this principle because he was elected to this House from a country seat with 16.6 per cent of the primary vote. With just over 8,000 primary votes, he represents the people of MCMillan-nearl y 50,000 electors-in this House. That is a ridiculous state of affairs. Considering the views of the honourable member I am not surprised that he received only 8,000 odd votes. The views that he expressed in his maiden speech were the views of the League of Rights and it is surprising and deplorable to me that people with views such as those should receive even 8,000 votes in any electorate in Australia. But I was pleased that even in an electorate such as MCMillan he was able to receive only 16 per cent of the vote. I am quite sure that the honourable member for MCMillan will not be here after the next election. I will be interested to hear his reply to my claim.",63
11,Mr HEWSON,SQUARE MILES," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",65
12,Mr SPEAKER,SQUARE MILES,Order ! Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,65
13,Mr HEWSON,SQUARE MILES,Yes . The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) has deliberately made an untrue accusation. His final statement to the House relating to his earlier accusation was well watered down. His first remark was that I was a member of the League of Rights. I deny it. I never have been. It is a deliberate lie.,65
14,Mr SPEAKER,SQUARE MILES,Order ! The words 'deliberate lie' are unparliamentary. I ask the honourable member to withdraw them.,65
15,Mr HEWSON,SQUARE MILES,"I will say that it is deliberately untrue. I stand by that. I say on oathwbich is something that the honourable member would not take-that it is offensive to me, and I ask him to withdraw it because it is a reflection on the electors of MCMillan to say that I was elected on 16.6 per cent of the vote. That was a primary vote. Four nonsocialist candidates stood. Ifinishedup polling 51 per cent of the total vote. It is most unfair that the honourable member has disparaged me in this way. Mr Armitage- Mr Speaker, I rise to order. I did not quite hear. Did the honourable member say that he was elected on 16 per cent of the vote?",65
16,Mr SPEAKER,SQUARE MILES,Order ! No point of order is involved.,65
17,Mr HEWSON,SQUARE MILES,Thes e sorts of tactics are not savoury. They are most unfair to a new member of this House who has won an election by a very fair method. I had the support of 51 per cent of the total voting population of MCMillan. I will challenge the honourable member to contest the seat against me at the next election on a two candidates first past the post basis. Debate (on motion by Mr Malcolm Fraser) adjourned. NA LEVY FOR NON-PERMANENT NA Ministerial Statement,65
18,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,I ask for leave to make a statement concerning non-permanent ports throughout Australia. Mr Whittorn-Where is 'Stormy Normie'?,65
19,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,"'Storm y Normie', as the honourable member calls him, is sitting in the official advisers' area. He is more of an adornment to the chamber than the honourable member is, if I may say so.",65
20,Mr SPEAKER,PORTS,"Order ! Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",65
21,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,"Since the guaranteed minimum wage levy issue has become the subject of some particularly opportunistic politics by the Victorian Government and, in this Parliament, by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), I want to put on record the course of events which led to this statement today. The first point is that the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour chose to alter the funding basis of the guaranteed minimum wage levy only a month ago. The day after-o n Tuesday, 6th March- I told this House that I was deeply concerned at the implications of the move by the AEWL. I said that 1 was concerned because it might jeopardise the employment of some hundreds of waterside workers, because it might lead to the closure of ports in a way inconsistent with our developing decentralisation policies and finally because the AEWL had decided on this action without consulting me and in anticipation of the inquiry which I had initiated on 23rd February. I undertook to examine the effects of the change and to determine what new financial arrangements might be appropriate to offset the ill effects of the move by the AEWL. That was on 6th March. The following day I sent a letter to all members of the Stevedoring Industry Council confirming that an inquiry into the industry sbould take place and that I would expect it to include an inquiry into the effect of the changes in the method of imposing AEWL levies to finance the guaranteed minimum wage in casual ports. I ask for leave to incorporate in Hansard a copy of the letter which I sent to all members of the Stevedoring Industry Council on 7th March 1973.",65
22,Mr SPEAKER,PORTS,"l s leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)Mr R. M . Northrop, QC, Chairman, Stevedoring Industry Council, C/o Owen Dixon Chambers, 205 William Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000. Dear Mr Northrop, I refer to my letter dated 23rd February in I indicated my intention of seeking advice from Stevedoring Industry Council on a number of matters relating to the future of the industry. The major ties represented on the Council have indicated that they see no difficulties in the way giving me advice in relation to the questions which I propose, namely: (1) What scheme of permanent employment, if any, can be introduced into ports in which the 1967 National Conference scheme involving weekly hiring does not operate? (2) What employment arrangements should be made in respect of ports in which no permanent employment arrangements appear to be viable in the foreseeable future? (3) What special financial arrangements, if any, should be made in respect of ports covered in (i) and (2) above respectively? (4) What changes, if any, should be made to the basis on which the Stevedoring Industry charge is presently levied, and in particular whether the present 'man hour' basis should be replaced or supplemented by some other method of assessment? I would appreciate the Council furnishing me with its views on these matters no later than 31st July 1973. This would not, of course, preclude the Council advising me on any one of these issues at an earlier date if it felt in a position to do so. You probably will be aware of the recent public comment concerning the effect of changes in the method of imposing AEWL levies designed to finance the guaranteed minimum wage in casual ports. In my view, this matter is comprehended by item (3) above, and I would expect the Council's advice to take into account considerations arising in this area. Yours sincerely. CLYDE R. CAMERON",66
23,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,"I thank the House. That letter was sent 2 days after I was informed of the AEWL decision. It is difficult to imagine the former Government, of which the honourable member for Wannon was a member, acting with the speed with which I acted in this case. Over the succeeding week my Department continued to monitor the effect of the AEWL levy. On 15th March-1 0 days after the AEWL decision became known- I told the House: The inquiries I have made have convinced me that it is not a matter entirely in the hands of the employers to correct. It cannot be corrected at all unless we alter the legislation which brought about the disaster. Honourable members will appreciate the significance of that comment a little later. 7th March 1973 During the same debate the honourable member for Wannon alleged, quite incorrectly, that I had not written to the AEWL. The letter dated 7th March, which I have incorporated in Hansard, proves him wrong. The honourable member has been consistently wrong and has consistently attacked me for inactivity which when, in fact, I have expended a great deal the of energy in correcting the mistakes of the parGovernment of which he was a member. Durto me ing my speech on 15th March this year I of the Council announced that Mr Norman Foster",66
24,Mr JAMES,PORTS,"A good man, too.",66
25,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,"Yes , a good man. I agree with the honourable member. During my speech on 15 th March I announced that Mr Norman Foster, together with 2 departmental officers had been dispatched to Portland to make an on the spot investigation of the trouble. The issue came up in the House again on 28th March, 3 weeks after the AEWL changed its levying arrangements. I said in that debate that I would be seeking leave to make a statement in this Parliament concerning the Portland situation as soon as I received the report from my Department which would be reporting to me by Tuesday the following week. That is today. I am happy-indee d I am very proud-to be able to present that report now. That report is now tabled. It has been supplied or will be supplied upon request, to all honourable members. It was on that date-28t h March-that I read to the House part of a letter which I had sent to the Honourable Murray Byrne, Minister for State Development and Decentralisation in the Victorian Government. That letter replied to the criticism of me that had been made by Mr Byrne in the Press and clearly demonstrated the political opportunism of the Victorian Government and its allies in this Parliament in vilifying me during the period of the State pre-election campaign. T ask for leave to incorporate in Hansard the full text of my letter to Mr Byrne-to which, I might add, he has not yet cared to reply.",66
26,Mr SPEAKER,PORTS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)The Hon Murray Byrne, M.L.C., Minister for State Development and Decentralisation, 232 Victoria Parade, Melbourne, Victoria 3002 My dear Minister, In the present controversy over the future of the port of Portland, a number of matters have been misrepresented, and in particular, the Commonwealth's role and the Commonwealth's responsibility. I have been disturbed, for example, to notice the statements attributed to you in the Press attacking me as though Portland's problems were of my creation; and I was disturbed, too, on being informed that at a meeting concerning Portland which was chaired by you on Friday 23rd March, to which the Department of Labour was not initially invited, a motion was adopted which appears to shift the responsibility for the viability of Portland entirely off the State Government's shoulders and entirely on to mine. That resolution read: 'This meeting asks Mr Cameron to make a direct approach to the AEWL and to use his influence to have the decision reversed. If no satisfactory reply is received within a week (by 30th March 1973), Murray Byrne is empowered to send a representative group through Mr Fraser to see Mr Cameron'. Let me say that I find the basis on which the motion was adopted on Friday quite erroneous. This is because it bears no relation to the true cause of Portland's problems. I think you know that I have already asked Mr Norman Foster to investigate the situation at Portland and I expect to have his report in a few days. However, it is clear to me, at this stage, that the problems that exist at Portland have been evident for months and even years before the change in AEWL levy. As_ I am sure you are well aware, the viability of a port is ultimately determined solely by the volume of cargo which can be shipped through it. This in turn depends upon the industries which carry on their activities in the surrounding district and the arrangements which they make to obtain their raw materials and transport ibeir products. For some time cargo through-put at Portland has been declining and the cause of this is the way in which local industries have chosen to operate. So long as through-put continues to decline, the changein the AEWL levying system is of marginal significance-of less significance, for example, than extra costs on Portland shippers due to the increase in the Portland Harbour Trust levies from lst March of this year. I think recognition of my point is implicit in ihat Friday's meeting's decision to establish a commiitee to discuss wool shipments through the port I am certain this approach will be of far more help to Portland than attacks on me through the newspapers. This letter is intended to clarify the major issues involved as I see them, but a major statement on my views must await an opportunity to study Mr Foster's report on the situation. I would be glad if you would pass the contents of this letter on to all those present at the meeting which took place last Friday. Yours sincerely, (CLYDE R. CAMERON) 27 March 1973",67
27,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,"If the Honourable Murray Byrne had the interest in the welfare of Portland that he pretended to have for the purposes of the election campaign, I would have thought that at least he would have replied to my letter to him dated 27th March, but not a word have 1 heard from the Honourable Murray Byrne. The day after that letter was sent-28t h March-actin g on advice from Mr Foster and other officers of the Department as to the seriousness of the situation in some smaller ports, I sent an urgent telegram to the parties to the Stevedoring Industry Council. That telegram read as follows: In view of the difficulties at smaller ports I would be glad if Council could urgently advise me of their views on the guaranteed minimum wage levy. Specifically I seek its view on the desirability of funding the guaranteed minimum wage levy in non-permanent ports out of the uniform levy imposed under the Stevedoring Charges Act, on all ports permanent and non-permanent. I had the added advantage that Mr Norman Foster had actually conferred with the members of the Stevedoring Industry Council and was able to report to me directly on the issues as the Council saw them. This proposal seemed to me the only one which could advantage Portland. Cairns, Mackay, Coffs Harbour and Esperance-the ports in which the guaranteed minimum wage levy had been increased-withou t disadvantaging the remaining ports whose levy had been decreased. The effect of merely returning to the old system-the course advocated by the honourable member for Wannonwould have been to help Portland marginally, ancl only marginally, at the expense of ports like Geelong outside his electorate. I could not afford to be so partisan. 1 had to adopt a nalional outlook to this question and had to behave in more of a statesmanlike manner than the purely partisan parish pump attitude which the honourable member for Wannon has only recently been able to raise in himself. Until recently he did not bother to have even a parish pump interest in the electorate of Wannon but now at any rate he has been able to muster this interest while the Victorian State election campaign is in progress, a synthetic parish pump interest in the affair. This afternoon the Stevedoring Industry Council informed me of its unanimous ommendation and I am pleased to be able to read now to the Parliament the text of the message that I received. The Council agreed, firstly, that it is desirable that the costs guaranteed minimum wage scheme should be funded through the stevedoring industry by charge and, secondly, that in that event cost of this particular item of expenditure should be made from the proceeds of all three rates of charge Which will involve contribution from permanent ports, as applies in the case of other industrial costs. I am now to state to the Parliament that I am authorised by a unanimous decision of the Government members Industrial Relations Committee to recommend to the Cabinet that the guaranteed minimum wage levied in the non-permanent ports be funded from the charges made under the Stevedoring Charges Act. This means that all ports, permanent and non-permanent, will contribute to the miniaffairs mum wage payments made in the smaller ports.",67
28,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PORTS,Coul d I ask,68
29,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,"No , you cannot purposes ask anything. This will have a very substantial effect on the viability of some For example, in Portland the guaranteed minimum wage levy will be reduced from $1.15 a man hour to about 2c or 3c a man hour.",68
30,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PORTS,"Hear , hear!",68
31,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,"Now we have a cry - Hear, hear' from the honourable member who presided over the decision of Cabinet to destroy the smaller ports by the introduction of the former legislation which placed the full responsibility for maintaining these smaller ports in the hands of the employers concerned. Here is the guilty man sitting at the table, the honourable member for Wannon. He was responsibile for the situation that we are in now. Not one word did he utter in this Parliament in protest against the Government's action. Not one question did he ask while he was a private member in this Parliament about the future of Portland. He had 2 spells as a private member-on e before his dismissal as a Minister and another during t'he interregnum till he got back into the Cabinet as the Minister for Defence. On not one occasion did he make any attempt to raise this in the Parliament, so meagre was his interest in the port of Portland. And if it were not for the fact that we have a State election in Victoria his interest now would be recno more than it was then. All the non-permanent ports will be advantaged by the change as this levy of 2c or 3c of the a man hour will be uniform. Only Geelong, whose levy has fallen to 2c now, will not gain the change but neither will it suffer by the the change. I believe that this recommendation represents a far better solution to the problem of the non-permanent ports than those which a have been advocated by the honourable member for Wannon or by the Victorian Governable ment. It is the solution advocated by Mr Bill Lewis, the member for Portland in the Victorian Parliament, who has been indefatigable in his representations to me on this matter. Every day since this dispute occurred Mr Lewis has been in touch with me and my office. Every day I have given him a running account of how the negotiations are proceeding and noone could have taken a greater interest in the of the port of Portland than Mr Lewis. The only time. I have heard from the honourable member for Wannon was when he twice got up in this Parliament and gazed up at the Press hoping that it would report him for the of his local paper. Beyond that not a scintilla of interest did he show in the whole of these ports. Portland dispute. I believe we have the right solution. It was the inability of the honourable member for Wannon to understand the working of the levy system which led to his quite erroneous and unworthy accusation that a deal had been done between the AEWL, the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the parties to the Stevedoring Industry Council. In fact, he showed so little knowledge of the industry that my informants advise me that when he was dealing with this matter in another place he made such a fool of himself that the Honourable Murray Byrne had to call him to one side and explain to him what it was all about. Even the Honourable Murray Byrne laughed about it. I do not know whether the Honourable Murray Byrne is a member of the Country Party or the Liberal Party but he was almost beside himself with mirth at the lack of interest which the honourable member for Wannon displayed when he was called upon to pontificate on the disputes at Portland. The honourable member for Wannon tabled in Parliament on 28th March a letter to Mr Murray Byrne from the Executive Director of the AEWL, Mr Craig, in which Mr Craig said that at a Stevedoring Industry Council meeting on Friday, 16th March, 'an arrangement whereby some casual out-ports were subsidising others was rejected entirely by the parties to the discussions, including the Waterside Workers Federation and the ACTU on the grounds that it was improper for some small ports which may well have problems of their own to be forced to carry additional costs to maintain another port or ports'. The honourable member for Wannon implied that this was a conspiracy but I believe that the Council was quite correct in rejecting a scheme of cross-subsidisation between out-ports-that is, temporary portsjust as it was quite proper to recommend a scheme of cross-subsidisation which would involve the permanent ports. That is just another example of the disregard of the facts by the honourable member for Wannon. 1 believe a solution of this kind justifies the 4 weeks time between the AEWL's change and this announcement during which we have examined the possibilities within my Department. After 23 years of inaction by the former Government, of which the honourable member for Wannon was a member, my Government and my Department in the short space of 4 weeks has been able to come up with a solution which will, providing the State Government does its part-and I emphasise that provision-brin g a solution to the problems of the port of Portland. I turn now to the report on Portland prepared by Mr Foster and other officers of my Department. Although the report has been prepared very quickly in response to the urgency of Portland's problems, I believe it makes a profoundly important contribution to the future of smaller ports generally. The report makes it quite clear, as I have already pointed out in my letter to Mr Byrne, that the viability of smaller ports like Portland will not, in the end, be judged by the nature of the levying arrangements for the guaranteed minimum wage. The causes of Portland's decline go far deeper and quite beyond the ambit of my portfolio. There is, however, a great deal that the Victorian Government, which has attacked me with such ferocity over this issue, could do to ensure Portland's future. My Department's report concludes in the following manner: Having considered a wide range of views, examined submissions and documentation together with ihe results of inspections at Portland, the following matters are noted. The port faces a number of problems which threaten its viability. They include trends toward centralisation and containerisation, seasonal factors and special overseas customer requirements. These have not occurred suddenly {except perhaps for seasonal factors) but have been evident for several years. Although the Victorian Government has espoused the development of Portland as an example of decentralisation, a pattern of trade and transport has been allowed to develop which has resulted in cargoes by-passing Portland in favour of Melbourne and Geelong. These developments, depending as they do on road and rail transport, lie within the power of the State Government to correct. The introduction of the changed levy arrangements has caused considerable concern in Portland. This concern was exacerbated by what was seen as a cavalier altitude on the part of the AEWL, whereby interested parties were denied an opportunity to express a viewpoint on this matter prior to changes being made. The change in levy arrangements was seen as a fundamental departure from the established practice of uniform levies, and not merely an increase in the rate. It was interpreted by some parties that smaller ports such as Portland were being deliberately driven out of existence. In this context, the view was put that the AEWL represents shipping companies and was subject to control and direction by overseas shipping interests to this end. Having Tegard to suggestions that the former basis of funding the guaranteed wage should be restored, it is clear that the pattern of cargoes moving through Portland develooed under the old basis of funding when a uniform rate of levy was applicable. It follows then that reverting to the former basis of funding will do nothing to encourage the future balanced growth of the Fort. It was suggested that the establishment of a container facility for roll-on roll-off vessels should be given consideration as a first step in a co-ordinated approach to ensuring the future of the port. In view of the declining pattern in non-bulk cargoes, and existing competition from road/rail transport, such a step could only be justified if suitable action were taken by State and local authorities to ensure a worthwhile volume of cargoes being available for shipment. Future employment arrangements for waterside workers in small ports (including Portland) were the subject of a communication from the Minister for Labour to the Stevedoring Industry Council on 23rd February 1973. The Minister sought the Council's .consideration of this whole area and such an examination by this forum would give the Minister guidance as to the future of small ports and place the labour aspects of this matter in the proper perspective. (n other words, the report notes that a change to the niinimum wage levy will not save Portland. Its vitality depends on action by the Victorian State Government. Without that, nothing that we can do by way of levies will provide a cure for the problems of Portland. Figures within the report sustain the argument that Portland's decline began long before 5th March when the employers' organisation decided to increase the charges. For example, in the financial year 1967-68, 63,942 bales of wool were shipped from Portland. This represented 38.98 per cent of the bales sold in Portland.",68
32,Mr JAMES,PORTS,How much of that wool was from the honourable member for Wannon?,70
33,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,"That is what I am trying to find out. I do not know whether he sells all his wool through the Portland wool stores. I do know that there was one time when, according to reports- I do not know whether they are true and I cannot vouch for them but the honourable member will tell us later-h e shipped his wool direct to the London wool stores. He did not worry about the Portland wool sales. I do not know whether that report is correct but he has friends in London and he knows more about London than he does about Portland so he probably decided to do that. By the financial year 1971-72 only 5,309 bales were shipped from Portland. This represented 2.24 per cent of the wool sold. A similar situation is reflected in the export of dairy products from Portland. 1 do not know whether the honourable member for Wannon also milks cows but if he does he might be able to explain how these figures came about. In 1967-68, 11.410 tons of dairy products were exported through Portland. In 1971-72, 5,930 tons were shipped. As the report notes: It would seem that rail and road transport organisations have been able to apply policies which have operated to oppose the Victorian Government's announced policy of decentralising trade at Portland. It is for that reason that the report says that it is: . . . unlikely that a reversion to the former funding arrangements will have any significant effect in developing trade through the port. The Government has decided not to revert to the former funding arrangement, but even the new and generous arrangements which I now recommend to Cabinet will have insufficient effect on stevedoring costs to save Portland without rapid action from the Victorian Government of the kind referred to in the report. I place on public record my appreciation of the tremendous interest of and the great help I have received from Senator Primmer in this matter. He has given a great deal of his time to this subject and, like the local State member, Mr Bill Lewis, M.P., has been in daily contact with me to ask that my Department indicate clearly what it proposes to do in this matter. I have now done that, but I repeat that if the Victorian Liberal Government does not get off its backside and do something about it the port of Portland will be doomed no matter what the Australian Government does. The port of Portland will not survive if the Liberal Government of Victoria pays special concession freights to take the wool and other materials that normally would be shipped through Portland down to Melbourne for shipping. We will not get the best out of Portland if the Victorian Liberal Government does not do something about the roll-on rolloff facilities that must be introduced into Portland. We need stern loading also in Portland if we are to get the best out of the port. It is a good port. I believe it has a draft of something like 70 feet. It is one of the deepest ports-if not the deepest, very nearly the deepest-betwee n Melbourne and Fremantle. As I say, it is a good port. It does not deserve to languish and it does not deserve the shocking treatment and neglect which the former Government demonstrated towards it when that Government had the opportunity to do something positive to save the port from the disaster that is now overtaking it. I present the following paper: Guaranteed Minimum Wage Levy for Non-Permanent Ports-Ministeria l Statement, 3rd 1973. and move: That the House take note of the paper. Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr Clyde Cameron)-by leave - agree d to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member speaking for a period not exceeding 30 minutes.",70
34,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PORTS," Mr Speaker, the Minister for Labour (Mr Clyde Cameron) has tried to hide in a mild political barrage-mil d for him- a complete recognition that what had occurred around the levy question was a Federal responsibility resting upon his shoulders. Many people would have been a good deal happier during the last month if there had been public nition of that fact, lf the Minister had pracsupported tised, as his Government is meant to practise, a pattern of open government and had advised people-the Portland Harbour Trust comselling missioners and others-of the moves that have now been revealed in his statement, a good deal of the public concern and public agitation which has occurred would not have occurred. It is quite clear that the Minister for Labour has been responsive to the very real pressure that has come from the Portland Harbour ports. Trust, the Port Development Authority, State Government, and all the local members of Parliament concerned-member s of the Liberal Party, the Australian Labor Party the Australian Country Party, including my friend the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King)-and has acted in a way which certainly will assist the small ports around Australia. I only hope that the Minister has success in having his recommendation accepted by Cabinet. The House needs to note that what he has said tonight is a recommendation that he will put to Cabinet. At this stage it is in fact a Cabinet decision. I hope that Cabinet decision will be made promptly and that any necessary amending legislation will introduced equally promptly. l l needs lo be remembered that what hapthis, pened regarding these levies occurred during the term not of the previous Government but of the present Minister for Labour and therebelated, fore the responsibility for this matter rested upon his shoulders. That has now been recognised. It was recognised in a resolution moved in the Upper House of the Victorian April Parliament and supported by every member of that Parliament. It was recognised by every member of that Parliament from all parties representing Western Victoria. I think that it would have been better if the Minister for Labour could have shown acceptance of his responsibility initially and dealt with this matter in a manner that befits this Parliament instead of hiding it under a political smokefor Wannon screen as he has sought to do. I recognise that this might be in part a mild bait from the Minister for Labour, but I think it needs to be put on record again that in the initial battle to have wool sales established in Portland we broke a 70-year relationship with another wool broking firm, first to try to sell at Portland when wool buyers did not turn up to buy and then, as recogthe only way in which Portland could be under those circumstances-as many other people from western Victoria did, by exporting through the port of Portland didof necessity in London until wool sales were established at Portland. Since then many other people, including myself, have done nothing but sell wool in Portland, and that will continue. But what has occurred-wha t the Minister has announced-is in plain terms a victory for Portland and for decentralised I thank the Minister for Labour for it, the but I could have thanked him more warmly if he had left the politicking out of his speech. I am glad that the Minister has come to and the conclusion that he has come to because I believe it is the right conclusion. He has come to a conclusion which will enable Portland and many other decentralised ports in Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia to continue on a competitive basis. His statement is full justification for the view that has been expressed by representatives of all political parties in Victoria, that the levy was a not matter for the Minister for Labour and the the Minister for Labour alone. But he has responded to that by the statement he has made be accepting that responsibility. If he could only have shown a greater degree of concern, given some indication of his thinking earlier than then much of the concern and the moves that have taken place in the last month would not have been necessary. The recognition was but it is recognition as a result of pressure from all parties and from many different people. Pressure has come from all local members of Parliament, from the Portland Harbour Trust, from the Port Development Authority and from the State Government, and it is noted that members of all political parties have supported the resolutions that were sent and put to the Minister for Labour on this matter. But the Ministers statement glosses over the importance of the levy. It says, really, that the levy is not important to Portland. In his speech the Minister said: . . . the report notes that a change to the minimum wage levy will not save Portland. Its vitality depends on action by the Victorian State Government. Later he said: It is for that reason that the report says that it is 'unlikely that a reversion lo the former funding arrangements will have any significant effect in developing trade through the port'. Earlier in his statement he quoted the report as saying: It follows then that reverting to the former basis of funding will do nothing to encourage the future balanced growth of the port. That statement in the report is grossly inaccurate and it may be that its inaccuracy is due to the haste with which it was prepared. If the report had been checked with the Portland Harbour Trust and the Port Development Authority, they would have known of its innccuracy. Let me give one example. A significant trade has been developed through Portland in bagged wheat. Now, because of the changed levies that had occurred as a result of the decision of the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, 5,000 tons of bagged wheat were going to attract an additional levy of more than $7,000 in Portland and, I think, under $200 in Geelong. There was trade of about 40,000 tons of bagged wheat, and additional levies therefore would have approached $60,000 through Portland. Clearly, the levy for this trade in bagged wheat, bagged grain, was going to be a complete killer. Also, an export trade in oats was developing which I think would have been affected in a somewhat similar manner. These facts, I think, do not find proper recognition in this report which I have not had time to examine in detail. Of course, I have seen the extracts contained in the Minister's speech, and they show that the report is deficient and deficient in serious respects, in trying to suggest that this levy was not really an important matter for outports and was not going to have a material effect. In terms of bagged wheat and labour intensive cargo of that kind, it was going to have a very material effect. The Minister for Labour on 2 occasions in this Parliament has tried to suggest that there are substantia] problems facing Portland as a developing port, a growing port. In order that that might be put at rest, I would ask leave to incorporate in Hansard the last report of the Portland Harbour Trust commissioners.",71
35,Mr SPEAKER,PORTS,Is leave granted?,72
36,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,"Not that book, is it? Mr MALCOL M FRASER-Yes .",72
37,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,"Tur n it up. No, of course leave is not granted. Mr MALCOL M FRASER-Well , at the very least, Mr Speaker",72
38,Mr SPEAKER,PORTS,"I think it is a bit too much to ask that a booklet be included in Hansard. We have to make arrangements with the Government Printer. It is a big job to put the whole of a booklet in Hansard. The Printer will complain about this, as he has done in the past. Mr MALCOL M FRASER-Leave has been refused. T am not arguing about that. But, at the very least, may I ask that a comparative trade summary for the years 1967-68 to 1971-72, as set out at page 17 of the report, be incorporated in Hansard.",72
39,Mr SPEAKER,PORTS,Is leave granted?,72
40,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,I would just like to have a look at it. Mr MALCOL M FRASER-That is the table.,72
41,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,1 cannot read it from here. Mr MALCOL M FRASER-Is leave granted or is it refused?,72
42,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PORTS,"I do not know what it is. You say that it is something, but I cannot sec it. Mr MALCOL M FRASER- I will read it into Hansard. I have sufficient time to do so in the generous half an hour that the Parliament has given me. In 1967-68 the total tonnage which passed through the port was 330,000. In 1968-69 the total tonnage which passed through the port was 473,000 or a little better. In 1969-70 the total tonnage which passed through the port was 609,000. In 1970-71 it was 842,000. In 1971-72 it was 922,000. That table shows a very steady growth and expansion of the total tonnage through the port. Again this does not find reflection in the document prepared by the Minister's troubleshooter. It shows that there is in that document not a prejudice but an incomplete account of what in fact has been happening at Portland. I think that is regrettable. The Minister for Labour and the report which was mentioned referred to obligations of the State Government. The State Government has accepted those obligations. Facilities have been provided at Portland which enable cargoes to be handled quickly and efficiently-perhap s in a better manner than in many other ports around the coast. But at a meeting convened by the Honourable Murray Byrne a short while ago-agai n at which members of all the political parties in Victoria were represented-variou s matters were pursued. One aspect of the report which was anticipated by that meeting is the suggestion that the establishment of a container facility for roll-on roll-off vessels should be given consideration as a first step in a co-ordinated approach to ensuring the future of the port. This matter was discussed at length. The Honourable Murray Byrne has established a committee, consisting of the Chairman of the Marine Board, the Chairman of the Portland Harbour Trust and a Treasury official, which will be visiting many different places in Victoria and taking evidence to ascertain what additional measures might and ought properly to be undertaken by the State in further increasing trade through the port of Portland. So the State certainly is doing its share and it is anticipating the aspects mentioned in the report by the Minister's troubleshooter. But I am glad to have the Minister's recognition of responsibility and I am glad that, even if he tried to cloud it in a smokescreen, he has conceded victory to Portland and to all those who have been fighting for the outports around the coast. I am delighted with the decision and, except for the politicking, I am delighted with the Minister himself. Debate (on motion by Mr Riordan) adjourned. NA The following Bills were returned from Senate without amendment: Migration Bill 1973. Export Payments Insurance Corporation Bill NA (No, 2) 1973 Second Reading Debate resumed (vide page 1004).",72
43,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"The political nature of the second reading speech of the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly)-the Minister responsible for electoral matters-is , I think, without precedent in this Parliament. There has been a long-standing tradition in this Parliament that when Bills are introduced they will be introduced in a factual manner, giving the reasons for the government's proposals and the reasons for the government's decisions. But the Minister, in introducing the Commonwealth Electoral Bill, did so in an entirely political way which was without precedent and which did the Government no credit. The tone for what the Minister did clearly was set by attitudes that are deeply held and deeply expressed in the Australian Labor Party. For example, Mr Hawke, of whom we are not hearing quite so much at the present time, was reported in the 'Australian Financial Review' of 19th February 1970 in this way: 'The cost price squeeze argument', he said This is what we are hearing about today 'amounted to little more than a plea for maintenance of a rural production structure which includes a substantial number of inefficient marginal producers without whom we would all be better off.' There is a better quotation from the present Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), as reported in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of 21st August 1965- a little longer ago. But he is not known as a man who changes his view. He was reported as follows: 'Concentrate on better cities', says Whitlam. 'too much attention is being paid to the wishes and needs of rural areas and too little to the needs of the cities', the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Whitlam, said last night. Cities and civilisation go hand in hand, he told the Sydney division of the Australian Planning Institute last night. By derivation civilised men are those who live in cities, pagans are those who live in the country. That is the end of the quotation from the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is that basic attitude which underlines the electoral redistribution proposals of the Minister the and the Government and their attitudes to rural communities throughout Australia. The purpose of the Electoral Bill quite 1973. plainly is to achieve permanent Labor rule. I think it needs to be noted-this is the ultimate test of fairness of an electoral systemthat in the one year, under the first redistribution which we had undertaken, in which the Labor Party obtained a majority of votes in total that Party at the same time won office. In 1954 Labor won a greater number of votes in total than did the present Opposition parties. But that was an election fought under a redistribution introduced by a Labor government. But under all the redistributions that we have introduced the party that won the majority of votes was the party that won office, and that includes the last election. That, I believe, is the test of a fair electoral system. It will not be the test if this present Electoral Bill is allowed to go through. It is worth noting that no redistribution required under the present law, except in Western Australia. That in itself is the test a good Act because it is not good government moment. and does not provide for a good Parliament or for continuity if redistributions need to be held too frequently. The Opposition now argues against the 20 per cent provision which has been in the Electoral Act since 1902, pre-dating, I think, the existence of Country Party by 16 or 17 years. It was measure that, we were told earlier today, was He said: passed without dissent and without argument because it was accepted as being reasonably tion fair and proper. The 20 per cent provision, as torate bas been explained on a number of occasions, is necessary to allow for population changes. If we are not to have a 20 per cent variation from the average, if it is to be only 10 per cent as this Government wants and if we couple that with the other electoral changes wants to introduce into the Act, we will be faced with 3-yearly redistributions. That would be a nonsense and a disastrous proposal. imum It is worth noting that in the United KingNow dom, because as I understand it, that country had become concerned about the frequency of redistributions, amendments were introfacts duced so that there would not be redistrilation bution changes more frequently than every to 15 years. We need to look at the proposal in this in the light of other proposals that have foreshadowed. The Prime Minister was through the wringer and ultimately gave an assurance that the actual method of voting would not be altered in the life of this ParliaGovernment ment, But he was playing with the prospect of an optional preferential system. It has been made quite plain that if the same Party were returned to office after another election there would be the first past the post voting system, which is the second plank in trying to ensure perpetual Labor rule. The 2 proposals that we are now debating, coupled with the foreshadowed changes after another etetion, if the Government is lucky enough to win it, need tq be looked at in that light. The insidious changes that are proposed are being introduced under a very attractive slogan-on e man, one vote, one value. But what is the difference in principle between a 20 per cent variation from the mean and a 10 per cent variation from the mean? There is no difference in principle between the two. It is a question of degree. What is being proposed in is this area needs to be looked at alongside the changes that the Government wants in section of 19 of the Act, to which I shall refer in a It is interesting to note that some Government supporters do not believe their own words. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Collard) on l l t h March 1968 had this the to say to the Chairman of the Redistribution a Committee at a hearing in Western Australia. If this is so then I would respectfully draw attento certain factors which in my opinion are such as to warrant the boundaries of the Kalgoorlie elecbeing drawn to ensure that it contains no more than the absolute minimum of electors. This meant 20 per cent below the average figure. In 1968 the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), who was then Leader of the Opposition, it in a letter reiterated a view he had expressed in 1962. From any plain reading of his letter he was surely asking the distribution Commissioners in New South Wales to use the maxprovision of the law-2 0 per cent. the Government says that the maximum provision should be 10 per cent to follow the slogan 'one man, one vote, one value'. The are that because of movements in popuan allowance is needed-no t a manda10 tory allowance but an allowance which the Commissioners may use if they believe it is necessary and desirable having in mind the Bill various factors which this Parliament deterbeen mines that they should take into account in put drawing the boundaries of electorates. Again, do we find any proposal from the to reduce the number of electorates in Tasmania from the constitutionally guaranteed 5 seats? Do we hear Government supporters saying that the principle of one man, one vote, one value must apply in Tasmania? Is it going to take seats away from Tasmania in a constitutional referendum? Tasmania has 10 senators and 220,000 voters and New South Wales has 10 senators for more than 21 million voters. This difference is for good and valid reasons. The Government has mooted the prospect of having 2 senators for the Australian Capital Territory and 2 for the Northern Territory. Where is the one man, one vote, one value principle in these aspects of the Labor Party's proposals? For a moment it has been put aside. The difference between 20 per cent and 10 per cent is a difference of degree; it is certainly not a difference of principle. Government supporters who tried to suggest that there was some basic and pure principle involved in this proposal certainly were not depicting the matter properly. The 20 per cent provision enables the Commissioners more nearly to achieve proper equality of representation throughout Australia. I think it is necessary to have in mind that this is not just the Australian view. In Canada the variation from the mean may be 25 per cent either way. In the United Kingdom electorates move from 40,000 to 80,000 voters and in the United States of America, under its Supreme Court ruling, variations of more than 15 per cent from the average have been accepted. When we look at section 19 of the existing Act and the changes which the Labor Party wants to initiate in that area we find the really insidious nature of its proposals which would have a dramatic and unfortunate impact upon representation in this Parliament. The Government wishes to remove all reference to area, remoteness, density or sparsity of population. This, I believe, shows a complete misunderstanding of rural representation. It shows a complete misunderstanding of the time lost in travelling from one centre in a remote electorate to another centre in that electorate. It is important that honourable members within this Parliament should have the capacity and the assistance to enable them to provide equal representation to the people in their electorates. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie obviously would find it difficult to cover his electorate as easily as one of his colleagues from metropolitan Melbourne or Sydney would find it to cover his electorate. The Government wants changes by removing references to area and disabilities arising from remoteness or distance. But at the same time it wishes to leave in a change that was introduced as a proper balancing factor in the 1965 changes to the Act. I refer to the trend of population changes. An analysis of that provision reveals the real and true effect of the proposed amendments suggested by the Government. The effect of removing those references to area and of leaving in the reference to population changes would mean that the extra-metropolitan seats would not only be smaller in size, as obviously they must be, but also they would be smaller in population than the large rural electorates of Australia. I do not believe that there is anyone, whether he is in an inner area of a great city or in a remote country town, who would believe that it is a viable or a just proposition to have the extra-metropolitan seats not only smaller in size, as they obviously ate, but smaller in population and smaller in their numbers of voters than the great and large rural electorates of Australia. This is the effect of the proposals of the Government. This is the result that they would achieve. That, I believe, would be a quite unjust result. It would be unjust and it would be inequitable. It reveals the blatant sell-out of rural Australia by the present Government. It reveals the falsity of the claims to support the principle of one man, one vote, one value in all its purity. That concept is something which the publicity machine of the Government has been trying to spread for the last several weeks. Under the proposals as many as 10 seats could be moved from great and large areas of the country, from provincial towns, to the smaller electorates of the extra-metropolitan areas which I have mentioned. This would not be of advantage to a nation which is the most centralised in the world. Surely we want a parliament which has a real concern for decentralisation, not just in one area in Albury-Wodonga but over the whole of this nation, and we want a parliament which will have a balance within it and which will do something to achieve decentralisation. The kind of electoral changes which the Government wants to introduce certainly would not achieve that. I think that the best point to return to is the quote from the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition when he said: By derivation civilised men are those who live in cities. Pagans are those who live in the country. That was a report of what was said by the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Whitlam, in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of 21st August 1965. If that is what he believes, the Electoral Bill which his Government has introduced certainly shows the kind of regard that ne has for rural interests. We need only to look at other matters which the Government has done or has not done in its short few months of office to see where it has either recanted utterly on promises made to the rural community or forgotten about them completely. The Treasurer (Mr Crean) is on record as having said that the Government would follow the revaluation compensation principles of the previous Government. He said that before Christmas. It is now quite plain that his Government has no intention of following that principle. Two great rural spokesmen for the Labor Party promised $500m at 3 per cent interest for loans for the rural community. Not a word has been said about that. Not a word about that appeared in the Governor General's Speech and not a word about it has come from the Government since that time. The research funds for rural organisations and the promotion funds for the International Wool Secretariat are very much under threat. Commitments entered into by previous governments are likely to be put aside. The wheat industry is in real difficulty with the negotiations of a new stabilisation proposal because of the attitude of the present Government. Rural reconstruction funds were cut by half. An attempt to increase the rate of interest on those funds was thwarted only because of the opposition of various State Ministers. This is the record up to the present time of the Government's attitude to the rural community of Australia. This Electoral Bill would reduce the rural voice within this Parliament and would make it possible for the great metropolitan cities to utterly swamp other sections of the Australian community. The result would be unjust and inequitable and against the best interests of proper and balanced development in Australia. The Liberal Party has said that it is opposed to these measures for a variety of reasons and it will be opposing them in this House and in the Senate, the first time round and the second. ] would be delighted to see the fight on this measure on any occasion and the empty threats of the Minister for Services and Property about a double dissolution on a measure of this kind will carry no particular weight with the rural community. It will carry no weight with the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) and the Minister for Immigration (Mr Grassby) or at least with the people who elected them on the last occasion but will think better of it on the next, because they know that they have now elected to this Parliament a Government that is concerned only with votes in large cities and is not concerned with the remoter country towns, provincial cities cr the people who live in the rural communities - no t just the farmers but the totality of people who live outside the great metropolitan areas. I believe it is a tragedy for Australia that we have such a Government and I hope that it is short-lived.",73
44,Mr WALLIS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL," I rise to support the Bill before the House which was introduced by the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly). The Minister in the opening remarks of his second reading speech correctly stated: Free elections are basic to a democratic society. But free elections by themselves are not enough-the results must reflect the will of the majority both in individual constituencies and throughout the nation. (Quorum formed) The quote continues: If the electoral laws do not result in the Government desired by the majority-if they are manipulated to reflect the political interest of persons or parties-it would be a denial of the very essence of democracy . . . To give effect to these thoughts the Government has introduced this Bill in line with its more forward thinking attitude on electoral matters. We have already introduced legislation to give full voting rights to 18-year-olds. The Minister stated in his second reading speech that there would be a comprehensive review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. He stated also that the question of providing additional representation to both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory would be the subject of legislation that he intended to introduce into this House at a later date. The plans of the new Labor Government are in line with the Party's attitude in the past in that it has been from this quarter that electoral reform has always come. We have led the fight against the established interests in our society to obtain some form of electoral justice. This has been the case not only in this country but also in every country that aims to live under a system people like to call democratic. Man for centuries has desired to take a hand in the manner in which he has been governed. We as a Parliament have always taken many of our customs from the Parliament at Westminster and, whilst that institution is referred to as the mother of Parliaments, the stage that it has reached today did not come about without a continuing Hght for fair representation and some form of electoral justice. We can refer to the struggle that took place in the United States of America to set up that country's constitution when lack of representation resulted in the American Revolution and the subsequent setting up of that country's own form of Government. We can look to the present troubles in Ireland, much of which has been caused by lack of representation and repression of the common people of that country in years gone by. France is another example where the fight for democracy has taken place. Whilst our own situation has been to a certain extent free from the violence of many other countries in their aspirations to seek fair and democratic representation for their people, our own past shows that the political struggles to establish our own form of democracy have been a continuing political confrontation with the Establishment and the forces of privilege, and unfortunately this political fight for fair and democratic representation has not been finally won. The present Bill, besides bringing about a redistribution of seats following the 1971 census- a move which the previous Government dodged-is a further step towards the Labor Party goal of one vote one value. Whilst we realise that there are problems in carrying out this goal in its entirety we believe that this legislation is a big step along the way. The Bill endeavours to alter the existing tolerance of 20 per cent in the numbers of electors in an electorate to a tolerance of 10 per cent. It also alters other factors. Any examination of the numbers of people eligible to vote in the various electorates as they stood at the election on 2nd December clearly indicates the great variations that exist. These figures certainly show a great difference in representation in this House. Perhaps we can look at some of these variations. In New South Wales, which at the time of the last election had an electoral quota of just over 57,000, the number of electors varied between 47,000 in the seat of Calare, 68,000 in Chifley, 44,000 in Darling and 71,000 in Mitchell. The difference between the largest and smallest electorate in this State was 27,000 voters. In Victoria, which had an electoral quota of nearly 57,000 electors, the electorate of Diamond Valley was made up of 72,000 voters and Mallee was made up of 45,000 voters. The difference between the largest and smallest electorate in that State was 27,000 voters. Tn Queensland, which had an electoral quota of 57,000 electors we find that Bowman contained 68,000 electors and Maranoa 43,000. The difference between the smallest and largest electorate in that State was 24,520 voters. In my own State of South Australia, where the electoral quota also was 57,000, the electorate of Bonython was made up of 67,000 voters and the electorate of Wakefield contained 45,000. The difference in that State between the largest and smallest electorates was 21,800 electors. Western Australia varied from 64,000 voters in Canning to 50,000 in Forrest, a difference of approximately 14,000 voters. If we look at Tasmania, where of course the position is different because the population is lower, we find a difference of only 3,684 between the largest and smallest electorates. These figures indicate the differences in the size of electorates in the various States. This Bill will be a progressive step towards the goal of one vote one value. Whilst we realise that some tolerance is essential, this legislation certainly will help to break down the wide disparity that exists now between the various electorates in our Federal system and bring about a system that gives equal voting rights to every elector, irrespective of what he is, what he does or where he lives. As a member for one of the larger electorates, I can fully appreciate the difficulties of distance in these large electorates and the amount of travel involved in endeavouring to give some service to the people, but I feel that this situation does not justify the large disparity in numbers that exists at present. It should not be used to reduce the value of electors' votes in other areas. The best way in which we can overcome this problem is not to reduce the numbers in those electorates to a ridiculous level, making the possibility of a gerrymander of seats very easy, but by the provision of greater facilities to members who represent the larger electorates to enable them to give their electors the service they should be able to expect. I understand that the Minister, fully realising the problems of these electorates, is having investigations made as to how these members can be assisted. I am sure that he will come up with some worthwhile ideas in an endeavour to overcome these problems. I note that in the Press last week the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) is reported as having said, in the course of comments he made on this Bill and the proposal to reduce the tolerance from the present 20 per cent to 10 per cent, that few overseas countries had as good a record as Australia in keeping electoral districts politically equal. Surely the Leader of the Opposition could not have been referring to the electoral system that exists in most of our States. With the exception of Queensland, every State has an upper House and in every one there is some grave anomaly in the matter of representation. I am of the opinion that under our present system of government grave doubts exist as to the efficiency or usefulness of upper Houses in the State electoral setup. In most cases they are leftovers from the political power of the landed squattocracy and the wealthy of the last century. In every case they can frustrate the democratic wishes of the people as reflected in the franchise that exists in the State lower Houses, despite the fact that there are inequalities in these themselves. If we look at the upper Houses that exist in the 5 States other than Queensland we find that in New South Wales the upper House may delay Appropriation Bills for only one month but not reject them; otherwise its powers are unlimited. In Victoria it may not initiate money Bills and can reject, not amend, any financial legislation. In South Australia it may not initiate financial legislation, but here again its powers are practically unlimited except only in that regard. In Western Australia the upper House may not initiate financial legislation. In Tasmania it may not amend annual supply Bills but can reject or delay them indefinitely. So in every one of the States we find that the power of the upper House is far beyond what it should be in a democratic society. In the upper House in South Australia, that is the Legislative Council, we have a clear example of the undemocratic procedure of upper Houses. It is elected on a restricted franchise, with the State divided into 5 electoral districts. These districts each elect 4 members, 2 being elected every 3 years. The franchise, as I mentioned before, is restricted, and as a result denies a considerable percentage of the people of South Australia their right to vote in Legisblance lative Council elections. A further hurdle to democratic government is the fact that the number of electors in the 5 districts varies from 106,000 in one district, that is Central District No. 1, which is an Adelaide seat, to 50,000 Mr MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I wonder whether you could ask the honourable gentleman to read his speech slightly more slowly. He is talking about South Australia. I am interested in his views.",76
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"Order ! There is no substance in the point of order. The honourable member may deliver his speech as he sees fit. Mr MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to draw your attention to the state of the House. There are members on this side who are interested in the honourable gentleman's speech. There are about only 6 members from the Government side in the chamber. Mr Daly- I rise on a point of order. Is it in order for a member who has come into the House for only the first time today to call a quorum?",78
46,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,Order ! There is no substance in the point of order.,78
47,Mr WALLIS,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"(Quoru m formed). I thank the honourable member for Boothby. I hope that the people in South Australia now realise the number of electors in the Legislative Council districts in that State. I was mentioning that in Central District No. 1 there are 106,000 voters and that in the Northern District, which is the smallest, there are only 50,000 voters. Prior to the recent election on 10th March the Liberals were able to control 16 of the 20 seats in that House, despite the fact that the Australian Labor Party in South Australia consistently polls well in excess of 50 per cent of the overall vote of the people. As the honourable member for Boothby will well know, it was clearly indicated on 10th March what the people of South Australia thought. I think that the last election showed the Liberal Country League in South Australia that the people of South Australia are not prepared to tolerate such undemocratic political power any longer. The LCL in fact at the last election, despite the unjust electoral set-up, lost 2 of its seats in the Legislative Council and certainly received a big fright in another Legislative Council district. Efforts to give this upper House some semof democracy in the past have always been rebuffed by the use of the undemocratic power that it has consistently used against the political interests of the people of South tralia. However, the results of the last election are a clear warning to the Legislative Council in that State that refusal to pass legislation from the House of Assembly on matters in which the State Government has a clear mandate from the people will result in the Legislative Council having to answer to the South Australian people for their actions. So much for the South Australian upper House. In every other State upper House we find conditions that have some parallel with the South Australian Legislative Council situation, and until these Houses are reformed to reflect the political wishes of the majority of the people we cannot say that we are a true democracy. I would like to refer also to the electoral setup in the South Australian lower House, the House of Assembly. Until a few years ago we had the dubious honour of having the most gerrymandered electoral system in Australia under the former Premier, Sir Thomas Playford. We had electorates varying from 4,000 to 40,000 electors. 1 might add that the numerically smaller electorates were held by LCL members and that the numerically larger electorates had elected Labor members. The. former LCL Premier, Mr Steele Hall, apparently had some twinges of conscience about the unfair setup in South Australia and some twinges of conscience over the gerrymander, and as a result had a redistribution carried out in 1969 that did in some measure take some of the worse features out of the gerrymander; but he clung to the weighting of the electorates in areas where the LCL was in favour. Incidentally, Mr Steele Hall has since had the chop for his more progressive ideas. City seats after the redistribution had over 14,000 voters while rural seats had approximately 9,000. It is interesting to note that at the election on 10th March the size of some electorates had remained at 9,000 while some had grown to 23,000 or 24,000. Here again most of the small seats numerically are held by the LCL and the larger seats are held by the Labor Party. But whilst we still have our anomalies in South Australia, I think we have lost our crown as the most gerrymandered State to Queensland, where we see the reins of government in the hands of a Party which is receiving only 20 per cent of the overall votes of the Queensland people. Perhaps this is the good record that the Leader of the Opposition mentioned when he referred to the good record Aus- Australia has in dividing our electorates equally for political reasons. We on this side of the House firmly believe that one man's vote is as good as anothers, and we will continue to press for reforms in the electoral system of our society so that we can say that our society is democratic in every sense ot the word. This Bill is a further step along that road, and 1 therefore fully support the measures contained in the Bill.",78
48,Mr NIXON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"We are debating a Bill tonight that was introduced by the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) on Tuesday, 13th March, and, without question, Parliament reached a new low in its proceedings with the speech by the Minister. Second reading speeches traditionally and correctly are expected to be technical documents of impeccable accuracy that can be used by all as the basis of judgment on the matter under debate but the Minister for Services and Property used the occasion for the presentation of a blatant, political speech not matched in this Parliament. Knowing the complete impartiality and integrity of the electoral officers, 1 hope the Minister will have the decency to clear them from any involvement in the political aspects of his speech. He took the occasion to smear the Australian Country Party with statements that were both misleading and untrue. The Standing Orders do not permit me to brand him a liar but were that not so, the Minister would stand condemned by this Parliament as a liar extraordinary.",79
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,Order ! I suggest that the honourable member moderate his language.,79
50,Mr NIXON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"I am fully aware that I am unable to brand the Minister as a liar. I have made that particularly clear. Such statements as ' . . . the Country Party at both State and Federal levels has consistently exercised ruthless control of the machinery of Parliamentary elections, both Federal and State', were contained in the Minister's speech. As far as I can ascertain, I have been the only member of my Party to be in charge of a redistribution in this Parliament and I had that responsibility because members of both parties in the coalition recognised that the matter would be treated with complete propriety. In regard to the States, only in Queensland in recent years has a Country Party Minister held the responsibility for redisof tribution. This has never occurred in Australia, Western Australia or Tasmania; it occurred more than 30 years ago in Victoria the and, as far as 1 can ascertain, it has never quota occurred in New South Wales. That is only one example; research shows that at least another half dozen misleading statements were contained in the Minister's second reading speech. That he should so abuse his privilege as a Minister is a reflection on him, so much so as to call into question the propriety of his holding such a position. That a second reading speech should contain false and misleading statements will also lead to reflections against the traditions of Parliament as a whole. The purpose of this Bill is three-fold. Firstly, it is to enable redistribution to take place in Western Australia, following a census of population demonstrating the need for an extra seat in Western Australia as determined under section 10 of the Representation Act. The nub of the matter is that the census figures do not demonstrate that any change is required in other States and so it is to section 25 (2.)(b) of the Electoral Act that the Minister looks to obtain justification to introduce his electoral gerrymander and it is by a reduction of the 20 per cent differential that has applied since Federation to 10 per cent in the number of electors in each seat above or below the quota of each State that the Minister looks for the right to implement his gerrymander. Let the people of Australia recognise this stunt for what it is-n o more than a justification for the Minister to hold a redistribution as soon as possible. Let me quote the figures to honourable members. Under the Act that has been with us since Federation and as proposed by our founding fathers, only 3 seats out of 45 in New South Wales have more than a 20 per cent variation from the quota. There are 3 seats out of 34 seats in Victoria with such variation; 3 out of 18 in Queensland; 1 out of 12 in South Australia; none out of 9 seats in Western Australia, and none out of 5 seats in Tasmania. By reducing the variation as is now proposed from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, the number of seats that would vary from the requirement would be 18 out of 45 seats in New South Wales, 13 out of 34 in Victoria, 8 out of 18 in Queensland, 4 out of 12 seats in South Australia, 4 12608/73-Jt-[40 ] out of 9 in Western Australia and none out 5 in Tasmania. Section 25 (2.) (b) states South that a redistribution shall be made: . . . whenever in one-fourth of the Divisions of Stale the number of the electors differs from a ascertained in the manner provided in this Part lo a greater extent than one-fifth more or one-fifth less; So, by reducing the variation in numbers of electors from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, the criteria applying in section 25 (2.) (b) gives the Minister for Services and Property the opportunity for which he says he has been waiting 23 years, and that really is to gerrymander the electorates in favour of the Australian Labor Party. That really is what this proposition is all about. To achieve that end, the Minister claimed that his entire approach was predicated on the wish to achieve one vote, one value, although he admitted 'that a degree of variation must be allowed, that exact equality in the number for division cannot be achieved, nor is it desirable'. Sensible admission though that is, it is an extraordinary one from this Minister, having regard to the vilification poured out by him and others who have expressed the same view. The only difference is that to obtain the gerrymander the Minister so dearly wants, he suggests that 10 per cent is better than 20 per cent. The 20 per cent variation is a basic factor in the Electoral Act which was no doubt well thought out by our founding fathers and it has stood the test of time. The Minister made great play of the fact that, in the last redistribution, the Commissioners had made variations in certain electorates, such as Kennedy of 17.95 per cent below the quota, Kalgoorlie of 18.56 per cent below the quota, Darling Downs of 18 per cent below the quota and Grayndler 14.01 per cent above the quota. He made extravagant claims that these variations occurred as a result of amendments to the Act passed by this Parliament in 1965. As far back as 1948 Parliament accepted variations such as 16.4 per cent below the quota for Kalgoorlie, 15.3 per cent below for Bonython and 13.1 per cent above for Curtin. My own electorate of Gippsland was 14.3 per cent below the quota in the 1948 redistribution. And what Government controlled that redistribution? None other than the great Australian Labor Partythe great one vote, one value Party. What sheer hypocrisy this is. What utter bunkum for the Minister to use figures of that kind and state in such a misleading way in what is supposed to be an accurate, technical document, that the Commissioners were forced to produce figures like the ones he quoted because of changes to the Act in 1965. Such misleading statements do the Minister little credit. The Minister's only interest in one vote, one value is the belief that there is electoral advantage for the Labor Party in such a proposition. The sheer hypocrisy of the Labor Party can best be pointed out by the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) during the course of the last redistribution. The Prime Minister made a submission to the Commissioners that an extra 4,000 voters should be taken from the seat of Prospect and added to the seat of Reid. The acceptance of this proposal would have been to move further away from the principle of one vote, one value. The proposal of the Prime Minister would have increased the electorate of Prospect from 3.68 per cent to 11.0 per cent below the quota and the electorate of Reid to 16.82 per cent above the quota. Mr Keogh-There was a good reason for it.",79
51,Mr NIXON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"Yes , there was a good remove reason. It emerged that the Prime Minister's son wanted to stand for pre-selection for Prospect and the 4,000 voters included in area proposed to be shifted to Reid contained the most left wing members of the ALP who were opposed to having the Prime Minister's son as a candidate. Was that a good reason? consider it a very base reason indeed. But shows the real attitude of the Labor Party the principle of one vote, one value-that is, that it should be advanced only when polititheir cally expediency demands it. There is one other aspect of the one vote one value condrive cept about which more needs to be said. constituents Right through the Minister's speech he kept making statements such as 'we should not accept regional discrimination', 'the principle of substantial equality of representation between electoral divisions was almost eliand minated' and 'every worthwhile authority ports the case for one vote one value and equality of electorates'. If that is the Minister's view, why does not do something about the fact that on December the quota for New South Wales was 57,386 and the quota for Tasmania was so. 43,902? If he believes that all people should be equal in making the law, why is he not first seeking an amendment to the Constitution to abolish this differential between the States? How does he explain the fact that in Tasmania 10 senators represent only 221,000 electors and in New South Wales 10 senators represent 2.6 million electors? Surely the fact that the Minister has not even mentioned such a difference demonstrates his real lack of sincerity on the question of one vote one value. Why not ask the people of Australia by way of referendum to overcome such sweeping differences? Has the Minister sought to have this matter raised at the constitutional review conference? The fact is that, just as our founding fathers provided for there to be variations in the numbers represented by senators from State to State and for variations in the quotas for members of the House of Representatives as between one State and another, so they provided for a variation from the quota within each State. I suggest that we should not consider departing from the latter provision until consideration has been given to the broader constitutional provisions. Let me deal with the third area of this Bill. That is the removal of the amendments put into the Act in 1965 for clarification-to the words 'disabilities arising out of remoteness or distance, the density or sparsity ot population and tht area of the division'. the No thinking member would challenge the fact that there are enormous difficulties facing members in large country electorates in being able to make themselves available to meet their I constituents. Electors in such electorates are it often faced with driving hundreds of miles or to making expensive trunk line calls when urgent matters arise which require consultation with Federal member. Similarly, the Federal member in such an electorate is required to thousands of miles a year to give his an opportunity to put their case. The electorate of Gippsland covers 14,524 square miles. It has 15 local government bodies, more than 200 schools, and 27 towns cities with no commercial air service consupnecting any of those towns. Compare that with the electorate of Grayndler which covers 8.4 square miles. It is not even the size of a decent property in some parts of Australia. he The honourable member for Grayndler could 2nd ride around the electorate on a pushbike before breakfast if he had the energy to do I understand that the only difficulty he has is when the lift drivers go on strike. He does not walk up the 12 flights of stairs to see some of his constituents; he makes them walk down the stairs. Equity surely demands person living in Gippsland should be able reach me as easily as a person living in Grayndler can reach the Minister. The Minister has stated previously that he recognises the great disadvantages and extra cost involved in country electorates and proposes to assist country members to overcome their disabilities. We all look that assistance. But I noticed the. other night, when a certain Bill came into this House, that he voted in favour of all allowances, whether for city or country members, being the same amount. I wonder just how much he is going to do to overcome the disabilities of country members. It remains a simple fact that order Canada- a country so often likened to Austo tralia-ha s a variation of 25 per cent above or below the quota. In the United Kingdom, gagging small though it may be-it would fit into the State of Victoria-at the time of the last redistribution, variations of up to 50 per cent from the quota were given for remoteness, all things. The Minister has not put forward satisfactory case to support his amendments reducing the variation from 20 per cent to per cent. All that would do would be create the unsettling situation of forcing redistribution every Parliament. Suspension of Standing Orders",81
52,Mr NIXON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"The Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) told me a gag the moment ago that he proposes to gag this debate. I believe that he ought not to gag this debate because, as 1 indicated to a number of Opposition members still want to speak on this very important matter. For that reason I propose to move that standing order 93 be suspended during the consideration of the Commonwealth Electoral Bill (No. 2) 1973. The Minister does not know what that standing order says, so I will read it to House. It says: After any question has been proposed from Chair, either in the House or in committee, may be made by any Member, rising in his place, and without notice, and whether any, other Member is addressing the Chair or not, 'That the question now put', and such motion shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. So I move: That standing order 93 be suspended during the consideration of the Commonwealth Electoral (No. 2) 1973.",82

56,Mr NIXON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,No . I am moving for the suspension of standing order 93 so that the Minister cannot gag this debate and so that the debate can proceed after the discussion on the motion for the suspension of the standing has taken place. The Minister indicated me across the table that he intended to gag this debate. I believe that what he is doing is Mr MCLeay-It is shocking.,82
57,Mr NIXON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"It is shocking. I can underof stand why my colleagues in the Opposition a are upset, because what the Minister is doing is gagging the Parliament on a fundamental 10 issue. We have heard for 2 days from Govto ernment supporters about why democracy a should be protected and encouraged. They put forward all sorts of statements that they believe support the concept of democracy. Let us have a look at that proposition. The simple fact is that here tonight the Minister shows what he thinks of democracy. He is going to people's representatives in this Parliament and prevent them from speaking on a fundamental issue-that is, how the electoral him, divisions will be sorted out and how the people will have the right to choose their representatives in this Parliament. It is sheer hypocrisy for the Minister for Services and Property to say that he is going to gag such a debate. If he tells me that he does not propose to gag the debate I will not go on with the my motion for the suspension of the standing order. But I suspect that his words to me the across the table were correct and that he is a motion going to gag the debate. The Minister talks about freedom of the be individual and the right of one vote one value. How is a member of Parliament in the Opposition in this place going to achieve one vote one value in this place? Only on the sheer brutality of numbers do the Minister's Bill figures count. My colleagues on this side of the House want to debate many aspects of the Minister's second reading speech. Let us look at the list of speakers. It is fascinating see the list of Opposition speakers who have not had a chance to speak and whose names are on the speakers list. They are Mr Fairbairn, Mr Adermann, Mr Garland, Mr Hallett, Mr Giles, Mr Lucock, Mr N. H. Bowen, Mr Sinclair, Mr Street, Mr Corbett, Mr Katter, Mr Calder, Mr Holten, Mr Fisher, Mr MCVeigh, Mr Lloyd and Mr England. I must say that it is a very good team. They should be given their chance to speak in their rightful place in this Parliament where they were sent to speak. They should not be gagged by the little dictator sitting across the way. Already we have seen the Prime Minister take the opportunity to use Press conferences to avoid making statements in the Parliament on Cabinet decisions. We have seen the Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) wanting an FBI-type political police force for himself, and now tonight we have the last straw from the last bastion of democracy that I thought we had in this place, the Minister for Services and Property, who when on this side of the House used to make great speeches about the rights of individual members of Parliament. But look at him now. He leaned across the table a while ago and told me he was going to gag the debate. Let him rise and deny that he is going to gag the debate. He will not deny it. One has only to look at the list of speakers to follow me to see that Mr Keogh was on the list. Mr Keogh- I rise to order. Is it in order IMalcolm for the honourable member for Gippsland to refer to honourable mcmbers on this side of the House by other than the name of their electorate?",82
58,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,Mr MACKellar) here - Order ! The honourable member will refer honourable members by their electorate.,83
59,Mr NIXON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,Fa r be it from me to depart from your ruling but I was quoting from list of speakers as provided by Mr Keogh- I rise to order.,83
60,Mr NIXON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"As provided by the honouroutside able member for Bowman. Mr Keogh-The honourable member for Gippsland was attempting to defy your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. I note now that he has acceded to your request.",83
61,Mr NIXON,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"The honourable member for to Bowman had his name on the list but obviously, being a good friend of the Minister for Services and Property, he was not intending to rise. The fact is that whilst there are 17 or 18 Opposition members ready to rise and tell the Minister that he was wrong in what he said when introducing the Bill, to point out all the misleading statements he made in his speech and what is wrong with the Bill he has introduced, there are no more Labor members on the list who are prepared to get up and defend him. Or are they in the know? Do they know that the Minister intends to gag this debate, that he is going to gag democracy? One can well remember the great speech made in this House by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Turner) recently in relation to televising the proceedings of the Parliament, when he referred to democracy and Parliament, and his personal explanation today. I think it is true to say that the Minister is wanting to make this place a forum for Labor Party performance and to use Parliament as a rubber stamp. We on this side of the House cannot accept that. I think that Government members who have their names on the list should be given their rightful opportunity to speak and I do not think that the Minister who made all those misleading statements in such a blatant political speech should be permitted to get away with them for a moment. That is why I have moved for the suspension of standing order 93. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Fraser) is very keen to support me know because he, as I do, feels hurt that of all members in this Parliament this Minister should propose such action. I can recall the great speeches he has made in the past in support of the Parliament and democracy but tonight he is wanting to gag the people's to representatives in the Parliament. It is a thorough shame. He ought to be ashamed. The Minister is red faced; probably he is thoroughly ashamed of himself. This is the the third incident we have seen recently. The Attorney-General announced that he wanted to set up his own political FBI and we have the Prime Minister holding Press conferences and making major announcements to the Press rather than to the people's representatives in this chamber. This is the last strawthe Minister for Services and Property wants to gag democracy and gag the Parliament.",83
62,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,Is the motion seconded?,83
63,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL," I second the motion. The motion moved by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) is worthy of the support of this Parliament. On the information available to us it appears that the Government intends to gag 17 members on this side of the House who wish to speak on a matter of quite fundamental importance to the future of this Parliament and representative democracy in Australia. This Government was in pari elected on a plank of open government which means allowing people within the Parliament to say what they feel they need to say, and making known to the people of Australia the various decisions of the Governmeni and the background to those decisions. Instead we have seen a Government that is already using the gag and restricting the rights of private members in this Parliament more vehemently and viciously than any Government since 1945, certainly any government since the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) has been in the Parliament. Also we find the Government, far from adhering to its principle of open government, becoming secretive. It is by-passing the organs of this Parliament and is reducing the rights and prerogatives of members of this Parliament. It is doing this now because it is ashamed of what the Bill contains, ashamed to have exposed in debate for another 2 days the provisions of the measure which the Minister has introduced and which he knows is designed to perpetuate Labor rule and to establish a circumstance in which many metropolitan or extra-metropolitan seats would be smaller in terms of the number of voters than some of the large and vast electorates of Australia. That is an utterly unjust proposal and it ought to be debated and exposed to the full. But 17 honourable members on this side of the House are being gagged deliberately. Under the catch cry 'one vote one value* the Government is trying to conceal what could become for the first time in the Commonwealth's history a gerrymander of electoral boundaries. This has not been the case in past redistributions whether undertaken by a Labor or a Liberal-Country Party government. This Bill is all the more important because, bluff though it may be, the Leader of the House has said that it is a measure that could lead to a double dissolution. That makes it all the more important for it to be debated fully and openly. Mr Daly- I rise to order. We are debating standing order 93 which states: After any question has been proposed from the Chair, either in the House or in committee, a motion may be made by any Member, rising in his place, and without notice, and whether any other Member is addressing the Chair or not, 'that the question be now put', and such motion shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. I submit that those moving and seconding the motion should speak to it and not discuss in broad detail a matter which is at present under discussion in this Parliament.",84
64,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,That is the rule of the House and should be abided by. The honourable member must speak to the reason for the suspension and not debate the question.,84
65,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"Mr Speaker, thank you for your ruling. I am relating the reason for the suspension of the standing order to the importance of the measure and the necessity to allow free debate. One of the reasons for the importance of the measure is that although it could lead to a double dissolution 17 honourable members are to be gagged. What is the Government frightened of in this debate? It says it wants open government. We have had a certain lack of enthusiasm on the part of Government supporters in supporting the Bill. Has the Government run out of speakers or has it no more supporters for this measure and does not want Opposition speaker after Opposition speaker to rise and speak on it? Or is it just another of those tactics we saw earlier today when the Prime Minister virtually accused senior public servants of conspiracy? They, of course, are not able to reply under Public Service rules. For the Prime Minister it is open season on all whether they have the right to reply or not, and for members of this Parliament it is the gag denying them the right to speak on matters which are of fundamental importance to Australian democracy.",84
66,Mr DALY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"There is no doubt that the Opposition is extremely edgy. Whether it is because of this legislation or the prospect of facing the electors again I leave to the populace to judge. Tonight a motion has been moved to suspend Standing Orders in respect of something that members opposite do not know will happen. I told the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) that something might happen, but how does he know that I am not pulling his teg? Honourable members opposite will look silly if his claim is not correct. Here we have the great defenders of democracy opposite demanding that. Standing Orders be suspended to enable them to debate this great issue that is before the Parliament. Do honourable members know why they have moved this motion? Honourable members opposite want their long list of speakers to be heard in order to stop me from speaking and tearing their attack to ribbons. The world knows this is so. When this debate commenced a list of 16 speakers was supplied by the Opposition. The Government nominated 16 speakers also. Members opposite knew that when those speakers had been heard I would reply to the Opposition's spurious arguments. But today they duced further speakers-member s who could not speak in an iron lung-to defend their attitude. Many of the defenders opposite are from the Country Party. They are clinging to their ill gotten gains and trailing behind them like poodle dogs yapping at their heels are members of the Liberal Party. They know that if they do not hang together they will hang separately. That is why they have moved this motion to enable them to discuss this great measure. However, in debating this motion for the suspension of Standing Orders on such a high sounding principle, as they call it, they have wasted the time which would have been allotted to a couple of speakers. I told members opposite this morning that in due course the second reading debate would finish and the Government would allow every member of the Opposition who so desired to speak during the Committee stage of the Bill. This would have enabled those who now cry to high heaven for justice in this place the right to express their point of view, certainly with a limited time of 10 minutes, but when all is said and done not everyone can speak for 20 minutes on every second reading debate. Was that not a fair offer to make to honourable members opposite?",84
67,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,-No .,85
68,Mr DALY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,Was it not? I tell the people of Australia that this morning I offered every member opposite the right to speak on this Bill but they rejected it. I do not say that members of the Liberal Party would have rejected it but they were told to do so by the Country Party. We know that when the Country Party speaks all those brilliant men opposite,85
69,Mr GILES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not want to stop the fun and games or the tirade of the Minister but I think I should take a point of order for the sake of accuracy. At the tail end of last week a complete list of speakers from the Liberal Party and the Country Party was given to the Government Whip. It is not my fault if there is no co-operation on the Government side, but that is the truth.",85
70,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,There is no point of order. The Chair is not made aware of any arrangements between the Whips.,85
71,Mr DALY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"I point out to honourable members that when this debate concludes, even if it is gagged now, about 7 hours will intro- have been allowed for the second reading debate and 20 members will have spoken. As every supporter of the Government knows, those in Opposition have been guilty of tedious repetition. Honourable member* know as well as I do that the Government gave the Leader of the Country Party (Mr Anthony) an extension of time, and he is only the third most important man opposite. In addition the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) was given 45 minutes in which to speak, which was stretching it a bit. The Covernment was prepared to give extra time to any third member opposite who wanted to speak, but no-one accepted the offer. Yet these are the members who say they want time to talk on this measure. This is nothing but a lot of humbug, as honourable members opposite know. The honourable member for Gippsland spoke about the gag. Members from this side of the House knocked up coming in and out to vote on gag motions when the Opposition was in Government. Members opposite forget that for 23 years when we sat in Opposition we were constantly gagged because the then Government did not have a case. In the 4 weeks of this Parliament on only 2 or 3 occasions has the curtailment of a debate occurred and this was simply because members opposite were frustrating the duly elected Government of Australia, which has an overwhelming mandate to legislate in the interests of the people. Everyone knows that this motion is a phoney proposition. Members opposite are desperate. No doubt they have read the Brisbane municipal results, so why would they not be upset? Why would not the members of the Country Party be worried about what is happening from Brisbane to the Gulf of Carpentaria?",85
72,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,Order ! The Minister is becoming very provocative.,86
73,Mr DALY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"Mr Speaker, you realise that 1I have been unduly provoked by this episode. 1 contend, however, that this motion is a phoney proposition - We listened to the honourable member for Gippsland this evening. He did not say anything new but repeated the same old Country Party philosophy that he has put forward in days gone by. This Government believes in open government. It believes also in freedom of discussion. I repeat that I offered all honourable members opposite the right to speak on this Bill but they would not accept that offer.",86
74,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. If the Government believes in freedom of discussion will those public servants against whom a charge of conspiracy was made this morning be allowed to speak to it?",86
75,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,Order ! That is not a point of order.,86
76,Mr DALY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"l s is interesting to note how touchy the Opposition is on this question. Had the time of the House not been taken up with this particular debate we would have been listening to a first class speech from a supporter of the Government on this Bill. By moving this motion honourable members opposite have denied to one of their shadow Ministers the right to speak on the measure. I did not deny him that right. This has been caused by the moving of this motion. The formcT Minister for Shipping and Transport, the honourable member for Gippsland, ran out of matter when he was debating this Bill and with 5 minutes of his time remaining moved this motion to fill in his time. The world knows this, and that is why I mention it now for the benefit of honourable members. Let me give a clear exposition of what will happen with this Bill. The second reading debate is not yet finished, and I will not indicate what my intentions are in that regard, but tomorrow honourable members will be debating this Bill for a reasonably considerable time. Members will be given the opportunity to participate in the debate during the Committee stage of the Bill. Unless there is undue frustration they may debate the Bill. The fact of the matteT, however, is that members of the Liberal Party are prepared to drag along at the heels of the Country Party and frustrate the will of the Parliament by trying to stop legislation. The Government must, in the interests of the people this Bill seeks to serve, take effective action in the Parliament to see that its legislation is passed. The former Minister for Education and Science, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said: 'Let us have a dissolution'. There were not many cheers when he said that because even if he has not done so, many others opposite have read the election results. In the other place where the Opposition has the numbers the attitude to this Bill can be decided. Let members of that place decide what they will do. In the other place there is unlimited speaking time. The interesting feature of this debate is that every member of the Country Party is in the chamber at this stage. This is unusual but they know that they are desperate men and anything they can do to try to discredit this legislation is worth attempting. Do members of the Country Party say that they do not believe in one vote one value? The honourable member for Wannon says that he does.",86
77,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Is the Minister not moving a little wide of the debate about the suspension of Standing Orders?",86
78,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,1 think the honourable member is right. The Minister will come back to his reasons why the motion to suspend Standing Orders should be rejected.,86
79,Mr DALY,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL BILL,"I thought I had summed the situation up clearly. I can understand the touchiness of members opposite. If members opposite wanted to debate this measure they would not have interrupted it with a frivolous motion of this kind. It is clear that they do not want to debate the Bill. If they had wanted to do so they would have permitted one of their shadow ministers to proceed with the debate and not fallen for the claim of the former Minister for Shipping and Transport who said that he has read my mind and knows that the debate will be stopped. Members opposite are very touchy if they get upset about a debate being stopped on one occasion because they know that on hundreds of occasions members from this side, when in Opposition, were not allowed to debate not only the most important matters but also the most flimsy matters. The worse offender in seeing that the gag was moved was the former Minister for Supply. So tonight I am not upset by the phoney opposition to the proposition that we are putting up. Why do not honourable members opposite allow the debate to take its course and in that way see what God will bring to them? Then they will know our intentions.",86

(5) If not, with which of the findings does it disagree and what are its grounds for disagreement in each case. $ Mr CLYDE CAMERON - The answer to the 138,784 . . 399,917 honourable member's question is as follows: . . 500,000 (1) The New South Wales State Industrial Commission's mainfindingswere that: (a) it rejected the employers' submission that there $ could be no ground for a reduction in work.. 3,981 ing hours unless it was common throughout 65,000 the electricity supply industry; (b) it would be proper to support a shorter working week if special circumstances applied to a particular industry; (c) there have been enormous changes in the electricity supply industry, resulting in increased efficiency, since 19S2. (d) almost half of all employees in the industry belong to the Salaried Division; <e) the electricity generation sector of the industry is the most capital intensive of all industries; (f) during the year 1971 alone the Electricity Commission extracted from charges no less than $48m towards capital expenditure; (g) 8,354 persons employed in the electricity supply industry already work less than 40 hours a week, and that 5,971 of these work a 35-hour week and 2,296 work a 36i-hour week. (h) there are 2 subsidy schemes in operation which are designed to assist country Electricity Councils to pursue a policy of rural electricification which are financed from charges made to city consumers; (i) most of the Electricity Commission's employees work only a small amount of overtime and the average weekly overtime paid to employees of Electricity Councils is substantially lower than the average overtime paid in all other industries in Australia; (j) the 35-hours a week employees of the Electricity Commission work a nett 35 liours; (k) the effective daily working hours of field crews are as low as 5 or 6; (1) the differentiation between the ordinary hours of 40 bours per week for the predominantly manual workers and the ordinary hours of 35 hours a week for the predominantly professional administrative and clerical group is alleled in the United Kingdom where the National Board for Prices and Incomes described it as 'the result of an historical accident'; (m) the awards covering employees in the industry provide the same hours as the awards covering employees in more labour intensive industries; (n) 'It is an indubitable and uncontested fact' that the industry has demonstrated a capacity to improve its productivity and efficiency in terms of the number of units produced and distributed compared with the number of persons employed; (o) advances in and the utilisation of the latest technology are the most important contributing factors to the increased productivity and efficiency in the industry and that the growth of the economy and the consequential increase in sales of electricity are yet another factor in increased productivity; (p) employees' willingness to transfer from the older power stations to other establishments does not assist their case for a shorter working week; (q) the fact that a particular industry has a special economic capacity is an irrelevant factor in according its employees a shorter working week; (r) the benefits of increased productivity itself from utilisation of advanced technology belong to the community to be shared by all for the general good; (s) productivity gains belong to the community as a whole and not to a particular group of employees (or, presumably, employers); (t) it could not assert any sound logical justification for the widespread differentiation which exists between the hours of manual and nonmanual workers; (u) the shorter week should apply to all employees in all industries or not at aU; (v) no firm conclusion was reached on the costs and prices of a shorter working week; (w) other employers would lose tradesmen to the electricity industry if a 35-hour week were introduced into that industry; (x) a 35-hour week would provide work for additional employees in the electricity industry in New South Wales, and that it is unlikely that the number would be obtained; (y) there would be a loss of productivity by other industries which lost the benefits of the work done by those transferred to the electricity industry; (z) increased prices for electricity could cause the present consumers to change to diesel fuel, fuel oil, liquified gas, etc. and it could also adversely affect the subsidy scheme for countiy areas; (aa) because of the foregoing conclusions there were no grounds for a shorter working week in the electricity supply industry but that if there were any prospect of redundancy in the industry, it would have paid serious attention to it. The Commission made its report on the basis of whether special circumstances distinguished the work par- performed by the Wages Division rather than on the special circumstances of the industry itself. The Commission'sfindingsappear to merely reflect the status quo rather than provide a design fur progress. The findings were partly influenced by the working hours operating in foreign countries and by the standards set by the International Labour Organisation which are designed to uplift working conditions for the emerging countries of Africa, Asia and South America and for territories like Papua and New Guinea and the colonial possessions of Portugal. (2) (a) Pursuant to the provision of section 35 (1) (o) of the New South Wales Industrial Arbitration Act, the Commission was asked to consider and report upon the following matters: 'The terms and conditions of employment of persons employed in the electricity supply indusiry, that is, the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in New South Wales; and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, whether there are any grounds for a reduction in the ordinary working hours or ordinary working days of persons now working a 40-hour week in the said industry; and, if there were a reduction in such working hours or working days, on the economic effects which would result from such reduction'. (b) Over 100. (c) (i) 3rd August 1971. (ii) 25th September 1972. (3) Yes. (4) and (5) It would not be proper for me to comment on the findings of a State industrial tribunal. Registered Unemployed and Vacancies (Question No. 125) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Labour, upon notice: (1) Can he say whether there are any labour shortages. (2) If so, what is the extent of the labour shortage in (a) each State and (b) each region of each State in respect of (i) skilled, (ii) unskilled and (iii) semiAustralia skilled persons. (3) What action (a) has he taken and (b) does he intend to take to rectify each incidence of labour shortage.",92
87,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The honourable member, having preceded me in the Ministry, should be aware that my Department's published Monthly Reviews of the Employment Situation provide detailed information on the numbers of registered unemployed and vacancies in each State and in each non-metropolitan district office. This information is also provided in respect of broad occupational categories for each State. The published data throw considerable light on the extent of labour shortages or surpluses in particular States and areas. I accept, however, that additional analysis of CES information is required for detailed manpower and regional policies- 2 areas which were neglected by the previous Government. As the honourable member knows, my Department has set up an advisory committee to examine, inter alia, the statistical requirements for a comprehensive manpower policy so that Government action could be taken where necessary to offset a situation of labour shortage or surplus in particular areas and occupations. Australia-United Kingdom Trade (Question No. 1.57) Mr Garland asked the Minister for Overseas Trade, upon notice: (1) Have estimates been made of the drop in trade between the United Kingdom and Australia as a result of the United Kingdom Government placing import levies on a range of Australian products. (2) What is the total value of import levies placed on Australian products by the United Kingdom Government to date. (3) What are the matching levies that have been placed by the Australian Government on United Kingdom imports to offset the unilateral action of the United Kingdom Government. D r 3. F . Cairns-The following is provided in answer to the honourable question: (1) The import levy arrangements operated by the British Government in recent years on eggs and egg products, cereals, beef and veal, poultry meat and milk products, other than butter or cheese, were terminated on 31st January 1973. These arrangements provided for the imposition of levies on imports into Britain under certain conditions. In the case of Australia, levies, insofar as I am aware, were applied only to some cereals. Fluctuations in British imports of cereal products could be caused by a variety of factors and it is not possible to isolate the effect of the levies. As from lst February 1973 Britain adopted the European Economic Community's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which provides for the application of variable general levies to most agricultural commodities in certain circumstances. No estimate has been made of the drop in trade between Britain and which might occur as a result of the imposition of these levies which will be a consequence of the application of the CAP. Table 1 shows the value of principal Australian exports to Britain in 1971-72 liable to variable import levies. (2) Information on the total value of import levies placed on Australian products under the British levy arrangements has not been published by British authorities in respect of imports either before or after the adoption of the CAP. (3) It is my understanding that the previous Australian Government held consultations with the British Government concerning the implications of the preCAP levy schemes for Australian trade from the time that they were initially proposed and that no compensating action was taken. In respect of Britain's adoption of the EEC's CAP, the EEC has recognised that problems could arise for exports to Britain of agricultural commodities from third countries, including Australia, in Protocol No. 16 to the Treaty of Accession, the 'Safeguards Clause', which provides for steps to deal with such problems. Australia has used the 'Safeguards Clause' as a basis for a series of detailed discussions with Britain and other EEC Members. In these discussions Australia has been seeking to identify the nature of the problems which might arise for particular commodities and to suggest possible solutions. The next round of discussions is programmed to take place in about May this year.

Ministerial Salaries and Allowances Mr Garland asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) What salaries and allowances have been paid to him and each of his Ministers since they were sworn in. (2) Is it a fact that all Ministers receive the same salary and allowances. (3) If senior Ministers receive the same as junior Ministers, what legal authority or device was used to effect this. (4) Will gift duty be payable by any Minister. (5) How is their liability under the income tax law to be resolved. Mr W h it l a m - I refer the honourable member to the Second Reading Speech on the Remuneration and Allowances Bill (Hansard, 2Sth March 1973, pages 809-812). Australian Industry Development Corporation: Mr Garland asked the Minister for Secondary Industry, upon notice: What are the details of the sum that has been loaned to or invested by the Australian Industry Development Corporation to 31st December 1972. Dr. J. F . Cairns-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The most recent figures available on the financial activities of the AIDC are contained in the latest Annual Report of the Corporation and relate to the financial year Ist July 1971 to 30th June 1972. This report showed that at 30th June 1972 SI6.8m was on loan to AIDC.

Investment by AIDC at 30th June 1972 stood at approximately $55m. Of this, $44m represented the value at cost of general investments, comprising principally investment of capital funds, while investments in industry projects were valued at $llm . Education: Handicapped Children (Question No. 162) Mr Garland asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) What arrangements has he made for special schools for handicapped children to receive assistance under Commonwealth education programs. (2) What sum has been made available and spent in each year for special schools for handicapped chil1973 dren in (a) each State and (b) the Commonwealth.",94
88,Mr HAYDEN,THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under the Handicapped Children (Assistance) Financial Activities Act voluntary organisations and other non-profit (Question No. 16(1) bodies may receive grants of $2 for $1 towards the capital cost of training centres and residential accommodation units. Subsidy is also available towards the cost of training equipment. Other forms of assistance are provided through the Department of Education, details of which could be obtained from the Minister for Education. (2) The grants that have been approved under the Act, and the expenditure incurred, each year in (a) each State and (b) the Commonwealth is shown in the attached table. Further, under the existing provisions of the Nalional Health Act a handicapped children's benefit of $1.50 a day is payable to eligible non-profit organisations conducting approved handicapped persons homes in respect of each handicapped child under 16 years who is accommodated and cared for in the home.

(2) If so, what are the details, including the basis on which the assistance is available in each case.",95
89,Mr HAYDEN,EACH STATE AND THE COMMONWEALTH SINCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under the Handicapped Children (Assistance) Act grants of $2 for $1 are available to eligible nonprofit organisations towards the capital cost of premises for use as training centres for handicapped children or to accommodate such children who are receiving training. Grants are also available towards the cost of training equipment. Each claim for assistance is examined having regard to the need of the handicapped children concerned. Tbere bas been no general examination, for the purpose of this Act, into the provision of special schools. (2) See above. The overall assessment of the need for special educational facilities is more a matter for the Department of Education and relevant information could no doubt be obtained from the Minister of Education. Further, under the existing provisions of the National Health Act, a handicapped children's benefit of SI..50 a day is payable to eligible non-profit organisations conducting approved handicapped persons homes in respect of each handicapped child under 16 years who is accommodated and cared for in the home. Australian Trade with Far East (Question No. 224) Mr Graham asked the Minister for Overseas Trade, upon notice: (1) What figures are available to demonstrate a comparison of Australian Trade with the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China in Taiwan. (2) What comparative figures are available with respect to Indonesia, Malaysia. Singapore and India. Dr. J. F . Cairns-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) In 1971-72 total Australian imports from, and tolal Australian exports to the countries specified were: China 41,318 Taiwan 35,147 Indonesia 14,312 Malaysia 31,030 Singapore .. . . 38,437 India 35,215 Detailed statistics of Australia's trade with overseas countries are published by the Commonwealth Statistician in his bulletin 'Overseas Trade'.

(2) Did he also state in reply to part (2) of my question No. 227 (Hansard, 13th March 1973, page 535) that a communication was signed by Dr Wilenski or Dr WUenski's secretary. (3) If so, is there an inconsistency in his 2 replies. (4) Will he give an assurance that he will sign all substantive replies sent by him to members and senators. (5) Will he, as Leader of his Government, ensure that his Ministers do the same as part of the proper conduct of Parliamentary affairs.",96
