You can imagine how that particular to his death-by that incident. In all that great expanse of nothingness which that could fall practically on this man's back dealing with in this bill-the unforeseen ramifications of the wonderful technology that the way we do.

In the early 1960s, middle of nowhere, out in the middle of the him there was a serious air incident being great difficulty. This fellow was sitting down He turned around and went out his backdoor and a crashed airliner. It was a horrific accident that man is haunted-and he will be, I think, is the outback, to think that an airliner like doorstep is incredible. That is what we are circumstances, the completely unexpected enables us to fly and to travel about the planet an 'if. The fact. that there may be another air because aircraft are made by human beings by dint of a whole bunch of various mechanical impact on those things from time to memorandum and in the Bills Digest that has about the El Al crash in Amsterdam, in which the people on the aircraft itself. It also NA 6062 talks about other incidents in which damagehas other examples-the Lockerbie crash, where the did fall on houses and people were killed as to a lot of people to be very far away. I would I have a range of excerpts; I have been going that the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation would like to talk about first off-and I will an incident that happened at Maddington in Western an aircraft that was out fighting fires, dropping The pilot levelled the wings, fully opened the He flew the aircraft close to the stall at approximately pilot decided to attempt to land the aircraft on a small The aircraft severed a set of powerlines at the northern broke a power pole.

However, investigations, I have sought to see the way in of grey areas-and I have discussed with the I believe we should bring out into the open be matters for the courts to decide. The second example is that of a crash Tocumwal in New South Wales on 5 January 1997. It was a crash between one dual-seat glider were no established procedures for gliders procedures-but one of the gliders arrived at speed the other one. That was the finding (I) This section applies if a person or property on, of life, material loss, damage or destruction caused by:an aircraft falling.

But I think those incidents may seem like to read a little excerpt that I have here. through the reports of accidents _and incidents complete as a result of air accidents.

As I said, I have been show where the bill can be very effective. The on behalf of the minister when laying out the Rome Convention, the fact that at the there are different ways in which compensation an air accident, and the fact that some nations if their aircraft were to crash in Australia and signatories to the Rome Convention. in going through these examples of crash which they apply to the bill.

The inquiry found that there in the circuit area-in other words, no radio into the circuit area and basically collected of the report. In this bill we say: in or under land or water suffers personal injury, loss degree and it is intended that this bill will assist falls on them. It will assist them by way of injured but also for all of their property. The glider incident is: what compensation is there were killed in that glider as well, but what by the other glider? Why is there a discrepancy and property that is in the air? NA Thursday, 3 June 1999 I know that we are dealing with a bill replacing people on the ground, and it is appropriate also extend our thoughts to what happens in act, I think it is called, or something of that claim. But I think property is property, no matter of an incident, then I believe there should be flies or property that is firmly lashed to the very important example. The next incident I would like to talk about me in relation to this legislation. This involved of Mackay in Queensland on 17 July 1997. It to the vessel MV Karoo, which was anchored hatch of the MV Karoo and, while its blades pilot had put the brake on the helicopter and was gusting quite a bit and the helicopter slid halfway out of the door, and fell onto the lower in the bill is the definition of when an aircraft helicopter was going backwards, it was (2) For the purposes of this Act, a power-driven aircraft from the moment when power is applied for the purpose run ends. That gets very grey when you are talking about brake on but still has its rotor spinning and had got out and the pilot had done whatever again straight away. The question is: does it provides, was it deemed to be taxiing or parked-or going to be an issue for courts to decide in the future. There is also the fact, too-and I have raised aircraft do not necessarily involve the aircraft accidents involving an aircraft landing and this bill-that is, the unrestricted compensation need to prove fault-if an aircraft were coming and the pilot of a taxiing aircraft were to something happening, arid the two were to collide, cause for compensation for third parties who crashed into the terminal, or whatever else landing but was clearly not the one that was at the operators and owners of that landing aircraft, to seek through the courts the compensation the aircraft that was at fault. There are some elements to that that I am if the landing aircraft were to be subject to this aircraft may be well and truly bankrupt and from the operator that was at fault, that is the they would be entitled to. That is something that with the departmental officers, and I do MAIN COMMITTEE 6063 a previous act that only ever dealt with that we should look at that. But I think we must the air. There is an act-the commercial liability nature-under which passengers in that plane can where it is. If it gets damaged as a result no discrepancy as to whether it is property that ground. I think that incident provides us with a illustrates another issue that is of concern to an accident that occurred 11 kilometres east was a helicopter carrying, I think, a pilot out offshore. The helicopter landed on the cargo were still spinning, the passengers got out. The set about getting out of it. At that time, the wind backwards off the hatch, with the pilot still deck of the carrier. One of the issues covered is in flight. You could say that, when the flying. But in the legislation it says: that is heavier than air is taken to be in flight of take-off until the moment when its landing a helicopter that has touched down, has the people are getting out. In fact, after the people he was intending to do he would have taken off apply? Was the aircraft in flight or, as the bill what? That is something that I think is this already-that often accidents involving while flying. There have been rather big another aircraft taxiing. Under the provisions of and the fact that it can be applied without the into land and was in no distress whatsoever taxi out onto the runway, through a mistake or it occurs to me that, under this bill, the may be injured by damage when those aircraft might happen, would flow to the aircraft that was fault. It would be up to the people responsible, who would then find· themselves responsible, they would be subject to from the operators of a bit concerned about because, in the process, legislation, I think that the operators of that gone long before they had the opportunity to get taxiing aircraft, the compensation or the relief that crossed my mind. Naturally, I have raised hope that the minister will be able to respond to NA 6064 that when he is summing up, because these are public in the future will have to deal with. Those are a number of issues, but I wanted range of things that can go wrong with aircraft these are all incidents that have happened a crash in the Northern Territory-poor flight to complete its journey; a crash in New South the pilot, and he hit a tree when he was crop-dusting; in New South Wales-loss of control at night down; an incident near Narrabri aerodrome passenger aircraft, one apparently a De Havilland and I think those aircraft came within 300 metres and an incident in the Northern Territory-the separated in flight and catapulted the aircraft all illustrate how fragile we are when we fly, of aircraft and how important the provision I spoke previously about the crashes at Lockerbie sort of thing does not happen, or there is not I have two examples here-one from 2 May both involved Boeing 747s at Australian occurred when the aircraft was taxiing for departure out of regularly.

(2) Has the maximum penalty of $10,000 which may be imposed on an employer who is convicted of having knowingly employed unlawful noncitizens been reviewed; if so, (a) when was the last occasion it was reviewed and (b) is there a formula to review the penalty. (3) Since his appointment as Minister, has his Department recommended the prosecution of employers for knowingly employing illegal labour; if so, did the Director of Public Prosecutions refuse Town State Post Code a disability, people with a non-English speaking background KATHERINE NT 0852 KATHERINE NT 0852 ALICE SPRINGS NT 0871 ALICE SPRINGS NT 0871 ALICE SPRINGS NT 0871 ALICE SPRINGS NT 0871 ALICE SPRINGS NT 0870 CASUARINA NT 5792 DARWIN NT 0810 CASUARINA NT 5792 DRIVER NT 5787 BERRIMAH NT 0828 BERRIMAH NT 0828 NIGHTCLIFF NT 0810 SANDERSON NT 0812 DARWIN NT 0812 STUART PARK NT 0820 HUMPTYDOO NT 0836 Illegal Workers to act on the recommendations; if so, on what grounds. (4) Is it a fact that since 1988 only one employer has been convicted of being knowingly concerned in visitors working without permission but locations of illegal workers and overstayers increased to 12 679 in 1997-98; if so, (a) does this indicate a weakness in the Employer Awareness Campaign and (b) are his Department and associated enforcement bodies failing to rigorously pursue the possible prosecution of employers for disregarding the law. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The regular participants of the Inter Agency Cash Economy Working Group are the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA), Centrelink, and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Other government agencies, such as the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, attend as required. (b) In March 1997, the ATO, Centrelink, and DIMA formed an Inter Agency Cash Economy Working Group to examine opportunities for joint activities. The activities of the Inter Agency Cash Economy Working Group include: investigating the possibility of undertaking joint prosecutions for taxation and social security offences; outposting Centrelink officers to ATO sites; improving cooperation and information exchange; identifying potential joint activities. (c) Since its establishment in March 1997, the Inter Agency Cash Economy Working Group has met twelve times. (d) The Inter Agency Cash Economy Working Group is an informal working group. It is not a body tasked with recommending to Ministers. Agencies may take ideas and information from the working group and incorporate these into their portfolio responsibilities. The Inter Agency Cash Economy Working Group has played an active and critical role in fostering joint activities, extending co-operation and improving the exchange of information between the three agencies. It continues to develop new approaches and monitors the progress of those, which have been put in place. (2) (a) The amount of the maximum penalty of $10,000, which may be imposed on an employer who is convicted of having knowingly employed unlawful non-citizens, has not been reviewed since it became part of migration legislation in September 1994. (b) There is no formula to review that penalty. (3) Since my appointment as Minister, there have been no briefs to the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of employers who knowingly employ illegal workers. Prosecution of employers who knowingly employ people with no work rights is possible under section 5 of the Crimes Act. Prosecutions, however, have rarely occurred because of: - reluctant supporting witnesses - insufficient evidence to prove ""knowingly"" or ""intent"" by employers - the chain of evidence required to meet prosecution standards. (4) I refer the honourable member to my answer of 31 March 1999 on the number of employers who have been convicted of being knowingly concemed with visitors working without permission. (a) The Department has been conducting the Employer Awareness Campaign (EAC) since 1992. The EAC encourages employers to check the work rights of prospective employees and provides them with information on how to do so. The EAC has been a valuable tool used by my Department to help those many responsible employers in Australia who remain committed to ensuring that they employ only Australians and workers with right to work. (b) I have previously indicated my Department's efforts at identifying and acting where people are working without authority. I am concerned, however, that under current law there is no obligation on employers to check the work rights of employees and that it is difficult to establish sufficiently well, for prosecution purposes, that employers may knowingly have recruited people without work rights. The Review of Illegal Workers I have commissioned will consider, among other things, the adequacy of provisions available to discourage employers from recruiting people without the right to work. The review will also e-arnine the adequacy of information available to employers. Equal Vocational Employment Network (Question No. 602) Mr Tanner asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 11 May 1999:Has the Commonwealth provided funding to Equal Vocational Employment Network (EVEN) Inc. and its associated organisation, Zenith Employment and Training; if so, (a) what sum did it provide in (i) 1996-97, (ii) 1997-98 and (iii) 199899, (b) on what programs, activities or products did EVEN and Zenith spend the funds and (c) was portion of the funds used to finance a proposed contract with the Eden Fishermen's Recreation Club under which EVEN/Zenith would assume responsibility for managing the club; if so, (i) what sums and (ii) on what items. Mr Truss-The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) (i) $452,156; (ii) $497,600; (iii) $526,999. (b) In accordance with their service agreement, Equal Vocational Employment Network (EVEN) Inc. and its associated organisation Zenith Employment and Training, provided outcomes for people with a disability through employment preparation, job search, employment placement and post placement support. The Agency also provided specialist services to people with a disability from a Non English Speaking Background, and to school leavers. (c) (i) and (ii) Nil. Voyager Disaster: Legal Action (Question No. 612) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 May 1999: (1) How many former crew members of HMAS Melbourne have initiated legal·proceedings against the Commonwealth in connection with the HMAS Voyager disaster. (2) How many of claims (a) have been resolved in favour of the applicant, (b) have been resolved in favour of the Commonwealth and (c) are still unresolved. (3) What total sum in damages has been awarded against the Commonwealth. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 113 as 11t 24 May 1999. (2) (a) and (b) 1 case was resolved in favour of the plaintiff by the court, the other 17 resolved to date have been settled by agreement out of court. (c) 95 remain unresolved. (3) One; MCLean at $696,450.00 plus costs. The remaining cases were settled out of court, arid accordingly are not awards of ""damages"". Settlements have totalled $4,231,450.00.",176
