Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of a message from His Excellency the Governor General recommending an appropriation for the purposes of this Bill. BUDGET.",12
1,Mr EISHER,Unknown,"Certain articles have* appeared in the metropolitan newspapers,, dealing, with the Budget, the financial position of the Commonwealth, and theviews of the Treasurer on the figures before him and the prospects of the country. I wish to know from the right honourable gentleman whether those articles were based on information given to the press with his knowledge or consent, and. whether he knows anything at all about them. Or are they merely statements; made in anticipation of the delivery of the Budget?",12
2,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,It is not very likely that I would communicate to the press information about the Budget which I wish to deliver first-hand myself to honourable members. I-have not given any of these matters to the newspapers.,12
3,Mr FISHER,Unknown,And the statements which have been published are not correct?,12
4,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I have hardly looked at them, and. cannot say whether they are or are not correct. I have certainly not communicated any information on the subject to the. press. SMALL-POX OUTBREAK: QUARANTINE STATION, SYDNEY.",12
5,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister aware .that it has been stated in the Sydney newspapers that the question of removing the unjust embargo which has been placed upon Sydney and the district within 15 miles of the post-office in connection with the small-pox outbreak has been .referred to him ? Is he aware, also, of the proposition by the Minister of Trade and Customs that the State Parliament should pass a Vaccination Bill , and that the Houses of that Parliament have not been asked by the people to do so ? Is he aware, further, that the Board of Health, the Chamber of Commerce, and the daily newspapers urge that it is uot necessary to continue the embargo; and does he know that all authorities admit that auy further cases arising could be dealt with effectually by isolation, as cases were dealt with during the jjlague outbreak in Sydney some years ago ?",12
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My honourable colleague has been in Sydney this u'eok-end in consultation with the Board of Health, but there is nothing fresh to report. It is not proposed to raise the quarantine. Until the State has taken steps on its own account which will effectively prevent the spread of small-pox to the other States, the quarantine cannot bo lifted.",13
7,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Is there any provision in the Constitution, or has Parliament provided, that a State Parliament shall be compelled to pass a law which the people do not desire?",13
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I shall have the Constitution searched to see.,13
9,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I u view of the reply of the Prime Minister to the honourable member for East Sydney, are we to understand that unless the State of New South . Wales or the State of Victoria, or both, pass certain legislation to satisfy the Federal Government, the present embargo on the metropolitan area of Sydney is to remain ?",13
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What I have said, and what I wish to repeat, is that the embargo will remain so long as this Government, on the authority of the Department responsible, is of opinion that there is danger of the disease spreading to the other States.",13
11,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"In view of the in formation which, I understand, was placed before him during his recent visit to Sydney, has the Minister of Trade and Customs come to any determination in regard to the removal of the quarantine station from Manly?",13
12,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"A deputation representing the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of Manly waited upon me yesterday and urged the removal of the Quarantine Station to some other area. I informed the [58] deputation, which mentioned one or two sites which it was thought might suit the purpose, that this matter had been under the consideration of the Department for some time, and that the late Director of Quarantine had reported that the various sites suggested were unsuitable for the purpose. In passing, I may mention that the removal of the Quarantine Station would in itself involve a very heavy expenditure. I informed the deputation', however, that if there could be suggested a site that would fulfil the necessary conditions, it would certainly be considered by the Department. Sydney is a very important commercial and shipping centre, a fact that cannot be overlooked in determining the location of a Quarantine Station, and I mentioned that, in considering the suitableness of any site, regard would have to be paid to the im portance of the shipping interests to be served. I reminded my interviewers that a matter that had given rise to great anxiety on the part of citizens of Sydney was that vessels had come right down from the north into the port of Sydney with quarantinable diseases on board, but that the cause for this anxiety was now being, removed, since three Quarantine Stations were being provided north of Sydney. One of these is being placed at Thursday Island, another at Townsville, and the third at Brisbane.",13
13,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,"Following up my question, to which the Minister has given a very vague reply, I should like to ask him whether, in the event of a suitable site being found, he is prepared to remove the Quarantine Station ?",13
14,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"If we find a site more suitable than the present one, and the officers of the Department so advise, I shall certainly be prepared to recommend the removal of the station. ELECTOR AL ADMINISTRATION . OBJECTIONS-STATISTICS-ROLLS .",13
15,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"On Friday last the Leader of the Opposition asked a question about an instruction which has been issued by the Electoral Department. I have here a copy of that instruction, and propose to read a portion of it for the information of honourable members.",13
16,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The question that I asked was based on a statement which has appeared in the press.,13
17,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That matter is being inquired into. That part of the instruction which is now relevant reads as follows: Where specific information is furnished in writing that electors have removed to another division or subdivision, or have died, or that several entries which differ in sequence of Christian names, in detail of spelling, & c , refer to one and the same person, you should cause independent inquiry to be made through the registrars - id police with a view to(a) Objections being lodged where it is ascertained that the electors concerned have left the divisions for which they are enrolled. and are not temporarily absent therefrom; (i) Prosecutions being failure to comply with the compulsory provisions of the Act is disclosed; (c) The names of deceased persons being removed from the rolls, if this has not previously been done in ordinary course. That instruction has been issued by the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth to the Commonwealth Electoral Ofiicers tor the States.",14
18,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I asked the Honorary Minister during the adjournment debate on Friday whether a communication had been sent from the principal Registrar to a certain body, asking it to take steps to lodge objections to names on the roll.",14
19,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I do not wish honourable members to think that the reading of the instruction was intended as au answer to that question. which the right honourable member referred is now under consideration.,14
20,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The instruction speaks of Registrars.,14
21,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I read the instruction because it has been very much canvassed in this House recently, and I understood that honourable members would like to know the actual wording of it .",14
22,Mr FISHEK,Unknown,Will the Honorary M i nister lay a copy of it on the table ?,14
23,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes. So far as the other matter is concerned, I have placed the newspaper report which the right honourable member quoted from in the hands of the Chief Electoral Officer, who is looking into it now.",14
24,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"A statement appeared in the Melbourne Herald of last evening as to the inability or neglect of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs to supply certain information from the Electoral Department. The Assistant Minister has given one side of the case, that of Mr Knibbs, and I ask him whether he will take steps to see thab documents reporting the other side, that of the Chief Electoral Officer, are laid on the 'table of the House, so that honourable members may be able to deal with the question.",14
25,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am glad that the honourable member has brought up this question, because in. view of the very caref u l l y worded and absolutely untrue statements that have appeared in the Herald, it is well that honourable members should know the facts. The reporter of the Herald waited on me on Friday afternoon in the Ministers' room, and asked me if initiated where I would give him permission to interview Mr Oldham, the Chief Electoral Officer, in regard to Mr Knibbs' statistical calculations as to the number of voters. I said, "" No . """,14
26,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,And the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs is the man who believes in the liberty of the press!,14
27,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Not the liberty of the press to run our Departments. The reporter of the Herald said that it was very unfair-that I was muzzling a great Department which I knew had an answer. I replied that I was not muzzling the Department, but wished to give the fullest information, and was ready to give it to 1 any honourable member who asked a question in the proper place, namely, Parliament. The reporter of the newspaper The matter to then said-and this is what I wish honourable members to bear in m in d - "" That is no good to me; I want copy."" It is because that gentleman desires exclusive copy at the expense of the Departments that he is adopting this particular method. This morning the Chief Electoral Officer informed me that, so far as he was personally concerned, he did not wish to see the reporter of this newspaper, and that he had in no way been suppressed or gagged by the present Administration. If the Leader of the Opposition or the honourable member for Yarra has any doubt, I shall be only too happy for them to see the Chief Electoral Officer. I may sayfchafcone reason why I felt it particularly necessary to be careful of this press reporter is that, some time ago, when a controversy was going on in another place, he wrote in the Herald as f o l lows",14
28,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Is this answering the question ?,14
29,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I think .the Honorary Minister is going beyond what is necessary to answer the question.,14
30,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Of course, if my honourable friends opposite do not wish to, know the reasons",15
31,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I have no objection.,15
32,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I should like to hear them.,15
33,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I can assure honourable members that the Chief Electoral Officer is under no sense of difficulty whatever. It is purely because this particular press reporter desires exclusive copy for his own newspaper that honourable members have heard anything about the matter.,15
34,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Will the Assistant M i ister of Home Affairs state whether it was because the Herald representative desired exclusive information that he declined to allow him to interview the Chief Electoral Officer, and also whether he will allow all the press representatives to in terview that officer upon the question under consideration?",15
35,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I regard the Parliament as the first body entitled to information in regard to departmental matters. Mr FISHEK, - Accordin g to the Honorary Minister, the Chief Electoral Officer is in no way embarrassed in making his statements and reports, and I ask the Prime Minister, as Minister of Home A f fairs, whether he has any objection to the whole of the reports being laid upon the table of the House without honourable members being called upon to elicit the information by questions?",15
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am quite unable to say off-hand what should be done with papers. There are some papers and reports between responsible officers and Ministers which are not for publication, while there are others that are - In regard to anything' which is proper to be published, there is not the slightest objection.",15
37,Mr FISFIER,Unknown,I mean documents dealing with this question.,15
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I mean papers dealing with this question. Papers must stand on their merits as to whether it is proper to publish them or not. honourable gentleman has any particular paper or report in his mind, and he will put a question on the notice-paper, the matter will be inquired into.",15
39,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Such papers ought to be laid upon the table at once.,15
40,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Will the Honorary Minister now lay on the table Mr Oldham's statement of the case regarding the [58]- z number of persons eligible for enrolment, and move that it be printed 1",15
41,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes , certainly. The Chief Electoral Offioer has today given me his statement in regard to this matter. This is not the first statement laid before honourable members, because I quoted the Chief Electoral Officer's views in my second-reading speech on tihe Electoral Bill . The statement of the Chief Electoral Officer is as follows : The figures prepared by Mr Knibbs were submitted in response to an inquiry by a member of the Senate, and merely gave a rough apn - proximation of the number of persons in Australia qualified for enrolment on or about the date of the issue of the writs for the recent elections. It is admittedly a very difficult matter to even approximately estimate the number of persons qualified for enrolment actually in Australia or in each State at any given time, or the number of persons enrolled but temporarily absent, or the number of persons not enrolled. The main point raised has been that the total enrolment for the purposes of the elections exceeded the total number of persons qualified for enrolment. The Chief Electoral Officer reported that, altogether apart from any question of irregularity, there must always be an excess of names on the electoral rolls at any given date for reasons which arise under the law, and the Minister referred to the matter in his second-reading speech on the Electoral Bill . It will be seen that, so far from suppressing what the Chief Electoral Officer has said, that gentleman himself recognises that expression has been given to his views.",15
42,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"In connection with the question put by the Leader of the Opposition to the Minister of Home Affairs regarding reports made by the Chief Electoral Officer on the administration of the Electoral Act , aud its working at the last election, I should like to ask the honourable gentleman whether he has any communicatiou or report from the Chief Electoral Officer covering all the proposed amendments of the law in the measure now before the House. Reference has been made to the Chief Electoral Officer in this regard, and I would ask the M in ister of Home Affairs, if he has not any If the reports or communications recommending or justifying any or all of these proposed amendments, will he invite the Chief Electoral Officer to report and express his official opinion in regard thereto, and lay such report on the table of the House.",15
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"This request .comes strangely from the honourable member, as it would, indeed, from any member of the OpjJosition who, in the last Parliament, were very indignant when asked whether the Chief Electoral Officerparty had reported favourably to the abolition of postal voting. There was then a great "" to-do "" about my question, and we were told by the Minister of the day, that "" h e "" was the Minister. I am afraid that I must follow so good a precedent, and give the same answer in this in - able stance.",15
44,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I desire to ask Assistant Minister of Home Affairs a question arising out of an answer given so. by the Attorney-General relating to objections lodged to the names of electors do that, sir. being placed upon the rolls. Erom his statement. I gathered that before objecsee tions could be filed, full inquiry woxild made, either by a police officer or otlier official. I understood that that protlia cedure was to be followed. But I have received several letters from residents i the Creswick district, which show that it is not being followed. Objections are being lodged to the names of people who have resided in that district for t h i for ty years, without any preliminary inquiry whatever. Will Minister of Home Affairs take action in regard to these objections, otherwise many of these persons may not take notice of them, and their names may thus be struck off the rolls?",16
45,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The instruction which has come from the Chief Electoral Officer is very clear on this poiut. I have read' it today. If that instruction has in way"" been improperly exceeded, the Chief Electoral Oflicer may be depended upon to see that it is not exceeded again. If foundation. the honourable member can point to any cases in which the safeguards imposed in that instruction have been disregarded, I suggest that he might very properly bring the in under the notice of the Department, and they will then be dealt with.",16
46,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I desire to ask another question of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, with regard to the in timation that has been sent out by the Attorney^General or his Department. The intimation to which I refer has evidently been received by the Liberal party before any other party knew anything about it . It is to the effect that if objections are lodged against names on the electoral roll, the immediate effect will be .that those names will not be placed I on any roll. I know that the Liberal in Ballarat have lodged information against hundreds of names-or , at any rate, scores of names. I want to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether he will see that every Deputy Registrar- I do not think that the Registrars would do anything dishonor",16
47,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The hon the orable member must not make a speech. He can ask a question if he desires to do,16
48,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I am proceeding to I wish to know if the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs will that the Deputy Electoral Registrars be get a notice that they are - not to act upon the information received and consider t of itself an objection, but are to make full inquiries and see that the pern sons in question have not left the division ?",16
49,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I only wish to reaffirm that the instruction of the Chief Elecr ty or toral Officer is very clear and very explicit, and requires that such independent investigation shall take place before any the Assistant name is struck off the roll.",16
50,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,They are not doing it .,16
51,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"W it h regard to the premise of the honourable member's question-that is to say, that the news of this matter had got first to the Liberal organizations, and the insinuation that if such news did so get to the Liberal organizations it was deliberately given' to any them by the Electoral Office, or those responsible for its administration- I wish to say that the insinuation is without any",16
52,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,We had to wring from you the announcement.,16
53,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I have given the honourable member the same reply about six times.,16
54,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"the Minister of Home A f fair s , upon notice I. What was the number of persons eligible for Commonwealth Electoral enrolment at the date of the last Commonwealth Census? 2. By what method did the Commonwealth Statistician arrive at the "" rough estimate of the number of persons eligible for Commonwealth enrolment at 30th April, 1913,"" namely, 2,585,000 persons? 3. Is the number stated by the Commonwealth Statistician as the number of electors on the rolls at last Federal polling day, namely, 2,760,216 persons, the same number as the total number of persons whose names were not ruled out or otherwise challenged officially on the certified official rolls used by the Commonwealth officers at the elections held on 31st May, 1913. 4. Will the Ministei state the number of electors whose names were not ruled out or otherwise challenged officially on the certified official rolls used by Commonwealth officers at the elections held on 31st May, 1913?",16
55,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The answers to the questions are1. The Commonwealth Statistician estimates the number as 2,397,060. 2. The Commonwealth Statistician's rough estimate of the number' of persons eligible for Commonwealth enrolment on the 30'th .April, '9'3, was 2,576,000, and on the 31st May, 1 9 3> 2,585,000. 1 tained(i) by estimating on the basis of the Census results and the subsequent records of migration and the registration of births and deaths, the total number of persons aged twenty-one and upwards on the respective dates; (ii) by deducting from the totals shown in (i) an allowance(a) for adult inmates of gaols; (6) for adult inmates of hospitals (c) for adults of i.j>n-European (d) for adults of European race who (e) for adults who at the respective In the case of allowance (.«) the net adult migration was taken into account. This, consequently, has the effect of making due allowance for any Australian citizens temporarily absent at the dates specified who have left Australia within the six months preceding those dates. 3. There were 2,760,216 persons enrolled on the 31st May, after the certified list had been adjusted under the law, as far as the time available would permit. 4. The instructions to presiding officers require that all electors applying to vote shafl be .challenged as to whether they have already voted.

I wish to know whether or nob the tenders have yet been accepted, and what system it is proposed to adopt?",17
64,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I accepted following some tenders the other day. They are being accepted by degrees, as we have the inoney to expend.",17
65,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Can the Minister mention whether the system adopted is the same one as was originally chosen? 0,17

72,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether he can tell us exactly the position in regard to the erection of a new General Post Office in Perth?,18
73,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"In reply to the honourable member, I may say that a site was chosen as the best in the interests of the Commonwealth, and designs were received for the buildings concerned. The lay-out, however, was somewhat severely criticised by various public bodies in Perth, with the result that the whole matter is now under urgent consideration.",18
74,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,Was it not which was criticised ?,18

77,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"The answer to the question isI t would be premature to lay upon the table of the House any list of reforms which I have in mind, as I have a Bill drafted dealing with anomalies and for the appointment of a Commission. I stated publicly, soon after I assumed office, that I was very much impressed with the efficiency of the officers I had met. Since then I have had the opportunity of meeting many more of them, and I am satisfied that the officials and staff of the Department are anxious to assist in doing all they can for the improvement of the Service.

I arrived from Sydney only half-an-hour ago; and if the honourable member will allow me, I shall endeavour to obtain the information this afternoon.

I received, just before I enthe site tered the House, the following letter from Mr KnibbsUnderstanding that some question has arisen as to whether on any occasion or occasions the work of the Statistician has been interfered with, may I mention that on no occasion since my taking office up to the present time has there been any such attempt, direct or indirect, either restricting the freedom of the Statistician as regards the analysis or publication of statistical matter or otherwise.

96,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RECIPROCA L TRAD E WITH,I will give the right honourable gentleman a dozen instances tomorrow. PRIVILEGE.,19
97,Mr HIGGS,RECIPROCA L TRAD E WITH,"I rise to a question of privilege. Last Tuesday I gave notice that, contingent on the Electoral Bill going into Committee, I would propose an addition to clause 1 as follows: (a) AB ill to enable Liberal and Tory scrutineers to ascertain bow the people vote, and(*) To as far as possible put a stop to the secrecy of the ballot. I cannot see that notice of motion upon the business-paper, nor is there any reference to it in Hansard. I did not expect that it would appear in Hansard, but I did expect that it would find a place upon the business-paper. It is quite the practice-as I am sure honourable members will realise if they read the business-paper for the last few days-to put upon it contingent notices of motion of that kind. Only the other day the Treasurer gave notice that, contingent on a certain Bill going into Committee, he would move in a certain direction. If there is to be any change in that procedure I would be glad to know it, so that I may adopt another method of bringing my views before the House and the country.",19
98,Mr SPEAKER,RECIPROCA L TRAD E WITH,"I would point out to the honourable member that no notice of an amendment to a clause of a Bill would appear upon the notice-paper. In regard to the character of the amendment, I may say that my attention was drawn to it by the officers of the House, and I did not regard it as being intended seriously, or as one that the House could seriously entertain.",19
99,Mr HIGGS,RECIPROCA L TRAD E WITH,I am very serious about it.,19
100,Mr SPEAKER,RECIPROCA L TRAD E WITH,"As in duty bound, the officers of the House call the attention of Mr Speaker to any notice of questions ..or amendments, or motions, which, in their judgment, should be brought under his notice. A f t e r having seen the notice referred to, it seemed to me that the honourable member did not seriously jiropose i't. And , in any case, it was one which no Speaker could, with propriety, accept seriously. I , therefore, directed that it should not be printed. It was couched in ironical terms. According to MayWhen a notice, publicly given, is obviously irregular or unbecoming, the Speaker has interposed, and the notice is not received in that for m ; and he has also directed that a notice of motion should not be printed, as being^ obviously designed merely to give annoyance. Satirical or ironical notices or questions are not in order, and are not received. My predecessors also laid it down that, following upon the recognised practice of Parliament, notices of motion, or of questions or amendments of that character cannot be received, and that Mr . Speaker is the.sole judge of whether such questions, motions, or amendments should be allowed. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS .",19

121,Mr SPEAKER,RECIPROCA L TRAD E WITH,The honourable member has raised a auestion which affords mean opportunity of laying down what I consider to be the proper procedure in regard to questions.

W it h regard to the nature of questions which may be asked, the practice is laid down by a number of authorities. I have had extracts taken from these authorities for ready reference by niyself, and it may, perhaps, be as well for me to read some of the quotations for the information of honourable members. On page 255 of Brand's Decisions the rule is laid down by Mr Speaker as followsThe hon- I think it right to state to the House that the question of which the honourable member has He is given notice refers to matters which passed out 1 side the walls of the House, and does not-relate to any Bill or motion before the House, and that, therefore, it is a question which, according to the rules of this House, cannot be put. A question that relates to matters which took place outside the House, and has nothing to do with any Bill or motion before the House is, properly speaking, out of order. Again, at page 126, Blackmore lays the practice down in these termsQuestions relative tp matters outside the _ House, aud not bearing upon any matter before * the House; questions ' seeking the opinion of the Government; questions adverting to matters beyond the cognizance of the House, and those which deal with subjects which would properly be matters for motions, are improper to be 1 asked.

157,Mr DANKEL,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Boothby) [4.3] Jusfc before the House rose on Friday last, I submitted several amendments which I had prepared to the consideration of Ministers and of the Ministerial party ^in general. I mentioned at the time that I looked upon them as a very fair compromise, and expressed the hope that honourable members on the other side of the House would deign to consider them fully. I also trust that they will be able to accept them, aud thereby make it possible for the Bill to pass, not only this House, but also another place. I believe that if they were accepted by the Ministerial party and by the Government, the measure would have a very fair chance of being passed by the Senate. mated on Friday last that I was i u favour of giving the postal vote uuder certain conditions, to any elector who, on polling day, during the hours of polling, would not, be within 10 miles of any polling place, or happened to be quarantined in the Commonwealth. Women in a certain condition cannot, of course, attend a polling-booth, and, as we have often been told by our friends on the other side, we should not withhold the franchise from the mothers of the nation- In order to meet, the. Government and the Ministerial party in that respect, my third proposition is that any female elector who will not, ou polling day, during the hours of voting,-on account of ill-health or infirmity, be able to attend at any polling place, may, after the issue of the writ, upon making a declaration in the prescribed form before a postmaster, vote as an absent voter. Of course, there would have to be a schedule in connection with this amendment, to provide that the declaration shall be made, and the vote recorded only at the post-office of which such postmaster is in charge: and, secondly, that the declaration shall not be valid unless the postmaster stamps it with the post office letter stamp of the date on whioh the declaration is made. This proposal would safeguard the secrecy of the ballot, and at the same time meet the case of the female electors. It would enable those living over a certain number of miles from any polling-booth to record their votes, and also meet the case of people who happened to be in quarantine on the day of election. I understand that the honourable member for Bourkehas expressedhimself as willing to vote with the Government for restoring the postal vote as it has operated in previous Commonwealth elections. If so, that honourable member cannot have had any practical experience.",24
158,Mr MCGRATH,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,He did not promise to vote for the Government proposition.,24
159,Mr DANKEL,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,He said he was in favour of restoring the postal vote. If he means that he is going to vote for restoring it as it us id to be in the Commonwealth elections,24
160,Mr BRENNAN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,He did not say that.,24
161,Mr DANKEL,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"If he does mean that, I do not think that he could have liad any practical experience of the postal voting system. I do not blame honor-, able members on either side of the House who have not had any j>ractical experiI in t i- ence. The Attorney-General, for instance, I look upon as an honourable gentleman in every sense of the word fro m both a political and private point of view; but, as he has evidently had no experience in this matter, he thinks that everybody else must be of necessity honest and above board. All my experience, however, absolutely prevents me from voting for the restoration of the postal vote as we have had it in Commonwealth elections. I can assure honourable members that it is quite possible to get hundreds of votes under that system, not illegally, but witliin the letter of the law, and without taking the slightest shadow of risk. If one were unscrupulous enough to do so, he could do the businesshimself without inducing, other electors to do so. If I were given a few weeks, I could get at least 400postal votes under the old system if I wanted to, but, of course, I would not do so. I shall oppose the Government proposition in that respect bitterly, and I sincerely hope that if it is passed in this House, it will be rejected in another place. However, I submit my amendments as a fair compromise to the consideration of honourable members on the other side. I have a very shrewd suspicion of what takes place when membersmeet together, and honourable membersopposite may have been told by the Government, to stick to the Bill , and nothing but the Bill . No doubt some honourable members in particular have been advised to. that effect by Ministers, when perhaps prompted by tlieir consciences toobject' to some of the provisions of this Bill , but I should like to . advise them not to stick to. the Bill - in its entirety. Surely, we can reason together, and' ar- ra-ngeacompromise-. If it is really the. desire of honourable members opposite to pass a Bill which - will meet the just demands of those who, at election time, are laid aside by sickness, or are beyond a certain number of miles from a polling booth, they can do so by accepting amendments which will enable the measure to pass through this Blouse, and, I think, through the other Chamber also. As to the number of miles that a voter must be distant from a polling booth on the day of the elections to be qualified to vote by post, I am willing, if the Government cannot accept 10, to agree to 5, because I wish to meet Ministers in every way; but I warn the House against restoring the postal voting system in its original form, because it opens the door to auy amount of swindling and underhand work. Tliere have been hundreds of cases in which the names of candidates have been written down by the canvassers.  ber say that of his own actual knowledge and experience?",24
162,Mr DANKEL,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Not by any means; I would not stoop to such a thing. But I am certain that it has been done. A postal voter hadto sign his name, and the signature was witnessed by a justice of the peace. It was immaterial to the Returning Officer, wlien the ballot-paper was being counted, who had written in the name of the candidate. If Ministers accept the amendments which I have foreshadowed, I shall support the second reading, and I hope that in Committee we shall be able to effect some alterations.  not my intention to support the second reading of the Bill . I have had twenty years' experience of electoral legislation, and I have no hesitation in saying that this is the most drastic, aud one of the worse Bills that I have ever seen put before Parliament. Personally , I think that there should be some pause after the heat of an election before the introduction of au amending electoral measure. All the spleen, bitterness, and animus provoked by the elections are to be seen in this Bill , which has been conceived in hatred, quickened i u malice, and has had its b i r t h - I refer to the speech of the Honorary Minister-in vile vituperation. Why did the honourable gentleman refer to the 143,000 persons who have been convicted of minor offences? What had their conviction to do with the Bill ? His object was to v i l i fy honourable members on this side. He says that he did not associate us directly with them, but he stated indirectly that if our seats were in clanger, they would come to our rescue. Let me tell him that he has afforded additional evidence of the fact that education alone does not make a gentleman. A residue of the 143,000 persons to whom he referred may permit themselves to be used in connection with elections, but they do not give their services for love. It is not long since, in this State, in the linnald v. Harper case, on the evidence of certain witnesses a verdict was obtained ; but within a fow months nine of these witnesses were serving sentences for perjury. Their evidence had not been procured by any member of the Labour party. If the services of such men are used i u connection witli elections, the Honorary Minister knows who are best able to use them. The measure should be entitled, "" AB ill for an Act (a) to l i m it the facilities for electors getting their names on the electoral r o l l ; (?') to provide facilities for the wholesale removal of the names of bond fide electors from the roll, aud (c) to enable inquisitorial and vindictive persons to ascertain how other electors record their votes. The Bill provides, first, for limiting the period during which names can be placed on the roll. Undoubtedly the object is to prevent thousands of persons from being enrolled.",25
163,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The r e must be a date fixed.  now. Probably more names are now enrolled during the month preceding an election than in the whole three years of the life of a Parliament; but honourable members opposite wish to prevent persons from being enrolled in that month. The Bill will deprive thousands of young men and young women coming of age just before au election of the opportunity to vote. Honourable members opposite have not the courage to say that they do not believe in adult franchise; but there are ways of destroying it , and they have adopted one of them, namely, the placing of all possible difficulties in the way of enrolment. The Bill provides, also, for the restoration of the postal vote, honourable members opposite displaying their chivahy by expressing great anxiety for giving the ladies the vote. But let me read What they say to the women of the country. The party with which they are associated has described our wives, our mothers, and our daughters as breeding cows. That statement is taken from a document issued by the Liberal Union. it could be proved that that is not so, would resign my position.",25

Union on the matter.  official publication containing the names of the Liberal candidates and their photoof South Australia. graphs, and setting out the ticket of the party. The issue was published i u March last. In it is a quotation called A Tear and a Day. The quotation is printed under the heading of course. "" A the is t Socialism,"" but the writer referred to a Socialistic club. The word "" Socialism "" was substituted for the words "" Atheist Socialistic Club,"" to give the passage an application to the Socialists of Australia, because, as applying to an atheistical Socialistic club, they had no relevance. The intention was deliberately blacken our characters, and characters of our wives, mothers, and daughters. They said that we had no further use for the women of this country than to make them breeding cows, and wished to father their children on the and State, instead of on the animals who bred them. That is the statement gentlemen who now parade on the houseSocialist tops their chivalry to Women, and wno with, say they want to give the women a vote.",26
165,Mr KENDELL,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The words referred to appeared in the book that the honourable, member has mentioned.  lished in the document from which I am quoting ? They were published to alienate the sympathy and support of the electors from what is known as the Socialist party. Those responsible for the publication went further, and told the electors that if met Socialists and listened to their talk, they would be amazed at the low value they placed upon women. I ask honourable members opposite if that is true ? There is no answer. Again, they said that they did not know any persons who disless honoured women more. Is that a true statement, Mr Speaker ? You have been associated with the members of this House fbr many years, and I venture to say that you would r o t willingly and knowingly party to a statement branding those with whom I am associated as dishonourers women. If this is to be a fight with the gloves off, honourable members will get what they wish for. We know where the women are dishonoured; and if they want If to know they will have it . They go on I to say that there are none who dishonour their mothers more. Could there be a worse indictment against a political party",26
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Who says these ,26
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Is the honourable member quoting from the same document, taken from a book or some other?  Honourable members opposite and their supporters display wonderful anxiety for ladies on their own side to have a vote; but I have shown how they speak of the ladies who support the Labour party.",26

In fact, in this very document there is a reference to free love and the Labour party.",26
169,Mr KENDELL,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Did not the Labour party of Australia send greetings to the Socialist party in the Old Land?  think they did ; but that is not m y busithey ness, and I take no exception to it . As a matter of fact, the Socialists of Australia opposed such views at the last election, as they have done on previous occasions; and yet, because, like some honourable members opposite, we are more or Socialistic, this document is issued with the sole purpose of damaging us in the eyes of the electors. As to the postal vote, whether the radius be 5 miles or 20 miles makes no difference; and if this be method be restored I can see very great danger of a large number of votes being of manipulated. At one time in our political history lords and squires and their ladies used to drive the electors to poll, and stand by while they recorded A their votes openly; and Will postal ting, clear of the supervision of the per officials, there is a possibility of introduction of all the bad, old elements attached. of a by-gone day. As to newspapers, I such have yet to learn where an honest pubtwentieth, century. lication has been placed at any disadvantage because of the provision that the mind in matters electoral. names of the writers shall be attached to the political articles for a certain period during election time. I not be afraid to attach my name to writin g in which I attacked another perbut son; and I do not see why the press should be allowed, not liberty, but the licence which they frequently exercise, and sometimes from personal spleen, to ruin man's political clninces.

It will be remembered that in the statement of the Government policy which accompanied the Governor General's Speech, we were told that the purification of the rolls was being proceeded with , and every endeavour being made to insure their accuracy. Erom this it will be gathered that what is being done was then contemplated. The Honorary Minister today absolutely evaded the question that he was asked. He may think it very well to slate an unfortunate pressman who is not present, or, in any case, cannot reply on the floor of the House. The honourable gentleman said that he referred to this matter i u his speech on the second reading of the Bill . It is alleged that there are over 170,000 more names on the roll than there are adults qualified to vote. When the Prime Minister and his colleagues are speaking at tea parties and other social gatherings, they invariably quote the Statistician's figures, and assert that at"" the last general election there were on the rolls the names of 175,000 persons in excess of the adult population of Australia. They mention this as if it were a fact.   torney-General was honest enough to admit that the process of transfer accounts for the apparent .duplication in a very large number of cases.  there were on the rolls 175,000 more names than there ought to have been.",27

A great many apparent duplications can be accounted for by the process followed in transferring the name of an elector from one roll to another. name cannot be removed from a roll, in the case of a person who has shifted from one electorate to another, until it has That been added to the roll for the electorate to which he has removed.

It was said that even the dead had voted. A remarkable feature of these charges is that they are made only in respect of electorates which returned members of the Labour party. The Attorney-General obtained from the Chief Electoral Officer a memorandum regarding this question of duplicate voting, and that report bears out my contention. Members of the Ministry have denied making these charges, but I have before me a statement made by an honourable senator, who is a member of the present Government, to the following effect: They have even resurrected Ihe dead to vote. The Ministry was trying to get to the bottom of it, but it was found that, while the parties who passed the Electoral Act, and were responsible for the conduct of the elections, had left as many doors open as possible for wrongdoingWhat does the Chief Electoral Officer say",28
174,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The ex-Minister of Home Affairs said that in his electorate men were dragged out of their graves.  they did at Indi ; but I should not be surprised if the honourable member found it necessary, at the next general election, to practically take people out of the grave to vote for him.",28

In liis memorandum, in answer to the inquiry of the Attorney-General, the Chief Electoral Officer reportedWhile the average number of apparent duplications is less than three per 1,000 voters, it will be noted that in one division (Ballaarat) the number reaches 175 in a poll of 32,818, and that in another division (Macquarie) the number falls to eleven in a poll of 23,322.

177,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The official report dealerrors ing, as it does, with thousands of votes in the various electorates shows that honourable member for Hume is wrong.  Electoral Officer says that in the case the Macquarie electorate the number apparent duplications "" falls to eleven a poll of 23,322."" That shows that the inquiry dealt with the whole of the votes. He went on to say in this reportIn divisions m which the elections were keenly contested, and the polling was exceptionally heavy, it might be expected that more names would be inadvertently marked in error than in other divisions; but much would, of course, depend upon the care with which individual officers performed their duties. While a margin of between two and three errors per 1,000 voters would not appear to be excessive, having regard to the number of There similar names appearing on the rolls, it could not, of course, be assumed that, where the average is either above or below, fraud either has or has not entered into the elections. I complain of the failure 'of the Government to obtain a report from the Chief Electoral Officer when Mr Knibbs made his unsolicited statement as to the apparent disparity between the number of names ou the rolls and the census returns. The Honorary Minister' attempted to reply to a statement by a newspaper reporter who had the audacity to saysomething in regard to these figures. Of course, it was very naughty of the newspaper man to do anything of the kind. When he was told that he was not to have the desired information, he ought not to have said another word about the Department. I venture to say that the statement made by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs today is not an answer to the charge made by the newspaper report in question, neither is it an answer to a statement made in this House. AVhat we ought to have from the Chief Electoral Officer is a report showing what proportion of the alleged excess of 175,000 names ought not to be on the rolls. I venture to say that such a report would be very different from the statement made by the Minister. The honorablo gentleman says that this question was answered by him when introducing the Bill . On that occasion he referred to the - alleged excess of 175,000, and went on to say that the Chief Electoral Officer it was reported on the matter as follows: Unless the law is amended as proposed it always be impracticable, on the eve of an election, to make the necessary adjustments consequent upon duplications resulting from the of electors and upon transfer and changes in the rolls to be used at the elections. the That is not the point we are discussing. We want to know from the Chief Electoral Officer to what extent it would be of possible to avoid this alleged duplication. of No Electoral Act could be so framed,as in to render it possible to have no duplications on the rolls on any particular day. The last general election took place on the 31st May, and since two months elapsed between the issue of instructions to transing fer a name from one set of rolls to other, and the finalizing of the matter, I from day to day. take it that on that date there would a greater apparent duplication, owing the rush to be enrolled, than on any during the preceding three years. It must not be forgotten that rolls are not printed every month, and that consequently thoutransfers sands of names on the ordinary printed rolls do not appear on the certified rolls in the Electoral Office. When an objecare tion is lodged,' inquiry has to be made, and if the objection holds good, the name in question is ruled off the Electoral Officer's certified copy. The ordinary rolls in use outside do not show that alteraI tion. In this case a clean roll was taken by the Government Statistician, and i showed that there were 2,760,216 names enrolled. That roll, however, made allowance for transfers in jjrocess of being carried out. It therefore covered, I am confident, many thousands of names which tee were being transferred from one roll to another. As against this number on the rolls, the Government Statistician quoted a total of 2,585,000, ou the basis of the census returns. I have worked out the figures, and they show that in the case of South Australia there were on the rolls, apparently, 7,026 in excess of the number that ought to have been enrolled. A great many of these names were in course of transfer.   transferred, and until the transfer been complete the two names appeared on two different rolls.  point.  sought to be made by the honourable memstronger the Labour j > t y will unbers opposite. Their assertion is that doubtedly become. there were 175,000 names on the roll i excess of the nuniber that should have any been enrolled. I challenge the M istry to prove that that is correct. Surely According to Mr Knibbs, the excess is 175,000, but his figures are based on false premises. There is no day in the whole year upon which the numbers wil l not gret vary.  cise the Statistician.  that officer will affirm that my statement is incorrect. If he does, he will exhibit a want of knowledge of the actual workof the Electoral Department, for the ansimple reason that the clean rolls vary The only place in be which clean rolls can be obtained is the to Chief Electoral Office. Honourable memday bers themselves do not know the names which appear upon tliose rolls until almost the day of election. The reason is that are continually coming in , and new names are constantly being inserted. On the other hand, the census returns based upon the number of persona resident in particular localities at a particular time. It is impossible to apply the same rule to ascertain the number of persons who should be on our electoral rolls. have very little more to add. I think it would be wise to refer this Bill to a Select t Committee, and consequently I give notice bhat, contingent upon its passing the no second-reading stage, I will move That the Bil l be referred to a Select Commitfor the purpose if inquiring into and reporting upon(a) the conduct of the Federal Elections of '913 ; (b) a better method of purifying our electoral rolls; (c) the prevention of plural voting or personation at elections; and (d) a more perfect system of conducting elections. Before adopting such drastic proposals as are embodied in this Bill , we ought to have a thorough inquiry upon the lines I have indicated. So far, not one scintilla of evidence has been forthcoming to justif y the sweeping alterations proposed. Why should we change our whole electoral syshad tem merely for party purposes? Rightly or wrongly, honourable members opposite feel that the existing law is more favourable to the Labour party than it is to them. Of course, the more adults there the ar On the other hand, n the party opposite will be benefited by process which wil l prevent adults from in - getting their names placed upon the rolls. it is the duty of the Assistant M in ister of Home Affairs to give us some evidence of illegal practices in connection with the recent general elections! I reto observe that it is proposed to hold the general elections on some day other critithan Saturday. We all know that Satur-' day afternoon is a half-holiday, practically throughout the whole of the States. Upon what day can greater facilities be afforded to the people to exercise the franchise 1 Of course, if we clo not wish them to vote, we shall hold the elections on some other day of the week. In South Australia, elections have been held on Saturday for about fifteen years, and no complaint has beeu made Surelv it is idle to urge that, by holding elections on Saturday, the counting of the votes has to be suspended over Sunday. Can any election be held in the Commonwealth the result of which has not to stand over for a few days ? The only reason assigned for holding elections on any day other than Saturday is that the ballot-boxes might be burnt on the Sunday.  that elections may be held on any other day than Saturday. To-day they can be held only on Saturday.  well that if this Bill be passed the Government will do away with Saturday elections. In South Australia the holding of elections on a Saturday, instead of on a Wednesday, resulted in an increased vote of 20 per cent. How can men possibly leave their work to exercise the franchise ou any day other than Saturday? I recollect the occasion of a by-election in South Australia on which the business people induced the Factory Act authorities to waive the Saturday half-holiday. This was done within two days of the polling, aud the result was that thousands of votes less were recorded than were recorded at the ordinary Saturday election. In my opinion, Saturday affords greater facilities to the working classes to exercise the franchise than are enjoyed by them upon any other day. Of course, the residents of Toorak who have tlieir motor-cars can vote on any day. there are some persons who have conscientious convictions, and who do not like to ride in motor-cars when they are not going to vote for the candidate in whose interest they are being run.  the ballot. Does the honourable member mean to tell me that, because an elector rides in a motor-car, he is going to vote for the candidate who is supported by the owner of that car?  a lady- a banker's wife-wh o inquired of her washer-woman, "" Y o u are going to vote today?"" "" No. I am afraid to go to the polling booth,"" was the washerwoman's reply. "" Oh, you need not be a f r a i d , "" said the lady, "" I will walk down with y o u . "" Just imagine that lady walking down the street with her washerwoman upon any other than polling day. I shall vote against the Bill , and prior to the Committee stage shall move the amendment of which I have given notice.

179,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Order ! The honourable member must not reflect upon other honourable members.,31
180,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Honourable members upon this side of the House have been charged with having entered into a conspiracy of silence. Amongst those who have been most vehement in expressing that view was the honourable member for Boothby. i He accused us of not beiug permitted to speak on this Bill . He declared that we had to sib quietly behind the Government and accept it without a word of criticism or comment. As a member of the party supporting the Government, I wish to assure him that there has been no such limitation placed upon us in regard fco the expression of our views on this measure. We are perfectly free to discuss it as we think proper. I , for one, would not permit myself to be used by any Government or any party in the way that has been suggested. I am absolutely at liberty to criticise this Bill as I think proper. GeneBut rally speaking, it has my support, but fchere are certain features of it which do not entirely meet with my approval, and upon which I shall have something to say in Committee. There are other features in connection with electoral matters and the amendment of our electoral law which should have received consideration at the hands of the Government, but which have not. The professed object of all parties in this House is to secure the enactment of an electoral law as nearly as possible perfect, to provide for a proper system of registration of the electors, to devise the best means of enabling them to record their votes, and to insure the secrecy of the ballot. If that be our real desire, why not approach this Bill in the spirit in which it should be approached? Under the existing system of party government, it seems to me that, because the Ministry introduce a measure, the Opposition feel bound to condemn it . If we are going to approach the consideration of an Electoral Bill , which goes to the very foundation of good government, in that spirit, then we can scarcely expect any satisfactory results. Because the Governmeut have introduced a measure that is not exactly in accordance with the views of honourable members opposite, it seems to me that the latter have set themselves out to criticise it to an extent which involves considerable delay in the transaction of the business of the country.",31

182,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Fortunately , I come to this House fresh, hoping to assist in the conduct of the business of the country in a business-like way. I must admit that I am disappointed that, so far, very little progress has been made. little progress seems likely to be made if measures are to be discussed in the carping spirit which has been exhibited on this occasion. If we wish to secure the best electoral system, why not consider this Bill calmly and sionately? Why not get into Committee and consider what is desirable in the interests of a good electoral system ? I am jsleased to say that, notwithstanding all the criticism which has been levelled at this measure, we already appear to have converts to it amongst honourable members upon the opposite side of the House. A number of them now admit that the postal vote should be restored  generous.",32
183,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Houorabl e members, in doing so, try to cover up their tracks by saying, "" We. will l i m it the postal vote to a certain class of persons; we are desirous of restoring it , but we want a perfect system."" Let us then get into Committee, and evolve a perfect system. Then, no doubt, all parties will be satisfied, and the postal vote will be restored. Amongst the extraordinary proposals that have been put forward by the Opposition it i connection with this measure is one by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, that we should abolish rolls altogether. But in the course of some conversational discussion across the chamber, which, I admit, was quite out of order, I drove the ex-Minister into a corner, whereupon lie left the subject and entered upon a discussion of compulsory voting. He found that his position was utterly untenable. So it is with regard to a large number of similar suggestions made i u criticism of this Bill . It is generally admitted that our electoral system should be improved, although the honourable member for West Sydney claimed that the present - system is a* nearly perfect as possible. The Bill may be considered under different heads. One of the earliest provisions made in it is i u connection with the divisions of electorates. A new departure has been made by the Government in the method of fixing the boundaries of electorates. An y scheme for this purpose has to be submitted to a Judge of the High Court,, or. of the Supreme Court of a State, who, having dealt with the matter, will report to Parliament, which may Very accept his report or reject it . Then it will be open for the Judge to make a second or final division, which will become law. Whilst, on the whole, I think it desirable that the matter of adjusting the boundaries of electorates sliould be dispas- dealt with by a Judge, as proposed, I should like to see an amendment made by which we should obtain the benefit of the knowledge and practical experience of officers like the Surveyor-General and the Chief Electoral Officer. I do not bind myself to submit an amendment providing that those officers should sit with the Judge, but I think that their expert knowledge would be of cousiderable value to him. A provision might be inserted, however, by which the Judge, as a person absolutely independent, should have the ultimate decision.",32
184,Mr HOWE,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,What is the objection to the present procedure ?,32
185,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"It does not provide for a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State, or a Judge of the High Court of the Commonwealth, to act. Under the present arrangement, the chairman is the Surveyor-General, if obtainable; and the provision which operates if he is not available is extremely loose, inasmuch as it provides that an officer of his Department, or some person having like qualifications, shall take his place. I consider that that is most unsatisfactory, aud is a point which requires amendment. I suggest that the Judge should have some assistance, instead of acting solely as proposed .",32

I assume that I am within my province, in discussing an Electoral Bill , if I show effect, not only on this House, but also in relation to another place.

197,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"F o r the information of honourable members opposite, and at their invitation, I was about to explain that in time to come the members of botli Houses of this Parliament need not necessarily be elected at the same time. Assuming that there is an election for this House at the eud of next year, there may not, and would not, in the ordinary course, be an election for the Senate at the same time. Theu, assuming that this House, when re-elected, runs for three years, as fixed by the Constitution, in the interval an election for the Senate must necessarily take place. It canuot be deferred until the date for the next election of the members of this House. "" Therefore, the result will be that in time to comenecessarily, I might almost say-the members of the two Houses will not be elected on the same day. What will the tion be unless provision is made for the division of the States into electorates for the purpose of Senate elections ? In the country districts there will be comparatively little interest in the Senate elections, but in the cities and big towns to which the candidates will direct their chief attention, attention will be given, and the result will be that the members of the Senate will be largely elected by the city and town interests. That shows the great importance of taking in hand at an early date the division of the States into electorates for the purpose of Senate elections as contemplated by section 7 of the Constitution Act .  that in this Bill .",34
198,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"No , but I am indicating what is desirable in the Bill , and I am not afraid to express my opinion. The honourable member for West Sydney, who, I think, gave the other side away entirely in their attitude to this Bill , said he had never heard of an Electoral Bill being introduced in the early life of a Parliament, except on one occasion by Sir George Reid. He stated that an Electoral Bill was generally introduced towards the close of a Parliament. As a large number of honourable members opposite admit the necessity of amending the electoral law, and so are going to vote for the second reading of the Bill , and as member the honourable member for West Sydney also admits, even with his criticism, that amendments in certain directions are necessary, evidently his party believes that the time is not far distant when tliere will be an appeal to the electors. That shows the wisdom of the present Government in introducing this Bill at this early stage. It shows that the Government is going to prepare it self for an emergency. It shows that the Government is doing its best to have a perfect electoral law in this country. If the Opposition is desirous of securing a perfect electoral law, it should let this Bill get into Committee as quickly as possible, and criticise it there, and so let us prepare for an emergency which may arise.",34

206,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"U n l i k e the honourable member, I do not suggest that the electoral officers did not do tlieir duty. I believe that, on the whole-at any rate in this State; and I know in my own electorate-w e had as fair, reliable, and trustworthy a set of officers as could be found in any part of the Commonwealth, or, indeed, in any country.",35
207,Mr MATHEWS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,They were all on your side.,35
208,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member for Grey, in his speech, referred to the provision in this Bil l to l i m it the time up to which electors can be placed on the roll to one mouth before the issue of the w r it, instead of the date on which the w r it is issued, as at present. He said that there was a desire ou the part of the Government fco prevent persons who were clearly entitled to be enrolled from becoming enrolled.  the effect.",35
209,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"No , you said that fchey did ib purposely ",35
210,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member also said there would be a largo number of young men and young women who would not become enrolled. Does that not operate in the same way on each side ? Does the honourable member suggest that, on the Labour side, tliere are more young men and young women coming of age ? ",35
211,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I wonder what is the honourable member's justification for saying so. The persons coming of age will be pretty evenly distributed on both sides; therefore, neither side, as a party, will suffer any injustice in that respect. The honourable member for Grey also referred to another matter, and that was the statement attributed to Mr Knibbs, that there were 175,000 more names on the electoral rolls than there were persons entitled to vote.",35
212,Mr MCDONALD,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Whic h Mr Knibbs never made.,35
213,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I am taking the statement of the honourable member for Grey, and the honourable member who interjects was not in the House at the time it was made, and, therefore, cannot express an opinion on the matter.",35
214,Mr MCDONALD,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The remark was made by the Attorney-General, but Mr Knibbs never made the statement.",35
215,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I am dealing at present with the argument put forward by the honourable member for Grey, that at no period was it possible to ascertain exactly how many persons were on the roll. ",35
216,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"A l t h o u g h that may bo so in connection with the printed rolls, it is not so in connection with the certified rolls, because on whatever date the certified rolls are completed all transfers throughout the Commonwealth are supposed to have been carried into effect. ",35
217,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Yes , if the system is efficient. Therefore, when the certified rolls are made up on a certain day, every elector who is entitled to be enrolled in Australia sliould be accounted for, neither more nor less.  sibility, unless you deprive a lot of people of their votes.",35
218,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"But if the rolls are perfect, it is not a moral impossibility, because on that date, when the rolls are closed, no transfers are in operation, and, naturally, the number of persons entitled to vote should have their names recorded on the rolls. I do not personally know what Mr Knibbs said, but if there were 175,000 more persons on the certified lists than were entitled to vote, there is certainly something distinctly wrong.  fied "" lists.",35
219,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I feel sure that, in a matter of this kind, Mr Knibbs would not deal with the printed rolls, because, in some cases, there were as many as 4,000 names struck off when the supplementary rolls were made up.",35
220,Mr MCDONALD,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,All he did was to give the number of people who were entitled to vote. He never touched the rolls.,35
221,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Yes , told me so.",36
222,Mr MCDONALD,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"No , he did",36
223,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Honourable members opposite say that they want a pure roll, and that it should be the aim of all parties in the House to have a pure roll. I cannot understand their violent tirade against the Attorney-General in connection with his attempts to purify the roll . It seems to me that they do not want the roll purified.",36
224,Mr ABTHUB,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Not in that way.,36
225,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable gentleman says "" in that way."" I should like to know what he means.  way.""",36
226,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"If the honourable member is desirous of having a clean roll, then, there should be no objection to anybody informing the electoral authorities of cases which they think should be in quired into. I take it that the responsible officers in the Department will not neglect their duty if information is f u rnished to them, that they will not simply l i m it their duty to cases where a sum of 5s. is paid down in order to insure an inquiry, if information is furnished to them which they consider should be investigated.",36
227,Mr HOWE,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Let them put down the money every time.,36
228,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I can understand honourable gentlemen on the other side saying, "" P u t down the money."" they have plenty of money to put down, unlike the party on this side. We cannot afford to put down 5s. to. inquire into every name that is objected to. In my electorate, on the last occasion, there was a number of names which I felt should be inquired into-o n one roll something like 100 names-bu t I did not feel disposed, and 1 know that my committee did not feel disposed, to go and plank down £ 2 5 to have those names inquired into. Why should not information be furnished to the electoral officers, and inquiries be made by them, and, if tire names should be struck off or added, why should a payment of 5s. be the test of public duty ? Moreover, in this measure, the Government has included a provision for the in fliction of a fine of £ 5 upon any person who enters a protest or makes an objection which is not well-founded. That shows that the Government have no desire to - stuff the rolls. Although they are he did; he abolishing the os. deposit, they are securing due inquiry in every case by the not. ofncials, aud are putting such provisions in the Act as will prevent absurd objections and absurd notices being sent in . The honourable member for West Sydney said that the Government, by means of this Bill , were attempting to achieve five things-to abolish Saturday voting, fco close the rolls one month before the issue of the writ, to compel voters to sign their names, to restore the postal vote, and to restore the freedom of the press. Apparently, there is a difference even amongst the honourable member's own part}', as to three of those things. A nnmber of them now admit that the postal vote should be restored. I wonder what their position was three years ago when it was abolished. I suppose they were flogged in Caucus, aud were brought down here and compelled to swallow the measure as introduced. Now they appear to have some little freedom in this connection. I suppose they consider it discreet and wise to favour the restoration of the postal vote. They see the desirability of reintroducing it , and are anxious to vote for it , while at the same time protecting themselves by saying that it should be limited.",36
229,Mr HIGGS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,That is why we are helping you with the Bill .,36
230,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"If what we are now getting from the other, side is assistance, I do not know what opposition would be. Apparently Although the honourable member for West Sydney has criticised the Bill , there is, apparently, a considerable section of his own party in favour of restoring the postal vote- a proposal to which I am absolutely committed. I advocated it throughout the whole of my campaign, and intend to advocate it in the future, although I admit that there should be proper restrictions to prevent abuse. I shall be glad to give my assistance and co-operation in every direction towards achieving that end. The honourable member for West Sydney also criticised the proposal to close the rolls one month before the issue of the w r it ; but upon that question, also, there appear to be members on the other side who are entirely in accordance witl i the views of the Government. In fact, one honourable member who spoke from the Opposition benches favoured the closing of the rolls three months previously.",36
231,Mr FENTON,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,He waa the only one.,36
232,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Perhaps some of the others who have not spoken also favour it , and he might have let the cat out of the bag. The incident shows that there is an honest feeling on the part of some honourable members of the other side towards getting these proposals through, even in face of the disapproval of many of their party.  member for Oxley who made that statement.",37
233,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"That is so. ""Under the old law it was compulsory to hold the election on a Saturday. Under the present Bill , the election may be held on any day. Before I had experience in the matter, I was against Saturday polling, but I now view the question with rather an open mind. I am indifferent as to whether the voting takes j>lace on a Saturday or on any other day, and I believe that applies to a number of electors; but in the country districts, I believe. Saturday suits a large number of voters.",37
234,Mr HIGGS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,B e careful of the Caucus decision.,37
235,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I am not afraid of the Caucus. There is no such thing as a Caucus on our side. We are free to express our opinions, and are not brought down under the whip and the lash as the party on the other side are.",37
236,Mr ARTHUR,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The honourable member just said that we were not.,37
237,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I .said that some of them were backing out on these questions. There are some objections to Saturday voting, and the conscientious scruples of certain sections of the electors should be considered. I have met numbers who object to Saturday voting, and unless there aTe strong reasons why the polling should take place on that day, consideration should be given to their views. Wliilst I favour the adoption of every safeguard to prevent double voting, impersonation, and abuses generally, I am afraid that the proposal to compel voters to sign their names on polling day will not work satisfactorily. I am willing to give it a trial, but I am afraid that in crowded ceutres, where several thousand electors record their votes at one polling booth, the greatest difficulty will be experienced in making provision to enable them to sign their names.",37
238,Mr FENTON,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,We know you are going to drop that proposal.,37
239,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member is an authority ou everything ; he is omniscient; but whetlier or not the Government are going to drop that provision, I am afraid it would not work smoothly in crowded booths.",37
240,Mr HIGGS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The honourable member has not the courage to vote against it .,37
241,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,I have a n absolutely open mind on this as on every other question connected with the electoral law. honourable Mr HOWE - Has the honourable member an open vote ?,37
242,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I shall vote for the adoption of what I think will be the best electoral system for the people of Australia. Another proposal criticised by the honourable member for West Sydney was the restoration of the freedom of the press. ' I expressed my views on that subject when moving the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, and I notice that even on that question - there is a difference of opinion on the other side. I suppose the Caucus whip has not yet been cracked sufficiently loudly on that point. Before I knew whether I would be returned or not, I expressed myself in favour of the freedom of the press. I may also say that I did not have the assistance of a large number of the Liberal party in connection with my campaign, although I was allowed a free hand. I fought my own fight, and won it in face of the strong opposition of the then Government. I should like to have seen provisions for preferential voting included in the Bill . In my campaign I strongly advocated preferential voting, which was one of my chief planks in connection with the electoral law.",37
243,Mr MCDONALD,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The honourable member did so to curry favour with the Age!,37
244,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,I can afford to ignore that interjection. I strongly expressed the view that there should be no pre-election or selection of candidates by any party. I think it is desirable that both parties should be permitted to put into the field any number of candidates that they think proper. The result would be that proper elimination which would in sure that whoever was elected represented the views of the majority of the electors who recorded their votes.,37
245,Mr HIGGS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Then the honourable member would make pre-selection illegal ?,37
246,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I do not know that the system of preferential voting, if in troduced, need touch the question of preselection. The party on the other side select candidates, and so do our party.",37
247,Mr FENTON,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,And select them on the preferential system.,38
248,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"W h i c h , no doubt, the honourable member for Maribyrnong will vote for when it is proposed. candidates are selected by either or both the parties, the adoption of a system of E referential voting will also enable anyody else with political ambitions to offer his services.",38
249,Mr AKTHOR,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Is the honourable member going to move its inclusion in the Bill?,38
250,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member need not be afraid that this question will not be considered at the proper time, and I hope that when it is considered he will vote for it . It is sometimes said that the system of preferential voting means the. introduction of a'large number of candidates into the field, and it is also stated that candidates working on the same side in the same interest often cause more bitterness than those opposed to it . Pre-selections also often cause a great deal of bitterness and dissatisfaction, but I feel sure that if a number of candidates come into the field, no matter what party they represent, the electors w i ll ultimately select the man who will most suitably represent the views of the constituency. There will be a proper elimination, as I said, and so long as the electors use the system 'of preferential voting honestly and fairly, they need have no fear of it . Under present conditions, we may have a Labour candidate and a Liberal in the field, and also an Independent, who is wanted by neither party. Often the result of the candidature of the Independent is the return of a member for whom only a minorit y of the total Aotes is cast. r",38
251,Mr THOMAS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Would the honourable member make it compulsory to vote for all the candidates?,38
252,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Yes .,38
253,Mr THOMAS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Why should a voter be compelled to vote for a candidate in whom he did not believe? Mr AHERN"" - TJnde r the preferential voting system electors must vote for all the candidates in the order of their preference. At the present time, in Senate elections, electors are compelled to vote for three candidates. I hope that, at the proper time, provision will be made in the Bill for the adoption of preferential voting. There are many other matters with which I should like to deal, but I Even if do not wish to occupy time unduly. If we desire a pure roll and a good electoral system, we should approach the consideration of this measure in a proper spirit. To my mind, the measure is a very plain one, and its provisions are worthy of careful and deliberate study, but so many bogies have been raised by honourable members opposite, so many obstacles erected, so many a w f u l possibilities pictured, that I may say of the speeches of the Opposition, that they haveHeld me entranced in intellectual pain And wonder, at the art than can confuse Things in themselves most plain.  peroration of the honourable member for Indi was a wonderful affair. A more self-satisfied gentleman I have never met in my political experience.",38
254,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The honourable member said that of me.,38
255,Mr WH IRVINE,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"He says it of every one.  the other side are all alike; but, Mr . Speaker, knowing the honourable member for Werriwa as well as you do, you must be of opinion that there is some strong chain holding him down. How the candidate party keeps him silent God Almighty knows; I do not. Some spell has been thrown over him. Possibly he has been told that if he does not keep quiet during this Parliament, he will never again get the Liberal endorsement. That is the only whip with which they could scourge him successfully; because he loves to be in the midst of a fight. When the first Electoral Bill was introduced, no one spoke more loudly than he in denunciation of certain proposals that are now being brought forward again. There is a conspiracjof silence on the part of honourable members opposite. Either they have been struck dumb, or they have been struck comical. The honourable member for Indi has broken away, evi-. dently because he felt that he must say something. Like a b i rd escaped from the cage, he was bursting with song, and had to get it off his chest or die. When honourable members who now support the Government were in Opposition, we had to listen aud suffer in silence to what the Prime Minister has characterized as "" hog-wash "" and "" drivel."" We remember, too, the tirade of abuse which the honourable member for Werriwa, in the early days of Federation, used to pour on Protectionists; but he has now become a strong Protectionist, and today is like a little Pomeranian dog, ready to follow his master or mistress anywhere that they may call him. I should like to hear what he has to say regarding certain clauses of the Bill.",38
256,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member will hear that in Committee.  are to hear at some otlier time what, the honourable member has to say! He knows that in Committee his tongue will be tied. Now is the time to deal with the general principles of the Bill. This measure, instead of being one to amend the Electoral Act, is a Bill to keep persons from getting on the roll, and to strike names off the roll, and the Honorary Minister in introducing it used lauguage such as I have never before heard in this or any other Parliament. I would remind the honourable gentleman that, while the two parties sit on opposite sides of the House, the members of this party, and those with whom they associate are not criminals, although he would have the country believe that-we are connected with all that is bad. Let me quote his own words. He saidThe records of the Courts bear witness to that fact. This country is the most honest on the face of the globe, yet, as in every other country, there are in Australia a certain number of persons who are ready to commit offences against the law. We had in ign-the last year for which particulars are available-144,76 4 convictions in the Police Courts of this country, and 2,631 committals for trial. These were not serious offences; they were trifling Police Court offences. But the fact remains that a proportion of these men who will commit trifling offences against the law, might be led to commit what they might regard as trifling offences against the electoral system if they thought that honourable members opposite were in danger. Nobody believed at the last general election that members ODposite were in danger. . . . Since then some of these people have, unfortunately, found out the way to commit these petty crimes, and have learned of the safety accompanying any such breach of the law. We have had the newspapers full of the opportunities for fraud given by the present electoral system. Every one is now educated up to the opportunities for fraud which it offers. A number of interjections were provoked by those remarks, and the honourable gentleman, finding that he was in deep water, started back for the beach. He continued The point I am making is this: Admittedly honourable members opposite will see that it ought to be worth the while of a man who, perhaps, takes a drink too much, and gets into trouble with the "" beak"" in the morning, to give an extra vote, or to* give a vote, and do his best for the Labour party. Honourable members opposite will agree that they are of more value to these people than is the mere extra drink which gets those people into trouble. I am not saying it pretty low down.",39
257,Mr KELLY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I do not say for one moment that there is any connection whatsoever between honourable members opposite personally and these particular people. I am only showing that there is an immense number of people in Australia-the number is small proportionately to the number in other countries, but still it is a very considerable one-wh o from year to year, commit trifling breaches of the law. I think that these people would be more likely to believe that honourable members opposite would benefit the country than they would be to think that .honourable members on this side of the House would do so. They are enthusiasticUnfortunately, the honourable member for West Sydney then asked if the Honorary Minister was in order. Had the honourable gentleman been allowed to go on without interruption, he would have convicted himself out of his own mouth. I know what he intended to say, though he did not say it . It is playing it pretty low down for honourable members to speak of their opponents as consorting with thieves, rogues, aud vagabonds. How does he know that those to whom he refers would vote for the Labour party instead of for the Liberal party. If he and those supporting the Ministry believe what he said of us, they have no right to associate with us in any way, nor to have anything to do with us. I do not think that there is any difference between honourable members opposite and those on this side, exceptfchafcon political matters they think in one way, while we hold entirely opposite views. I would be sorry to fasten on them every crime in the calendar, as the Honorary Minister tried to fasten evil upon us. Every one is free to vote as he honourable chooses; and if any honourable members 011 this side have to depend for support on criminals or drunkards, our position is not very stable in this Chamber. The Honorary Minister would have been well-advised to drop such talk as he indulged in when introducing this Bill. The honourable member for Indi finds a "" peg "" in what honourable members on this side have said in regard to the postal and preferent i a l voting. When the honourable member was speaking I interjected, "" One swallow does not make a summer "" ; and, as a matter of fact, the vapourings of honourable members opposite have nothing in them. They tell us that we are Caucus-bound, and that we are bound to vote here as the Caucus dictates. Times out of number I have told honourable members that, beyond the Labour platform, the Caucus has no right to bind me in any way ",39
258,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"What ""about the duty on bananas ? M'.r. PAGE - I never voted for a duty on bananas. I introduced that proposal for a Queensland colleague of mine, who was asleep at the time, but I voted against it ; and the honourable member should not t w it me when he knows that was only a joke. No one knows better than yourself, Mr Speaker, that we on this side are free to vote as we like outside the Labour platform. I feel that the pledge I gave my constituents has to be honoured just as I would honour any promissory note I had endorsed. When I go on to a public'platform and say that I am will ing to carry out certain reforms, I am prepared to prove my sincerity by signing my name, as it were, to a promissory note to my constituents. Beyond the Labour platform, however, I am quite free, as can be shown in several instances. The Honorary Minister made a great parade about the Labour party's disloyalty, because of the fact that they did not subscribe to the Queen's Memorial; and, as showing the freedom that we have, I may say that I was the only Labour member who voted for that proposal, and that not a single member of a my party has said one word to me about the occurrence. Then, in regard to the Bill before us, there is nothing to prevent my supporting postal voting if I feel inclined to do so; but, as a matter of fact, I do not believe in the system. I think it is one of the most rotten pieces of machinery ever in vented in any country. I have lived a long time in the State i u which postal voting originated, and I have seen some peculiar things done under it . I plead guilty to the soft impeachment of having done some myself.",40
259,Mr BENNETT,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Consciousl y ?  voter was going to vote, and, if vote as J. wanted, his vote did I know very well what can be that is the reason I am against postal voting. Some honourable members take exception to my remarks about justices of the peace. The honourable member for Darling Downs knows as well as any man that the Philp Government, when they ousted the Kidston Government, appointed political justices of the peace by the score, and in no electorate was this more glaring than in that of the honourable member I have mentioned. Every canvasser of the People's Political League, as it was then called-the "" People's Political Leg-puller ""-wa s made a justice of the peace. These men went canvassing from door to door, and frightened women into voting by post, pointing out that if they did not do so their husbands would lose their jobs. But as soon as the Government were returned, what was their first act ? Every justice of the peace created under the Philp regime-and they numbered over 300-wa s wiped off the rolls, and a fresh start made.",40
260,Mr FENTOX,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"That shows how far some people will go when justices of the peace are appointed in such a way.  knows better than the Minister of Trade and Customs what corruption took place. The newspaper with which that honourable gentleman's relatives are associated denounced the system with "" bell, book, and candle,"" and the newspaper files of the Library will show what his family thought about it . Y e t we find the honourable member in a Government which seeks to perpetuate this evil.",40
261,Mr STUMM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"It is a different system altogether, and the honourable member knows it .  does not know what he is talking about.",40
262,Mr BENNETT,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,It is a different system.  member for Gippsland knows is abchit telling untruths from the public platform.,40
263,Mr BENNETT,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I object to a remark of that kiud.  mav object, but it is a fact, all the same.",40
264,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member for Maranoa is out qf order, and must withdraw that remark. ",40

However, I shall leave the honourable member for Gippsland alone, because he is not worth much- I shall refer to him at the proper time.",41
267,Mr HUGHES,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Does the honourable member mean to say that thought is free?  it to ourselves. As I was saying, no one knows better than the honourable member for Darling Downs what happened at a particular election, and I have here cuttings from the Queensland Hansard to show what did take place. The honourable member for Lilley has suggested that the clauses now proposed are not the same as those in operation in Queensland, but I ask that honourable member wliether the .Bill before us forbids canvassing for postal votes ?",41
268,Mr STUMM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"No .  same evils are likely as were shown under the Queensland Act . I shall, however, be fair with the honourable member, and take it that his interjection has reference to the new E ill now before the Queensland Parliament, in which it is provided(a) No candidate, or agent of a candidate, or of any organization engaged in promoting or intending to promote the election of any candidate, shall attest or receive or take from a voter any postal vote or envelope containing a postal vote. For the purposes of this subsection, the term ""candidate"" in the case of a general election includes any candidate for any electoral district at such general election. Any such person who attests, receives, or takes a postal vote or envelope containing a postal vote shall be liable lo a penalty not exceeding One hundred pounds, and the election of a candidate who, or whose agent to the knowledge of the candidate so attests or receives or takes such postal vote or envelope shall be void. I venture to say, if the postal vote for the Commonwealth were safeguarded in a similur way, that not half-a-dozen honourable members on this side would be found to oppose it .",41
269,Mr RODGERS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I am just thinking what the honourable member escaped at one time 1  as political agent, and not as a candidate. It was my desire to get my friend in , and I can tell the honourable member ""that I worked hard, got him in , and kept him there. Under the Queensland Act , justices of the peace are done away with altogether; and this brings me back to what I said about political justices of the peace being rotten wretches. If honourable members knew some of the things those justices of the peace have done, they would agree that the words used are not strong enough : in fact, I am sorry I did not call them something stronger. Some of the acts they perpetrated at the 1907 election -.vere something a w f u l ; indeed, honourable members opposite would scarcely believe what was done. In regard to postal voting, it is provided in the Queensland Bill - ' ' Any elector(!) Kesiding within the electoral district and at least five miles by railway or by the nearest practicable road from the nearest polling place appointed for the district for which such elector is enrolled; or (ii) Who, by reason of age, infirmity, or ill health, will be unable on polling day to attend at a polling place to vote; or (iii) Who believes that on polling day will be absent from the electoral district for which he is enrolled, and will not be within a distance of fiftv miles by railway or by the nearest practicable roaci from any polling place appointed for such districtmay, after the issue of the writ for the election before polling day, apply to the returning officer for a postal vote certificate. As to the sick and infirm, I have no objection to their having a vote. Honourable members on both sides believe that every qualified man and woman should be able to exercise the franchise; but what makes me so suspicious about, the postal vote is the corruption that has taken place. In one electorate, a justice of the peace went round with a canvasser, and told the wives of working men that it was quite easy to avoid the bustle of the polling booth by signing a postal vote, and that, in a few days, they would come round with the necessary witness. There were peculiar ways of finding out how these people voted. I do not wish to tell honourable members what I know, because I am familiar with the game from A to Z. As I told honourable members before, I have been at it, and know very well what is in it .",41
270,Mr HIGGS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member repents of what he did ?  brother. On the occasion to which I refer, the abuses were so great that the Argus sent a special representative to Queensland to make inquiries. The Argus. apparently was shocked, but not the Age - it wouid be hard to shock the Age. The Argus was shocked at the suggestion that such political indecencies should be perpetrated in a young country like this. It could not believe it possible that this sort of thing was carried on to the extent alleged. It therefore sent to Queensland a special reporter, and on 15fch A p r i l , 1912, published an article from him dated Brisbane, Sunday, in which it was saidThe justice of the peace has degenerated. In former years there was an old-fashioned feeling that the justice of the peace was created to hold impartially the scales of justice. In hundreds of cases justices of the peace are party political agents. There is little, if any, disguise about it ; avowedly in many instances they are appointed to their judicial position for political purposes. It is but natural in these circumstances that abuses will result. The Argus reporter also .wroteThe justice of the peace had local knowledge of the voter, and of his and her political faith. Unscrupulous justices saw to it that all the votes for their candidates reached the returning officer, and that all votes for the other side were mislaid. . . . It was the discovery of such abuses that led the Queensland Parliament to abolish the postal vote.",41

The honourable member for Hume says that the system for which this Bill provides is different from that to which Mr K i d ston referred.

Kidston went on to say thatThe evils of last election will be a mere circumstance compared with the evils that will take place at next election.

274,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"It is going to restore the system.  posed to be introduced in Queensland is very different from that in vogue at the time to which Mr Kidston alluded. The His first difference is as marked as the difference between night, and day. No justice of the peace is to be allowed to witness, and no canvasser is to be allowed, to handle, a postal ballot-paper. That, at all events, was the original intention of the Goverument, but I learn from the Brisbane press that the State Ministeria l party held a caucus on the Lucinda the other day, and decided to recommit the Bill , with, the object of allowing justices of the peace to witness signatures.  justices of the peace?  an innocent man the honourable member is! Mr Kidston went on to sayThe postal vote is of such a nature that fraudis made easy owing to considerable abuse of the postal vote. The best way is to wipe it out altogether. The Minister of Trade and Customs knows that, after this memorable election in Queensland, a Committee or Commission was appointed by the Government to inquire into the postalvoting system, and that magistrates, amongst others, were invited to express their opinions with regard to it . Amongst the witnesses examined was Mr Thomas Mowbray, police magistrate at Toowoomba-no t a Labour man, but a police magistrate-and this is what he saidThe general tendency of the voting by post certainly impairs the secrecy of the ballot in more ways than one - The freedom of the elector is forestalled. Hundreds obtain postal votes through misstatements. Scores of postal votes went to one addressHere is the trouble in regard to intervention by organizations and canvassersand were taken out to the Federal electorates by the justices of the peace, collected and posted by them. I am of opinion that postal voting is not secret voting, and is open to very grave This was the statement made by a gentleman for whom all classes of the community in Queensland have the most profound respect, ancl whose integrity as a police magistrate is beyond question. A report from Sandgate in regard to this election saidThe certificates were evidently watched for by the justices of the peace who had canvassed. Very serious danger of improper action lies here. The Hon. Peter Airie , who was Home Secretary in the Kidston Government, introduced an amending Electoral Bill , and, in doing so, saidHe must emphasize his previously expressed opinion that the introduction of justices of the peace into this particular provision might possibly lead to a great deal of mischief. might do a great deal to vitiate the validity of elections. Then Mr Hawthorn, Home Secretary for Queensland in 1907, saidNo less than 1,30a postal votes never reached the returning officers, with the result that those 1,302 voters lost their votes. Premier Kidston interjectedThey were lost because they voted for the wrong man. The honourable member for Indi raved and ranted"" this afternoon about purity of elections. All that he wanted, he said, was to insure the purit y of electionsthat no name should appear on the roll that ought not to be there, and that no one should vote who was not entitled to vote. There is no virtue about that. Our electoral law is the freest in the world. Every man and woman of the full age of twenty-one years has the righ t to be on the roll and to vote.   albe member that my experience is that it is a difficult, matter to get many people to vote onee, let alone twice, at an election. In many instances constituents of mine have ridden 70, 80, and up to 100 miles in order to vote for me. In my electorate, hundreds of miles intervene between polling booths. Every man and woman has a right to be enrolled. If they are resident in Australia, their names ought to appear upon some r o l l ; and I maintain that they should not be struck off one roll until they have been transferred to another. They, are residents of the Commonwealth, and have as much righ t to be upon the roll as has the abuse - Attorney-General, whose fixed residence is Melbourne.

The honourable member for Lilley knows Mr Hawthorn, and he knows that he is not a gentleman who would rave about anything. He is one of the coolest politicians I have ever met.",42

At Mosman the work of revising the rolls has proved, unsatisfactory. There were 500 names objected to, and when the lists were thoroughly this examined many names were found for whose membership tickets no'butts could be discovered.

There is one little ewe lamb of which the Attorney-General has made a great parade, namely, the signing of the butts. He intends to have duplicate ballot-papers, and to insist upon the voter signing the butts. Has he ever had any experience of conducting an election ? I venture to say that he has not. Need I remind honourable members of what occurred in this Chamber when the Federal Capital Site was chosen? On that occasion no less than three members of this House cast informal votes.

If that does not destroy the secrecy of the ballot, I do not know what does. It does not matter whether you put the number on the front or the back of the paper, because, if the scrutineers desire it , they can handle every ballot-paper that comes out of the ballot-box, and it is the easiest thing in the world to make a note. If I wanted to know how you voted, Mr . Speaker, and I was scrutineer at a booth where you voted, all I should have to do would be to put the number which appeared on the front or back of your ballot paper opposite your name on my copy of the roll. I think I should have enough brain power to keep twenty or t h i r t y cases in my head u n t i l the votes were reAt counted. The secrecy of the ballot must be maintained at all, costs; otherwise, we might as well go back to open voting, and compel voters to range themselves on sides, as we did in the days of old, when every I elector had to go to the polling booth and declare himself openly. This system of signing the butts is about as old as the hills, and has been found defective. Suppose that half-a-dozen men came and voted in the name of James Page at different polling booths in Melbourne. U n less the election was disputed, how could any one find out who was the r i g h t f u l voter? I wish to deal with the matter of removing names from the electoral roll. I have seen many instances of people who have been residing in one place for thirty years, and whose' names have been removed from the roll. Only today I heard Before of people who have written down to their representative, telling him that they had received notice that their names were to be struck off the roll. If the members of my party had been imbued with the same feelings as I am, the Government would never have obtained Supply last week until they undertook to lay aside the regulation under which these objections have been entertained. A more unjust one I never heard of in my life. We seem to be returning to the condition of things that prevailed in the old days, when the Pastoralists' Union.' and other organizations used to send in sale objections to persons to whom they were opposed in politics. A person objected to could not go to the appointed place and prove his claim, and it was not permitted to an agent to go to the Court and speak for him. The same sort of evils are being perpetrated today. I will fight this Bill at every stage, as long as it contains provisions enabling people to be deprived of their just rights. reasonable objection is there to the 5s. deposit 1 The honourable member for Indi told us that he knew of 100 names that ought to come off the roll, but that neither he nor his organization afford to put up £25 to strike them of f .

The best man you can get for such a purpose is the Surveyor-General of the State affected.  faction from Judge Murray, in New South Wales.  ray, who, I know, takes a lively interest in matters of the kind.

It certainly is good enough for us. I shall have more to say ou the subject in Committee.",46
285,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Adelaide) [8.20] - I propose to offer a few remarks if the silence of honourable members opposite is to be maintained. But if any one of them would like to explaiu a Bill that has not yet. been satisfactorily explained, I shall be only too happy to give way. Each honourable member opposite seems to know enough about the Bill to enable him to interject, though incapable of explaining his meaning in a speech. It would be in teresting to find out which Minister is in charge of the measure. It was introduced by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, but during the last two weeks he has hardly been in the chamber ten minutes. We are somewhat at a loss to understand who is really in charge of the Bill , who is making a note of what is said about it , and who will guide its course in Committee. Possibly Ministers and their supporters, revelling in their present majority, are indifferent to the references made to the subject on this side, and to appeals for justice, or even for the observance of an ordinary sense of decency. Apparently, they have decided that a certain course is to be followed, and we must put up with the consequences, merely hoping that the time is not far distant when circumstances may be somewhat changed. The penultimate speaker opened his remarks by the suggestion that we should accept this Bill in a Christian spirit, refrain from adverse< criticism, even with the object of effecting improvements, and let it go through. He referred to some members on our side who had ventured into his electorate, even including my humble self. It is true that I was invited by some hundreds of citizens in that part of the Commonwealth to visit them and address them. I have been invited to go there again. I feel disposed to accept the invitation. But when the honourable member asserts, as he did, that he won his election in the most open and upright manner, I feel concerned to remind him that there is on record oue instance in particular of where his conduct was not such as he alleges it to have been. I have before me a copy of the Wangaratta Chronicle, of 24th May, published just one week before the day of the election. Consequently, any statement published in it had just about time enough to circulate in the district, without permitting an answer to appear. If this statement is typical of the political criticism in which the honourable member indulged at this or subsequent or previous meetings, his statement of today must go by the wall, because it will not hold water. For instance, the honourable member is reported in this newspaper to have saidAt the Hobart Labour Conference of last year was formulated the policy of the Government for this election. A proposal was brought forward that the present Federal exemption of ;£5,ooo should be wiped out and no exemption at all allowed. This proposal was only defeated by one vote, which shows what a narrow shave the land-owners of Australia had, large and small, of having to pay a Federal tax with- honourable members on both sides. out any exemption whatever. Is the honourable gentleman correctly reported ?",46
286,Mr AHEKN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Y o u are reading the newspaper.,47
287,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Before making a comment I ask the honourable gentleman that question.,47
288,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,You are taking the responsibility of it .,47
289,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"A little while ago the honourable gentleman was loud in declamation; he was still more loud in denunciation; he was vigorous in his allegations concerning this side. He even went so far as to profess to be able to read our intentions, much less understand in detail our utterances. I ask him, before I make a comment, is that a correct statement of what he said ? [59]- 2",47
290,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,I am afraid that you are not given to very accurate representation.,47
291,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable gentleman will not deny the report; he will not admit it , and he seeks to prevaricate by an assertion of his own respecting myself. He being present, and at liberty to deny it or accept it, as the case may be, I feel justified in calling attention to that particular view. The land tax was one of those subjects with which certain honourable gentlemen wickedly deceived the electors. Their allegations in respect of it were of a most wretched and most shocking description, and, in the direction referred to, deplorable. The statement warning the farmers as to the narrow shave by which they escaped being subjected to a land tax without an exemption is an indication, at any rate, that some statement of that description was made. If honourable members will tur n to the official report of the proceedings of the Conference referred to- a report which, I presume, the honourable gentleman has had, because he referred to it a few weeks ago in remarks he made - the y will find, on page 14, that that particular proposal was defeated by 18 votes to 6, and not, as alleged by him, by the narrow shave of one vote. Ifc was by methods of that description that he won his election, and he asserted that he won it in a fair, upright, honourable way, deserving of the praise of all sections of the community, with a modesty which, I am sure, commended itself to In the circumstances, he was justified in saying that he cared neither for the hosts of heaven nor for the hosts of the other place. He could win, I admit, if he followed a course of that kind. We are asked, for instance, why we do not approach this Bill in a Christian-like spirit, why we do not show ourselves amenable to reason, which, we can only, assume, is in the other side, for few of them venture to address the House. We are asked to consider a particular Bill . We consider the Bill as it is put before the House. If it is a Bill which permits of a Christian-like criticism and forbearance, necessarily it will receive it ; but if it is a Bill specifically designed to do in j u r y to the country, it naturally follows that honourable members who believe it to be of that description will receive it in no friendly spirit. Even if the Bill were of the 'character suggested, even if it were in its provisions, we are justified, in circumstances, in criticising it in criticising the Minister on the other side on the spirit in which he presented tinctly. the Bill to the House. He presented it to the House in a blackguardly uttertinuedance ",47

These offences; they were trifling Police Court offences. But the fact remains that a proportion of these men' who will commit trifling offences against the law might be led to commit what they might regard as trifling offences against the electoral system if they thought that honourable members opposite were in danger. I propose now to comment, and then to continue reading.",48
296,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,On what page is that reported ?,48
297,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"It is reported on page 1236 of Hansard of 15th September. There is a deliberate assertion on the part of the Minister presenting the Bill that the drunkards, the vagrants, people up for petty .larceny, resisting the police, and assaults in the streets, pickpockets, and the ordinary people who number the 144,000 who were up before the "" beak,"" as he alleged, in a particular year, were the supporters of this sideWe are expected, in the light of such wretched utterances, to accept this Bill in a Christian-like spirit, and with marked forbearance, and to refrain from comment of a character likely to ruffle the feathers of honourable gentlemen on the other side. Tha Minister saidNobody believed, at the last general election, that honourable members opposite were in danger. .The assumption is that if it had been believed that we, on this side, were in danger, these characters to whom the mild honourable gentleman refers in such glib the terms would have come to our assistance, ; indeed, and rendered help willingly.

298,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The Minister conThe honourable member for West Sydney him- 3 self told the people, as reported in the Sydney newspapers, that his party, instead of losing any, going to win more seats; and the people who did not know him believed him.

The Minister proceeded. There were some interjections, and very warm objection was partaken to his utterance. One honourable in the member is reported in Hansard to have comwithdrawn references he made, and the were not serious Minister saidThe point I am making is this : . Admittedly honourable members opposite will see that it ought to be worth the while of a man who, perhaps, takes a drink too much, and gets into trouble with the ""beak"" in the morning, to give an extra vote, or to give a vote, and do his best for the Labour party. May I ask, sir, why the honourable gentleman should suggest that? I might go a little further, and ask why he was permitted in this House to indulge in such a vicious insult, to indulge in this degrading reference, to offend honourable members with assertions of the character that the drunkards of Australia would naturally, according to him, support this side of the House? I am surprised, in the circumstances, that he was not prevented",48
299,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Order ! The honourable member must not reflect on the Chair.,48
300,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I am not reflecting on you, sir.",48
301,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,But the honourable member is doing so.,48
302,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I assure you, sir, that I am not reflecting on you, because that would be out of order. I am reflecting, if any reflection is contained in my remarks, upon honourable members on this side of the House who were present. They ought to have subjected the Minister to such treatment as would have prevented hira from going on in that vicious way, or displaying such a degrading mentality as was displayed in those particular words. He went on to sayHonorable members opposite wil l agree that they are of more value to these people than is the mere extra drink which gets those - people into trouble. I am not saying Here the honourable member for Maranoa is reported to have interjectedThe honourable member is playing it pretty low down. That is a mild way of referring to the utterance, I must say. The Minister continuedI do not say for one moment that there is any connection whatsoever between honourable members opposite personally and these particular people. I am only showing that there is an immense number of people in Australia-the ' number is small proportionately to the number in other countries, but still it is a very considerable one-wh o from year to year, commit trifling breaches of the law. I think that these people would be more likely to believe that honourable members opposite would benefit the country than they would be to think that honourable members on this side of the House would do so. When serious exception is taken to the deplorable utterance of the Minister, there is an attempt to excuse it by saying that he did not personally associate us with these characters, but he left the intention of the stigma by saying that we are politically associated with that section of the community. In the circumstances, Mr Speaker, I am sure you will forgive me-and you will see that I had justification a few moments ago, for breaking a rule-in referring to this as a black""guardly utterance.",48
303,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Order ! I must ask the honourable member to withdraw those words.,49
304,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Mr Speaker, I am sure that, in the circumstances, you will request the words to be withdrawn, but, at the same time, I know that, in your heart of hearts, you must agree with me.",49

308,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Then , Mr Speaker, I withdraw the offence again, I am sorry that I have offended; but, in the circumstances, you will see that honourable members are justified in displaying a little warmth of feeling. When, on top of that conduct, the honourable member for Indi- a novice in the House, but not a novice in years nor in legal procedure - suggests in words that are calculated to mislead the community, that we ought to meet this Bill in a Christian-like spirit; when we are being subjected to this kind of insult daily, in particular by Ministers, and being misrepresented daily at socials, banquets, or other sorts of gatherings by the Prime Minister, then there is room for exception being taken to such conduct in words that cannot possibly be misunderstood. The honourable member for Indi regrets, he interjects, that there is not an illustrated Hansard. I am sure I do not know why he wishes the publication to be illustrated. If these words of the Minister, whom he tamely follows, are not sufficient embellishment, do not in themselves form a sufficiently dirty picture, I do not know what more he desires. Now, so far as the Bill itself is concerned, in the few moments that are allowed to honourable members for its consideration, nothing like detail is possible, yet we may indulge in a few general references. We were led to believe, by the first line of the Ministerial statement, that a major alteration of the Electoral Act would be suggested, for that line readsThe existing electoral law has not been found lo work satisfactorily. That is a complete sentence, composed before any inquiry had been made, before anything in respect of the elections was known other than that honourable gentlemen on the other side, though representing a minority of the electors, have yet a majority in this House. Before any irregularities were proved, before, indeed, the inquiry in relation thereto wasfinalized, the electoral roll had not been found to be satisfactory. One would think that honourable gentlemen opposite, embracing in their numbers, as they do, some nine or ten members of the legal professionmen who 'assert that they are of high business standing, who arrogate to them- selves almost the sole right of governing and legislating for this country, and who refer to honourable memberson this side as being quite incapable of rising to the sublime heights of understanding tical economy-would have some reasonable proof behind them serting that a thing factory; at any rate, a proof acceptable to the average and unbiased But from that day until this, -.the few speeches that have been made, - notwithstanding the columns that appeared in their party newspapers, have not been able to prove in the Electoral Act oue unsatisfactory far as the last elections were concerned. All that they are entitled to attempt to do, by reason of their hustings is to re-institute the postal vote. of that particular feature there is scarcely one clause in the Bill that embodies any of the references or pledges they have made to their electors. Electoral Act is unsatisfactory able members opposite because they have - not a majority in both Houses of the Legislature. Only an Electoral which will give them, by preferential or some other form of voting, by splitting up the Senate seats, by striking names off or putting them on the roll, by having the electorates divided by Commissioners or by a Supreme Court Judge, by absent voting or postal voting, or any other method, what they term a workable majority in both branches of the Legislature, will be satisfactory to them, and then only will they be mute so far as suggestions for its alteration are concerned. is sad, indeed, that the Electoral Aot of this country should be made the plaything - of political parties. If , at the moment that either party receives a chance majority in either branch of the they are there and then to seek to alter the Electoral Act to suit their purposes, it will be a sad day, for we shall go down to the low level of some of the smaller American States, where these matters, together with all Civil Service matters, are regularly manipulated party purposes after What can be said of this Bill, immediately following an election, uo irregularity has been disclosed, when not one member on the other side has produced a scintilla of evidence, - of the restoration of the postal voting provision which they promised to their electors, to justify any alteration Mr Roberts. Despite all the powers of the Government, which have been used during the last three months-detectives , officials, poli- unlimited money-afte r every inquiry that could possibly be conceived of has before as- been made, they have failed to find one was unsatis- irregularity, one justification for any alteration. Yet they submit the Bill to elector. us in a form which clearly indicates that despite it has been introduced wholly and solely for party purposes. The main have features of the alterations which are they proposed have emanated, not from the brains of honourable members opfeature, so posite, but from their political leagues, from the machines that control the elections, from those people who understand pledges, the practical working of every-day elecOutside tions, and who want to make the Electoral Act such that they can escape the. penal provisions, and do whatever seems to them best to get a majority for their Of course, the side. The question of whether every to honor- human being is allowed to vote is of no consideration to them. If they are so solicitous about the women voting, why Act do not their party in this State extend the franchise for the Legislative Council to women ? If they are so anxious that their women should speak at 'the electoral booths, and have a voice in the government of the country, why not give them the right more full y ? Why not give it to them in all the States, where today they are debarred specifically aud persistently by the very poltiical element which is facing us today ? The cry about giving women the vote is about the most It hollow sham ever imposed on a community by honourable . members on the other side. In Victoria, there still remains a form of plural voting for men, - and they seek no alteration of it . As Legislature, I say, the idea has emanated fro m the political leagues outside. It is an in party dication of a desire to manipulate elec-. tions, to remove some names from the rolls, to be able at some special times, when their Ministry happens to be in office to identify particular electors, and for enable canvassers to go from door to door each election. and solicit votes. They know that canintroduced vassers can mislead and deceive, obtaining when votes from persons who do not give much attention to politics, and who are liable to be misled by forceful or u n truth f ul outside arguments. They know that they can mislead the electors, for instance, by such wretched statements as that a proposal to whatever? alter the land tax was defeated by the narrow majority of one, when it was really defeated by eighteen votes to They know that the efforts of these cancan vassers are systematically directed to misbe suggested. lead and misrepresent. They want able to pay their canvassers, men and women j degrading women as they do day by day, by paying them to go mislead the electors. They want to be able to canvass the electorates and get votes by hundreds, as many can get them, not because the average voter is venal, not because he wants to do wrong, but because if men and women sufficiently strong-minded and sufficiently unscrupuspeak. lous go from door to door, innocent and uninformed electors can be misled i many ways. That class of electioneering can be indulged in only by those who have abundant wealth, those to whom money is no object, and who, if they do not manipulate all the funds that come in, know full well that the wealthy i stitutions of the country send money i by hundreds of pounds to aid in the elecof tion of honourable members opposite, or defeat referenda proposals, which would give the people a fuller privilege of selfPacific government. This Bill was conceived viciousness, delivered in venom, and preutterances, sented in vilification by its unmarried us parents. The four great corner stones on which it is proposed to erect this safe retreat for electoral thieves, are deprivaI tion of electoral rights, curtailment political power, violation of the secrecy of the ballot-box, and opening up avenues for fraud. Whatever be the desire individual honourable members on the other side, it is utterly impossible for them raise on such a foundation any supersions structure that can be either honourable to the builders, or perfect in its parts. Y e t honourable members on the other side, knowing full well a ll the possibilities' under the Bill , knowing whence it in reality emanates, propose to continue pushing it before the House, not that they have any real hope of it passing, that they believe that its provisions meet with final legislative assent by branches of the Legislature, but because they think that by its provisions they can mislead a section of the community into believing that something is wrong with the Electoral Act .",49
309,Mr KENDELL,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Does the honourable member think the present Act is perfect,51
310,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"No Act produced human beings can be perfect. sertion to that effect has ever been made. The present Act is possibly capable of six! improvement, and whenever human minds conceive of an improvement, it should It will then be the duty to be of every honourable member on this side of the House to receive it with the respect that it deserves, and to place it round and upon the statute-book.",51
311,Mr SAMPSON,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Le t us get into Committee, so that we can put our heads together, and make a perfect Act of it .",51
312,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The cry on the other side is, "" F o r Heaven's sake, do not Let us get into Committee, where you are not full y reported. Do not exn pose our intentions and desires to the public. Say nothing. Let it be a policy of hush, silence, and suppression. Get into Committee. Let it go."" Does the honourable member wish me to go back n - over the last three years, when from this n corner, he regularly delivered orations unlimited length on all and sundry to subjects, like Mr Dick with K in g Charles' head, never forgetting the Cable business in every speech. in Indeed, so long and laborious were his that it was he that constrained to propose a time l i m it , for , although we love to hear him, there was nothing truly edifying in his laboured efforts. t , therefore, ill-becomes him , on this of occasion, to suggest that we should go into Committee, when but a few honourable members have had the privilege of of speaking, and all have been subjected to a time limit . It is proposed in the Bill to that the boundaries of the electoral divishould be delineated no longer by a Commission of three, including the Surveyor-General of the particular State, but by a Judge of a Supreme Court or the High Court. First of all, we may doubt whether the Judges have the time for this work. Secondly, unless they call exnot pert evidence and go into the question will very minutely, as this practically emboth braces a new sphere of employment for them, it will be impossible for them to do the work in a reasonable way. Another serious objection to a Judge . alone having the right to do this work is that one of the matters to be considered is diversity, or community, of interest, and I would suggest for the consider a? tion of honourable members opposite that by it is not meet that we should m i x No asour Judges up in that matter. Let us keep them pure and above the reach of everything and everybody that can improperly influence them. Do not let us ask them to decide questions affecting community of interest or similar matters which are not dealt with on evidence or according to law. They should not have that task assigned to them. But while it may not be of great importance who does the work of subdivision, the method under which it is done is of importance. The Ministry of the day can submit the redistribution of a State to the Judge, practically whenever they like. If the Bill became law, they could ask for the redistribution of New South Wales, Victoria, or any or all of the States whenever they so. desired. If , after their ings utterances, the Government were proposing to take the redistribution of States altogether out of the hands of Parliament, we might regard them as sincere, and as believing what they told the electors about the need for that step; but the right of Parliament to interfere with the redistribution is not taken away. After the Judge has decided the new electoral boundaries, his redistribution must come before Parliament, and if either branch of the Legislature-not as heretofore, both branches of the Legislaturedisagrees, the Ministry can do what they like in the matter. In this provision we see their Machiavelian cunning. ters happen to have a majority in this House. If either branch of the Legislature disapproves of the work of the Judge, what happens? This is the worse feature of the provision! The proposed redistribution is thrown holus-bolus into the hands of the Ministry, who can do what they like with it. It has been said that the last Government prevented a redistribution of the State of New South Wales, but the statement is grossly false. There was a redistribution in accordance with the law. It was submitted to Parliament for review, and returned to the Commissioners. Redistributions were submitted by the Commissioners on two separate occasions, and then the Liberals, finding that the scheme proposed was favourable to them, because its adoption would increase their numbers and decrease ours, went so far as to hold up the business of Parliament for fifty-four consecutive Lours, or thereabouts, to force its acceptance, despite the assurance that was given that it would be approved. Mr Roberts.",51
313,Mr ATKINSON,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,No . The assurance was given after that.,52
314,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member's statement is not correct, but I know that he is not too regular an attendant.",52
315,Mr ATKINSON,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Do not be unfair. I am here as often as is the honourable member.,52
316,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I do not wish to be unfair. Even were the honourable member a regular attendant, he might not quite understand; though I shall not stress that point too much. The assurance waa given by Ministers. Although, having a majority in both branches of the Legislature, we had the power to prevent the acceptance of the 'redistribution, and hustalthough we knew that it was inimical to our interests, because it would bring about the reduction of our following, we passed it. Note the difference between what we did and what was done earlier by the Liberal party. When the last Fusion Government were in power, in 1909, it became necessary to redistribute the divisions of Western Australia, and independent Commissioners made a report to Parliament. The.then Minister of Home Affairs, Mr Fuller, as in duty bound, moved the adoption of that report. Then what happened. These immaculate gentlemen, whose honour transcends anything previously known in the political Minis- life of this Commonwealth, voted or paired against the scheme to a man, the Minister of Home Affairs alone voting for it. What did they care then about a fair redistribution, or about one man one vote of one value? What sense of honour, decency, or uprightness did they then show? They were playing the political game.",52
317,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The honourable member must not pursue this illustration too far.,52
318,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I shall not do so; but it has a close relationship to the provision under discussion. Every Liberal member and Minister alike voted or paired against the scheme, because it would have lost to the. party the then member for Fremantle, Mr Hedges. Did they send back the scheme to the Commissioners for reconsideration ? No. That would bave been too much risk. It was quietly put into a pigeon-hole in the Minister's office, and their adherent was saved. These are the gentlemen who today bring forward a provision under which they would be able to do the same thing again. After this House, and they have a majority here now, has disagreed with the proposals of the Judge-and the majority will disagree with them if they are not suitable or satisfactory to the party ; because we must judge of the future by what has happened in the past-the y will do as they did in 1909, and stamp it out of sight. Well might the honourable member for Wimmera say, "" Do not speak. Let us hush it all up, and rush' the Bill into Committee."" They do not desire the exposure of these proposals to the public view, so that the people may understand their evil possibilities.",52
319,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The honourable member has not given a correct interpretation of the provision. Read the plain English of it.,53
320,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I do not know that the honourable member for Indi is an expert in interpretation; judging by what I have read from the Chronicle he is an expert in misrepresentation. This is the provisionI f either House of the Parliament passes a resolution in pursuance of sub-section (i ) That is, objecting to the provisionof this section, the Minister may direct the Commissioner to propose a fresh distribution of the State into divisions. Is that a correct reading of the provision ?",53

322,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Paragraph statesThe Commissioner shall thereuponT h at is if the Minister sends it to him reconsider the matter, and forthwith declare a fresh distribution, but for that purpose it shall not be necessary to cause the action provided by section 17 of this Act to be taken.",53
323,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Exactly ; that is not what the honourable member told the House.,53
324,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The gentleman gives the clearest possible proof that he has not read the provision.,53
325,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,I have read it carefully. The honourable member does not underso stand it .,53
326,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"In order that I may pierce the political density of the honorducted under the new provisions. able member, I say again that, if the Ministry, whoever they may be, do not desire that the report shall go back to Commissioner for reconsideration, it does not go back. It is in the hands of Parliament in the first place, and when liament disagrees, it is in the hands the Ministry of the day.",53
327,Mr AHERN,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,It is in the hands of the Commissioner. Listen to the embryo lawyer!,53
328,Mr ATKINSON,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Embryo ? He thinks himself the finished article.,53
329,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Thes e interjections are disorderly.,53
330,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member need not get angry. I am not an embryo lawyer, nor yet the finished article; but, while I do not like to be unkind to the honourable member, it is possible that if I were the finished article I could earn my living, whereas he cannot earn cheese. If the House disagrees, then the Ministry have full control. If it suits the Ministry the report may go back to the Commissioner; but, if not, then the report does not go back. As in 1909, when the Fremantle seat was in danger, the Government, with the knowledge of what they are doing, may pigeon-hole the proposals, Wangaratta and the Commissioner will never see them again. Despite all the utterances about the purity of elections, and the necessity for taking the control out of the hands of Parliament, this has been done. Paragraph 5 of the clause is as follows: Notwithstanding anything contained in subsections (1) and (4) of this section the distribution shall not, until the then next ensuing dissolution or expiration of the House of Representatives, affect the election of a new member to fill the vacancy happening in the House of 3 Representatives, but for the purposes of any such election the electoral divisions as theretofore existing, and the rolls in respect of these divisions shall continue to have full force and effect, notwithstanding that new rolls for the new divisions have been prepared. Once again we see the cunning which drafted this paragraph. It is quite possible that a by-election now would upset either side of the House. A resignation or death on this side might mean a very substantial majority for the Government honourable if they won the seat; whereas, a death or resignation opposite might mean the Government and their supporters coming over here. This particular paragraph is framed that, no matter how the electorates may be divided in the next two or three years, no by-election can be conThe Ministry, to the extent to which they canmake themselves safe under this provithe sion, have done so; and yet all the time they keep talking about using their power to protect the people. There is another proposal to which I desire to call attenPartion. It is proposed, by an amendment of. of section 64, to prevent the registration i of names within one month before the professions, and issue of the writs. At present, a desiring to become an elector may regisenroll, ter up to the day of issue; and not word of justification has been said the proposed alteration other than that the electoral officers allege they scarcely time to get the rolls reasonable condition. During the thirteen years, however, the officers been able to do this work; and we bers . know that within the period of month before the issue of the' writs many thousands of electors register their names on the rolls. This provision specifically drafted to prevent a large number of people from having names recorded. In the excitement mediately preceding an election of people, good citizens in the best sense of the word, who have not taken the precaution, awake to a knowledge of their responsibilities to be placed on the roll.. The Honorary Minister ought to have been honest us, and brought down a statement ing the number of persons who, during active interest in politics. the last thirteen years, have had their names recorded within the month. There is, however, a policy silence and secrecy that is almost appalof ling-a policy of hush permeates whole of the Government side. Had the Minister given us this information, should have been able to show clearly that tens of thousands of electors do denly awake to their responsibilities, in the vast majority of cases they become the most active of voters. There may no clear notification when the writs be issued, and hundreds of electors, in the case of an unscrupulous issuing them a week or ten days earlier than expected, may find themselves disfacilities franchised. All the time we have honorunder able members opposite crying about the purification of the rolls, and their desire to give every elector the opportunity exercise a franchise. They are fair of mise, but false in deed. The result this Bill will be to deprive many thouCommonwealth sands of electors of their rights. loss this will be I cannot say; but I confident that those from whom this meavision sure emanated are under the impression that the majority of the electors registering their names are not favourable to them, or we should certainly not have had such a provision suggested. hope sincerely that honourable bers opposite will be true to their Mr Roberts. afford every faciperson l it y to properly qualified persons to and subsequently to record their a votes. Here, however, we find a specific for provision to prevent very many thousands from voting. Another peculiar provision have is that declaring that citizens shall not be into allowed to register their names for one last month prior to the issue of the writs, whilst have the leagues which control honourable memopposite will continue, without responone sibility or penalty of any description, to object to names already on the roll, and to have them struck off right up to the is very day on which the writs are issued. A m I not justified, in the circumstances, their in saying that this Bill has been drafted imwith a cunning that is almost Machiahundreds velian ? How will this provision affect a citizen who has been six months in the previously Commonwealth, or who has reached his and seek majority a day or twp before the issue of the writs? All these will be deprived of with the right to vote. Many of our young showpeople, I am glad to say, are taking an W it h the spread of education they are obtaining a specified better knowledge of political economy. of Hence the gradual increase in the strength our voting power, although, for the the moment, it is not adequately reflected in this Chamber. I have in my mind's eye we at the present moment some young men of eighteen, nineteen, and twenty years of sudage, who are looking forward eagerly to and the time when they will be able to record their votes. For long they have been be active political workers. But these young will men may become of age, perhaps, just a few days before the date of the issue of the Ministry writs, and honourable members opposite, who prate of their desire to extend the for voting, will say to them, this measure, "" You cannot vote at this election; you ought to have come of age a few weeks earlier."" Then we may have to a citizen pf repute who desires to record proliis vote, but who, a month prior to the of issue of the writs, has not been in the for quite six months, and, Whose therefore, will be deliberately prevented am from .securing enrolment. This is a prowhich necessarily means strengthening the position of honourable members .so opposite. As Conservatives they naturally desire for this House a conservative or limited roll, like those relating to their I Legislative Councils-so limited, indeed, memthat but few Democrats will be able to enter. Whilst they seek that degree of conservatism which. will prevent people from getting on the rolls, they desire, also, to secure a power that will enable them to remove names from the roll right up to the date of the issue of the writs. If the one proposal were fair and honest, why should it not be applied to the other ? Why not say that political leagues, also, shall not be allowed to lodge objections to names on the roll within one month of the date of the issue of the writs ? The whole Bill has been framed for specific party purposes, and there is underlying it an intention that does not reflect credit on those responsible for it . There is, first of all, the intention to deprive people of tli3 right to vote by preventing them from securing enrolment, and, secondly, the in tention to deprive them of the right to vote by a rigid system of striking names off the roll once they have been put on. This is but a return to the old methods, which we thought had been dead for twenty years. Indeed, such methods are dead in some countries; but, because honourable members opposite have been suddenly returned to power by the narrowest of majorities, and with a minority of the votes of the. people behind them, they have seized the first opportunity to carry back our electoral procedure twenty-five or fifty years-to drag us back practically to the days which we thought we had left behind, for ever.",53
331,Mr RILEY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,They will withdraAv the Bill.,55
332,Sir BOBERT BEST,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Oh !,55
333,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"We see at once the desire of honourable members opposite underlying this measure. We can read, so to speak, into their minds and hearts. This Bill lays bare their intentions. Every line of it is stamped Will conservatism, rank and rampant. that they Would, if they dared, have this House and the Senate like the Legislative Councils of the States. The leading man behind this measure is one who, but a year or two ago, having a majority behind him in both branches of the State Legislature, deliberately robbed certain people of their votes because they dared to differ from him on political questions. Here we have honourable members opposite, Avho arrogate to themselves knowledge, culture, education, and all that go to make up the individual f it to take part in the deliberations of the National Parliament, seeking to institute an electoral system so conservative as to make honest men blush. We can readily see the condition of mind into which they have fallen. A moment or two ago, Avhen it was suggested that the Bill should be withdrawn, the honourable member for Kooyong laughed scornfully at the idea of AvithdraAving a measure which is going to help his side so materially.",55
334,Sir ROBERT BEST,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,I laughed at the honourable member's humbug r.nd nonsense.,55
335,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member laughed at the idea of AvithdraAving «. Bill which is going to chock thousands of useful citizens-withou t whose assistance and labour many Government supporters would not bask so happily as they do today in the sunshine of life, in the desire to record their A'otes. Their names are to be taken off the rolls. Then there is the provision to prevent Saturday being chosen as a polling day. According to the honourable gentleman who in troduced this Bill , the reason given by the Electoral Officers is that there is always a great rush after 1 p.m. when the election is held on a Saturday-that the rush is so great as to clog the electoral machinery. If a general election were held on a Friday, instead of there being 'a continual rush from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m., all those Avho had been at Avork from 6, 7, or 8 o'clock in the morning Would be rushing to record their votes from 5 to 8 p.m., so that for a couple of hours the congestion would be intensified a hundred-fold. The holloAvness and shallowness of this pretence is positively nauseating. The Government know that by doing aAvay Will Saturday as polling day they Avill deprive thousands of It SIIOAVS useful Avorkers-clerks , shop assistants, labourers, mechanics, and artisans-of the right to exercise the franchise. Then, agaiu, those who seek to record their votes are to be called upon to sign the butts of the ballot-papers. Of all the ludicrous, not to say shameful, proposals ever made this is the worse. Imagine elector!? going into a polling place in respect of which 5,000 Alters are enrolled, and hai n g to sign their names in this way before being allowed to vote! Many, unfortunately, are not rapid Avriters; a small percentage are scarcely able to write at all. So that this proposal that every man and woman, before receiving a ballot-paper, shall sign the ballot-paper butts, discloses eitlier a remarkable peculiarity of imagination or the depths to which honourable members opposite will descend in order to deprive electors of the franchise. There are several other provisions with which I should like to deal, but, as my time has expired, I shall have to reserve, until we reach the Committee stage, my comments on them.

I may mention that I am moving this resolution with a view to basing upon it the Bill which will subsequently be introduced. The resolution, however, has first to be adopted. It authorizes the imposition of a duty upon that quan1 tity of sugar which is equivalent, first of all, to the sugar which was produced from cane delivered at the mills up to the date on which the Sugar Excise Act was repealed.",56

354,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I do not wish to enter into anything of a controversial character. In addition to that, the next clause of the resolution declares that the actual amount shall be certified to by the Comptroller-General. The t h i r d resolution declares that all cane sugar manufactured in Australia and entered for home consumption after the commencement of the Act is to be deemed to be sugar subject to Excise. F u r t when the duty has been paid, the Act is to cease to operate. The effect of this resolution will be to authorize the collection of revenue upon cane and beet sugar to the amounts respectively* that would have been paid if such a clause had been inserted in the repealing Act . other words, the effect is just the same as if a continuing clause had been inserted in the repealing Act providing that revenue to these amounts could be collected. We authorize the collection of the revenue to the full extent of the £ 4 per ton upon all amounts upon which we have paid bounty.",57
355,Mr FISHER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Has some sugar been taken out of bond?,57
356,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Some has gone into consumption.,57
357,Mr WEBSTER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,How much?,57
358,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"We cannot at present determine the exact amount. But that does not matter, for this reason: We require that there shall be passed through the Excise entered for home consumption, amounts equivalent to these amounts, so that we can collect exactly the amount of revenue mentioned.",57
359,Mr TUDOR,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Supposin g some of the persons who received the bounty are not producing any more sugar; how can you get the revenue then?,57
360,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"We know, as a matter in of fact, that the persons liable for the duty are all producing sugar.",57
361,Mr TUDOR,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Suppos e that there are some who are not?,57
362,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,We know from in quiries that there are none.,57
363,Mr FISHER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,B e fran k about it .,57
364,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,I am perfectly frank. All the persons interested have announced that they have no desire to take advantage of the repeal of the Excise.,57
365,Mr TUDOR,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Onl y one of them has done so, I think.",57
366,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"All the manufacturers. They say they have no desire to take advantage, and wil l enter for home consumption the amounts which come undei the paragraphs a and 6 of these motions.",57
367,Sir ROBERT BEST,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,What is the general result in figures ?,57
368,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The general result is this: The quantity estimated to be made from the cane delivered up to the 25th July will be 36,134 tons of refined sugar. h e r ,' About 4,000 tons of that sugar would be made after the 25th J u l y fro m cane delivered, but not treated. The amount of revenue expected from the new legislation wil l be £158,000 altogether.",57
369,Mr TUDOR,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,How does the Minister get that result? In Mr GROOM - Thes e are the figures supplied by the officers of the Department.,57
370,Mr TUDOR,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Then there must be some figures which we have not got.,57
371,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,This is an estimate.,57
372,Mr FISHER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I do not see how the Minister gets £158,000 from 36,000 tons at £ 4 per ton.",57
373,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"We have to add 3,500 tons of sugar in bond from last year, making a total of about 39,500 tons. Of course, these figures can only be taken at present as approximate. The revenue from that will amount to £158,000 . This year we have paid bounty to the extent of £114,672. In addition to that, in the other proposed legislation which I propose to circulate, dealing with the additional bounty upon the cane of 2s. 2d., there will be involved another amount of £35,730, which will make the bounty payable total about £150,402. cludes what has been paid, together with what is promised to be paid.",57
374,Mr HUGHES,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Is it proposed to for interest on the amount, or to waive the interest?",58
375,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"We cannot ask for in terest, as we have no legal claim.",58
376,Mr HUGHES,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"You had no legal claim on the other, if you once admit that you are not going to follow the sugar into the hands of the holder.",58
377,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"We shall have a legal claim on equivalent amounts that will pass through bond, and have to be entered for home consumption. We shall get an equivalent, and that is what we propose to do.",58
378,Mr TUDOR,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Why do you not interest, if we have a legal claim ?",58
379,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,When we pass the E ill we shall have a legal claim.,58
380,Mr HUGHES,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,A legal claim which you would not enforce against a bond fide holder for value.,58
381,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"We are not even entitled to interest, because sugar is entered for home consumption when a man desires to take it out of bond.",58
382,Mr HUGHES,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,What proportion is still held by the producers?,58
383,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I cannot give the exact amounts; but under the legislation we propose we shall be able to take possession of equivalent amounts; so that we shall be i u a position to secure and collect the revenue to the full amounts I have mentioned. I should like the Committee to adopt the proposed resolution to-night, so that we can get the Bill circulated, and its second reading fixed for tomorrow.",58
384,Mr FISHER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Wide Bay) [9.47] - I have no intention of delaying the introduction of the Bill ; but I think that the Minister might have frankly stated the reason why it is being introduced. For about two months the Government have paraded before the country a statement that their trouble arose out of some fault or failure of the previous Government. It did not. There was before them a Statute, telling them exactly what they could do and what they could not do. The Minister did not say whether the Government had cognisance of the fact chat there was in bond sugar on which bounty had been paid at the time of the i&sue of the proclamation, and on which they must have known duty ought to have been That in - paid, the sugar not being released by the proclamation. He has not said a word as to whether the Customs officers were ask invited to give information to the Government before the proclamation was issued.",58
385,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,I said that on a previous occasion. I did not know that you desired me to go over the ground again.,58
386,Mr FISHER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The Government, as well as the Minister, have indulged in a great number of public statements, and should have embraced the first opportunity to substantiate them.",58
387,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The last time. I spoke here I gave the honourable member information, including telegrams sent on the night of the repeal.",58
388,Mr FISHER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member go for has not told us either that Parliament was to re-assemble shortly after the issue of the proclamation. If Ministers had looked at the Act . and seen that it was defective, from their point of view-and it was not defective at all, in my opinionthey could have removed that defect, because Parliament was to meet within sixteen days after the proclamation was issued, and no disturbance could have taken place as regards the collection or noncolle&tion of revenue. In fact, the matter was discussed when the Bill was going through last session in the ordinary course of events. Unfortunately, the last cane season-that is, 1912-13-yielde d a very poor crop. Had it been put on the market, as it ought to have been, it would have been all consumed in Australia before March, and ""any proclamation issued between March and the end of June before fresh cane was cut would in ordinary circumstances have been issued at a time when there was no sugar in bond at all, unless some persons were speculating heavily and holding back against a proclamation that might be issued by a Government who would not take care to see that there was no sugar in bond. That is really the position, as the Minister knows, but this is not the time to debate it. I hope that later the Minister will tell us frankly whether he consulted the Customs officers to ascertain what sugar was in bond. The officers must have known as the new sugar was coming in that there must be some i u bond. It is carried in bond ou the seaboard from the mills to the refineries, and therefore the Government must have been aware of the position if they took any notice of matters at all. Furthermore, this question was discussed in the Queensland Parliament, particularly by Mr Gillies, who pointed out to the Commonwealth Government twelve days before they issued their proclamation that they had to take care that the sugar in bond was not allowed to go scot free, because the bounty had already been paid in accordance with the amount of sugar delivered at the mills for manufacture. That is how the matter stands, but I shall wait with pleasure for the second-reading speech of the Minister, when, no doubt, we shall hear more of the facts, and the reason why this proposal has been brought forward. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported, and adopted. Ordered-=That Mr Groom ancl Mr W. H . Irvine do prepare and bring in a Bil l to carry out the foregoing resolution.

389,Mr FISHER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Does the Minister propose to get the correspondence between the parties printed ?,59
390,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"No , but the correspondence will be on the table of the House for any honourable member to see. ADJOURNMENT. ORDER OF BUSINESS : RECEPTION OF FLEET-SMALL-PO X OUTBREAK : QUARANTINE . Motion (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That this House do now adjourn.",59
391,Mr RILEY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"South Sydney) [9.56] I wish to know if the Prime Minister can make a statement as to the arrangements in connection with the welcome that is to be extended to the Fleet at Sydney ? We should be told when the train is to leave Melbourne, so that we may communicate with our friends in regard to the matter. I understand that it is proposed that the special train shall leave on Friday morning. If that is so, it will not be fair to keep us here on Thursday night, because the train will not get to Sydney u n t i l early on Saturday morning, and we shall have to walk about in the parks-at any rate, those who have not homes to go to will have to do something of that kinduntil the function starts.",59
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [9.57] - I wish to meet the convenience of lionorable members in this matter. A special train will leave for Sydney at 1 o'clock on Friday afternoon, and it will, therefore, be useless for the House to meet on that day, because, to catch the train, honourable members will have to leave here not later than noon. A f t e r an hour had been spent in the asking and answering of questions-whic h is becoming the usual thing-ther e would be only half-an-hour left in which to do work.",59
393,Mr FISHER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The honourable gentleman set that fashion.,59
394,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"That is a mistake; the statement could not be supported from the Hansard records. , It seems to me useless to meet on Friday, because little or no business could be done then. Thursday is the day set apart for private members' business, but I suggest that at 2 o'clock instead of at a quarter past 2, which is the usual hour when we reassemble after luncheon, the Treasurer should be permitted to deliver his Budget. He will probably finish by 4 o'clock, and then honourable members who wish to leave will be free to do so. Of course, there remains fco be settled the question how best to accommodate private members' business. As to that, I should be glad to receive a suggestion from the Leader of the Opposition during tomorrow.",59
395,Mr RILEY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,There are to be celebrations in Sydney next Tuesday. When is it proposed to meet next week ?,59
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"On Tuesday afternoon, at the usual hour.",59
397,Mr FISHER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Wide Bay) [9.59] - I agree with the suggestion of the Prime Minister regarding the arrangement of business. It would be futile to meet on Friday. Perhaps the best arrangement would be to give up Thursday morning to private members' business. The Treasurer could then make his speech after the luncheon adjournment, after which honourable members might like to go home to get ready for their trip . am inclined to think that there will not be a general desire to sit late on Thursday. Perhaps we may be able to rise before the dinner hour then.",59
398,Mr WEST,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"East Sydney) [10.0] - This afternoon I endeavoured to obtain from the Prime Minister a statement regarding the intention of the Government about the removal of the quarantine restrictions on Sydney and the area within 15 miles of its General Post Office. On Monday a conference was held there, the outcome of which, according to the newspaper reports, seems to have been that the whole question should be lef t for the Prime M in ister to decide. The press statement of what took place is thisThe object of the Conference was to discuss the small-pox outbreak and the possibility of removing the quarantine restriction from Sydney. The Conference lasted for more than an hour. AH the members of the Board of Health, which include such well-known figures as Dr Paton, Director of Public Health Sir Normand MCLaurin, Chancellor of the University; and the Lord Mayor, Alderman Cocks, M . L . A . , were in favour of the immediate liftin g of the quarantine embargo. The Federal representatives, however, were anything but complacent. What appears to be the desire of this Government is that the embargo shall not be removed u n t i l the two Houses of the New South Wales have passed a law making vaccination compulsory on the people of the State. If the disease is really smallpox, and the Federal Government has the right to compel the people within the affected area to be vaccinated, it has either made a mistake in imposing quarantine or has failed to give effect to its constitutional powers. For this Government to ask the State Parliament to pass a law about which the people of the State have not been consulted, and in regard to which they have not expressed their views, is an unheard-of thing. The National Parliament has no right to tell a State Parliament that it must pass such and such a law. As a member of this Parliament I disclaim any right of that kind. Let the State Parliament act in a constitutional manner, and appeal to the people on the subject. Apparently, the Government, as represented by the Minister of Home Affairs, will not allow even a conscience clause. Surely, the State Parliament is not expected to act so tyrannically as to pass a law compelling the whole population of New South Wales to be vacciI nated, seeing that there is a strong objection to compulsory vaccination in the State. Many persons have .died in New South Wales recently who would be alive today had they not been vaccinated. Some of the lymph that has been used has been of such a quality that many have suffered because of it .",60
399,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable mem-' ber may not debate the question, because it forms the subject-matter of an adjourned debate which has been made an Order of the Day for a futur e date.",60
400,Mr WEST,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"You r ruling, sir, makes my position difficult. I do not think this Parliament desires that the embargo should be kept upon Sydney until the Parliament of New South Wales has passed a law compelling the citizens of the State to be vaccinated. Action of that kind is without precedent in any part of the civilized world. If you, Mr Speaker, representing Lang, the Prime Minister, who represents Parramatta, and other Ministerial supporters who represent other Sydney constituencies, were sitting on this side of the House, the Government in power would have no peace, and no business would be done, until this unjustifiable embargo had been removed. The constituents of honourable members opposite are appealing to the honourable Parliament member for South Sydney and myself as the only legislators with the courage to stand up to represent the case of many people in the quarantine area who have been vaccinated in a brutal manner.",60
401,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member must not discuss that question, for the reason I have already pointed out to him.",60
402,Mr WEST,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"A large number of persons outside commercial circles are suffering from the application of the quarantine laws, and many medical men in Sydney have told me that I am taking the right course. I trustthat the Prime Minister is now in a better frame of mind than he was this morning, and that he will see that the 755,000 citizens in the quarantine area are no longer unduly punished. The Sydney Board of Health, the Sydney press, the Chamber of Commerce, and other public bodies are all in favour of the view I am expressing; and it is an absolute fact that if small-pox were to break out in New York, London, Glasgow, or Paris, such steps as have been, taken by this Government would be laughed at.",60
403,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Werriwa) [10.10] The Ministry ought to seriously consider the position, because in no civilized part of the world would such steps be taken in the case of an outbreak of small-pox.",61
404,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The honourable member is now debating a question which is the subject of an adjourned debate on a specific motion.,61
405,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"What I desire to discuss is Dr Cumpston's fitness to give the Government advice. During the last three or four years medical opinion has so altered that, while no one disputes the prophylactic power of vaccination, that method of treatment is now regarded as obsolete. Sir Victor Horsley, the President of the Compulsory Vaccination Society, said, so recently as A p r i l last, that, while he had not abandoned his belief in vaccination, he considered its compulsory application as obsolete and unnecessary, in view of the present methods of sanitation. In Dr Cumpston we have a medical man who supplied lymph reported to be so unsterilized that it had caused hundreds of people to lose hundreds of days' work; and I should like to know whether the Federal Goverument propose to reimburse those people.",61
406,Mr FINLAYSON,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,That has occurred not only in Sydney.,61
407,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"It has occurred also, I believe, in Melbourne; but in Sydney the loss must amount to tens of thousands of pounds. The man who advised the Government was recommended by the Labour party for the position; but, of course, if they chose, when in power, to recommend an unfit man, the whole Parliament had to bear the responsibility. The Government are following the advice of a young man who does not seem to have sufficient knowledge to guide him as to the right steps to be taken.",61
408,Mr ROBERTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Does the honourable paper shall not be anticipated. member say that Dr Cumpston is unfit for the position ?,61
409,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,I unquestionably say so.,61
410,Mr ROBEBTS,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Then why do the vernment not dismiss him 1 [60],61
411,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"In my opinion, that is what the Government ought to do. Dr Cumpston is so unaware of the recent developments in bacteriological science that last year, in Western Australia, he said that vaccination was unknown for a certain disease, although it had been used in this way in the Philippines for three years. If a medical man can make such mistakes, for which he has to be corrected by laymen, we cannot have much reverence for his knowledge. The attitude which Dr Cumpston has advised Australia to take is different from the attitude of Italy , Germany, and England, where opinion is so changing, that during the last twelve months, in the Old Country, for instance, compulsory vaccination has been abolished in the Public Service.",61
412,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member is distinctly out of order. The terms of the motion, the debate on which has been adjourned, cover all the ground which the honourable member is now traversing.",61
413,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I was quite - prepared to allow the Government time to see what the developments might be; and had the disease become malignant, I should have been ready to allow them to take any action they pleased to try to stamp it out. But we have had the history of epidemics of cow-pox in other countries, and, seeing that in this case there have been no deaths amongst the unvaccinated, although small-pox is believed to be specially fatal in such cases, we can only conclude that the Sydney epidemic is one of cow-pox.",61
414,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I must ask the honourable member to desist. I have called attention several times to the fact that he is dealing with matters covered by a motion, the debate on which has been adjourned to a future date.",61
415,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,I am dealing with a medical man who gave advice only yesterday,61
416,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I have nothing to do with that. I have to carry out the Standing Orders, and they provide that the discussion of a motion on the noticeA l l that the honourable member is now saying is germane to that motion.",61
417,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The whole matter Goarose only yesterday. The meeting took place only yesterday,61
418,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member may be right as to his facts; but I am concerned only with the carrying out of the Standing Orders. The adjourned debate on the motion moved by the honourable member for Gwydir, to which 1I have referred, is set down for another date, so that the matter cannot be discussed now.",62
419,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I am afraid that I was getting rather heated; but when we see a drop of over £300,000 already in the trade",62
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"It is not the quarantine, but the existence of small-pox that is responsible for that.",62
421,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"That is not so. Surely the Prime Minister recognises that the belief in the wisdom of all Governments, not necessarily the present one, is not always well founded. I should like the Government to take into consideration the fact that the Royal Commission in England recommended that the British Government should recompense all who had lost money because of vaccination; and I also desire that an inquiry shall be held into the number of deaths which undoubtedly have been caused by the lymph supplied. There is no question that a septic poison has been set up",62
422,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member is out of order. I must remind him again that he is traversing a motion, the debate on which has been adjourned to a future date.",62
423,Mr GROOM,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"If the honourable member will allow me to intervene, I should like to ask leave to temporarily withdraw my motion for the adjournment of the House, in order to allow the Prime Minister to submit a motion for a special adjournment. Motion, by leave, withdrawn. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.

SMALL-POX OUTBREAK: QUARANTINE. Motion (by Mr GROOM) again proruling, posedThat the House do now adjourn.",62
424,Mr FINLAYSON,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"On a point of order earlier in the day, Mr Speaker, you ruled so far as my memory serves me, that an honourable member would not be out of order in bringing before the House a matter of urgent public importance, notwithstanding that it related to a notice of motion, the debate on which stood adjourned. Is not the question which the honourable member for Werriwa is raising a matter of urgent public importance, and, therefore, within the ruling to which I refer?",62
425,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member is mistaken as to a statement which I made earlier in the day, which had reference to quite another matter. What I pointed out was that the practice of the House of Commons was that questions without notice were asked only in respect of matters of urgent public importance. I did not rule that the discussion of a notice of motion, the debate on which had been adjourned, could be anticipated as an urgent matter of public importance.",62
426,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I do not know, Mr. Speaker, that the point I have been dealing with is covered by the motion to which you have referred.",62
427,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Perhaps I had better read the motion moved by the honourable member for Gwydir, the debate on which has been adjourned. It is as followsThat-wit h a view to putting an end to the suffering, sacrifice of human life, and the commercial, industrial, and domestic stagnation in the State of New South Wales, resulting from the proclamation and administration of the laws governing small-pox epidemics-this House is of the opinion that the proclamation should be cancelled, and that isolation, combined with sanitary reform, the true enemy of small-pox, should be substituted for the present injurious methods. It will be recognised that the matter which the honourable member for Werriwa seeks to discuss properly pertains to the adjourned motion.",62
428,Mr FINLAYSON,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"On a point of order, Thurssir, do you now rule that because of the to notice of motion by the honourable member for Gwydir, this question cannot be discussed on any other motion, no matter how urgent it may become? This is a question of increasing urgency, and your if I understand it rightly, means that, because the debate on the honourable member for Gwydir's motion has been adjourned to a future date, there can be no chance of raising this question on any other motion, no matter how urgent it may be.",62
429,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The Standing Orders distinctly provide that no discussion anticipating a debate upon a motion on the business-paper shall be allowed. Mz. .JOSEPH COOK - Does the honourable member for Brisbane want the quarantine lifted t,63
430,Mr FINLAYSON,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Certainly .,63
431,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"What I point out is that the Director of Quarantine gave certain advice to the Government, and that the lymph supplied by him was of such a character as to cause great suffering on the part of thousands of people, and also much loss of wages. there is no reference to lymph in the honourable member for Gwydir's motion.",63
432,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Order I Standing order 274 providesNo member shall digress from the subject matter of any auestion under discussion; nor anticipate the discussion of any other subject which appears on the notice-paper. The honourable member for Gwydir's motion deals specifically with the question of vaccination, and alludes to the suffering and sacrifice of human life, and the commercial, industrial, and domestic stagnation resulting from the operation of the laws governing small-pox epidemics.",63
433,Mr FINLAYSON,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The honourable member will have to move the adjournment of the House in order to ' discuss the question.,63
434,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Eve n then the honourable member would not be in order in discussing it .,63
435,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I think that I would be in order, sir, in moving that the House dissent from your ruling.",63
436,Mr SPEAKER,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"The honourable member would be in order in giving notice, writing of his dissent from my ruling , but such a motion could not be discussed until a future date. I should like to that I have no desire, personally, to honourable members in the discussion of these matters, but that I have to adminismove, ter the Standing Orders as they exist, and their own nominee. this particular standing order is very finite. . Mr CONROY - As the Standing Orders with. preclude debate on the subject, I presume that the only course I could have adopted ral matter 1 [60]- z - had the mover of the motion on the business-paper been present-woul d have been to induce him to temporarily withdraw it . Mr SPEAKER.,-That could not be done at the present time, because the honourable member would still have to wait t ill the Orders of the Day were called upon before any' motion for withdrawal or postponement could he made.",63
437,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"I would further point out that it is reported that Dr Cumpston is endeavouring to force the New South Wales Government to introduce into the Parliament of that State a Compulsory Vaccination Bill , and, as a consequence, he is imposing upon that State an altogether'undue stress. A ny legislative body I think ought to be at liberty to f u l ly consider a matter of this character, and this Parliament ought to be the last to endeavour to force vaccination upon the whole of one State. Mr FisHEn - The honourable member's point is that we should not interfere with an independent State.",63
438,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"We ought not, unless we are prepared to take over the whole of the quarantine laws and make them declaratory throughout Australia. The Ministry ought to take care to clip the' wings of this young Health Officer, who has not had the experience of the Health Officer in New South Wales, whom he is endeavouring to rule. I say that he has displayed a lamentable lack of knowledge.. I would not have brought this matter forward were it not for the extreme lack of knowledge which he has exhibited- a lack of knowledge which^ absolutely unfits him for the position which he holds.",63
439,Mr WEST,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,The Minister is also to blame.,63
440,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"We have already been in told that Ministers are guided by the advice of their medical officers. It mnst be recollected that the members of the say Labour party who were responsible for curb Dr Cumpston's appointment would, By voting for the motion which I desired to be passing a vote of censure upon Recognising that defact, I have always striven to make this matter one for the whole House to deal",63
441,Mr SHARPE,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,Shoul d it not be a Fede,63
442,Mr CONROY,REPORTS IN BRISBANE,"Certainly . We have more than one report from medical men absolutely condemnatory of the policy which has been followed, and which has caused an untold amount of suffering. It is time that this Hbuse took, into consideration the question of reimbursement foT the loss which has been sustained. This is a matter which should receive consideration, and I think we might well accept the advice of other medical men who are more competent to deal with this smallpox outbreak than is Dr Cumpston. These men have seen hundreds of cases of smallpox, whereas that young man had probably never seen one until he went to Sydney. The present restrictions seriously interfere with the livelihood of thousands. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.32 p.m.",64
