1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 2.00 p.m., and prayers. NA Child Care",13
2,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Given the minister's frequent declarations of the importhis seat. ance of accreditation to the future development and reform of the child-care sector, will the minister immediately repudiate recommenfront dation 36 of the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, which recommends the removal of Commonwealth accreditation for child-care centres?",13
3,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow minister is of a horse race. quite right; I have made declarations about the importance of the accreditation system the delivery of child care in this country. not resile from that at all, and neither does government. We do support accreditation. have said that consistently. As we outlined our policy in the lead-up to the last election, we said that we would be reviewing the accreditation system. We will take count all of the material available for us in undertaking that process and ensure that there is a very strong accreditation system for the child-care sector in this country.",13
4,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Could the minister inform the House of developments in Zaire, including the announcement by the Tutsi rebels of a unilateral cease-fire? What implications will this have in respect of scope for the international community to extend urgently needed humanitarian relief to the vast numbers of refugees and displaced persons in the region? Mr MCMullan-You might say something are about World Vision, too.",13
5,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would say something well about your speech on aid the other day, but I will leave that to another day. Mr MCMullan-You can talk about it now.",13
6,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will address the question.,13
7,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will not now. I will talk read about Zaire now, but we will fix you up another day. Mr MCMulian- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: all I said was that the budget was the worse budget for aid in history. I do not know why he is objecting to that.",13
8,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will resume,13
9,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the little bit where you said, 'If this comes out I'll get on the page like Gareth would.' Do you remember that bit of your speech? Well, it will be on the front page but it will not be tomorrow because today is the Melbourne Cup and we don't want you to lose publicity because The honourable member for Aston asked a in serious question because he is seriously I do concerned about developments in Zaire. I the know that all Australians are concerned about We developments in Zaire. Even members of the in opposition-those who are sincere and concerned in their approach to politics-would share the concerns of the government and the into acAustralian community about Zaire. The three-week cease-fire, which was declared unilaterally by the alliance of Tutsi rebels, is an encouraging development to the extent that it may, at least temporarily, put an Zaire end to the fighting and may provide international relief agencies with a window of opportunity for access to the hundreds of thousands of refugees stranded in Zaire. One offer of a cease-fire is not a permanent solution, but we welcome any steps that will at least enable aid agencies to take the necessary measures to alleviate the suffering of the refugees caught in the fighting. We hope that Zaire will cooperate in implementing the cease-fire. African regional heads of government, who to meet in Nairobi today, will give consideration to the issue of Zaire. We wish them in this difficult and complicated task. A negotiated settlement by all countries in the region would be by far the best outcome. We remain concerned that Zaire has said it will not participate in any regional talks so long as it believes that Rwanda is supplying arms to the rebels and as long as Rwanda occupies Zairean territory. However, we would strongly encourage Zaire to take a constructive approach to such regional initiatives. I am sure that the honourable member for Aston would be interested to know that I have instructed the Director-General of AusAID, Mr Trevor Kanaley, who is currently in Ethiopia inspecting Australian aid activities, to proceed to Nairobi for discussions with international agency officials coordinating the emergency response to the crisis and I have asked him to report to me on constructive ways in which Australian aid can best be used. I expect the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs to issue a consolidated emergency appeal on behalf of UN agencies as soon as a needs assessment has been completed. The Australian government stands ready to make a contribution to the appeal as soon as possible after that. Unemployment",13
10,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Yesterday the Treasurer told the House that job growth in the September quarter was 0.5 per cent'right on budget target'. But isn't it true according to the ABS, only 13,500 new jobs were created from June to September, a growth rate of just 0.16 per cent? Isn't the reality of the matter that the economy is dead, it is dead flat and that these employment figures of 0.16 per cent employment growth confirm just that?",14
11,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, Mr Speaker, it is not right that the economy is dead flat. That is right; it is not dead flat. Try as they the opposition have not been able to land a blow on the budget or land a blow on this government's economic management, and that is why it was the most popular budget since they started taking polls. Mr Gareth Evans-The man with the cinemascope smirk.",14
12,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would not interject if I were you. You had a bad day yesterday; you will have another one today if you keep that up. Gareth on what happened in the election: 'As far as political massacres go, 1996 was of the low intensity variety. We simply weren't hated or despised in the way some past Labor governments have been.' Well, I would not kid yourself. There are piles of these things. Every time you interject I am going to remind you of them. The fact is that in relation to economic management this was a government that took $70 billion of cumulated deficits and turned it around-$70 billion of cumulated deficits over five years. The Labor Party was a government which mortgaged the futures of Australia's young. It was a government which was prepared to run up debts to buy votes but had no concern about future generations of Australians. It was a government which had mortgaged and put our future in hock. It was a government which had run a current account deficit-the worse in the OECD. And what is the complaint that is now made by the member for Batman? The complaint that is now made by the member for Batman is that unemployment is at-what?-8.7 per cent, after you took it to 11 per cent. These are the people who look around and say, 'Unemployment is only three per cent lower than we peaked at. What a terrible job you're that, doing.' It is like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. When we make housing affordability the best since 1984 he says, 'Oh, that's only the best in 10 years. It could be the best in 20 years.' When mortgage variable rates were the lowest in 20 years he says, 'What are you crowing about? It should be the lowest in 30 years.' The fact is we beat you on every single indicator. These are the people who are defying gravity in their might, economic attacks on the government. The fact is that in relation to economic management we have the conjunction of low inflation and we have wage restraint. These are the matters that will be in the minds of decision makers. These are low inflation, low interest rate, low variable mortgage, high housing affordability and good economic prospects that this government stands for and no wonder the Labor Party hates it!",14
13,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the minister's attention been drawn to the sentence imposed on Wang Dan by the Chinese judicial system? Does the minister agree that the Chinese government needs to examine this case on the basis that Wang Dan's only crime was to be one of the leaders of the pro-democracy movement and Wang Dan had the courage to maintain his commitment to democratic freedoms in China? Was the procedure leading to his conviction and sentence commensurate with due process of law as Australia knows it?,15
14,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question-without notice. I am well aware that on 30 October the Chinese government sentenced Wang Dan to 11 years' imprisonment. Wang Dan is well known for his advocacy, as the honourable member knows, of democratic rights and freedoms. His case has attracted widespread international attention since he was arrested in Beijing in May of last year. Both the previous Australian government and this government have been monitoring the case since Mr Wang came to prominence in 1989, and I am aware that the Parliamentary Amnesty International Group has taken a particular interest in Wang Dan's situation. Mr Bevis-If you know about it, why are you talking about it?",15
15,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So you will learn something about it. The severe sentence and the speed with which the trial was conducted are obviously cause for serious concern. It is well known that the Australian government of both sides has a long standing policy of commitment to human rights and to fundamental freedoms, including freedom of speech and association. During my visit to China I raised Australia's concerns about human rights with China's foreign minister, Mr Qian Qichen, and stressed that Australia, as a - ountry with a long liberal democratic tradi-on, held human rights as an issue of great Importance. Let me just say in conclusion that we clearly have been concerned about the case that the honourable member raised of Mr China Wang Dan. We, naturally enough, are in the process of expressing those concerns to the government of China in Beijing. Moore-Wilton, Mr Max",15
16,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I ask him: if it is not appropriate for Commonwealth departmental heads like Ted Evans to be paid extra remuneration for their membership of bodies like the Reserve Bank, why is it permissible for Mr Max Moore-Wilton, Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to draw an extra salary of more than $50,000 for continuing to chair the board of the Victorian Public Transport Corporation? How can the Prime Minister justify not only the double dipping involved but the potential conflict of Commonwealth and state interest?",15
17,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The situation in relation to Mr Max Moore-Wilton is as follows. When he was approached to accept appointment as the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, he had a number of positions in the private and public sector which gave him an aggregate remuneration significantly above the remuneration that he now receives. He discussed all of those things with me and he put to me, after discussion with the Victorian minister for transport, Mr Brown, the possibility of continuing the part-time chairmanship of the transport authority in Victoria. He explained the circumstances of that. We discussed it. We believed that the potential conflict of interest that could arise from that was minimal. Mr Gareth Evans-COAG?",15
18,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just a moment. If it did arise, he would absent himself. I gave explicit permission for him to continue that until the end of the year when, as a result of restructure, the position will disappear. The remuneration from it is being paid into superannuation because for health reasons he is not able to participate in the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. Frankly, I do not think there is anything at all wrong with it-anything at all-but I take full responsibility for having approved the arrangement. He made a full disclosure of the arrangement to me, and I think the opposition is once again on a futile, nitpicking, electorally irrelevant exercise. Mr GARETH EV ANS-I have a supplementary question. For how many other departmental heads have equally special deals been made? How many of them involve equally obvious conflicts of interest?",15
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question is outside the question that was asked. Mr GARETH EV A NS-It arises from the answer given.,16
20,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is, therefore, outside the guidelines. The question is out of order. Pensioners Entitlements: Deeming",16
21,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs representing the Minister for Social Security. Minister, are you aware of the comparative disadvantage suffered by social security and veterans affairs recipients as a result of the current deeming arrangements? Ms Macklin-That's right; exactly.",16
22,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is my own question. I care about pensioners and blue-collar workers. You fellows don't. Mr Crean-Why did you vote for the change?,16
23,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You do not care about them, do you?",16
24,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will address his question.,16
25,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the light of falling interest rates and the inability of recipients to invest at or above deeming rates, will you agree to review the current five per cent and seven per cent deeming levels?",16
26,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am surprised because I understood the members of the opposition, when they were in government, saw the deeming arrangements as being very beneficial and thought they had developed a system which was well received. I will pick up the specific matters raised by the honourable member for Hinkler. He asked whether I am in a position to review the matter. I have to say I represent the Minister for Social Security in this place, but I do not make the decisions for her. The government does constantly monitor the appropriateness of the extended deeming rates. It assesses them against market rates that a person could reasonably expect to earn in safe investments. A fall or rise in official interest rates would not be the only factor that would be taken into account in deciding whether to change deeming rates. We look at such matters as sustainability. We do not want to cause disruption to pensioners by too frequent changes in the deeming rates themselves. We do look at other factors that influence investments including bank deposits, shares and managed investments. All those matters are taken into account. Obviously, if and when any changes occur, the government would look at it again. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",16
27,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that, when his Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs attended the ministerial council meeting in Darwin on 27 September, he did not state at the meeting or in his press release that he was representing another minister, nor did he declare his interest in the petrol industry when temperature correction was considered. He specifically referred to the cost to consumers and to retailers of the measure if it were to be introduced. How can the Prime Minister continue to defend a minister who has retained his directorship and control of a company operating in his area of responsibility and who has taken decisions which have a direct impact on that company?",16
28,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can I say to the member for Hotham I will never represent to this House that I read every press release that is issued. Mr Crean-Will you do it now?,16
29,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will I do it now? I will tell the member for Hotham what I will do: I will go and have a look at what he has said and I will go and have a look at the record. If I believe there are any reasons to cause me to revise the view I have previously expressed to the House, I will come back and tell him. I do not think he will be hearing from me. Doctors: Hospital Vacancies",16
30,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of reports that there are very significant numbers of public hospital medical positions filled by overseas trained doctors because Australian trained doctors do not want them? Is there any substance to the claims that well paid public hospital positions are dead-end jobs?,17
31,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of reports. It is staggering that in two states alone-New South Wales and Queenslandthere are 365 unfilled hospital positions. Many of these are very good positions paying up to $75,000 a year, so I was rather surprised to see them represented as dead-end jobs by young doctors. I think young doctors need a bit of a reality check, given that most honourable members in this place would represent electorates with average incomes of about $30,000 a year. What it puts lie to is the claim that there are going to be hundreds of young doctors who have no prospect of practising medicine. In fact, I have checked the number of specialty training positions and general practice training positions as best I can. There are 400 training positions next year in general practice; 125 in anaesthetics; 21 in intensive care; 25 in obstetrics and gynaecology; 93 in psychiatry; 22 in ophthalmology; six in dermatology; 35 in radiology; 260 physicians; 54, general surgery; 10, cardio-thoracic surgery; 11, neurosurgery; four, paediatrics; six, plastic and reconstructive; 20, urology; 29, orthopaedics; and nine, laryngology. That makes 1,102 training positions. That does not count emergency medicine, occupational medicine, paediatrics, rehabilitation medicine, medical administration, radiotherapy or pathology. When you add all those together and the other places that become available in speciality areas and general practice, the simple fact is that there are more jobs than there are doctors in training positions. The only reason a young doctor needs miss out on a training position is that he or she cannot be bothered to be fully trained. The fact is that for too long general practice has been a dumping ground for the medical profession. Bob Douglas of the ANU showed last year that a third of general practitioners would leave the profession tomorrow if there was something else they could do. Peter Baume, in a report last year, showed that general practice had been progressively deskilled over 20 years. It is time that general practice was given the status, the training and the backup that it deserves. In the end, this is incredibly in the public interest. General practice is the basic primary health care in Australia, and to have it detached, deskilled and disillusioned is a tragedy for Australia. I understand the changes put some obligations on young doctors. I understand that it is a change from what they expected. But, without this measure and without the limiting of overseas trained doctors, the fact is that general practice would have no future whatsoever. Prescribed Payments Scheme",17
32,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How can the Treasurer have confidence in the integrity of the prescribed payments scheme, as he stated on 17 October, when the Taxation Office refunds 25 per cent of collections and does not reconcile payments made against income tax returns?",17
33,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because it works well for those industries that are covered, and it is a much preferable system to the non-existent prescribed payments system which otherwise would operate. As I said to the member for Moore when he last asked me this question, that does not mean that you should not keep under review the operation of the tax system. We always do. If the member for Moore has any instances where he considers that the prescribed payments system is falling down, I would be only too happy to refer them to the Commissioner of Taxation. I am sure the commissioner would take all steps necessary to ensure that proper revenue is collected. Sri Lanka Mr Bradford- Mr SPEAKER Mr Leo MCLeay-Give the colonel a go.",17
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the member for MCPherson. Opposition members-Hooray!,18
35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! He was first out of the blocks.,18
36,Mr BRADFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I generally am, Mr Speaker. My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is an important question which all members will be interested in. What is the Australian government's position on the situation in Sri Lanka? What can Australia do to promote a peaceful solution to the problem there?",18
37,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I just say to the honourable member, who I know is concerned about this situation in Sri Lanka, that the Australian government is concerned about the tragic suffering of civilians in that country. The intensified conflict in the north has displaced thousands of people, and the bombings this year, allegedly by the LTTE, in Jaffna and Colombo killed or injured hundreds of civilians on all sides. Clearly, the conflict is primarily one for the main participants in Sri Lanka to resolve, but we are taking every opportunity in our contacts with the Sri Lankan government to encourage progress towards a peaceful resolution and to add Australia's voice to calls to all parties involved to look for and negotiate its settlement. We would see some value in third party mediation or good offices in the conflict, provided that such mediation was acceptable to both the Sri Lankan government and the L TTE and that both sides were willing to engage in genuine negotiations. The present environment in Sri Lanka appears not to be conducive to constructive negotiations of that kind to be mediated by some third party. Let me just say in conclusion that on the humanitarian situation Australia has provided substantial emergency assistance to large numbers of people displaced by the conflict in the north of Sri Lanka and has allocated $4.2 million to relief purposes in 1996-97. I also want to say-I think that the honourable member would be interested to know-that we frequently get requests for a meeting with me from representatives of the Sri Lankan Tamil community. I want to make it clear to the House that my position is that I will not see Tamil groups in Australia unless they indicate to me in writing that they condemn the terrorist activities of the LTTE. Given this government's strong and principled position on terrorism and political violence, I am sure that the honourable member would well and truly understand this position. Ships Bounty",18
38,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is not directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs; it is actually directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of a response to a survey on the impact of the ships bounty abolition? Is he aware that Western Australian manufacturer Austal Ships statedDr Southcott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: understanding order 144, questions cannot relate to a subject that is an order of the day, and you will notice that the bounty legislation amendment is due to be debated today.",18
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will hear the question in full.,18
40,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is he aware that Western - ustralian manufacturer Austal Ships stated In a survey: We have lost the opportunity with Stena Line (a major European operator) for two vessels and an option for two more with a total value of around $225 million. Stena advises our vessels are now too expensive and they will proceed with the purchase in Europe. In light of this, will he request that the cabinet employment committee urgently review the ships bounty decision? Can the Prime Minister look any of the workers at Austal in the eye and tell them that this decision meets his jobs test 'to increase economic growth and thereby increase jobs for Australians'?",18
41,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question, whilst detailed and complex, is in order.",18
42,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer is that I have not read that particular report, but I do not doubt the honourable gentleman quotes accurately what the person in question said. It is inevitable when you bring down a budget that takes certain concessions away and takes certain payments away that those affected will complain. It is inevitable that they will be critical of it. The overall benefit of the budget is apparent to the Australian community. It has been widely applauded. If you want to look the workers of Australia in the eye or, better still, you want to re-engage the attention of the workers of Australia, because their eyes have drifted away from you now for many months-they drifted away from you in big leaps on 2 March and you tried to get them in your sights again; you ran around and you tried to stop them-you went out to the electorate of Lindsay and tried stopping them in the streets saying, 'Please look me in the eye and say you still love the Labor Party,' but it failed completely. You learnt a very simple lesson. It really could not have been put better than in a very interesting letter I read today in the Sydney Morning Herald. It really does sum up the dilemma that the Australian Labor Party faces. The correspondent, amongst other things, had this to say: What the public is also indicating is that it is heartily tiredMr Latham-Why not quote Fraser. We don't hear you quoting Malcolm.",18
43,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will start again. It says: What the public is also indicating is that it is heartily tired of the intellectual bullying of those Who wish to question aspects of certain policies by several, largely self-appointed, political elites in our community which seem determined to have us toe the line on what they state to be politically correct. If the ordinary people were listened to for a changeMr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under standing order 145, What has this got to do with jobs for shipyard Workers in Western Australia whose jobs have been put at risk by this man breaching his ?wn employment test? i Mr SPEAKER-Order! The Prime Minister is addressing the question.",19
44,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is what the workers of Australia are saying everywhere. That is why you are over there, and that is why you will remain there. I will start the last paragraph again: If the ordinary people were listened to for a change and their uneasiness on many current issues patiently and constructively discussed with them, then the disturbing direction of the political debateMr Griffin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is all very interesting in the Prime Minister's own mind, but the fact of the matter is that I asked a question regarding the shipping industry in Western Australia. I do not recall mentioning the Sydney Morning Herald or anything that Bill Hayden may have said with respect to anything.",19
45,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Bill Hayden? Is it? It really is!,19
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I listened to your question very carefully. It was detailed, complex and wide ranging, as is the Prime Minister's answer.",19
47,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know you do not like it. You talked about the concern of workers in Western Australia. He is talking about the concern of workers all over Australia. And you do not like it, do you?",19
48,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I, too, represent an electorate with a shipbuilding company. The Prime Minister is not addressing the fundamental question of whether that decision, which is seeing employees sacked and ship orders being abandoned, is going to be reviewed.",19
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We are not going to debate the issue. There is no point of order. Resume your seat!,19
50,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It reads: If the ordinary people were listened to for a change and their uneasiness on many current issues patiently and constructively discussed with them, then the disturbing direction that the political debate is taking may be arrested. The letter is signed by Bill Hayden, Brisbane, Queensland. I assume that that is the same Bill Hayden who is the former member bar one for the federal division of Oxley, the former member of the Australian Labor Party and the former Governor General of Australia-and I reckon somebody who knows more about the ordinary people of Australia than most of you opposite. Green and Gold Logo",19
51,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Why has the government abandoned the 'Australian made' green and gold logo?,20
52,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has not abandoned the logo. Many of you will know that the Advance Australia Foundation, the sole licensing agent for the 'Australian made' logo, went into voluntary liquidation after receiving advice from its auditors. The current licensees continue to use the logo. Their licences have been extended until new arrangements are in place. I am pleased to say that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has established a working group which is now developing new rules for the logo's use with reduced red tape and reduced costs. In the meantime, and in the absence of a licensing agent, the government is not in a position to license any new products, and we are sorry for any inconvenience that has been caused. But I am confident that the new arrangements for the logo's use will protect the integrity of the logo while it will be made more accessible to industry and small business in particular. The logo will be around for Christmas. Research and Development",20
53,Mr HOLDING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement last week when he said that his government would: ... ask of every policy initiative and every change the question: would it contribute to a generation jobs? Is the Prime Minister aware that Laser Lab, a Melbourne based manufacturer and exporter employing around 50 people, has said of the R&D cuts and related decisions: We are now in a position where we must seriously question the future viability of continuing to manufacture in Australia. We have available manufacturing capability in both our USA and our UK businesses. In view of the Prime Minister's regard for the integrity of his own statements, will the Prime Minister assure the workers of Laser Lab that the unemployment committee of cabinet will apply his jobs test to the decision that has been taken in relation to Laser Lab?",20
54,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports knows, that particular R&D decision was part of a fiscal consolidation strategy which has produced a budget which has been received throughout the communityMr Tanner-Give us another burst on political correctness.",20
55,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Much as I know the Australian Labor Party does not like it, the more they interrupt and the more they growl and complain at question time, the more they proclaim their sensitivity at the positive reaction that the first Costello budget received. I know you do not like it. I simply say to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and all other questioners who have gone before him or who are to come after him as part of a pattern of opposition questions on this issue that of course it was part of an overall budget strategy. That budget strategy was designed to reduce the very big budget deficit you irresponsibly left us. Having lied to the Australian people about the size of the deficit, you left us with your mess that we-have had the guts and responsibility to clean up. Nobody opposite should imagine that anybody out there is listening to the nerve and the gall of the group of people who in 13 years gave us the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression. They now of presume to lecture us about levels of unemployment. They did not listen to you on 2 March and they did not listen to you on 19 October in the Lindsay by-election. You need to show a little bit of contrition and actually summon the ordinary understanding that the Australian people respect and go to them and say, 'Okay, we admit we got a lot of things wrong; we admit we governed badly.' You still think you governed well. That is part of your problem. I keep reading comments made by the Acting Leader of the Opposition. He said that one of the first lessons of opposition is to maintain that everything you did in government was right. I hope you stick to that doctrine because you will be there for a long, long time if you maintain that proposition. You know that that was part of a deficit reduction strategy forced upon a reluctant government because of the fiscal mess we inherited. In the long run the deficit reduction strategy of the August budget will lay the basis of strong employment growth in Australia. Census: Carers",20
56,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Having regard to the fact that there was no provision in the 1996 census form for the contribution of carers to be calculated, and considering the significant contribution made by carers in Australia, can the Treasurer advise the House as to whether the government will consider including in the next national census specific provision for carers who unselfishly contribute not only to their families but in very real terms to the economy of this nation?",21
57,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question and for her interest in carers. There is no doubt that carers in this country make a significant contribution not only to their own families but to Australia as a whole. While the ABS has not collected information on carers in censuses in the past, it does provide a wide range of statistical information on carers to assist and encourage informed decision making. It conducts regular five-year surveys of persons with disabilities, the aged and their carers. The next survey is scheduled for 1998. It also conducts three-year childcare surveys to collect a range of information on the care of children, both inside and outside the home. The latest was conducted earlier this year. It also has a regular time survey to obtain information on time spent on family, caring and voluntary work. The next survey on that will be undertaken in 1997. ; I have been asked by the member for Hughes whether we will consider including in the next census specific provision for carers. I can inform her that the ABS has already commenced initial discussions with users on their needs for the 2001 census. As part of that dialogue, an assessment will be made whether there are additional data needs on carers that cannot be obtained from the existing surveys. If this turns out to be the case, consideration of her suggestion will be given to collecting information on carers in the 2001 survey. Cooked Chicken Meat",21
58,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Does the minister recall prior to the election giving an unequivocal written undertaking that a coalition government would take no action on the importation of cooked children meat until the Nairn review had been completed and, to use your words, 'its recommendations acted on in full'? Do you still stand by this election promise? Are you aware of an AAP report last Friday that you plan to allow the importation of cooked chicken meat because the government is tied to a decision made by the former Labor government? What is the basis of that claim?",21
59,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This question has come up and been canvassed in this place before. The member, very interestingly, has an MPI listed for today, during which we will explore these matters at greater length. In essence, this is a process put in train by the previous government. Advice was tendered to the previous government in May 1995 that the science had been completed after many years of consideration for one aspect of a very wide range of import requirements relating to chicken meat. I can see the previous Minister for Trade watching. He knows the background and, unlike some of his colleagues, understands it. The recommendation was noted by the then minister and it was then to proceed. But they use did absolutely nothing about it, unlike us, where we have a technical working group and an adjustment group considering the matter. They will report in short order. Their considerations will be taken on board and worked through by the government. In essence, of course, by your non-action, having made a decision, you were exposing Australia, and the Director of Quarantine specifically, to the possibility of legal action both domestically and internationally. And, as I have explained in this place before quite simply and quite succinctly, the situation was that I discovered on coming into government that not only had the decision effectively been madeOpposition members-No, no, no!",21
60,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it had. Oh yes, it had. You have a look at the words that your former minister uses-the weasel words that he uses. He skirts around this very cleverly, but it does not stand up. The principle that I established was that we wanted to know whether independent scientific reviews ticked off on the science. We found that, in the case of this one, exhaustively that had been done. On that basis, I find it very hard to find any intellectual reason for reversing the process that you in government set in place. Having said that, I make it quite plain that the commitment we gave that the findings of the N aim review would be taken into full account for quarantine access requirements stands. Mr O'Keefe- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the letter that the minister wrote to the President of the Chickengrowers Association in which he gave those undertakings which have now been broken. Leave not granted. National Debt",22
61,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen a report in today's Melbourne Age which shows that the federal debt has worsened to $101 billion? What effect will this have on the people of Deakin? Can the Treasurer indicate what effect the government's budget strategy will have on reversing this trend?,22
62,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. On Monday, the ABS released data on public sector financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 1996. Over the year to June, Commonwealth government-general government net debt rose by $10 billion to $93 billion. That was the Labor Party performance-to triple Commonwealth general debt over three years, with underlying deficits over five years of $70 billion. You hear some of these Labor Party members saying, 'Well, what's going to happen to small business in relation to this budget measure?' What would be the future of any small business in a country hocked to the hilt where the government had to raise taxes to pay off your burdensome debt? What would be the future for young people in Australia if we told them that they had to pay taxes not for their health care but for this generation'S health care? What would be the situation if we said to the young people of tomorrow that this was a government which after five years, although it had told the Australian people that it had balanced the accounts, was running a deficit of $10,000 million? They were out by $10,000 million! Right throughout the election campaign the people of Australia were being told that the accounts were balanced. They were wrong by $10,000 million. And total Commonwealth net debt rose $8 billion to $10 I billion. What that means, as the member for Deakin will know, is that servicing debt in this country now ranks with our expenditure on education. Servicing past debt ranks with our expenditure on education. It ranks with our defence budget. It is one of the large items built into the Commonwealth accounts from which there is no escape: Labor's legacy to future Australians. The great thing to be able to say to the member for Deakin is that, because this is a government that had the strategy, a government that had the courage to sit down and do it over three years time, notwithstanding sabotage from Labor, we will be in a position to balance the accounts and stop that debt escalating. We would like to be in a position in this term to start paying that debt back. In our budget strategy we will at least be able by the end of this particular term to stop increasing that debt. We will at least be able to free young Australians from the legacy of deficit and debt, the legacy of intergenerational financial abuse in which Labor left this country. We will be able to give them a brighter hope and a brighter future. To the Labor Party we say this: it was bad enough that you failed in government. Do not sabotage us when we rescue the Australian economy from the errors that you made. It was bad enough to put us in this situation. Now that this government has the strategy to get us out, do not sabotage it. Do not hold that budget to ransom. Give future Australians a future and a hope. Cooked Chicken Meat",22
63,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I ask you, Minister, in light of the unanimous decision of the all-party Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Committee with respect to the importation of cooked chicken meat, will youMr Downer-You are half the man your father was. Mr Latham-Did you hear that, Mr Speaker? Mrs Crosio-Did you hear what he said? It is a disgrace. Mr o 'Keefe-That should be withdrawn.",23
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Hunter will resume his seat for a moment. There is too much chat across the benches. The honourable member for Hunter should begin his question again.,23
65,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. In light of the unanimous recommendations of the all-party Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Committee with respect to the importation of cooked chicken meat, will you now reconsider your position on the issue? How do you explain the conflict between your own position and that of your coalition colleagues on the committee? Will you now make an absolute commitment to keep your pre-election promise on this issue?",23
66,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Let me, at the outset, make the point that, interestingly , enough, they want to move away from some of the intellectual rigour that they put in On the basis of Australia pursuing enlightened self-interest in trade matters. They did it because, in net terms, the Australian economy in general and the rural sector in particular would benefit.",23
67,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Scrounging around, making promises which you are now backing away from.",23
68,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it was done with coalition support and it was done with the support of the farm community and farm leaders. Let me make a couple of other points. The first thing is that the general approach was, in fact, supported by that excellent work done by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee which said: The committee recognises that ministerial or government decisions must be consistent with the provisions of the agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures. And it goes on. But they are not the only people who agree with the broad approach. Mr Speaker, I would like to table a rather interesting letter from the shadow minister who has put down the MPI for today, Mr O'Keefe, in which he says, in part: I noticed reported commentsMr Tanner-But you will not table your letter! You will not let us table your letter.",23
69,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just a minute. I hope that all members will listen carefully to this. This letter is from the shadow minister who is moving the matter of public importance against me. It states: John, I notice reported comments in the press today about chicken meat imports. Refer to my comments on Thursday in Main Committee supporting decision. Thank you very much. I table a copy of the letter. Mr o 'Keefe-You know that is not right. You know the note was not about this. It was about",23
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Burke will resume his seat. Frequent Flyer Points,23
71,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed place to the Minister for Administrative Services. Has the minister seen reports attributed last weekend to the shadow minister in relation to the parliamentary use of frequent flyer points? Are those claims valid and will the minister please reiterate for the benefit of all in this House the guidelines which he issued several months ago?,23
72,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the government policy that frequent flyer points accrued by senators and members in the course of official travel should be used to meet the cost of further official travel. Senators and members were requested to notify my department of the of the points so that accurate records could maintained. It is correct that no senator member has formally notified the department that he or she has redeemed frequent flyer points since the introduction of the policy. wrote to all senators and members in July advising them of the new procedures on the use of frequent flyer points. The fact that department has not been formally notified of the use of the points suggests that some senators and members and their staff may not be aware of that requirement. So I am writing again to all senators and members to remind them of the procedures for using points and the importance of reporting their use to the department. The government believes it is not acceptof able to Australians that parliamentarians, any others whose travel is paid for from public purse, should obtain personal perks through doing their job. That is why the policy was introduced. Gun Control Advertising Contract",24
73,Mr MOSSFIELD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also Minister addressed to the Minister for Administrative Services. Did the Prime Minister's Chief Political Adviser, Grahame Morris, consult him before he wrote to the Assistant General Manager of OGIA, Ms Cathi Moore, telling her that DDB Needham Adelaide should be on the original list of propositions to be examined for the gun control advertising contract, because there is no doubt in some ministers' minds that this is the benchmark for the communication program? Which minister was Mr Morris referring to, if he did not consult with the Prime Minister or Attorney-General? If Mr Morris was not referring to him as the minister responsible for OGIA, why wasn'the consulted before Mr Morris instructed OGIA as he did?",24
74,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have been waiting for about three weeks for a question on this particular contract. I am absolutely amazed that I have not received one as yet. The suggestion by Mr Grahame Morris was simply that, because of the interest that had been shown in the DDB Needham proposition for that campaign, maybe they should be considered. That was all that was there. I remind you that the short use list of people who decided that panel of be advertising agencies consisted of officials or from OGIA, the Attorney-General's Department, the Commonwealth law enforcement agency and representatives from the Prime I Minister's office in the form of Mr Morris and the office of the Attorney-General. A member of my office, Penny Farnsworth, was my present but she was not a member of that panel and she did not vote or express a view. So, while Mr Morris may have made the suggestion, the fact is that the short list of three was agreed to by a full assessment panel. No member of that panel voiced any objection or expressed any concern about the short list. I think it is absolutely amazing that in the Senate we have had these accusations a political fix to look after mates. It is or absolutely amazing that we must be so hard the up to look after our mates that we meet in committee from 5.30 in the afternoon until 10 past midnight. We must be so stupid that we invite the New South Wales Labor Minister for Police to come along and have a vote, and we ask the. Australian Capital Territory for Police to come along and have a vote. If you reckon we are trying to rig under those circumstances, frankly, you're a bigger pack of dills than I ever took you for. Literacy and Numeracy",24
75,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I remind the ministerMr Martin Ferguson-You will not see the Cup when he gets up there.",24
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Batman is delaying events.,24
77,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind the minister that there are those in the community who claim that, if young children are not up to speed on literacy and numeracy by the time they are aged seven or finished grade 3, they will be in big trouble for completing their schooling. Can the minister confirm that there is any veracity in these statements?",24
78,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for his question. Mr MCGauran-He's been doped!,25
79,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Oh! They are under starter's orders. You had better hurry!,25

84,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Thank you.,25
85,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You took the water! Bronwyn would not take the water. You are in Cabinet now. You have passed the water test.,25
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I am not planning to take a swab, so just relax.",25
87,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know whether it is because it is the Melbourne Cup today, but I am feeling a little hoarse, as members can tell. I thank the member for La Trobe very much for his question. He is of course right: unless the literacy issue can be properly addressed in the early years of schooling, it is very difficult to correct the literacy difficuloperators ties of students later on. That is why the government has introduced a new literacy goal that every child should be able to read, write, spell and communicate by the end of primary school. It is also why we have introduced, and will be introducing with the states and territories, national standards for years 3 and 5 in primary school which will meet the needs of students in those early years. Members of the House would be particularly interested to know that over the next four years the government will be putting some -635 million into literacy programs. That will lllclude specific targeted programs aimed at these early years of schooling. The expert evidence certainly does confirm what the member for La Trobe has said. He is quite right on that point according to all the information that the government has. We will be doing everything in our power to make sure that students in these early years get the attention which students failed to get during the previous 13 years. It is evident that there has not been a single question on this matter from the shadow minister for education. He has completely failed to leave the starting gate. You cannot get him out of the starting gate. I thought today they might get him up on this issue, but they could not even manage it then, when I was feeling a little hoarse. So we have had to have this question asked from our own side. Rockhampton Airport",25
88,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. In recent weeks the Mayor of Rockhampton, Councillor Lea Taylor, and I have made representations seeking support for the airport project at Rockhampton to lengthen the runway to an international length. Could the minister indicate his support for the project and what sort of support the council may achieve?",25
89,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for his question. I have been advised to make it brief, and I shall endeavour to do so. The honourable member for Capricornia recently brought a group from his electorate representing the owners and of Rockhampton Airport, and this was one of a number of representations made by the honourable member for Capricornia in an attempt-his never ending attempt-to get a very good deal for his own electorate. I congratulate the owners and operators of Rockhampton Airport for the proposal they have to extend the runway in two stages, the first stage of which they can fully fund from their own arrangements. I also take note of the fact that this is a model example of what can be achieved by a well managed local organisation. They have developed the business over a number of years. Having developed the business and proven that they can service it, they now propose to extend it. The Commonwealth government in return will do everything that it can to assist Rockhampton Airport owners and operators to ensure they can fulfil the extension of their runway and further grow the business of that airport and further add to the economic opportunities and jobs that can be created from this runway extension. I take this opportunity to congratulate the honourable member for Capricornia on his representation in this area. I can confirm that the Commonwealth government will do everything it can to help.",25

I have to say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in all my time in this parliament that is the first time. I have ever seen anybody use for debate a personal note that has transpired in the chamber between one member and another.",26
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The member shall get to where he has been misrepresented.,27
100,Mr OKEEFE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am getting to my explanation, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I am pretty unhappy, as you can gather. He used that note to create the impression that I had somehow given you a note saying that I was in support of what you are now doing with imported chicken meat.",27
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I am doing nothing with imported chicken meat.,27
102,Mr OKEEFE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I'm sorry. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I wrote that note in the context of another debate in the second chamber when members of his team were protesting about any opening of trade barriers and he was starting to enter this debate. I wrote to him saying that we supported the opening of trade and it was in the context of the position you quoted to the world that you were going to follow. It was before you broke these undertakings that you gave, and it is a total misrepresentation to suggest what you did. NA Cooked Chicken Meat",27
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The threat to primary industry and the jobs of thousands of Australians from the failure of the government to give proper consideration to quarantine issues as evidenced by the government's handling of the planned importation of cooked chicken meat in breach of its election commitments. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",27
104,Mr OKEEFE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"People working in agricultural industries in Australia dependent on very strong quarantine protocols have reason to be concerned about the early performance of the Howard government and the performance of the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in its first few months. It is not just about imported cooked chicken meat. It is a very real question of quarantine issues across a range of products, and producers are now starting to come forward. I include salmon producers from Tasmania, who are becoming concerned, apple producers, and pear producers, who are threatened by the risk of fire blight disease from New Zealand. The minister's performance at question time today only serves to heighten those concerns. The minister's answers were, I think, very slippery indeed. It has been my experience that when ministers resort to answers that are slippery it is because their actions are suspect. What are our suspicions? The first thing that has happened is that the minister has very clearly reneged on an unequivocal coalition undertaking and promise in this area. He wrote in February of this year, when he was the shadow minister, to the President of the Mangrove Mountain Districts Community Group. This is a letter I sought leave to table during question time today and leave was denied. What did you have to hide? Now I have to read it in here. It is a letter in which the minister, when he was the shadow minister, very clearly said: A Coalition Government will suspend the approval of all proposed new import protocols, including the one for salmonid products, until such time as the scientific review has been completed and its recommendations acted upon in full. That was a very clear undertaking and it is now being breached. He has been caught out not only by us but also by his coalition partners. I am sure he was very uncomfortable as he watched the 7.30 Report last Wednesday night on the ABC when it was covered, in particular when Ray Moynihan raised the question. He said: . .. at a private Liberal Party meeting in early October, the Prime Minister indicated that any decision on chicken meat would come to Cabinet. The PM's comments highlight just how sensitive an issue this is for a government dependent on a large rural constituency. And they could signify a major change in quarantine policy, moving decision-making from AQIS firmly into the political arena. He further went on to say: The Prime Minister has told a private party room meeting that any decision on chicken meat will have to get Cabinet approval. They have taken it out of your hands. That is what has happened. Even the Liberal Party has become pretty concerned about the way you have been handling this matter. It goes further than this. In question time today, he tried to pass it off on us. He made the claim, as he was reported to have done by AAP on Friday last week, that he was moving in this direction because the previous Labor minister had already taken the decision. Today, he tried again to create the impression that former Minister Collins had already taken the decision. But, of course, we know what happened: the minister saw the report and noted it. Anyone, particularly in this place, who has been in these positions knows very well that there is one hell of a difference between noting a report and taking a decision to implement its recommendations. To stand up there and portray that the minister had already taken the decision-and that is why you are breaching your undertakings-is trying to slide around a broken promise. That is what we are talking about here. To do what you did to me today-to misrepresent my position, to bring in a personal note I wrote to you, which I dealt with a little earlier-simply underlines the fact that you are getting desperate. Your coalition partners are concerned about your handling of this matter and you are resorting to tactics. While the Prime Minister claims to be looking for high standards from his ministers, he will probably have a word to you about this at another point. Mr Martin-I wouldn't hold your breath.",27
105,Mr OKEEFE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, we will not hold our breath. That note was written in the context of what we assumed was the process of what was going to be happening-and also a process, I might say, which has been fully supported in the Senate committee findings that have just been tabled in the Senate. It is a unanimous report. It is supported by both sides of the House. So it is not as though we on this side of the House were trying to suddenly prevent putting in place some barriers to trade, trying to popularise ourselves with your constituency by saying that we were going to oppose these measuresMr MCMullan-As you did.",28
106,Mr OKEEFE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As they did in opposition. We have been absolutely straight with all constituencies about our position on this, including our position in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. It is a unanimous report. Both sides have supported the recommendations. A very interesting point is made in the overview, particularly in relation to imported chicken meat, and I think it would do the minister well to study and understand it. You are treading on very dangerous ground, and I will go into this in a minute. The decisions that you take and are taking at the moment are very important decisions not just for the chicken meat industry, not just for other agricultural producers and the people who work in value adding and rely on the markets but also for Australia's international clean green image as a food supplier. The decisions you take are important decisions that have to be strongly based. The committee report says, and I suspect they must have understood what was likely to happen: The Committee fully understands that any breakdown of the cooking and certification process will not necessarily result in disease outbreaks. However, the Committee believes AQIS's reputation will be irretrievably damaged if IBDthat is, infectious bursal diseaseorNDthat is, newcastle diseaseenter the country via a cooked chicken meat importation under its control. I repeat: the committee believes AQIS's reputation-that is, Australia's reputationwill be irretrievably damaged if you get this wrong. You are heading down the path of getting it very wrong. We are party to recommendations that support the WTO process on trade. We are party to section 2.12 of that report under international obligations where we outline that 'quarantine decisions must have a sound scientific and technical basis'. We are not arguing that you put up quarantine as artificial trade barriers; we are arguing that it has to have a sound scientific and technical basis. The report says that they have to: . . . flow from a proper process of risk assessment; AQIS must adopt a consistent approach to risk management, that is, not arbitrarily adjust the acceptable level of risk from case to case; We accept that. It continues: access decisions must be designed to achieve the determined level of risk in the least trade restrictive way; and the decision making process must be transparent and open. We accept that right across our front-bench. Our shadow minister for trade, Mr Smith, has been very strongly arguing these points to me-even in the last 24 hours-as has our shadow minister for primary industries. There is a commitment on our side. There is an understanding of that commitment. That is why your behaviour today was way beyond the pale and reflects the actions of someone who is getting pretty desperate. Minister, we are becoming concerned that what could have been and should have been a bipartisan follow-through of a process that we set in motion and supported has now changed because of widespread concerns about your actions. Just as the Senate committee and I have said-I refer to your comments on the 7.30 Report relating to risk-you said that Australia cannot have a zero risk quarantine policy. We agree. We have never said anything different. But the obligation lies with you to start outlining what is the acceptable level of risk. We are seeing, Minister, in a number of these issues that even the science is not clear and defined. When asking about the acceptable level of risk, or what is the risk factor, you can have a situation where AQIS says that there is an unlikely risk of an importation that could cause disease among an Australian product that does not have that disease at the moment and science saying that the risk is inconclusive. Experience says that if AQIS says it is unlikely and science says it is inconclusive then you have got to take a pretty cautious approach to it. Whatever the risk, it is unacceptable for you to not give guarantees that are very strong for Australian producers . Mr Crean-Especially if you break promises.",28
107,Mr OKEEFE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am coming to the point that is raised by the member for Hotham. When you wrote that letter to the Mangrove Mountain Districts Community Group and gave that undertaking that no changes would occur until such time as the scientific review was completed and its recommendations were acted upon in full, you did not know two things. You did not know that if and when you became minister you would move to break those undertakings-you now haveand you also did not know that your parliamentary secretary would rat on you. You got up here today and tried to purport that the previous Labor minister took the decision and that you are effectively carrying it through. Mr Miles, in his letter to the same President of the Mangrove Mountain Districts Community Group-they have both of themsays: The previous Government had received a final report from AQIS . . . The former Minister for Primary Industry had noted the report, but it was not legislated. So we have a situation where you are out there trying to cover up an activity in which you have broken a promise. The Liberal Party is taking it out of your hands. You have come in here at question time and have tried to dog it off with a pretty low-level little strategythe previous Labor minister really took the decision. All the time, you are avoiding the constituents who want to know whether you are going to put their industries at risk. You are avoiding those millions of people who are potentially in the market for Australia's clean green agriculture built upon a determined activity by the previous Labor government to ensure that our quarantine standards had the highest integrity and were known throughout the world to have the highest integrity. I say that this MPI ought to be supported and is condemnatory of you.",29
108,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am very glad to be able to rise to speak on what amounts to a matter of very great national importance. I notice the ex-Minister for Trade leaving, because he does not want to answer the very simple question: is it the case that legislation is required to allow chicken meat in? Is it the case that the minister allows cooked chicken meat in? Or is it the case that, under the legislation that you set up, the director of quarantine makes the decision? That is the way that it works. Mr Fitzgibbon-And you should tell your parliamentary secretary that.",30
109,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Ah! You do not deny my point. Thank you very much. Now we know where you stand, you great champion of rural Australia and its needs from the Hunter Valley-just like your old man. You will run the populist line every time without doing your homework, and that is why, in direct contrast to what the farm groups in this country would urge you to do if they were aware of your position, you urge us to renege on our obligations under GATT. No doubt you will be speaking next, and you can trot out your answer and say that it is highly qualified, but I reckon that is pretty simple language. I just make this point: what we have heard from the shadow minister at the table is the same trick of saying, 'No, the minister did not sign off it,' but we are hearing from the exminister himself when he knows full well that that is not the issue. The way they set up the legislation-with our support; it has not been changed-is that AQIS does the technical risk assessment work and the director makes a decision. That then goes to the minister. All the minister does is note it. He did not annotate it. He noted it. He signed it. His responsiit bility then-and the responsibility that I had from its being on my desk, because of the way in which the process had proceeded well down the road-is to satisfy himself that the process has been done properly. Again, there is no evidence that the previous minister took any action in that regard at all. Mr Lee-You fell for it; that's your problem.",30
110,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I fell for your policy, did I? Your policy was not sound; it was a trap, it was trickery, was it? Mr Lee-It was signed by AQIS.",30
111,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was your minister who signed off. That is what you do not seem to understand. It is a great shame that the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) has sought to politicise this debate. I intend to answer the political points. I begin by saying that it is typical of the utter gall of this mob to try to imply that we are lowering Australia's quarantine standards. It was us who pushed you so hard to conduct a full independent scientific inquiry into AQIS. Your then minister held out for as long as he possibly could. He finally did it. But it was as a result of the pressure that we brought to bear, along with industry, that you finally put together Professor Malcolm Nairn's inquiry. We, in government, as one of my first actions, moved to expand its evaluative capacity, and it is about to report. Like the government of the day, like the opposition at the time, like the Senate inquiry, like the farm groups in this country, anybody should look at it objectively and away from the sort of hypocrisy that is reflected in this MPIbecause that is what it is. You thoroughly deserve to be revealed. I need not have quoted your letter. I could have gone to the Hansard. You go and read the Hansard of the Main Committee. It makes it quite plain that you were effectively saying up there, 'So you now support our process. You are now recognising it is the right process and you want to continue it.' That is what you were saying. You cannot escape the obvious conclusion, the only conclusion, that can be drawn from the letter that you sent to me. You asked for with this utter hypocrisy. What is more-it is not just hypocrisy-it reflects an extraordinary lack of research and understanding. No wonder your former Minister for Trade has left the chamber, because he knows how far off the mark you are, what weasel words certain people on your side are using in relation to this matter. If anybody cares to have a look at the record, the fact is that you have come badly unstuck, you have been exposed. It is as simple as that. Let us come to this very fundamentally important issue for the industries of rural and regional Australia and, since you raised it, the employment of Australians in those regions. There is only one member for regional Australia here from your side-just one. The people from the regions understand quite clearly that you are no good for living standards and jobs in those areas. Mr O'Keefe-What about me?",30
112,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As a matter of interest, you have benefited very nicely under our enlightened and better policy approach to forests. You have benefited quite nicely. There will be some extra jobs in your electorate just to showMr O'Keefe interjecting",31
113,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Because you did not act and we did. I will shortly be considering the report from Professor Nairn and his committee-the most important major inquiry into quarantine in 20 years. Whatever the final recommendations of this committee, I can assure this House and the primary industries of this country that the government will not move from maintaining a very conservative approach to quarantine. We do maintain a very conservative approach, as I was explaining to a few people this morning, as you would well know. You maintained it, and we supported you in that. We continue to maintain it. We export more than five times as much as we import. So we have a great interest in a stable set of international trade laws. That is why the farm groups and the previous government, with our support. pursued stable trading laws for many years. Part of that is the SPS agreement, supported, as recently as last week, by the Senate committee. It made it q.uite plain that we ought to oblige the proviSlons of the agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures. But, all of that notwithstanding, we do and will maintain our conservative approach. That is reflected in the recent decision-a very interesting one-to actually reject, on scientific grounds, an application by industry to support 14,000 fertilised eggs from Denmark. We have rejected it. We are quite happy to reject things when it is appropriate to do so. But you left us, apart from anything else, with a bank-up because you would not act on your own policy-a bank-up that now has us being laughed at internationally. About 158 applications are not being progressed-thank you very much! I found this mess on my plate, and I have made it plain in this place that we will stand by the commitment we gave. We will not progress further access requirements until we have the Nairn review in place and have adopted the recommendations. But understand this: your minister, whatever weasel words he likes to use, noted the advice. Under the procedures that you put in place-let me repeat it again till I am blind, because I hear some pretty clever and slippery lines floating around the place-he noted it. The director of quarantine makes the decision. Under your legislation, in those circumstances-and you know this is the case-the minister has to satisfy himself that due process is being followed. Your minister at no stage indicated that he had any doubt about the science. And neither, for that matter, did the bureau. This is what I did not know in opposition when I wrote that letter. I will be quite open about it. I wish I had known. But when you are in opposition there are certain things you do not know, as you are increasingly finding out and as is increasingly being reflected in your cheap populism. I did not know that it had been noted; nor did I know that the objective which I was trying to put in place-which was that AQIS's scientific capacity ought to be properly checked off by independent scientists-had been done by BRS, by AAHL and, interestingly enough, by those who spoke for the science on behalf of the chicken growers themselves. You talk about misleading the population. What in the name of good fortune do you think this cheap MPI does? It tries to absolve them of their responsibility for putting something in place which we broadly support. That is what they are attempting to do. It is cheap populism because they are now in opposition. Mr Martin Ferguson-It exposes you, Chicken-man.",31
114,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is like this bloke over here from the ACTU who constantly makes out that we have been the destroyers of regional jobs. You were responsible for the export of jobs. Your great objective in life was to make sure that we exported less produce out of primary Australia, out of regional Australia, and exported more jobs. That was the net effect of your policies and your approach. Mr O'Connor-Are you blaming us for the drought?",32
115,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No. I am blaming you for your very poor approach to industrial relations, though. Your very poor approach is: tie our hands behind our backs and make sure we cannot compete. Who are the losers? The workers of this country that you say you represent. Mr O'Connor-That is rubbish.",32
116,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If it is rubbish-thank you, you have just confirmed my point-you are patronising the workers of Australia. They saw through you and they rejected you. Like the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said today, you have not learnt the lesson. Thank you for confirming it. He is confirming it. They have not learnt the lesson. Why would Australia, with the full support of the farm groups, go down the road of seeking a stable set of international trade laws, including the SPS agreement? Would we do it out of the goodness of our heart because we simply wanted to invite everybody who wanted to import into this country to have open slather? Is that why they would have done it? Is that why we would have supported it or the farm groups would have gone on with it? Of course not. Good trade policy is all about enlightened self-interest. is all about net benefit to the rural communities. That is what it is about. That is why you had our support for this broad approach. That is why the farm groups broadly supported it. The fact is that it has been producing benefits. I ought to give you some credit for it. It is actually beginning to produce some benefits. It is a great pity that you have sought to politicise this issue. It is important that we explain to the Australian people that enlightened self-interest is the right approach to trade. As a result of the Cairns group/ GA TIIWTO, we have gained very significant extra access to the US market for beef. Here they are looking on and wondering why in the name of good fortune-when your minister notes that this is ready to progress-nothing happens for nine months. The position you left the director of quarantine in and the position you left Australia's international standing in had to be taken into account when I looked at the mess you had left me. You left me with a mess to clean up. The point is that we have been winning things like access to California for citrus, access to the Philippines for citrus, increased access to Taiwan for a range of agricultural products, rice into Korea and rice into Japan. We have an interest in stable, agreed international trade laws, and that is what this is all about. Since gaining office, the government has pushed on with improving bilateral trade arrangements. We intend to keep going, but we want to be able to do so on the basis of our international credibility. Here you have the supposed alternative government in a very cowardly and misleading way walking away from their own position, because that is what you are doing. Why on earth can't you have the courage to stand up? Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know what is more illustrative than what they do say on this matter? It is what they do not say. Let the ex-Minister for Trade and the ex-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy come out and actually say, 'No, we weren't going to let it in. No, we don't believe the process was properly followed. No, basically, we are not going to progress it.' Let them just say that. I heard a suggestion in here that we are not It considering this properly and not thinking this issue through properly. While in the process of cleaning up their mess, in consultation with industry, I set up two working groups. One was to look at the technical aspects of imports, which you did not do, and the other one was to look at adjustment issues. That is what we have put in place. If that does not reflect consultation and the desire to take into proper account the impact on industry, what does? The simple fact is that we have done what you did not do. I am awaiting the outcome of those arrangements prior to, on my own volunteering, taking a broad based paper-it is mine-to cabinet on Australia's trade and quarantine arrangements so as to seek confirmation of the broad approach taken. Mr O'Keefe-You've had it taken out of your hands; what are you talking about?",32
117,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You can attempt to reinvent the wheel, but I am simply telling you the truth as it stands. I want to tum to a couple of other points in the short time remaining to me. I want to again emphasise the way in which the procedure worked. I wish to put on the record again that what I did not know and what I could not have known in opposition was that after seven years of analysis, scientific study and discussion the former minister had a final report from AQIS in May 1995 indicating its technical assessments were complete and that access would be granted to the USA and Denmark subject to the fulfilment, as specified in strict conditions, which we are progressing right at this moment. Access to Thailand would also be granted subject to the outcome of processing plant inspections. The former minister, I repeat, noted this. He signed off on it. AQIS intended to take the formal decision on entry after the former minister concluded further consultations with industry, but he did not do so. On the industry's own admission, nine months went by and nothing happened. Procrastination and mismanagement by the former minister left the director of quarantine open to legal challenge and Australia susceptible to international trade challenge. Faced with this situation, I did the only sensible thing I could: I opened up consultations with the industry and I set in place the two groups that I have just mentioned. In light of all of this, I want to conclude making the obvious point that when it comes to regional representation on that side, firstly, they have not learnt the lessons. They were comprehensively thrown out because they would not hold a policy position and they would not deliver from rural Australia. Secondly, they obviously have not learnt anything. That has been confirmed by none other than their mates in the CFMEU. Seventy-five per cent of their front-bench are ex-trade union members, versus about 30 per cent from the other side. (Time expired) Mr FITZGmBON (Hunter) (4.13 p.m.)-I noted with great interest the state of the government front-bench during the contribution from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). I think that probably reflects pretty well the attitude of the cabinet to this very important issue. I did note that the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) and the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) were present. That is good to see. I noted even more importantly the strong representation here from members of the National Party. Like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, they know the devastating impact of this decision. They understand how the minister's mishandling of this decision will affect people living in rural and regional Australia. How disappointed they must be by his defence. All the minister wants to talk about is trade. But there is no reference to trade liberalisation in this MPI. There has been no concern expressed by our side about the government's approach to trade, because they are doing it no differently from the way we were doing it. We were very proud of the way we were doing it. This MPI is about quarantine and the minister's inept handling of the quarantine issue, particularly in relation to the importation of cooked chicken meat. The unanimous findings of the all-party Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee are a damning indictment of Minister Anderson's handling of this issue and represents a vote of no-confidence from his coalition colleagues on the committee. It recommends a sensible, well-considered by approach and offers real hope to a $2 billion industry that employs at least 45,000 people nationally and up to 3,000 people in the Hunter. Like the coalition senators who sit on the committee, I call upon the minister to immediately embrace the recommendations of the committee and to act upon them. The Senate committee has recognised that the proposal to allow for the importation of cooked chicken meat poses a real threat to the industry and to Australia's native bird population. Unlike the minister, the committee has been reluctant to accept AQIS's recommendations and its guarantees that the importation of cooked chicken meat can proceed without the risk of the introduction to this country of the dreaded newcastle disease and the infectious bursal disease. Unlike the minister, the committee has listened to the industry and was left holding grave doubts about the science underpinning AQIS' s recommendations. But the minister's embarrassment does not end there. The committee has recommended that the government should do what the minister was unprepared to do, and that is to look seriously at a GAIT friendly assistance package if, in the longer term, we are unable to gather enough scientific evidence to deny the importation of cooked chicken meat into this country. It is a question of science, not a question of trade policy. But the minister's embarrassment does not end there either. The committee, chaired by their own Senator Winston Crane, has recommended that the Quarantine Act 1908 be amended to put the final decision not in the hands of the minister necessarily but, to use their own words, back into the hands of the minister 'and/or the government' . We all know in public life that words can be bullets. This bullet, Minister, is directed at you, and it comes from your own side. This is why they are in here. This is, of course, a very subtle vote of no confidence in you from your own side-and you know it. They have no confidence in the minister's ability to competently handle this application or, for that matter, any future applications, whether they be with respect to salmon, apples or pears. His handling of the issue has sent shock waves through the chicken industry, and it has those who work within the apple, pear and salmon industries shaking in their boots. The issue has been running for months now. What have we heard from the minister? The same thing we heard today: 'It is all Bob Collins's fault. I'm innocent. I'm not a party to it. It was all said and done before I arrived here.' The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) has already referred to the letter-which he sought to table-from the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), where he clearly states that the former minister only noted the AQIS recommendations. I do recognise one thing. I do recognise that the parliamentary secretary did get it wrong when he said that it is not yet legislated. That in itself expresses his total ignorance of how the act works. But we do have from the parliamentary secretary a letter which confirms without any doubt and which makes it very clear that former Minister Collins did not give his imprimatur to this decision. Under the Quarantine Act, the final decision on these matters does not rest with the minister of the day, as you have quite rightly pointed out. But the minister is responsible for the act, as you know. As part of the process AQIS seeks the minister's imprimatur. It did not get the former minister's imprimatur, I can assure you. It is in this area that we find the greatest differences between the former minister's approach and the current minister's approach to the applications from Thailand, Denmark and the United States to import cooked chicken meat into Australia. As I said, AQIS does not require the minister's approval, but it does have to seek his imprimatur. Minister Anderson's story is a much different story from that of former Minister Collins. He was very quick to give the proposal the tick, despite his written guarantee to the industry, before the election, that he would not allow chicken meat to be imported before the Nairn review had been completed. The member for Burke has referred to Minister Anderson's letter. It is dated 14 February 1996, nicely just prior to the election. I will just quote the last paragraph where he says: A Coalition Government will suspend the approval of all proposed new import protocols, including the one for salmonid productsbut that is a typo, obviously, I think he means chicken; the rest of the letter is all about chickenuntil such time as the scientific review has been completed and its recommendations acted upon in full. You cannot be any more clear than that. Let me paint a picture for the House. Let me tell you what really happened. There is Minister Anderson, sitting behind his big ministerial desk. He has been there only a couple of months, and he is feeling pretty important. He is contemplating his determination to show his bureaucrats how tough he can be, how well he can get across a ministerial brief, and how determined he is to take the tough decisions. The next thing you know AQIS rolls in. These are the people, of course, who have been seeking Senator Collins's imprimatur for months. But he proved too cautious and too determined to protect the interests of the industry from disease. But the same cannot be said for Minister Anderson. 'You have to agree with this,' the AQIS bureaucrats said. 'We're obligated under the rules of the World Trade Organisation.' So what happens? In typical Yes, Minister fashion, the twomonth-old minister says, 'Well, give me the bit of paper. I'm ready to tick.' Let's look at the way the Australian Financial Review covered the incident. It says: At 5pm last night the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Anderson had signed off on a politically sensitive protocol allowing importation of cooked chicken meat. ""If he hasn't already, he soon will have,"" an aide said confidently. The conversation with our correspondent then proceeded something like this. Us: ""Has he told the National Party colleagues?"" Aide: ""Urn."" Us: Has he told the industry?"" Aide: ""Er."" Us: ""There are some pretty lively chook farmers out there. Just ask (National Party Senator) Ron Boswell."" Aid: (unintelligible gurgling noise). Us: ""See you."" Suddenly it was 5.30: the aide was on the line. Aide: ""I was wrong. The minister hasn't signed off after all. He's going to consult with the industry first. "" He just stood here and told the House that there was no opportunity for the minister to sign off. He does not seem to understand or that certainly does not seem to be the message being communicated by his staff. Of course, when the industry representatives read the article, they went ballistic-and why wouldn't they? They had been given an ironclad guarantee by the minister prior to the election that he would take no such decisions until the Nairn review had been completed. What did he do? He tried to keep blaming Senator Collins. But, of course, when that did not work, he tried something else. He established two joint government-industry task forces, which he has mentioned. I will tell you how often they have met. One task force was to look at the protocol issue and the other was to look at industry restructuring. The first has met twice, the second once-three meetings in total. This is the minister's initiative. It is just absolutely unbelievable! What was the minister doing while all this was going on? He was still out there on the airwaves telling all and sundry that the decision will proceed because Minister Collins has already put the whole process in place. So he is setting up two committees, he is asking them to meet and, while they are meeting, he is on the airwaves saying, 'Well, it's going to the go ahead anyway.' Notwithstanding the all party report that came down from the Senate last Thursday, on Friday he was still saying the thing will go ahead. (Time expired)",33
118,Mr ANDREW,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Wakefield) (4.23 p.m.)What a flight of fancy! What a featherweight fight has been put up by the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe). I stand here as the Liberal participating in this debate. I am not here because I was sucked in by the whip's office and I am not here because I was called simply to make the coalition look cohesive. I am here because, as I walked down the corridor at the close of the party meeting, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said to me, 'This is the MPI.' I said, 'That's an MPI I would like to be involved in because I know just how much nonsense we have had from the opposition about the status of the minister and his involvement.' Unlike everyone on the other side, including my coalition colleaguesexcept the member for Murray (Mrs Stone)--I know what happened in the Liberal Party meeting when this was discussed. There has been all of this nonsense running about some sort of vote of no confidence in the minister. Surely you realise-certainly the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) realises-that this is the most important matter that Australian primary producers have had to deal with since we came into office, certainly the most important matter since the issue of uncooked pig meat was dealt with by you in government in precisely the same way. Because it is such an important matter, it was raised in the Liberal Party room where there was not a whisper of no confidence in the minister. The comment was, 'Since this is so important, we ought to strengthen the minister's arm by getting front-bench approval.' That's why it has gone to cabinet-because we think this is important enough to warrant cabinet intervention. Unlike those opposite, I happen to have a particular interest in AQIS and a particular interest in the clean and green image of Australian exports. I will not stand silent when this sort of nonsense is being run in this chamber this afternoon by the member for Burke and the member for Hunter. Why do I have a particular interest? Because, as Mr Crean knows, I am in an area which happens to be uniquely fruit fly free in Australian terms and, for that reason, I have grown up in a quarantined area, an area in which the standard of AQIS and the standard of quarantine was absolutely important. I will tolerate nothing that compromises Australia's quarantine standards, neither will the minister and neither will any member of the government. Here we are dealing with the fundamental question of imported cooked chicken meat. The nonsense you are running suggests that in some way the minister is compromised when he has done precisely the opposite. But does it concern anyone opposite that all of this argument, including the member for Burke's MPI, may in some way itself compromise Australia's image overseas? No. If it is popular-and I know that this is popular because I know what my chicken growers are saying-let's run it. If it damages the AQIS reputation, that does not matter because there might be votes in it. The grim reality is that we cannot afford to stand up here and be unnecessarily critical of AQIS because it not only implies that what comes into Australia comes in and is not adequately supervised; it also suggests that what goes out-our clean and green imageis in some way compromised as well. It is inexcusable and unforgivable for the member for Burke to hang AQIS out to dry without any adequate evidence. That is what he has chosen to do with this MPI today. Why am I passionate about this? Because we are going through it now with cooked chicken meat and we had to face precisely the same dilemma over salmon and apples. We, the government, do not intend to compromise on any of these issues. To be fair to the member for Burke, he was honest enough to acknowledge that you cannot have a no-risk strategy-he knows that; we know that. The very fact that people move in and out of our country means that all of Australia's quarantine is, one way or another, at risk. But to suggest that we would lower the standard beyond anything that former Minister Collins had set is a scurrilous lie. We are as determined to maintain Australia's standards as you ever were and I have a personal interest in maintaining that standard to boot. The fact, of course-and the fact that you have chosen not to get in the way of a conveniently populist argument-is that the minister has no choice but to process this application and that is what he has done. As he has already acknowledged in his participation in the debate this afternoon, he came into office recognising that Minister Collins had not wanted to compromise Australian producers either and that Minister Collins had, in fact, delayed this application to the point at which the international court was banging on our door and putting all exports at risk. So he has no choice but to continue, as slowly as he can, processing it. That is precisely what he has done. Why are we supposed to apologise for merely following the course you had already set? Did I stand over there critical of you or Minister Collins when we were dealing with the pig meat exercise? Did I run this sort of populist line in spite of the number of pork producers I have in my electorate? Did I run this sort of populist line in the face of the meat decision? No, I did not. Why not? Because I was not prepared to be as unscrupulous as you have been with this particular MPI. As I said, the facts are that under the GATT arrangements we have no choice but to allow this to proceed. As I used to say from that desk opposite, it is high time people in the Labor Party recognised that we in the coalition facilitated the trade arrangements, frequently at great political cost. I know it because I was in opposition and the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) knows it because we both shared the anger of the citrus growers over the way we dealt, to your advantage, with the question of imported Brazilian juice and, recognising it was in the national interest, we endeavoured to support you. Here, with just a whiff of an issue that allows you to be popular, you want to run around and misrepresent all that we have been about. The member for Burke in his MPI suggests that in some way the government has failed to give proper consideration to quarantine issues in relation to the importation of cooked chicken meat. But there is not a skerrick, not even a sniff, of evidence that we have in any way failed to give proper consideration to quarantine issues. The member for Burke, in great indignation, holds up the Senate report as if in some strange way the minister and my coalition colleagues and I are supposed to apologise for the report of the committee chaired by our Colleague Senator Winston Crane. Have you heard the minister being critical of the Senate report? No. Have you heard me being critical of the Senate report? No. Have you seen us walk away from the recommendations in the Senate report? No. But you want to run that as some sort of evidence that the minister has failed to meet his responsibilities. I return to where I started. I stand here as a member of the Liberal Party, proudly part of the coalition, and I stand here as a volunteer in support of the minister to undo all the nonsense you have run about some sort of division in the coalition. The coalition recognises in government, even more clearly than pig it did in opposition, the obligations we have under GATT to allow reasonable trading arrangements. We recognise that we are facing difficult and unpopular decisions that we cannot take anything but a responsible stance on, that we cannot take a populist stance on, and that if we fail to deliver on them we will put Australian exporting industries at risk. For that reason we have been consistent. We have not painted AQIS as an organisation that is perfect. For his entire political career, since the day he entered this parliament, the minister has stood here and been critical of AQIS. He has said that it needed to be amended, that its costs were frequently unrealistic, and that many of its work practices ought to be adjusted. But on work practices, as always, you tum a deaf ear. The minister has been entirely consistent. This MPI deserves to be tossed out of the parliament and certainly does not deserve the debating time that it has been afforded.",35
119,Mr ANDREN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Calare) (4.33 p.m.}-I stand here proud to be an Independent in this debate. Australia has built a reputation around the world for the manner in which it has maintained a clean, fresh and disease free environment for its primary production. At the moment it is still a very clean supermarket to Asia, but that reputation is at grave risk, with trading imperatives distorting sound judgment on maintaining protection of our crops, and as instanced in the disaster of imported pilchards causing the spread of a virus through our native variety, and the discovery of the papaya fruit fly in southern New South Wales, identified only by a New South Wales research team now to be disbanded. The point is that our quarantine abilities are being severely challenged. Last week the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee said that it was not satisfied with the science that has previously cleared the importation of cooked chicken meat. There is a growing distrust of our quarantine inspection capabilities, and the answers from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in this House this afternoon did nothing to convince me that the decision to import chicken meat will be anything other than a short-sighted level playing field, no trade barrier decision to placate our trading partners, rather than a decision based on sound scientific judgment. Look at what America does when it wants to dump some meat onto our markets. Look what it does when it wants to try to protect its motor industry. Look at Indonesia and look at Malaysia and the sort of non-tariff barriers that might be erected to distort our trading situation. It is particularly in the area of importing New Zealand apples and the risk of importing fire blight where I see another looming danger for my own electorate. Two reports issued in early August suggest the risk of importing New Zealand apples to Australia exceed any trading benefits. A New Zealand proposal to send apples to Australia is being reviewed by both the AQIS and the Australian Bureau of Resource Economics. ABARE estimated the spread of fire blight into Australia could cause crop losses of between 20 and 30 per cent and believes it is uncertain whether fire blight can be restricted to one region by quarantine and control measures should it arrive. Fire blight also has the potential to devastate all plants in the Roseaceae family, including roses and the thousands of ornamental berry trees that grace the central tablelands where I live and elsewhere in this country. With the dismantling of the Rydalmere Research Station, the Carr government in New South Wales has already put at risk the research capability of that state. In fact, the ability of the New South Wales agriculture department to seriously study the effectiveness of a vaccine to counter the spread of the potentially crippling merino industry ovine johnes disease is another example of the devalued and understrengthed research capability we now have in this country. The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee report on the importation of cooked chicken meat makes very sobering reading. The committee recommends AQIS commission tests of the thermal inactivation of the newcastle disease virus which, if imported, could not only devastate our industry but make inroads into our native fauna. The committee is reluctant to dismiss lightly concerns from scientists within the Australian chicken meat industry about some of the assumptions AQIS has made. I find it hard to reconcile these doubts with the minister's answer to the House this afternoon suggesting, because the previous government had allegedly cleared the scientific studies into imported chicken meat, because the process was put in train by the previous government, that the decision had effectively been made and he would find it hard to reverse the decision. The AQIS view is not infallible. It has been found wanting on other occasions. There is enough doubt over the chicken meat issue to raise serious questions about its ability to reach a sound judgment on the threat from fire blight. The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture, in a letter to AQIS in December last year claims: Export of mature apples produced under New Zealand conditions will not be a viable pathway for the introduction of Erwinia Amilovora. Yet fire blight is a serious bacterial disease in 34 countries. Why should we believe the New Zealanders who also most likely delivered us johnes disease in carpet wool sheep in the 1970s-when our quarantine was fairly impeccable, I might add? lam told submissions to AQIS on the fire blight study have been extended until the end of this month. AQIS will then prepare a draft pest risk analysis to go out to the public for comment before a final decision early in the new year at the best. Given the adherence to the trading imperatives we face, 'We don't rock the boat attitudes' and the minister's acceptance of a process set in train, he says, by a former government-so I guess everything is okay-I hold real concerns for the imperatives that will determine AQIS's final recommendation. Our research and quarantine record and reputation is in danger of being sidelined for short-term trading imperatives. What is the use of a level playing field if it is infected with every disease under the sun?",37
120,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Kennedy) (4.38 p.m.)When we talk about level playing fields and equal access I recall that when I was minister for electricity I had a number of contracts to bring to cabinet one morning. All of them were allocated outside of the state of Queensland. I got the commissioner in and asked why there were no Queenslanders and he told me we were under an agreement with the other states to take the lowest tender. Where this is most relevant to this debate is the that in seven years Victoria had not allocated a single electricity contract outside the state of Victoria. So while people sign these agreements there are those out there who actively circumvent the agreements on a continuous basis. That is an important background to the decision we are talking about here today. The ALP in this place, the opposition, has come up and acted holier than thou, which is a most remarkable performance. It could only be made as an exercise in total ignorance of what has transpired up to date. The people of North Queensland suffered a 25 per cent cut back in AQIS-so much for the crocodile tears being shed on the opposition benches today. When we complained about this and said it opens the door to the incoming of diseases to the northern part-we are the gateway for Australia-we were told by AQIS and Mr Keating's government that although the cutbacks were 25 per cent in size they would not in any way open the door to any threats to Australian agriculture or horticulture. Within 18 months we had the papaya fruit fly in Far North Queensland and the cost to our industries was over $30 million per year-and we are now into our second year. Not only do I criticise the government but really I must also criticise the public servants because no matter how good or bad you are as a minister you definitely will be influenced by the public servants. As a long-serving minister I know only too well that on a lot of occasions you have to rely on their judgment. I would urge the current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in the strongest possible way to be very careful when he is relying on the judgment of these people because his predecessor, when he relied upon their judgment, was caught imposing upon Far North Queensland, upon all of our industries up there, a cost obligation of $30 million per year. So much for the crocodile tears coming from the opposition but, also, so much for the reliability and reassurances given to us by AQIS; so much for their veracity and dependability. Where I come from, their standing as far as credibility is concerned is zilch. Let me just fact reflect upon the fact because I have, in Mareeba, a very significant chicken meat industry that services the cooked chicken meat industry of Australia. If ever there is a town which reflects what has gone wrong in this country and the decision making of the now opposition-the Keating-Hawke government-it is the town of Mareeba. We had a TB eradication campaign introduced and that wiped out 600,000 head of cattle; it did not wipe out TB but it did succeed in getting rid of our cattle. Four hundred jobs were lost in Mareeba with the closure of the meat works because there were no cattle to process. We then had Senator Richardson, as minister, introduce world heritage which closed two timber mills. Half the main street of Mareeba is taken up with the giant timber mill that dominated the economy of the town. It was closed down and two, arguably three, other timber mills in the area were closed down, costing us 150 jobs. So that was 550 jobs. The incoming Goss Labor government in Queensland introduced an increase in water charges from around $5 up to around $30 a megalitre and that closed down the rice industry. The deregulation of the tobacco industry is another example. We removed the 50 per cent home content rule from tobacco, which was nothing to do with tobacco being dangerous to health or any of those things. At the same time the United States House of Representatives was passing legislation to increase their home content rule to up to 72 per cent. So much for level playing fields and so much for the hypocrisy of the now opposition. In all of these decisions we can see the reasons why they are sitting on the opposition benches. I am talking about hypocrisy here today. We had some 12 goldmines in the Mareeba area; they introduced a gold tax which closed at least half of those goldmines and put another 50 people out of work. At the time of speaking, their Hilmer legislation is threatening the sugar industry which we are trying to get under way. That brings me back very specifically to what we are talking about today. AQIS informed us that it was very safe, that they had everything under control, that they had no problems and that the 25 per cent cutback would result in no cutback in our security against the importation of disease. That is same thing that they are telling us with this particular legislation before us in this House today. I must deal in a little more detail with the saidintroduction of the papaya fruit fly. It has now been disclosed that they knew that the papaya fruit fly was in the Torres Strait years before the outbreak in Far North Queensland. Even though they knew the papaya fruit fly was in the Torres Strait three years before, they introduced no quarantine restrictions upon the Torres Strait islands whatsoever. For the information of the House, it is extremely easy to quarantine the Torres Strait because there is only one crossing of the Jardine River. All you have to do is pay the ferryman and you have got yourself a quarantine service. You already have six full-time officials operating on Thursday Island who can police the airport. So it was very easy to protect us. AQIS knew that the papaya fruit fly was there, yet they did absolutely nothing to quarantine the Torres Strait. The net result 3. was the loss of $30 million a year to the economy of Far North Queensland. Let me move specifically to this decision. I say to the minister: please understand that this town is reeling. Blow after blow has been delivered by the previous government. I do not want to see another blow delivered to the economy of Mareeba. I refer to the Senate estimates hearingsand I will quote from five pages. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I deeply regret that you could not stay on for your own meeting that you called. The AQIS representative in a fairly high-handed manner, I might add, told all of us that the research on this had been done over a long period. I asked whether this was done before this time last year and she said, 'Yes, all of it was done before this time last year.' I said, 'Fine. You came to this parliament and you told us that this is quite a safe decision,' yet I am holding here the quotes from the hearings of the Senate. Senator O'Chee said: Are you aware of a letter that Mr Alexander wrote  to Mr Board's earlier correspondence advising that the AQIS was reviewing Australia's prohibition of importation of chicken meat and chicken meat products on the basis of the use of at least one of five time temperature treatments? I ask whether you are aware that, in his response, Mr Alexander and this is the important point for this House and this is the authority upon which AQIS has three made all of these recommendationsI must admit when we did that work I did not expect it to have such ramifications. That means allowing the importation of cooked chicken meat into Australia. Senator O'Chee goes on: Let me quote the letter. I will happily give you a copy. He goes on to say: I would say that the heat inactivation of any organism is dependent on: 1. The organismthat was whether it was a high pathogenic level organism or not2. The medium in which the organism is treated and its thermal properties. The temperature applied. 4. The length of time the heat process is applied. The heat inactivation curves that we produced give a guide to the rate at which inactivation of the strain of infectious bursal disease virus used takes place within the specified parameters. Thus the greater the initial number of virus particles present the longer it will take (if the other parameters remain constant) to reach required low probability of survival of infectivity that is selected as the required level of confidence. I am not going to read all five pages here, but it probably does behove me to read one other quotation from Senator O'Chee. He said: But you are aware of the fact that if you have different concentrations of the organism then you will require longer time temperature cooking to reach a level at which you can say there is a low probability of effective survival ... actually have, across the whole range of meat product, a particular time temperature limit at which you can guarantee no effective survival. AQIS came forward to the meeting that I attended and told us all that it was 100 per cent safe, yet they are holding a letter from their own expert saying that there are three areas that need to be tested--one is the heat, one is the time that you apply the heat for and one is the pathogen level and the type of pathogen strain that you are dealing with. The third parameter has not been tested. (Time expired)",39

124,Mr ANDERSON,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Senate's amendment be agreed to. This amendment, the piece of work that we seek to include in the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996, is very short. The purpose of it is to allow persons other than officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, which has been recently discussed in this House, to be appointed as authorised officers under the Imported Food Control Act 1992 with all the powers of an authorised officer other than specified enforcement powers. The amendment is sought by the government as a result of concerns raised by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills regarding the unlimited nature of the enforcement powers which would flow to persons authorised under the Imported Food Control Act 1992. As a result of the amendment, AQIS anticipates a more effective and efficient service to industry as it not only minimises the duplication of inspection service activities but also provides a more flexible approach to inspection service delivery in locations where an AQIS officer is not readily available. The importing industry has been consulted at length and strongly supports the amendment. In essence, it is about delivering to the importing community a more flexible inspection system of the sort that we are very vigorously engaged in supplying to the exporting community. In the vast majority of circumstances, inspections are, and will continue to be, carried out in the major port facilities as this is where the bulk of imported food products enter the country. But there are occasions when inspections need to be carried out in more remote locations and the services of an AQIS officer are not available. People have been concerned that this may amount to import facilitation, but it is not really quite so much that as facilitating those who use imported product. For example, the dairy industry and other food processing companies often import some product or some part of the materials that they use in their food processing on a seasonal-basis need and are able to inspect it at the local level and in the regions. They often cannot find an AQIS officer readily available and, when they bring one in, they find that it is very expensive. Under those circumstances, it seems more than appropriate-indeed, very sensible-to ensure that people such as local health inspectors or other suitably qualified people can provide basic service delivery in this regard. Therefore, we do endorse the approach. Amendment agreed to. NA NA Motion (by Mr Cadman)-by leaveagreed to: That the Wool International Amendment Bill 1996 be referred to the Main Committee for consideration. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 November, on motion by Mrs Moylan: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Dr Lawrence moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""w-lst not declining to give the Bill a second readlng, the House: ; (1) deplores the Government for abolishing ational subsidies for community-based long day care centres which will have the effect of increasing the costs and reducing the quality of child care for parents using these centres; and (2) condemns the Government for breaking its election promise not to means test the Childcare Cash Rebate"".",42
125,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"Prior to the adjournment last night, I was relating to the House correspondence which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) received from a Ms Gilda Villani of Pascoe Vale concerning the child-care decisions being made by the government in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill. Ms Villani states: Is your strategy in assisting the middle and lower class workforce, (particularly working mothers) by forcing them out of employment and back into the kitchen ... this mentality of yours is well out of date. It certainly is. She goes on: Wake up Mr Costello and listen to our genuine concerns, we are saying we want to be able to afford quality care for our children, we did not ask you to make it a luxury. More importantly you must retain Subsidised Community Based Child Care Centres that don't put profits before the quality care of children ... I think they are very important points. The letter is signed by Ms Gilda Villani, who signs herself off as 'one of many thousands of angry working mothers'. Further, this bill represents yet another government broken election promise. If we go back to the pre-election period, the government made a commitment to retain-I guess that must have been a non-core commitment-the non-means tested child-care cash rebate and the system of child-care assistance. But what we see now is the abolition of operational subsidies for community based long day care centres, the government will not provide capital funding to build the promised 5,500 new long day care places, it is restricting eligibility for child-care assistance and it is applying a means test to the child-care cash rebate. Once again, we have seen a Labor government acting as the enlargers, expanding child oper- care from 46,000 places-a derisory 46,000 places-to 270,000 places, just as we expanded tertiary education places massively, just as we expanded secondary education from one-third of all children completing secondary education to better than two-thirds, just as we expanded health insurance to those two million people who were uninsured who were without health insurance when we came to government, just as we expanded superannuation from a narrow elite to encompass the overwhelming majority of Australian workers, just as we expanded jobs with our job creation programs. We created some 700,000 new jobs in our final term of office. In all those areas Labor were the enlargers. In all these areas we have seen a coalition government come in and put a stop to it. Once again, we are seeing this legislation putting a stop to the growth in child-care assistance, putting a stop to child care being affordable and accessible in the way it should be. I ask all members to support the opposition amendment.",43
126,Mr WILTON,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I rise in this place to draw to the attention of the House again the fact that I am proud to represent within the electorate of Isaacs the suburb of Cranbourne-perhaps the child-care capital of Australia. I submit that because it was at Cranbourne that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) launched the coalition's childcare policy-perhaps best described as its illfated child-care policy-during the election campaign in March. We can all well recall pictures flashed across the newspapers of the country of the Prime Minister seated at a child's tea set enjoying a tea party with a young child-care beneficiary. I would like to begin my contribution by referring briefly to an editorial of 15 August from the main weekly newspaper of the Cranbourne area, the Cranbourne Sun. This editorial, which dealt with the looming crisis in child care resulting from the federal government's changes in this area, had this to say about the government's changes: Provision of child care services is an unquestioned government responsibility in most industrialised countries. When an editorial of nothing more than a News Ltd newspaper accepts the vital role played by government in ensuring the provision of quality long-term day care to children of a particular area then I think it is fair to say that those who hold the view that the government ought not be playing such a role are well and truly in the minority. As the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) has so lucidly pointed out, the Labor Party takes great pride in the fact that as a government we had established a system of high quality, affordable child care that was the envy of the rest of the world. In fact, the introduction of such a service was largely driven by the recognition of the fact that there was an increasingly large number of women in our society who wished, as I will allude to a little later on, to pursue working careers, and without adequate child care many women would be denied this fundamental right, this basic opportunity. Again, as the member for Wills has succinctly drawn to the attention of the House, child care and the use of that facility in Australia has grown to such an extent that there are currently over half a million children in Australia enjoying the benefits of Commonwealth funded child care. The government justifies these changes to the child-care system, such as this bill's abolition of the operational subsidy for community based long day care, by claiming that this initiative shall encourage services to be more efficient and more cost competitive with the private sector. This is the thinking that is identified by the fundamental flaw of, as we see in so many other pieces of legislation before this House, the government again failing to recognise the value of child care. In this instance, the government recognises the price of everything but the value of nothing. The government's thinking is that the private sector can and ought to provide childcare services: let 'us save a few bucks and leave it to the private sector. Those of us on this side of the House have no objection to the role of the private sector in child care. In fact, it was under the last Labor government that the operation of private child-care providers absolutely flourished. We on this side also accept the notion that there is a direct role for government to play. Long day care is an excellent example of where this should occur. For instance, compared with the private sector, government subsidised community based long day care provides services for children with special needs, more places for babies and extended hours that are, in many instances, beyond the range of the hours provided by private sector based child-care operators. I return to the month or so prior to March of this year to remind those present in the House of the Prime Minister's often touted election slogan: for all of us. We on this side have come to realise that 'for all of us', when defined in practice, falls a long way short of the people who need to be brought up to the standards enjoyed by many Australians, those people Labor never left behind and whom this government is seeking again to leave behind. Of course, I am talking about the children of this nation who will be denied access now to proper child care. This bill makes clear the government's priority when it does tum to families; that those in which one partner is at home caring for children. It is not those families both parents are working. The government, in this legislation, is clearly saying to the over 50 per cent of women who are working these days, 'Don't work or we'll penalise you. We'll take away your right. We'll take away the opportunity Labor afforded you to gain access to community day care for your children.' The abolition of this operational child-care subsidy is yet another broken promise from a government that promised to set a new standard in propriety. It has demonstrated, through its failure to keep its word or act with some integrity, on too many occasions of late a new low standard that will draw forth the scorn of all Australian people. I note what the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) said with regard to community based long day care centres in the Sydney Morning Herald of August of this year. She said that she 'can't give a guarantee they won't close because it will depend on - ow the management structure operates'. This IS despite the government trumpeting the $8.3 million that they are providing to help community based centres manage the loss of operational subsidies. Like many of its apparent acts of giving, this is another case of the government giving with one hand and taking back with the other. In this case it is taking a lot more back-$118 million-with that other hand. The Chief Executive of the Municipal Association of Victoria, Mr Robert Barnes, has claimed that 'the loss of operational subsidies will mean rises in council-run child care taking funds from elsewhere or closing centres'. Having taken away this $118 million from community based day care, it is not likely that councils-councils such as the City of Kingston within my own electorate of Isaacs, which will lose $120,000 in funding for its four child-care centres-will be able to come up with replacement funding. There is no way the costs to parents will not rise unless-I suspect that Kingston may well do this-the quality of child-care services provided is reduced. To quote another person knowis, ledgeable in the area of child care, Frances Wright of the Victorian Subsidised Child Care in which Coordinators Association: Once again, it's those who can least afford it who will suffer the most. This is an emerging trend now with this government: those who can least afford it are those that are hit the hardest. Another angle that this government, which claims to represent small business and the battlers, has overlooked is the impact these changes to child care will have on more women being forced to leave work. An August editorial of the Cranbourne News-Cranbourne is an area which has a high proportion of families where both parents work to make ends meet-states: Prohibitive costs will also force some parents out of the workforce as well as the child care system, with ramifications for local economies. Those families will have reduced incomes and less to spend. The alternatives to fee increases for child-care centres are quite alarming. First, they could cease to provide cooked meals for the children. Secondly, they could be forced to reduce, or even cease providing, care for children in the under-two age group. Thirdly, they could reduce the numbers of staff or the hours of those staff. Fourthly, they could have to re-evaluate the after-school program and incorporate these children into the long day care program. We know that this is not the last we will hear of the government and its tampering within the child-care area. We have the recommendations of the EPAC child care task force, which has been looking into this area. We expect to be back here at some time in the near future, fighting in the interests of all Australian families to save what is left of our once great system. I commend the amendment proposed by the shadow minister to the House.",44
127,Mr MCCLELLAND,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"Barton) (5.07 p.m.)The member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) reminded me in his speech of the famous tea party scene where the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), then Leader of the Opposition, was seen in the sandpit with children in a day care centre. That image, while somewhat embarrassing at the time, is seen as transparently hypocritical in light of the policies this government has pursued. The thrust of this Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill is to discontinue payments of operational subsidies to community based long day care centres from 1 July 1997. The impact of the bill is shown in the financial impact statement contained in the bill's explanatory memorandum. The bill says it will achieve net savings of $118.4 million over the first four years. Because they are net amounts, which otherwise would have been contributed by the government, they have to be made up out of the pockets of parents. Because they come out of the pockets of parents, they are a gross figure. So, effectively, that is $220 million coming from the parents of children in community based long day care centres if they want to, or are able to, maintain current standards. There is no doubt on any objective analysis that it has been the community based day care centres which have been the innovators and the developers of the first-class facilities. is in comparison to a number of centres which have failed or are yet to pass the accreditation standards. By far, the majority of those which have passed the accreditation standards are the community based centres. They are the centres of quality. The benefits of the community based centres are that they enable minority groups, which include, quite frequently, children with special needs, to have access to the centres. Not only are those children with special needs children from poor families, they also include children who lack English skills and indeed, quite frequently, children with disabilities. The operational subsidies have meant, quite literally, that those first-class services have been affordable and accessible to the total spectrum of those in our community requiring community based day care facilities. It is quite simply poor government to abdicate the field of quality child care to private interests, as this government is well down the track of doing. As one commentator said, 'We don't dump kids in a school system that we don't regulate and don't fund,' and it is absolutely no different in terms of the crucial preschool age. There is already a black economy in child care which follows on from the United States example where so many child-care centres, if you can call them that, are regarded as 'child warehouses', where parents literally dump the kids off at the door of these child warehouses just as someone might dump a pet off at a local kennel before they go on holidays. They do not particularly want to look inside because they do not want to be distressed when they are away. Unfortunately, that is going to be the sort of scenario facing a great many parents who will have to put their kids into substandard child-care facilities as a result of the funds being taken out of the child-care system. I do not want to see any child developed in these crucial years in a warehouse environment, yet that is what this· government is driving towards. The thrust of the government is one which is predicated upon failure to recognise the This legitimate entitlement of women; and it is one so frequently revealed, when one scratches the surface of the government's rhetoric, in flashes from the internal soul or the internal conscience of the government. The member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), in his speech on this topic, regarded the childcare sector in the following terms: So the child-care industryBy the way, community based centres are not an industry; they are community based caring centres. They are not profit driven. But they were his terms. He said: So the child-care industry has grown in response partly to demand but more so because the government policieshe is referring to the Labor governmentwe have experienced in recent years have driven it. It was seen by the former government as a politically correct cause. It was seen as an opportunity to win votes by pandering to the extreme fetr.inist agenda ... I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have met a number of very fine people, both men and women, who are active in community based child-care centres. On their behalf, I strongly resent any reference to an unbalanced or misconstrued view of life or any simple insult implied by referring to them as being driven by a feminist agenda. They are concerned fundamentally with the proper upbringing of children at a very crucial age. For instance, in the St George region just outside my electorate, we have a centre for children with learning disabilities. The convener at that centre, Ms Maria Cook, has written to the Prime Minister. She said in her letter to the Prime Minister that, if you do not provide adequate care and if you do not properly train teachers at this level, it will result in kids with disabilities being undetected and you are not going to be able to apply the right treatment and help where it is required. Ms Cook has referred to United States examples where research shows that the cost of not treating, or not addressing, learning disabilities is multiplied many times in order to address the problems confronted by those children later in life. Regrettably, those problems are also quite often confronted by society later in life as a result of those learning disabilities possibly manifesting themselves in such things as criminal conduct. Similarly, Tracy Popple, the director of the Kogarah Uniting Church long day care centre, has written to me. She has referred to the fact that much of her patronage is from migrant families. She has referred to the fact that 25 per cent of families in her centre are eligible for the maximum child-care assistance, which requires a total family income of less than $476 per week. She has indicated that the additional fee of $25 per week will clearly be something those families will not be able to afford. Many will be driven from the quality system of community based day care into the private industry, but those parents will be able to afford only very low quality day care at the bottom end of the private scale. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) today in answer to a question from one of his colleagues referred to illiteracy in the community. He announced that the government had the intention of addressing illiteracy, despite the fact that clearly the initial program is one developed by the Labor government. Be that as it may, there is absolutely no use treating the symptom if you do not treat the cause. He acknowledged, in fairness to him, the importance of addressing the illiteracy problem at primary school age but, as Maria Cook quite rightly points out, up to one in five children have learning disabilities. The time to detect, the time to address, those problems is at preschool. The government's claim that it is interested in addressing illiteracy will come to naught if it does not and is not addressing the problem at the very earliest opportunity-that is, in these vital preschool years. The government is taking away the resource base of the community based centres. It is taking away the talent base from the community based centres. It is driving away parents who need the resources of the community based centres. The government's hollow rhetoric comes to nothing. Their actions with respect to this issue in particular are contemptible. Far from being motivated by a feminist agenda, the opposition is motivated by very committed and concerned parents. The government, ultimately, is going to pay a very heavy price for the policies they are pursuing. I strongly oppose the government's bill.",46
128,Mr MARTIN,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"Cunningham) (5.18 p.m.)Like all of us on this side of the parliament, I speak in absolute opposition to the proposition which this uncaring government has brought before the people of Australia today. The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is nothing but philosophically driven claptrap. To suggest that people in this day and age, particularly women, should be denied access to affordable child care is akin to suggesting to people they have no legitimate right to take a role in the work force if they are women, that they have no legitimate right to seek some opportunities for respite care for their kids or that this might be some sort of a rort to the system. All the words that I used there are the sorts of words we hear time and time again from this government. This government says, 'If you have used some R&D grants in the past, it's a rort now and we're going to cut those out. If in some way you have access to concessions to promote tourism overseas, it's a rort and we're going to cut that back.' In respect of child care, they are that, because they believe saving $118.4 million over three years is an appropriate way to attack child care, they are going to put in place this legislation. This legislation will, firstly, discontinue the operational subsidy to community based long day care centres to take effect from 1 July next year and, secondly, amend the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 to reduce the child-care cash rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for families with a taxable income in the current year lower than the family income cut-off for part A of the family tax initiative, which is currently $70,000 per annum for a family with one child. That is the basis of this government's attack on child care. Yet you have to wonder whether the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or any of these ministers on the other side who are part of this government have actually ever been to a long day care centre or have ever been to a community based child-care centre. Have they ever been there and spoken to the people who use the facility? They sit here in this parliament, point the finger at us and say, The Labor Party is out of touch.' They say that the Labor Party has forgotten what the average, ordinary battlers of Australia want. I can tell you: the average, ordinary battlers of Wollongong-the average, ordinary battlers of the Illawarra-who utilise child-care facilities have long memories. They have very, very long memories. This issue, which is raging in Illawarra, will come back at some stage in the future and bite this government where it hurts most. It is incredible to think that in some way opportunities should be denied people to access community based child-care centres. These are non-profit organisations. These are organisations that often are run by the local councils or by community groups. In the case of the Illawarra, the Illawarra Children's Services Action Group runs a number of these. You have the Bulli Children's Centre. You have a range of others-at Corrimal, the Western Suburbs Child Care Centre. They are all generally under the auspices of the Wollongong City Council, the lllawarra Children's Services Action Group or some other organisuggesting sation that is community based. You ask the mothers, the trained staff at these child-care centres, and the fathers as well: why do you put your kids in child care? All sorts of reasons come out. They tell you, for example, 'I happen to be a single mother because I am divorced, and I need the opportunity to have my children looked after in child care occasionally so that I can go to university, so I can improve myself, so I can get a better job in the work force to look after my family.' You hear of two-income families who are at the lower end of the scale-two incomes are a necessity for some of these people. They put their kids in child care not only because they want an opportunity for them to mix with children of. their own age but also because it is actually an economic necessity. You ask people why their children are in child care, and they will tell you it is because they believe that their children get an enormous socialisation experience, they mix with kids of their own age, they relate to one another and it is part of their social development. Yet those on the other side of this chamber think that that is all nonsense. In hard dollars and cents facts, they say, 'We are going to slash into child care.' Hang the consequences. Do not worry about what the people want. Do not worry about the fact that these people, over a long period of time, have come to believe that child care is a right in our society and have looked to governments-particularly federal governments; Labor governments-to sustain that belief. We certainly did that. It is rather instructional to go out and talk to some of these people in child-care centres around Australia. I certainly have done so in my electorate. In fact, not at my behest but certainly with my support, a number of petitions have been generated by parents, and by the children themselves, of the child-care centres in the Illawarra. I would like to take the opportunity to read from a couple of them. The people of Wollongong are very creative. [ wish I could share this particular drawing and petition with the people of Australia. Mr Hollis-Table it; table it.",48
129,Mr MARTIN,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I am going to table all these petitions through the correct channels. The member for Throsby, like me, has been fighting untiringly for child-care centres in the Illawarra. We have a petition from Carly Chapman, of 38 William Street, Bulli, aged nine. She has drawn here what certainly looks like John Howard saying, 'Well, if you can't afford it, stay at home.' That seems to be the Prime Minister's attitude-if you can't afford it, stay at home. Another petition has a letter which reads: Dear John Howard, How come you made a ridiculous budget? Some mothers like my mum have 4 children in care while him. she goes to uni. She pays silly amounts just for long day care and occasional care. It is signed: Emily Chapman (11) P.S. You may not have kids but others have. We know that the Prime Minister has kids. Mr Hollis-Well, you have kids.",49
130,Mr MARTIN,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"The member for Throsby draws to the House's attention my own circumstances. Sure, I have four kids, and all of my children at various times have been through child-care centres. If I do say so myself, it has not done them any harm whatsoever, because each of the centres that my children attended were centres which were appropriately accredited. This is again one of the issues which we are concerned about here--eliminating the accreditation of child-care centres so that any fly-by-nighter can set themselves up as a child-care centre. If you are a caring parent, are you going to want to dump them off at places like that? I think not. There is another petition from Christopher MCCaughtrie, of 61 Asquith Street, Austinmer-these people have gone to a lot of trouble-which says: Please find attached a little note from our son Christopher, who would be devastated if he was taken out of his preschool/longday care centre and away from his playmates. This is a real possibility given the rising cost of childcare. And, in the hand of Christopher MCCaughtrie, 'I love my friends at school.' He signed it himself, and he has also got a stick drawingbut a tremendous drawing-of some of his friends who attend that child-care centre. Here we have one from Catherine Dening. I think it really gets to the heart of one of the issues. I am pleased that the minister has come into the chamber now. I would actually like to give her these petitions. I will get them to her eventually so that she can read them for herself. Catherine Dening, of 23 High Street, Thirroul, writes: My brother needs Day Care because he was born with a disability and doesn't deserve to miss out on the opportunities I had and neither does anyone else. He needs all the help he can get and you don't have any right to take this help away from Dead set right, Minister. Here is another one: If your proposals go ahead my children will not be able to attend preschool due to the increases in fees. Listen to what the people are saying to you, Minister. You come over here, lecture this side of the parliament and say that we do not go out into the community and listen to what people want. Here is a whole stack of petitions from people-from children, from parents. They have got the message for you and I tell you what, I am going to deliver it to you. Kellie Thicknesse writes: Then I will not be able to study at tech and work part-time. The children will be who loses out the most. At preschool they get to interact with other children, play with a greater variety of children. They learn how to write, share and be independent. They get to spend time away from their parents and smaller baby brothers and sisters. Again, that is an important element in raising families these days. Here is a great line: 'The faces behind community based Long-Day Care! Betrayed by the Liberal Government! Dead set right. These petitions, which I will be lodging with the clerk in the most appropriate manner-I hope they find their way to the minister's attention; I hope she - as a look at them and passes them on to the Prime Minister-reflect the anger, the frustration and the sheer concern that people in the Illawarra have about this government's decisions to slash $118 million in the name of fiscal responsibility from people who need these facilities. I urge the government to reconsider what I consider to be one of the most appalling decisions of this budget. It is not right. It is not Australian. The Prime Minister likes to talk about battlers, about being Australian and all the rest of it. I have to tell you, this is definitely not right, Minister. This is an absolute outrage. You should do something about it.",49
131,Ms HANSON,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I wish to remind the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of his commitment when in opposition to continue adequate, affordable, available child-care facilities for Australian families. Child care has become a lucrative thriving business in Australia. The majority of the cost, 60 per cent or $1.5 billion, is met by governments. Of this, in 1995-96, $1.1 billion was Commonwealth government funding. In 1983 there were 46,000 Commonwealth supported child-care places. The number of Commonwealth assisted places already exceeds the target of 300,000 set for June 1997 and further expansion is expected. This expansion is under severe threat thanks to proposed budget cuts. Thanks to these cuts, the creation of additional places to meet the ever increasing demand for child care is unlikely. What of the commitment to the continuation of adequate, affordable, available child-care facilities for Australian families? Community based long day care centres are non-profit centres. Centres in my electorate are normally administered by a committee made up of parents and other members of the community. This is of great benefit for all those involved-the children, the parents, the community and the centre. The big plus is, I believe, the ability of a centre run this way to be more responsive to the needs of those involved. The provision of the opportunity for parents to be so involved in decisions affecting the care of their children is of great comfort. Let us face it: most parents would prefer their children to be cared for in the home. It is a sad indictment of our society that these days, if a family wants to get ahead, it is often necessary for both mother and father to go out to work. Operational subsidies are targeted for removal from 1 July 1997 for community based long day care centres. This subsidy is paid by the government to these centres which are owned and operated by the community on a non-profit basis. Many of these centres in my electorate of Oxley have operated for more than 20 years. Subsidies have given these community based organisations the financial help they have needed to continue to provide a service for the thousands of children who attend them. The continued viability of these centres is questionable if the removal of the operational subsidy goes ahead. Without the subsidy, some families will have to find at least another $15 to $20 a week for child care. To many Australian families who are illready battling to find the money to pay the bills, this will be the last straw. Operational subsidies cost the government $137 million in the 1995-96 budget. This was paid to the community based long day care centres and family day care centres. Under the present proposal, long day care centres will lose their subsidy as of 1 July 1997. Unfortunately, this loss will mean that the price of care will have to increase by the amount of the subsidy withdrawn. This could ultimately bring about the closure of some centres. This operational subsidy was introduced to encourage the provision of quality child care in those areas shunned by the private childcare sector. Why? Because these operators prefer to set up centres only in economically viable areas. Operational subsidies received by the long day care community centres help to offset the expense of operating in rural and remote areas. Operational subsidies mean that long day care centres can offer a high standard of quality care to children who because of their age-many of them are under two years-need special care and attention. This care and attention is simply not provided by the private sector. The removal of this operational subsidy will mean that the supply of quality, affordable child care will gradually become a thing of the past and that low income earners will be forced into accepting substandard child care. In some cases, they will simply give up. The loss of this subsidy could see a reduction in the quality of child care overall. Child-care assistance is another subsidy paid by the government to aid low income families. This subsidy cost the government $745 million in 1995-96 and will cost $850 million in 1996-97. This subsidy is also available to sole non-working parents for up to 50 hours per week. The government will pay a maximum subsidy of 84 per cent for one child and 91 per cent for two dependent children. I consider this proposal, which allows for 50 hours support per week for non-working sole parents, a slap in the face for the married parent who, I am sure, would also dearly love to have 84 per cent of their child-care expenses paid for by the taxpayer. I have no objection to single mothers having 50 hours of c.hild-care support provided they are in fullbme employment. I believe it is counterproductive to be providing support and encouragement to those who are not in employment. Being a single mum, I can appreciate being able to have a break from your children, but 50 hours a week is only releasing sole nonworking parents from their responsibilities to care for their own children by allowing them to leave their children in child care at the expense of the taxpayer. People will argue that they may need the time to search for work or to attend training programs. Even so, the average working week is 40 hours. Isn't it in the child's best interest to be with the parent, especially when they are under school age? Provide care by all means, but 12 hours per week for non-working sole parents is enough of a burden on the taxpayer. The saving from this would enable the government to retain operational subsidy to long day care centres. This would benefit the community, employment and those parents who are trying to keep their heads above water. It would also mean that in some cases working mums would not be forced into a situation where they will have to give up their jobs and get back on to the social security roundabout. Child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate will be paid by a new Commonwealth service delivery agency from 1 January 1998. At that time families will be given the choice of receiving their child-care payments directly or having them paid to their approved child-care service. Parents and providers will benefit from a streamlined system involving one agency and a significant reduction in red tape. After speaking to a large number of long day care and family day care providers-the people who deal in the industry daily-it is obvious that they are appalled by the government's proposal to pay parents directly. This, I believe, will leave the door wide open for the system to be abused and some parents using the money for purposes other than intended. Thus, children will not be receiving the child-care services, employment will suffer and the taxpayer, again, will be taken for a ride. The government cannot afford to shirk its responsibilities to the taxpayer by passing the buck and saying that it is cutting red tape. We must be fair when making decisions. How can the child-care proposal in its present form be considered fair when, again, the average Australian battlers will be the hardest hit?",50
132,Mr HOLLIS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"Labor put child care on the agenda, taking it from obscurity to an accepted part of affordable quality of life and equity for all. It is well documented that the preschool formative years have a significant and long-lasting effect on the school performance of the child. It cannot be disputed that the greater the enriching experiences a preschool child has and the greater the level of security and safety, the more chance that child has in fulfilling their opportunities in life. It was a clear recognition of this that directly linked operational subsidies to the community based child-care centres. Children spend their formative years in many places not under the direct influence of government regulation, not least in their own home. But, where they spend time in organisations that are directly under the province of government, we have a responsibility to provide a high quality service. This also provides an important opportunity to raise the level of awareness amongst the broader community about high quality child care and raises the acceptable standards of the entire community. To me this is one of the most important imperatives for continuing the operational funding to community based centres. In many areas these organisations are the flagships of quality by which parents can have a benchmark to judge the service they receive. Many parents are also in areas where private providers are few and far between because the economic base or the geographic spread of the population makes private centres less financially viable. It is a great shame that the current government, as part of its first budget, has also cut thousands of places that were planned for new growth. The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 abolishes the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres. I have seen many spurious arguments put forth to justify what is in reality a simple but punishing cost saving. This policy stems directly from the National Commission of Audit and its ideologically driven commitment to the fairy tale of competitive neutrality in the child-care sector. The rhetoric of the report is chilling in its treatment of this service in its oversimplified and short-sighted consumer/provider terminology Quoting directly from the report on this matter, we can see the complete lack of comprehension of quality issues expressed and the sheer leaps in logic that this report presents as some form of unchallengeable truth. On this issue, the report states: Operational subsidies to publicly funded child-care centres result in distortion in the public and private sector supply markets for child care. Achievement of competitive neutrality between publicly funded and private sector suppliers is desirable and will also improve equity in relation to the fees faced by parents using suppliers in either sector. I would personally like to see any of the government members spouting that garbage to a delegation of concerned parents-I have had many concerned parents coming to see me not just here but in my electorate office-and teachers from their local community based long day care centre. I am sure the reception would clearly dispel these myths. Even more insidious, however, is the complete lack of discussion in this document about the way in which changes to funding processes will impact on the quality of the service. I would therefore now like to look a little more closely at the forced options being faced by the community based long day care centres in my own electorate of Throsby. I have received direct representation on this issue by several members of the community based centres in my area, including the South Coast Workers Child Care Centre, the Western Suburbs Child Care Centre, the Wallaroo Child Care Centre, the Warilla Child Care Centre, which is run by the local council, and Illawarra Area Child Care Ltd, which is a not for profit, community based umbrella organisation which sponsors and assists the management of six children's services in the Illawarra, including four, 40 place long day care centres. I also attended a public meeting on this issue at the Wollongong Town Hall on Thursday, 12 September. At all times it has been made quite clear to me that this proposal is putting before these organisations a decision where they are directly facing the choice between significantly increasing costs to parents or significantly decreasing the quality of the service. The South Coast Workers Child Care Centre face a loss of $30,670 in 1997 and $61,341 per year after that. They have indicated that they will not be choosing to compromise quality and so will have to pass on the additional cost to parents. The same situation arises at many other centres. All centres are indicating that they cannot trade off quality for decreased service fees. They are extremely concerned that this will push many families who are just able to meet their current child-care costs out of the system and into unregulated and even backyard services. The impact on families is dramatic. One constituent wrote to me: I am not a political person. I am a single parent defending my pre-schooler's right to quality, affordable child care. My child has been attending the Wallaroo Community based long day care centre full-time while I have been temporarily employed and training in an effort to become selfsufficient and no longer require Social Security payments. Under proposed budget cuts, Wallaroo will lose its operational subsidy and be forced to find other means to replace this money. I was recently informed that my fees may increase by twenty-five dollars per week or otherwise the level and quality of service will have to be drastically organised. This means reducing the number of qualified staff, purchasing less equipment for the children, possibly cancelling places for children under the age of 2 years and no longer providing hot meals. I am already struggling financially and can see no alternative other than to keep my son at home and give up any hopes of becoming independent. This letter is typical of the issues parents and centres are struggling with in their concern that the cuts will be implemented. These are everyday people. They may well not be political people, but they have seen an excellent service-run by the local community, delivering a needed and quality service to them and, most importantly to many of them, to their children-being beaten up by this government. These people can see no reason for this action other than cost cutting. If there is one area where people will not tolerate cost-cutting measures it is in the area of services provided to their children. These organisations are not protesting this decision because it eats away at their profit margin or weakens their investment potential. These are organisations run by dedicated members of communities who have put many years into building a service which their local community can be proud of and which ensures a benchmark standard of excellence. The people protesting these measures are adamant in their commitment to quality and will not trade it off for savings. They are insulted by the government sop of offering money to undertake efficiency reviews to make the organisations more financially effective. Choice in child care for parents should not revolve simply around the purchasing power of the dollar. It is not good enough to say that if you want to spend more you can buy better quality when it comes to the critical years our children spend in preschool facilities. Real choice relies on an educated population who understand the balance of quality and price issues effectively enough to allow them to make informed choices with their money. Community based and government subsidised child-care services have provided the measuring stick for many parents in this field. At the end of the day they may choose not to use a community based centre but, as part of the rereal choice, they should have that option to consider. What happens in reality is that those centres hold excellent reputations in their local communities and are so in demand that many parents who would use them by choice are not able to get places in them. It is an obvious statement to say that an under two-year-old child requires far more supervision than older children. This means a far higher staff to child ratio and therefore significantly increases the costs to the provider. It is no coincidence that this is an area with a huge un met demand problem already. In my own electorate of Throsby, only 25 per cent of the current private centres provide any positions for under two-year-olds. Children with disabilities and children at risk particularly need the option of a quality fully resourced centre to provide for their needs. The families of these children are often already faced with significant out-of-pocket expenses to meet the child's needs and should not have to face personally providing extra funds to the child-care centre to resource a place for their child. The interaction provided is important for the growth of that child and ensures that other children are able to develop the compassion and understanding that we all should have for children in this situation. If this type of cost cutting forces those parents to take their children back into the home, then we have moved a long way backwards in our recognition of the dignity and rights of children. Finally, I would like to comment on the other proposals which change the eligibility and administration of the child-care cash rebate. This scheme was put into place by the Labor government in July 1994. It was the first formal recognition that child care constitutes an essential expense incurred in earning an income. It provided some assistance to working families not benefiting from targeted child-care assistance and some further assistance to those in receipt of child-care assistance. Most significantly, the rebate was not income tested because it was already a direct recognition of the cost of child care as a legitimate work related expense. It was administered as a direct rebate rather than as a tax concession because this allocation is to be paid to families not in direct incomeearning situations, such as those studying, training or, indeed, seeking work. Means testing the child-care rebate is therefore a direct contradiction of the purpose of the rebate in the first place, and it is a clear broken promise by the current government. Over the last decade, we have developed a child-care system in Australia that is of world standard. Much of this achievement has been based on the funding of a system that has ensured quality and equity. To attack this now is short-sighted and self-defeating penny-pinching which can only negate results for all the interested parties. Not least of the children will be directly affected. I totally oppose what the government is proposing.",52
133,Mr OCONNOR,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I oppose the measures in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 that will abolish the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres in my electorate of Corio. There are eight community based child-care centres operated by the City of Greater Geelong and parents who use those facilities will have their child-care costs dramatically increased as a result of John Howard's budget. The coalition made a very explicit promise to the people of Australia before the election. The promise was contained in a letter written to the Australian Early Childhood Association by the then shadow minister for employment, training and family services, David Kemp. Dr Kemp had this to say: The coalition policy also states our continuing support for the community based long day care sector and we regard the operational subsidy as one of the key supports of that sector. And listen to this, Mr Deputy Speaker: The coalition has no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy. Yet here we are barely seven months after the Liberal and National parties won government and they are violating a key promise to many working families and putting affordable, quality child care out of their reach. It is not the only promise they have broken. In aged care, health care, education and jobs, this government-barely seven months in officehas one of the most appalling records of any postwar government. In removing the operational subsidy from community based child-care centres, the Howard government has taken a further step towards the Americanisation of child care-a system regarded as one of the worse in the world because of its high costs, poor standards, low wages and unequal access. The members of the coalition have no appreciation of the high quality of child care provided by community based long day care centres. These centres provide more places for children with special needs and provide extended opening hours for working parents. They are all, staffed by a highly dedicated and qualified staff and cater for small babies as well as older children. It is these centres that will be hit by increased costs with the removal of this operational subsidy. I recently visited several community based long day care centres in my electorate to assess first-hand the potential impact of these changes on the working parents who use those centres. At the Corio Day Care Centre, a dedicated staff of 12 people cater for 60 children coming from 100 families, most of whom are working parents. In allocating access at the centre, priority is given to children of working parents and families with special needs and, of course, single parents studying to improve their economic situation and future opportunities. Fees at these centres have recently increased due to the local council's competitive tendering process. The removal of the Commonwealth's operating subsidy will mean the centre will lose $65,000 in income out of a total operating budget of $488,000. Given that cutting costs further is not an option for the centre, as the centre is already trying to cope with constraints on its funding from local government sources, the only alternative it will have will be to increase fees to parents. A similar situation occurs at the Rosewall Child Care Centre, which I also visited recently. This small centre caters for 25 children at a time, is used by around 40 families and is staffed by four extremely dedicated people. The removal of the operational subsidy will simply mean that the centre's fees will have to increase, to the disadvantage of those working families and single parents who currently use it. But the bad news doesn't end there. From April next year, a means test will apply to child-care centre rebate, leading to further effective cost increases for working families. Add in further normal cost increases that flow from local government sources and I can quite believe the figures presented to this House earlier in this debate by the member for Fremantle, Dr Lawrence, who in quoting the financial effects on her constituents provided estimates of fee increases of between 40 and 50 per cent for a single parent with two children in full-time care. These measures represent a half a billion dollar grab from working families, and the government ought to be ashamed of it and condemned for it. I recently had a very distressed mother Contact me about the impact of increased fees on her own family situation. She has four children, three of school age who require specialised medical attention for physical problems. That constitutes quite a financial drain on the family budget and requires considerable transportation to receive the required medical and educational attention. She relies heavily on community day care facilities to assist in the minding of her fouryear-old while she and her husband seek out the required medical attention for their other children. She has informed me that she faces fee rises of $38 per week, and the family simply cannot afford it. The point I wish to make in this debate is that, when you strip the rhetoric of this budget away and examine the financial impact and direction of many of these government proposals, it is clear that the intent of John Howard's family taxation package, combined with these child-care measures, is to simply drive some of the working women out of the work force back into the home. That is despite the fact that there are women who must, of necessity, work to supplement the inadequate wages received by males in the household. Australian society over the past three decades has changed dramatically, and so has the role of women in that society. The increased participation of women in the work force has been driven in some cases by the increases in educational opportunities for women, which has legitimately raised their the own personal expectations of taking fuller advantages of expanded life choices. For many other women, sheer economic necessity has propelled them to enter the work force to put food on the table, to pay off the home mortgage, and to educate their children. Some key statistics bear out the degree to which women currently participate in the work force. The ABS family national summary of 1996 showed that, in 1985, 45.5 per cent of couples with dependants were both employed. By 1995 this had grown to 57 per cent. Between 1980 and 1995, the labour force participation rate for females increased by nine per cent, from 44.8 to 53.8 per cent. Of course, there are those in the community who bemoan these developments, who seek to deny women the opportunity to work, and who seek to tum the clock back. I am afraid the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is one of those. I was intrigued to read some very interesting material recently outlining the economic benefits to enterprises of people returning to the work force or, conversely, the cost to enterprises when they lost experienced employees. The Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment has estimated labour turnover costs at between 50 and 130 per cent of the past incumbent's salary. In the car industry in 1990 it was estimated it cost $850 per car for each unwanted staff turnover in a 4,000 person factory. I mention this point because there are many women employed in the car industry in my electorate. In the finance sector it was estimated that losing an employee with eight years experience cost $80,000. I mention these examples because there are many in our community who would deny the efficiency gains and the overall economic benefits to enterprises and the nation of an expanded work force with high levels of female participation. In conclusion, let me point out the reality of what these child-care fee increases mean in community based long day care centres. It will mean that many working parents will simply drop out of employment. The important tasks performed by these centres in monitoring children at risk will itself be at risk. The quiet community setting where parents can talk with professionals about their children and get good advice may in the long term be closed off to those parents. For single mothers who do not have family or neighbourhood support, these fee increases will put even one day's care to give these deserving mothers a break from their children out of the reach of many of those single mothers. The simple question will be asked by many women from low income families, 'What is the point of me going to work?' and they will simply drop out of the work force. This legislation represents yet another appalling breach of John Howard's pre-election commitments. He has clearly demonstrated that he is a Prime Minister not to be trusted.  pleased to be speaking on the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. Prior to entering parliament I can recall many discussions about child care. There used to be a view that child care was a women's issue. I have never actually seen child care as being a women's issue; I think it is really a family issue. The availability or non-availability of child care certainly affects women most particularly. When considering this bill, the parliament needs to take note of the changing work patterns occurring in society. Mr Deputy Speaker, when I first entered the work force-I dare say when you first entered it-we all aspired to a permanent job that we might hold for 40-odd years. The reality today is that when people enter the work force it may not be for a full-time job, it may be for a part-time job. Whether you are female or male, you can anticipate periods where you will be in full-time employment, periods where you might be in part-time employment and periods where you might withdraw completely from the work force. Increasingly this is happening to both men and women in our society. For families there can be no more important responsibility than the care and upbringing of their children. In looking at this mobility in the work force, this changing work pattern and the need for workers to be completely retrained for different occupations throughout their lifetimes, the availability of child care becomes absolutely important for families. I contend that child care is exceptionally beneficial for the children involved. Like other speakers, I have to confess that in the past my family has been privileged to be able to utilise child care for our four children. We keep on being abused by government members about our record of 13 years. But one of the achievements that we can point to is the tremendous increase in the availability of child-care places. Much as I am proud of that-and I am sure most members on this side of the House are proud of that-there are still not sufficient places to meet demand, and then there are issues of equity and access to child care. One of the popular refrains these days is to bemoan the fact that single parents may be in receipt of social security benefits and to injunct them to get back into the work force. When I go around my electorate and talk to women in this situation, one of the keys for them re-entering the work force is, in fact, availability of child care. One of the things that I find I am rather horrified about is the fact that there can often be just a marginal difference between them remaining at home or entering the work force and paying for child care. Economically, it is almost a case of indifference-that is, there is hardly a benefit in it and, if there is, it is marginal. But, of course, it does wonders for them and for their self-esteem and confidence, and they are very keen to take up whatever opportunities there are. Regrettably, under this present government, there are going to be decreasing opportunities in the workplace, not increased opportunities. For a whole variety of reasons, child care is important. In our society there is nothing more special than to entrust a family member-whether it is a child or an aged person-into the care and responsibility of others. In child care, entrust very young children into the care of others. We get into some ideological debates. If I say that I have a preference for community based child care, perhaps some people will say that I am being an ideologue. That may be the case. I recognise that there are private child-care providers and that they have a role in our society. But I want to mention some figures about child care in the two local government areas in my electorate. Firstly, Blacktown has 20 long day care centres catering for 1,350 children, three out of school hours programs catering for 93 children and a family day care service catering for 600 children. I might say that the family day care service employs some 142 carers. Secondly, Penrith Council has 17 long day care centres, nine out of school hours centres and one occasional day care centre catering for something like 2,000 children. Penrith claims that they are the child-care capital of New South Wales. As I have said before, I do not get into that debate. I just say that both councils have demonstrated a real commitment to young families in their respective areas because of the number of community based child-care centres that they are involved in. When we say that the opposition is going the to cut out the operational subsidy, it sounds as though it is so many dollars and cents and perhaps it is a very small amount and, after all, aren't we just a whingeing opposition? Let me say that, for Blacktown Council, the amount of the operational subsidy for its centres is $800,000 per annum. For Penrith Council, it is about $740,000 per annum. I know that Blacktown and Penrith are fairly significant councils. Indeed, Penrith-a Liberal controlled council, I might add-was so strapped for cash that it increased the rates by nine per cent this year. I do not have to tell you just what multiples over and above the rate of inflation that represents. The point that I really want to make-and it is not to score political points-is that they just do not have that money available to pick up the shortfall. They cannot say to the federal government, 'Oh well, you have cut you the operational subsidy; we'll pick it up.' They just do not have that spare cash available. So what does that mean? It means that the users of the centre are going to have to pay. We have heard a lot about battlers. I am proud of the fact that I have a pretty large amount of public housing in my electorate. The private housing is often what I would call first level or first time private home owner. In other words, the families have scraped together every cent and probably borrowed to the hilt to get into the house they call their own and pay off their mortgage. So an unforeseen increase like this is just absolutely devastating. To say that it will have no impact is just a lot of bunkum. In fact, these measures, ripping hundreds of millions of dollars out of child care, is one of the most savage attacks on the women of Australia, in particular the women of my electorate and their children, that I have ever seen. We hear a lot about the women who have come onto the government side. I welcome that. Congratulations! But I am puzzled that they should applaud and endorse such a move that has such a devastating effect on women and their children and what they seek for Never them in the world of work. If anything, you would have thought that the government whIpped would have had a more compassionate humane side. Last but not least, it has really been through the commitment of the previous Labor government that we have so many child-care places in the Penrith and Blacktown city council areas. But where are the additional places going to come from? Are they going to come through serendipity? Are we going have some magic-and suddenly there will some child-care places created there? does require a commitment by the government to ensuring that those people who wish to utilise child care for their children, those greatest need. women and families who want to get out into the work force or to return to the work force are able to do so because of the availabilit; of child-care places. There is no commitment in this bill to the sorts of increases that we have enjoyed under the previous government. It is no wonder that so many people have rung me in saId: my office or spoken to me absolutely dumbfounded about the stance of a government that claims to have families as a I really resent this bill. I am certainly opposed to it. I think it turns the clock and the debate back 10 or 20 years. I assure my constituents that I and my colleagues on this side will not give up, have not lost heart and will not lose the great objectives that we have had in the past about child care. We only seek the chance to re-implement them at the first available opportunity.",54
134,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"On this child-care measure, like on all the other budget measures, we have heard government members opposite saying that will somehow improve the system. On this one in particular we have a great gap between the rhetoric and the reality. Firstly, I want go through some of the rhetoric of governcovering ment speakers to date. I will pick couple. The member for Bowman (Mrs West) said in her speech to the House on 31 of last month that she was pleased to repudiate the claims. She also stated: have I witnessed a greater embellishment of the. facts. - he level of scaremongering being up In my local community is reminiscent of the farcical arguments raised over the nursing and home entry contributions. She says that there are no fewer than six child-care centres in a two-kilometre radius. She then states: It is for this reason, and not for those claimed by some, that centres will close. In other words, there are too many of them. to This is the rhetoric-we are scaremongering be and there are too many centres. The member It really for Canning (Mrs Johnston) said: ... we have ensured that child-care assistance is equitable and goes to those families who are in The removal of the operational subsidy from the community based child-care centres redresses the imbalance in government subsidies and removes a fund significant inequity for families ... Again more rhetoric. The member for Parkes (-r Cobb), who has a far-flung electorate, I am disappointed with the opposition's tactic of scaring parents by saying that fees will rise by special priority. gross amounts. Those opposite also talk about centres closing. The odd centre has always closed from time to time. This is what government members are putting forward: the system will be improved; then: is no real problem; it is not going to do any harm; and we on this side are scaremongering and not being genuine. Now for some of the reality. I would like to read today a letter from the Maitland Child Care Centre Inc. because their member currently is not here. He has been overseas for a this week or two and he cannot do it. He is a member of the government. I am sure that, if he were here, he would read this letter himto self to talk about the reality in Maitland. The note to me from Anne Hum, the out a centre's director, states: From recent discussions with our centre's auditor our centre will be retrenching 2 staff to help cope with the loss of operational subsidy. For our management to retrench these people we are looking at a payout figure for 2 staff of $39,874 ... I can't see how our centre will remain open. The letter to Mr Baldwin, which was forwarded to me for my use, states: I am writing to inform you of the impact that the withdrawal of Operational Subsidy will have on our Centre. Our Centre has been operating for 13 years. We were the first long day care service in Maitland and are housed in what were servants quarters and a horse stable. We have renovated our buildings in recent years to make them more user friendly and to comply with State Regulations and the Federal Accreditation Scheme. We have created a ""homely"" atmosphere which many of our users say is what attracts them to our Centre. Our Centre has a staff of 10. Eight staff are trained and one is a trainee. We also have a cleaner and clerical assistant. We offer a quality preschool education program for the 3-5 yr olds and we take 28 children in this age group. Our Nursery (0-3 yr olds) devise a developmentally appropriate program on a daily basis for 12 children aged 0-3 years old. Currently our fees are $27.00 for a child in Preschool/day, $28.00/day for a child in our Nursery. For this fee children have linen and morning tea provided and drinks throughout the day. Our Centre does not provide meals because of the kitchen in our Centre-not commercial. Our Centre is managed by parent users. Our Centre has their A.G.M. each February so we have 5 weeks from the start of our year to coerce, entice 8 new members to our Committee. We usually just have enough parents to fill the positions. I pose the question: How many small businesses do you know that ask their unqualified clients to meet 'monthly' for no money and make decisions eg: hire and fire staff, devise policies and procedures, know five different Employment A wards and do the wages and budget? The brave people that take on this role are dedicated parents that care about their child's care and edUcation, not owners of the centres that want $$s in their pockets at the end of the year. We fundrai.se endlessly throughout the year to give our children ""extras"" eg: new carpet, more choice in toys, inservice for staff. With the loss of our $37,000 subsidy things would change dramatically. Our qualified staff will be replaced by untrained - taff, our fees will rise from $28.00/day to $32.00 In January '97, $36.00 in June/July, our enrolments - ill drop as many parents can not afford the Increase, and our Centre may even be forced to close. Your Government says that by withdrawing the subsidy it makes things equitable for both private and community based long day care centres. In what ways are we equal? * Private centres are run by owners not parent users. * Private centres operate to make a profit, community centres break even. * Private centres in Maitland don't offer care for 0-3 year olds. * Private centres don't offer food like many long day care centres do. If we are to be ""equal"" * Fund us to attract trained financial advisers on our Committee. * Fund us to provide care for children aged 0 to 3 years. * Fund us to have a cook and supply nutritious meals. Then we will be equal. Come and visit our Centre and see for yourself. We welcome visitors-best time 9 am to 12 noon, 5 days/week, 48 wks/yr. We hope that you take up our invitation and visit our centre. I hope that your Government consider the impact the abolition of Operational Subsidy will have on Community Long Day Care Centres. That is a very moving letter. It is not dramatic. It is not sensationalised. It is not scaremongering. It does not exaggerate. It does not overdo things. It basically lays out to a member of parliament, to a member of the government, what is happening in that centre. We are all getting letters like that from people all through our electorates, but not once have we heard a government member bring forward what is coming to their offices. Not once have we heard any of them own up to the damage, harm and pain they are causing and the uncertainty they are engendering. The dishonesty of this legislation and of those opposite who are pushing it, like lemmings, over a cliff is appalling. It is unfortunate the member whose electorate covers Maitland is not here because I am sure he would have read the letter into the Hansard himself. In his absence, I have done that task for him. One does not need any more arguments. It was all there. The tragedy is that this government is adamant that it will persist with the legislation when it really should be looking at other ways of saving money, if that is its objective. I join with my colleagues in opposing what is a quite nasty and unwarranted amendment to the act.",58
135,Mr BEVIS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I would first like to thank the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) for his courtesy in cutting short his speech to give me the opportunity to make some comments in this debate on the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill. When I looked at the speakers list for this bill I noticed there were 14 speakers listed-13 from the opposition and only one from the government. Of the 14 people who have spoken on this matter this week, 13 are from the opposition. Only one government member would stand in this parliament this week and seek to support the bill that is now before the parliament. That is for good reason. They know this is a bad piece of legislation. They know this hurts a lot of Australian people. They know it is not just hurting Australian people in taking money from their pockets, but it is affecting their lifestyles. This is not just a piece of legislation that takes money from Australians from whom it should not, because it certainly does that. This is a piece of legislation that goes to the very lifestyle choices that Australian families make. This is a piece of legislation that is designed to engineer an outcome in families that happens to suit a model that those in the government believe should be the prevailing view, believe should be the dominant position, of family activity in this country. It is pernicious in that respect. It is also harmful in the way in which it has focused upon community child-care centres. It has been focused deliberately to attack the very heart of the community child-care system within this country. The decision to remove operational subsidies is one issue that has justifiably brought great criticism from one comer of the country to the other. Parents deliberately choose to send their children to a community child-care centre rather than a private care provider. They do it for many reasons. Having spoken to many parents who have been involved in this decision making process, many of them do it because they want their child to be in a community centre where they, as parents, have a direct involvement in the administration and operation of the centre and in the delivery of services as part of the community, not simply as a purchaser of goods and services as they might if they were buying a bottle of coca-cola. They make a decision very consciously that their child's care should be something they have a say in, even though they may not be there for the hours that the child is in care. This government is deliberately striking at the choice those parents make. It is deliberately targeting community child-care centres. In my electorate in the central city area of Brisbane I have a range of community childcare centres that cover the full socio-economic bracket. One of those child-care centres, Koolyangarra, specialises in providing assistance to low income families, particularly to migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds and to Aboriginal and Islander families. That child-care centre, because of its target client group, ensures that its fees are at the lowest possible level so it can provide support which the community values. That community knows that without that support many of those young children would grow up in much worse circumstances. With these changes and with the difficulties they have confronted they have approached the department. Indeed, I have written to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who is at the table, about their plight. When they approached the department the caring shoulder they leant on said, 'Find another clientele. Find someone else who can afford to pay higher rates.' In other words, they said, 'Tum away those children who come to you from difficult family backgrounds, from deprived socio-economic backgrounds. Put them back on the streets and go and find someone who can afford to pay a higher bill.' That has been the response from this government. To the best of my knowledge, I have not got a response from the minister at all to the letter which I sent in relation to this matter. Given that the minister is at the table, that is something she might like to take account of. During the last few months, I have attended a number of meetings at community childcare centres with providers, with parents and with others. I have been touched by the concern they raised. I have been touched by the stories they tell of the decisions they arrive at. One of the things that stands out-it is a bit like this debate-is the absence of any government members. One of the most recent meetings I attended was not in my electorate; it was in an adjoining electorate, in the seat of Lilley. The community child-care people there had arranged a meeting. They sent invitations in tum to some five or six Liberal members of parliament from Brisbane. We all know there is no shortage of Liberal members from Queensland in this federal parliament at the moment. Not one of them would tum up--not a single, solitary one would tum up at that meeting. Even the member whose electorate it was in would not tum up. The child-care centre where we held the meeting was literally across the road and two houses from the local federal member, the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace). Mrs Moylan-She sent her apology.",60
136,Mr BEVIS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,She could not be bothered to be there because she was at a school fete that morning and thought that the school fete was that important she should stay there for the whole day. Mrs Moylan-That is not correct.,61
137,Mr BEVIS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,That is absolutely right. Mrs Moylan-That is incorrect.,61
138,Mr BEVIS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"That is absolutely right because I was there and I spoke to the people concerned. Let me tell you that that is what the people in the child-care centre understood, too. There was a very telling tale mentioned by one of the parents. She subsequently wrote to me. I want to read from part of that letter. She was referring to her concern about the changes this government is implementing and talking about her own experiences. She said: But there was a time when we couldn't access a c-ld care centre, before privately owned centres eXIsted and when community based child care was so rare that a place was almost impossible to secure. To cut the story short, she entered into what she describes as a 'backyard' arrangement with a friend. She said: To be quite blunt, it was this situation which led to the death of our daughter at just 15 months of age. She died as a result of injuries inflicted on her by the care provider, a woman who took on child care as a means of supplementing her husband's income These people are concerned about what your government is doing and you should be ashamed of what you are doing as minister in this area.

139,Unknown,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. Clause agreed to. Clause 2 postponed. Clause 3 agreed to. Schedule 1.,61
140,Ms MACKLIN,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga) (8.01 p.m.)This schedule seeks to eliminate the operational subsidy that is currently paid to community based long day care and the opposition has indicated that it will be opposing this schedule for a number of very important reasons. The first, I would have to say, is that one of the roles an opposition has is to keep a government to its promises. This government made it very clear before the election that they intended to keep the operational subsidy for community based long day care. The effect of removing the operational subsidy will be that centres will have two choices. Either they will put up their fees by anything between $20 and $25 a week per child or-this is the one the government favours-they will have to reduce their services. One service all the community based centres around Australia are considering removing is the more extensive, highly qualified staff that they have in their centres. The effect will be a reduction in the quality of care children in community based centres have in this country. Secondly, parents will be required to either pay more for food or provide lunches, fresh fruit, morning tea and afternoon tea for their children in the centres. That will mean that parents will indirectly be paying more for their children's care. Other services that centres are talking about removing are nappy services and other services that in any other place would be considered essential services. To say that somehow this move is going to improve efficiency I can only say is very short-sighted and is not a view of efficiency I can understand. This view of efficiency equates poorer quality, more children per staff member, poorly qualified staff and lesser services with efficiency-a very funny definition. What is very important for those members opposite to recognise is that all around Australia there are people writing to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and me about their very grave concerns of these changes. I have letters from all the states and territories of Australia. In the short time available, I will choose a couple of paragraphs from some of them to show the huge concern that exists in the community about this change. It is a very serious change because it is going to abolish the notion of community based long day care in this country. I would like to quote from a letter to the Prime Minister, a copy of which the writer sent to me. She is from Western Australia and she says: While I am aware that your govemmentshe is writing to the Prime Ministeris obsessed with the notion that almost all goods and services can be provided better and cheaper by the ""private sector"", in child care that is simply the case and is never likely to be. You have completely underestimated the role community based child care centres play in upholding the quality of service to ensure that our children have the best of care. The community based centres have set the benchmarks for quality care of children, industry leadership and innovation. These are the things that we will lose as a result of this operational subsidy being abolished by this government. This is something the now government, before the election, led the community based child-care sector to believe would not happen. She goes on to say: For many families like ours, the selection of a carer for our children is not just a market commodity, we want a place that provides a framework of fundamental values to do with family and community, social responsibility and somewhere where we can feel we can have a strong input about the care provided. Our community based centre provides this but is now threatened by your budget cut. This is the sentiment that is reflected all around Australia. If we go to New South Wales, to a completely different type of organisation, the Benevolent Society of New South Wales-as it says at the top of their letterhead, 'Caring for Australians since 1813'-also says to the government: The issue of child care is far more complex than this policy suggests-this policy of seeing efficiency from the narrow framework of getting rid of a subsidy just to save money. As their letter says, an operational subsidy recognises-(Time expired)",61
141,Mrs MOYLAN,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"The operational subsidy is currently paid on a non means tested basis to community centres, even though they currently provide only 30 per cent of all centre based care. Community based centres cater for about 70,000 families. Operational subsidy has never been paid to private centres, despite the fact that they provide 70 per cent of centre based care, catering for more than 220,000 Australian families. Importantly, all special or high cost services provided by community child-care centres are also provided by the private child-care sector. Accordingly, there is no justification to continue with the differential in government not assistance between the two sectors, clearly prejudicing one group of parents. The removal of the un targeted operational subsidy from community child-care centres removes a significant inequity in government assistance that currently exists between families using the different facilities. The member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) implied that the private sector is not subject to the same standards as the community based sector. Quality is assured in both sectors through the state and territory licensing regulations and the Commonwealth government's quality improvement and accreditation system. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) can reassure constituents that the government is committed to maintaining accreditation and to extending it to outside school hours care and, in particular, to family day care, which is a very flexible option. Operational subsidy has been retained in family day care and in occasional care. I heard one of the members opposite saying that we are going to cut all of the subsidies to all child-care services. The fact is that we will be spending $5 billion in this term of government on child-care services. We will be retaining operational subsidy for the family day care program, for occasional care, for outside school hours care, for the multifunctional services and the multifunctional Aboriginal children's services. These services are crucial to meeting the diverse needs of Australian families. Importantly for family day care, the operational subsidy fund is a central coordinating unit which monitors quality and supports carers. The government also provides training and support for family day carers to provide good quality care in the home environment and to family day care coordination units to assist them to provide quality care. The private sector cares for almost twice as many babies, almost twice as many special needs children and more children from low income families than the community based long day care sector. Even though the private sector provides these services, their fees, on an average, are only $4 a week higher than the community based centres, and of course they operate without the operational subsidy. Savings have been directed and we have been very responsible on this. I heard the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) quoting from letters, but I have to say that we have spoken, along with my department, to many of the community based sectors-some of the big groups operating community based long day care-and they are working constructively with us in a responsible manner to ensure that they maintain a high standard of care and that fees are not unduly affected by this measure. We have done this in a responsible way. We have allowed plenty of time for restructuring to take place. We have directed much of the savings from this measure into other areas. Over the next four years $10.9 million will be provided to fund new places in rural and remote areas. After all, these are the parents in our community who have been most affected by the economic conditions brought about by the former government. These are people who have suffered drought, who have suffered economic hardship and who also have not been, under the former government, receiving very much assistance at all in terms of child-care facilities. We will provide $10 million per year, and $31 million has been set aside to support the inclusion of children with high level and additional needs, particularly those children who have disabilities. We have set aside $8.3 million over the two years to enable community centres to obtain financial and management advice on options to help them restructure their services. We will also provide $4 million per annum to ensure that families in areas of economic disadvantage will maintain access to child care. This has been a responsible measure. We have not pulled the rug out from under them, as the former government was intending to do. We have done it in a responsible and restructured manner, allowing plenty of time for this restructuring to take place without disadvantage to the families who care to use, and choose to use, the community based centres. (Time expired)",62
142,Mr JENKINS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I join the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) in opposing schedule 1 on the basis that abolishing the operating subsidy for community long day care is a very retrograde step. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, the struggle for affordable quality child care has been long and arduous for many of the families in working-class areas such as the area that I represent. They are battling families-the battlers so championed by the coalition in the run-up to the election. The abolition of operating subsidies to community based child-care centres is a measure which hits hard at the aspirations of these families. Another reason I wish to take the small time that is available to me to speak to this measure is that I have a feeling of deja vu about some of the aspects of this debate. In 1985, when I was the President of the then Shire of Whittle sea, I was in the position where, as the leader of a Labor controlled council, I found myself in dispute with the state Labor government and the federal Labor government. The basis of that was that we as a municipality had decided, as part of improving the access to child care, to build a long day child-care centre. We had the building, but we found ourselves in dispute over the operating subsidy. What was the basis of that dispute? It was the same sort of basis that we are seeing trotted out today. I went through some of the cuttings from that time. There were allegations that expenditure on child-care centres was excessive. There were allegations that, if organisations did not receive the subsidies, they would have an incentive to reduce costs. There were allegations that families would be able to pay the higher fees and that sponsoring bodies might be more capable of putting in additional moneys. The argument was false then-and it remains false. The fact is that community child care has displayed the type of benchmarks that were necessary. At that time, in 1985, we were seeing the federal government not willing to cover the costs of the type of child care that was required under state legislation. We have had this battle. We have won this battle, and now, through this budgetary measure, we want to be taken a step back. It is wrong. It is only through community child care that we are able to give families in the suburbs that I represent access to quality child care. To now place those child-care centres under pressure is mean-spirited indeed. What are the alternatives? The alternatives are to increase fees. I would contend that for the families who use these centres it would be a great hardship and very difficult. Are we to see the committees of management of these centres now look at such issues as the staff ratio of qualified staff to non-qualified staff? As we contend in this debate, the community sector has shown the lead by having ratios that are over and above the standards set by the states. This is what people would like to see. It is a matter of choice. It is a matter of being able to choose to take their children to centres such as this. Because of the special needs of such areas as Thomastown West and Lalor West in my electorate-basic working class suburbs-without access to community child care they would have to go back to the bad old days of backyard operators. There should also be the ability to adjust the ratio based on the age of the children who are within the centres. These things will place pressure upon the centres. The council was able to place the centre I have been talking about in the hands of a community committee of management. It is now run not by the council but by the community committee of management. The people who are managing these centres on a voluntary basis are going to have to contend with difficult issues. If the minister is fair dinkum about the type of transitional arrangements that she has spoken about, I hope we will see areas such as in my electorate amongst those assisted. If this measure goes through, I am worried that these things will not be properly targeted. (Time expired) Question put: That schedule 1 be agreed to. The House divided.

143,Ms MACKLIN,AYES PAIRS,"I move opposition amendment No.3: (3) Schedule 2, item 15, page 7, line 28, omit ""not"". This is a very important issue and one which those opposite should listen to. They might also listen to the views of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), because they will discover that the minister actually agrees with our amendment, as it actually corrects a mistake in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill. The original bill intended to give the Health Insurance Commission an openended power to defer making a decision about a claim for the child-care cash rebate. So, if the commission did nothing, people would not be paid the child-care cash rebate that they would be entitled to. That, of course, would have meant that families, parents, would have been guilty until proven innocent. That is obviously something which, I am pleased to say, the government did not intend. Nevertheless, it is a very important matter. It behoves those opposite who are carrying on to actually listen and take a bit of notice of a very important change that will make sure that we do not have to come back into this place and debate it once again. Amendment agreed to.",65
144,Ms MACKLIN,AYES PAIRS,"I move opposition amendment No.4: (4) Schedule 2, page 8, line 30 to page 13, line 13, omit item 18. This part of schedule 2 seeks to introduce a means test to the child-care cash rebate for the first time. Once again, this is yet another broken promise by this government. ",65
145,Ms MACKLIN,AYES PAIRS,"As one of my colleagues says, one of many. In its election manifesto the coalition said: The Coalition has long supported the recognition of the costs of child care associated with employment. They went on to say: A Coalition government will maintain the nonmeans tested childcare cash rebate. Child care, as the coalition apparently readily agreed to before the election, is a legitimate work related expense. Both parents cannot work without decently provided child care. Senator Newman, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, has conceded that child care is a legitimate work related expense. But this government, in breaking yet another promise it went to the election with, has changed its mind. What they are saying now is, 'We don't think it is a legitimate work related expense. We think the whole amount spent on child care should be reduced.' Something the minister failed to mention in her remarks earlier is that this government is reducing the amount spent on child care by $500 million-$500 million that will have to come out of the pockets of parents. On the coalition's logic, why shouldn't highly paid men who claim tax deductions for expensive tools, or lawyers who claim for their professional libraries, or politicians who claim for whatever they claim for be subject to the means test? We are not in here debating that issue because this government does not want to address this front on. It does not want to take into account that it is a legitimate work related expense, that women who work have to take out expensive child care. Certainly, with this government, they will be paying a lot more for child care. They will be paying the $500 million out of their pockets. What this government wants to do is make sure that we yet again have the debate which we actually solved while we were in government. What you will see come out of this decision is a claim for tax deductibility of child care-something that I would hope nobody in this House would support because of the regressive nature of such a move. The rebate recognised that child care was a legitimate work related expense, but it was not introduced in a way that gave much more benefit to those at the top end of the income scale and zero to those who did not earn any taxable income. This is another retrograde step, another broken promise, another message to working women that their place is not in the work force but in the home-go home, do not bother about child care. This is Howard style political correctness and we will not have a bar of it.",65
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES PAIRS,"Mr Vaile)Before I call the Minister for Family Services, I might suggest that the member for Sydney go and get his jacket on. It is all right to be in here in a division without it, but the Deputy Speaker has ruled that you should be properly attired.",66
147,Mrs MOYLAN,AYES PAIRS,"We do recognise that child care is a legitimate workplace expense. This government has not abolished the rebate, as stated by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). Tile rebate remains available to all eligible families. Ms Macklin-Means tested.",66
148,Mrs MOYLAN,AYES PAIRS,"You do not know the meaning of 'means test'. We have not abolished the rebate. However, the government considers that it is only fair and equitable that higher income earners make a contributionand it is a small contribution-to their childcare costs. Under the changes announced to the rebate, families with incomes below the new family tax initiative cut-offs of $70,000 for one child, rising by $3,000 for each additional child, will continue to receive a 30 per cent rebate, while families with incomes above those limits will be restricted to a rebate of 20 per cent. This measure reduces benefits only for families in the top 20 per cent of family incomes in Australia. We have a great number of unmet needs out there in the community. As a government, we have a responsibility to ensure equitable evenness in the distribution of child-care subsidies. I find it puzzling that the opposition is so keen to promote the interests of higher income earners but does not believe that higher income earners should draw any comfort from this stance. Labor appears to have a more sinister agenda for higher income earners, as hinted at by the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), who was adamant in his claim that high income people do not need child-care facilities.",66
149,Mr ROBERT BROWN,AYES PAIRS,"I just want to make the point that, while the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) denied that the claims made by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) were correct, she has simply confirmed that they were. She has indicated that the cut-off point is $70,000. The differential treatment of families below and above that figure indicates that quite clearly a means test is being applied. The member for Jagajaga quoted directly from the manifesto that government parties used prior to the last election when she said that the coalition said: The Coalition has long supported the recognition of the costs of child care associated with employAbbott, A. J. ment. And: A Coalition government will maintain the nonmeans tested childcare cash rebate. Quite clearly, the government parties are not doing that. The government is repudiating another very clear, unqualified undertaking that was given in its own manifesto. The litany of broken promises gradually being added to by this government is bringing it into serious disrepute. It is not just a matter of political dishonesty; it is an increasing example of the way in which the Australian people were hoodwinked and were taken for mugs by this government and, increasingly, they are becoming aware of it. All of these examples will come back to haunt the coalition. Question put: That the amendment (Ms Macklin's) be agreed to. The House divided.

150,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,"I move opposition amendment No.5: (5) Schedule 2, item 22, page 14, line 26, omit ""Penalty: 20 penalty units"". The reason we are moving this amendment is that I want to draw the government's attention to section 60 of the substantive act which already has a considerable section to it. It is headed 'Knowingly make false or misleading statements'. The penalties in that clause that go to false or misleading statements, material and all the rest of it-I will not go through the section in the act-already impose a penalty on those who seek to do the things that this bill is adding another penalty to. We will pursue the amendment on the basis that there is already a provision in the substantive act. Amendment negatived. Schedule, as amended, agreed to. Postponed clause 2 agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading",68
151,Mrs MOYLAN,NOES,"by leave-I move: That the bill be now read a third time. The coalition has established a strategic direction for child care which is sustainable in the long term, offers greater flexibility to parents and protects the benefits of low and middle income earners while ensuring that high income earners who can afford to make a greater contribution to their child-care costs do so. The opposition's failure to support the key measures in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 reflects Labor's arroNOES gant disregard for mainstream Australiafamilies who, for the last 13 years, have been struggling to make ends meet-and its lack of PAIRS concern for ensuring equity and fairness to all. Labor believes that high income earners should be entitled to the same benefits as low income earners, that subsidies should be paid to community based care centres, irrespective of people's income, and that 220,000 families in private long day care-that is 70 per cent of families in centre based care-should be ignored and receive fewer subsidies than other families. The coalition does not accept this position and I do not believe that the majority of Australian families do either. The measure contained in the bill eliminates Labor's inequities, treating families who use community based long day care no differently from the majority of families who use private long day care. Labor has taken a conscious decision to support the current flawed system and has run a deliberate and irresponsible scare campaign aimed at frightening parents into believing that they will be worse off because of the government's measures. Nowhere has this been better evident than in the course of this particular debate. I welcome this opportunity to repudiate many of the claims that have been made by the opposition both in this place and within the general community. Since the budget, the opposition has told families that, because of the removal of operational subsidy from community based long day care, services will close or fees will rise. At one point, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) was claiming that fees could rise by more than $50 per week. In the course of this debate we have heard a number of case studies from the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) and her colleagues suggesting that all families using community based long day care will have to pay extra amounts. The member for Fremantle even cited one example where costs would go up by over $55 per week. I would strongly encourage parents to challenge claims that fees will necessarily increase, certainly to that extent, because of the government's budget measures. Families cannot and should not trust the figures being touted by the opposition because every time we hear the opposition speak about these it is a different figure. It has ranged from $15 a week extra to $58 a week and beyond. They cannot be relied upon on those figures. Nor should parents accept claims by centres that they have had to increase fees because of new government policies. I am aware of at least one situation where a child-care centre has written to parents in those terms. It said: This centre is increasing its fees in January, three months before any changes come into effect, and even though it is a private centre which is not affected by the removal of operational subsidy. I believe Australian parents must challenge the claims of many of the centres that are threatening to put up fees immediately and blaming this government's budget measures in that respect. Suggestions by the opposition that all families with children in community based long day care centres will face massive fee increases are a gross embellishment of the truth. I want to make the point that 44 per cent of families using private sector care are on maximum child-care assistance, compared with 39 per cent of families in community based long day care. It is inequitable that none of these parents receive the same level of subsidy as the parents using the community based centres. The opposition has not been able to produce a single reason to justify this discrimination. Throughout the course of the debate on this bill, the opposition has referred to other childcare measures that are not contained in this legislation, but I feel compelled to address those measures because there are gross misrepresentations of fact in some cases. The opposition has unfairly represented the 50hour cap that will apply to child-care assistance as a disincentive to work. The member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) claimed that, if parents work long hours, the Howard government is now saying that they have to pay full costs once child-care goes over 50 hours a week. Nothing could be further from the truth. This initiative places a weekly limit of 50 hours per child on the amount of care attracting child-care assistance, unless families genuinely require that extra care to meet their work related commitments. Families who use more than 50 hours of care for work related reasons, including travel time to and from study or work, training or looking for work, will continue to be able to claim child-care assistance for that care. The vast majority of families use much less than 50 hours of care per week. The average is only 26 hours. Currently, though, 22,500 families are using less than 50 hours of care but are being charged by their service providers for receiving child-care assistance for more than 50 hours. That means this government is paying out for services that are not being rendered. I do not believe any responsible government can continue to take that course. In fact, only 4,500 families use the hours that they have booked over 50 hours. It is blatantly unfair to expect Australian taxpayers to subsidise care that is being charged to the government but is not being used. In that respect, I wish to table and have included in Hansard a chart which clearly shows the situation in regard to 50 hours. Leave granted. The graph read as followsNA 12000r------------------------------------------------------10000 8000 z - WORK RELATED w CARE - CHILDREN a: c....I PAID s: u 6000 II. 0 0 z 4000 2000 0-1-.........",68
152,Mrs MOYLAN,DISTRIBUTION OF CHILDREN,"Opposition members also attacked the government's decision to give parents across service types the choice, from 1 January 1998, to have their child-care benefits paid directly to them or their childcare service. While child-care assistance may currently be paid to providers, like the childcare cash rebate, which is already paid to parents, child-care assistance is not intended to benefit services but to assist parents with the cost of their care. That is what this is all about. It is time we got back to first principles here. I find the suggestion that child-care providers will lose their certainty of funding because of this measure highly offensive. The implication is that families will not use their child-care payments to pay their child-care fees. The message coming clearly from the Labor Party is that the government should pay services because parents cannot be trusted to pay their bills. Why stop at child care? The logical extension of that argument, of the rationale put up by the member for Fremantle, BY HOURS USED AND PAID> 50 HRS OF CARE (WORK RELATED CARE, CA CLIENTS ONLY) c WORK RELATED CARE - CHILDREN NA 51 52 53 54 55 56 NA is that parents should not receive any pay cheques; rather, the government should pay people's bills, because they might spend the money on something else. In other words, as the member for Fremantle said in her opening speech, parents cannot be trusted. I think that is highly offensive. Parents who receive child-care assistance already must pay the minimum fee plus any gap fee. Child-care assistance is not payable unless the family pays its contribution. Paying benefits to parents clearly acknowledges that families are the intended beneficiaries, not the services. Much has also been made by the opposition of the Economic Planning Advisory Commission's interim report on child care. Contrary to the opposition's claims, the report is not the government's blueprint. It is an interim report only and it was commissioned by the former Labor government. Someone from the other side said when he was in government: The report will assist government in planning to meet demand, and it will aid both governments child-care providers. These are not my words but those of the former Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul Keating. I am not usually one to agree with the former Prime Minister, but on this occasion I am more than happy to use his words: The interim and the final EPAC report will assist and aid but they will not determine our thinking and they will not determine the final shape policy. This government is committed to delivering a fair and equitable child-care system and to redressing the deficiencies of that system that we inherited and to making the hard decisions that Labor seemed incapable of taking. I have to remind the House that, although we have removed the operational subsidy from the community based long day care, $526 million in operational subsidy will be provided over the next four years to support services such as family day care, occasional care, outside school hours care and multifunctional care. Ms Macklin-But not long day care. Why discriminate against them?",70
153,Mrs MOYLAN,HOURS OF CARE,"Because it is a very different kind of service. We have heard the argument that this government is going to drive women out of the work force, but the fact is that over the next four years this government will commit approximately $5 billion to the provision of children's services. We are committed to giving Australian families, in particular women, better and fairer child care. Our national planning framework will overcome Labor's ad hoc planning system, ensuring that families have better access to appropriate child care where and When it is needed. I am pleased by the support the entire sector has shown for the government's initiative in that planning framework. This measure contained in the bill removes once and for all the inequities and discrimination that has characterised Labor's child-care system. We have listened to Australian parents. We are committed to delivering a child-care system that is fair and equitable to all Australian families.",71
154,Ms MACKLIN,HOURS OF CARE,"Jagajaga) (9.04 p.m.)and What this government is not listening to is how important this operational subsidy and community based long day care are to our communities. What this government is not telling us is how many community based centres are going to have to close or where they will close. They are not going to say how many of these centres will have to pass on the effects of this measure to parents in the of our form of increased fees. The government cannot or will not tell us how many parents will pay more in child-care costs and most certainly in payment for food, nappies and so on. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) does not think that the 50-hour change will have any effect. Of course it will have an effect, because it will affect the continuity of care that will be provided to children in community based long day care.",71
155,Mr CADMAN,HOURS OF CARE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would be reluctant to pull this debate to a close, but I am willing to do that unless we can have an understanding that it is going to cease in the very near future. I will do that; the member needs to understand it.",71
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HOURS OF CARE,Mr Vaile)The question is that the bill be read a third time. The member for Jagajaga is in order.,71
157,Ms MACKLIN,HOURS OF CARE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Some very important issues need to be raised in finalising this debate. We have had from the minister a discussion about the impact of the 50-hour change. It will have a very serious impact on private centres as well as community based centres. What they are all saying to me is that they will not be able to make sure that they have staff on tap, available for parents to meet their changing, flexible work needs. What it is going to mean is an increase in the casualisation of workers in the child-care sector. We are going to see child-care workers coming and going throughout the day. These are workers that are already on low wages. These are workers that are already highly dedicated to their task. What this measure is going to do is make their working conditions even worse. The most important thing for those workers is making sure that they deliver a high quality service to the children in their care. They will not be able to do this with this change to 50 hours. It is a very serious matter. It is a matter that the private sector has raised, along with the community based sector. It is not something that can be just swept under the carpet and done away with as a budget measure. This government says that it wants to provide flexible long day care for children in this country. It will not be able to do that with the introduction of this measure. The minister has also talked extensively in her comments about quality. She says that quality is assured, that accreditation will continue. I hope that means that she will repudiate the small business task force, which recommends to this government that the Commonwealth get out of accreditation, that the Commonwealth not get involved, that accreditation be left up to the market. That is not the sort of accreditation system that we want. That is not the sort of accreditation system that anybody in the child-care sector wants. It is certainly not what parents want. Not one parent in Australia would want to see the Commonwealth walk away from its commitment to the delivery of high quality child care. So I call on the government to immediately repudiate the Small Business Deregulation Task Force recommendation that says that the Commonwealth get out of it. I have never seen a more short-sighted recommendation as that coming from the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. Of course, the government only see things from the perspective of the market. This is not a market; this is about children. This is about making sure that our children are cared for-something that we on this side of the House are proud to have stood up for and will continue to do.  of order: I was puzzled when the honourable member for Mitchell got up on a point of order. I could not understand the point of order that he was making. It seemed to me that he was issuing a threat.",71
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HOURS OF CARE,Mr Vaile)There was no point of order.  Deputy Speaker?,72
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HOURS OF CARE,"Yes, I ruled that way and there is no point of order now. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 October, on motion by Dr Wooldridge: That the bill be now read a second time.",72
160,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"The Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996 is the bill we don't have to have. There is no doubt that, with a change of government and with the discretion that the current Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has-discretion that has been confirmed in recent court hearing after recent court hearing-there is no impediment to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge proceeding. The introduction of this legislation can fairly be described as the 'Ian MCLachlan payback bill'. This is the legislation that this government is introducing in an attempt to vindicate the disgraceful performance by the current Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) when he was shadow minister that led to him resigning from the front-bench. It is a situation that is absolutely unnecessary. It is interesting that tomorrow the minister is launching a book in relation to the Hindmarsh Island affair and it is interesting that the cheer squad is in the gallery this evening. I think it is fair to say that the Minister for Defence would be more productive spending his time looking after his portfolio than introducing a bill into this parliament that is absolutely unnecessary. Last week a financial report for 1995-96 from the Department of Defence was tabled in this House. That showed that the military budget blew out by $100 million in the last financial year. You would have been better off putting your attention to bringing the Department of Defence into line and maybe sending in a special auditor. There are some amendments that are circulating that I will be moving during this debate. They support the view that we hold that this bill is totally unnecessary. At the conclusion of the second reading debate, I will be moving: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the construction of the Hindmarsh Island bridge can now proceed without further delay and without prejudicing the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975"". If we are unsuccessful in that amendment, I will be moving in the consideration in detail stage the following amendment: (1) Page 1, after clause 2, insert the following new clause: 2A Racial Discrimination Act to prevail (1) For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly declared to be the intention of the Parliament that the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act shall prevail over the sions of this Act. (2) Nothing in this Act shall be taken to authorise any conduct, whether legislative, executive or sistent with the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. (2) Clause 3, page 2, after the definition of pit area add the following definition: Racial Discrimination Act means the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. If the government were fair dinkum, they would have no problems supporting that amendment during the consideration in detail stage of the bill. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has declared in this House that his government will respect the provisions and the spirit of the Racial Discrimination Act. Coalition policy says that we should respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. We had a debate last week in relation to racial tolerance in this country where both sides of the House, it is fair to say, supported the resolution. It is not in dispute in this country any more that all major political parties have it in their policies to respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. This bill does not do that. If the government says that it does, then it should have no problem supporting the amendment in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act that I propose to move. If the government says it is unnecessary, then it just becomes a motherhood resolution. In the current climate, it is necessary to send a signal out to the community. Let us put it beyond doubt: if the Minister for Defence says it is unnecessary, he should have no problem in supporting it. If it is unnecessary, all it is is a statement of principle that all sides of the House agree on. But the reality is it is necessary because this is a discriminatory bill. This bill discriminates against a class of person; namely, indigenous people. This bill is not necessary because we have had a change of government. We have a minister who has an absolute discretion and a parliament that has an absolute discretion. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs currently has before provi- him another report under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 in relation to Boobera Lagoon. He was given that report dated 20 April 1996 on 22 judicial, that is inconApril 1996. The minister was taken to court in relation to the Boobera Lagoon because it is fair to say that the Boobera Lagoon report recommends protection of the Boobera Lagoon. It is a positive report under the heritage protection act, but indigenous people in New South Wales are powerless to force the minister to exercise his discretion one way or the other. The best they can do is ask the minister to exercise his discretion one way or the other. The minister in response to a question in the Senate on Monday, 28 October 1996 floundered, but then had incorporated into the Senate record on Tuesday, 29 October 1996 an answer to the question we put to him. It is worth reading. We asked: Does the government intend to introduce legislation into parliament regarding Boobera Lagoon? His answer to that was: (c): I do not intend to introduce special legislation in relation to Boobera Lagoon. Why? Because his discretion under the act at the moment is absolute. There is nothing stopping the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge commencing tomorrow. Indeed, since December, when the Federal Court confirmed an earlier decision of the single court judge, there has been no protection order in existence in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge area, which leaves it absolutely open for that bridge to proceed. There has been no protection order in existence since 7 December 1995. With a change of government and a new minister, the minister's discretion is absolute. We are told in the second reading speech that it is all too hard. Frankly, the minister is asleep at the wheel. That is the problem. We are told: The decision to prepare separate special legislation to overcome the current situation is seen by the government as being the most practical course to resolve the issue once and for all. How fair dinkum is this government? Is this a bill that is requiring urgency? Has the government made any attempt to tum this into an urgent bill? No. We have a letter from the opposition whip in the Senate, Senator Chris Evans, dated 28 October 1996, which says: Dear Daryl Please be advised that the Government Leader in the Senate, Senator Robert Hill, has advised that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill is one of a group of Bills that will unlikely be dealt with in the Senate this year. The Government has prioritised its legislation into two categories-the first group described as ""high priority"", the second group described as ""to be dealt with this sitting time permitting"". The Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill is in the second group. There are 23 packages of Bills contained in the ""high priority"" grouping. Senator Hill has advised the Leaders and Whips of all parties in the Senate that he would be hopeful of dealing with the high priority Bills this year, but accepts that it is highly unlikely that the Senate would deal with any Bills not contained in that high priority group. Based on that advice I think it highly unlikely that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill will be debated in the Senate until early next year. Yours sincerely NA Opposition Whip in the Senate Labor Senator for Western Australia That letter was written on 29 October and 31 October was the cut off. So this bill cannot be debated in the Senate until next year because of the Chamarette cut-off motion if it follows those guidelines. The reality is the government is able to allow construction of this bridge tomorrow. There is no protection order in existence. The government knows it. Anyone with half a brain knows it. There are some procedures that need to be followed. They are technical procedures, but it does not want to follow them because it wants to pursue a political agenda in the lead-up to the South Australian state election. That is what this is all about. The reality is that this minister has the benefit of a number of Federal Court decisions. He has the benefit of a High Court decision delivered on 6 September that said: The reporter is not expressly required to hold a hearing, but may nevertheless be obliged to observe requirements of procedural fairness. It further states: Such a determination is essentially a political function. A reporter may choose to act independently of the Minister in determining the interests to be preferred, but the Act does not require the reporter to disregard ministerial instruction, advice or wish in preparing the report. Further down it states: The decisions to be made by a reporter are political in character. Why did the minister table Justice Mathews's report in the Senate? Because he was playing politics. The recommendations of that report cannot be used. It is worth quoting page 12 of Justice Mathews's reportMr MCLachlan-Are you going to use that now?",72
161,Mr MELHAM,CHRIS EVANS,"The minister asks if we are going to use it. What can be used is the evidentiary material that is now public material. There is an exception in the Tickner v. Bropho case. You want to get yourself a decent lawyer. You are a bush lawyer. The reality is that all sides of politics are saying the bridge can now proceed. You are in government. Your minister has an absolute discretion. Even if he were to exercise his discretion in an erroneous fashion allowing a protection order to come into existence, it is a disallowable instrument under the heritage protection act. Who has got the numbers in the House of Representatives in an overwhelming fashion? A disallowable instrument is what a protection order is. Section 13(6) of the heritage protection act states: Nothing in this section limits the power of the Minister to revoke or vary a declaration at any time. It is all there. But we have a lazy government, a government not prepared to follow due process, a government that wants to play politics, a government that wants to further divide and a government that says, 'We don't want to act in a discriminatory manner. We want to respect the Racial Discrimination Act.' Isn't it sad what the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is doing? What she is doing is sad in relation to a lot of things. There is no doubt that there is cross-party support. What sort of signal does this send? This is what Justice Mathews said about this whole process: ... it has been a painful and divisive process ... I fear that its legacies may remain long after its completion. The events precipitated by the bridge proposal have thus far revealed many deficiencies in Commonwealth laws designed to preserve and protect areas and objects of traditional Aboriginal significance. It reflects the fundamental differences between the introduced common law system and the legal system of the indigenous oral culture. This latest episode in the Hindmarsh Island bridge saga has provided graphic illustration as to how little our apparently beneficial heritage legislation has accommodated to the realities of Aboriginal culture. Justice Mathews says on page 2: ... the applicant women have not been prepared to reveal the contents of any restricted women's - owledge. Accordingly it has been unnecessary in this Report to embark upon the vexed issue of whether ""women's business"" or restricted ""women's knowledge"" exists in Ngarrindjeri culture. In the absence of restricted women's knowledge, other issues assumed much greater significance under the application than had initially been anticipated. - One of the reasons the women did not cooper,ate in providing that material is that the current government would not provide a female minister to receive the evidence. Notwithstanding that, the position is that Tickner and Western Australia says in effect that what you have to do in providing procedural fairness and natural justice in terms of common law is basically provide the information. The Broome crocodile farm case is an example of cases that have recently been decided by the Federal Court. The reality is, however, irrespective of whether the women were to go down that path and provide the material that satisfied the minister, that the minister still has an absolute discretion. Justice Elizabeth Evatt-remember her?has written the report on the review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. She has just been re-elected to the United Nations human rights section. She got the second highest vote, supported by your government. She confirms the absolute discretion that the minister now has. She says on page 15 of the report: Aboriginal people are critical of the Act because the power to protect areas and objects is discretionary. The Minister is not obliged to act, even if an area is of significance to Aboriginal people. He/she can revoke a declaration without any express requirement to consult the parties. The Act does not specify criteria which, when established, confer a right to a declaration. The political nature of the discretion is discussed in Chapter 10. She cites the Wamba Wamba Local Aboriginal Land Council v. Minister Administering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, which talks about discretion under section 9 and it flows over to section 10. We, on this side, can see that with the change of government the minister has an absolute discretion. There is absolutely no way this bridge can be stopped. So why is the legislation necessary? The legislation is necessary as a political stunt to vindicate the Minister for Defence and indeed the Liberal Party. It is not necessary. You won the last election. The reality is that you should withdraw your involvement in this matter. The fact is that you have lost all objectivity. You are shaming yourself in relation to this. I am not standing here and saying it is a decision that is out of our hands. What I am saying to the parliament in all honesty, in all good faith, is that, on the basis of three legal opinions from senior counsel in New South Wales and on the basis of material I have received from other interested parties, there is no impediment to this bridge proceeding if the minister were to conduct himself in a proper fashion. There are a number of options. There is an argument that no further material is necessary, that there is enough material in the public domain for the minister to withdraw from the process and objectively consider all the material that is available. He has an absolute discretion to say, 'I am not going to order a declaration in relation to this area,' which, as I say, allows the bridge to proceed. A more conservative view is that what he needs to doMr MCLachlan interjecting Mr .MELHAM-There is no declaration in existence. There is no declaration. If you go to the Tickner v. Bropho exception, the law is pretty firm on that view. The more conservative legal opinionMr MCLachlan-Are you sure?",74
162,Mr MELHAM,CHRIS EVANS,"It is really interesting. They are not interested in debating the merits of what I am saying. I had the benefit of the minister sending us legal advice on an inconfidence basis-and I will not breach the confidence of the legal advice. I understand where they are coming from. We were given permission to give those legal opinions to our legal advisers, and there is disagreementstrong disagreement. The one thing I will say about the legal advice that the government was relying on and sent to us-because the minister issued a press release the day after saying that he had sent us the confidential legal advice-is that the advice was prepared without the bill being before those legal advisers. The minister said in his letter: I also attach, on an in-confidence basis, a copy of legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department. The advice confirms that the only way to avoid further legal delays and expense to the construction of the bridge is by legislation. That is not borne out in the advice. He continues: As you will see from the bill, I have also taken account of your concerns about retrospectivity and the Racial Discrimination Act. The Bill is consistent with the RDA and is not retrospective. If the bill is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, then the government should have no problems in supporting the amendment that I will be moving in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act in the consideration in detail stage of this bill. If they do not, then they will be exposed not only for their hypocrisy but for being too smart by half. Surely, in all the public utterances of the Prime Minister in other places and in this parliament, they are duty bound to support a clause that respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. In relation to retrospectivity, it does take away existing rights. The bill is retrospective. You have only to go to clause 4(2), which says: The Heritage Protection Act does not authorise the Minister to take any action after the commencement of this Act in relation to an application (whether made before or after the commencement of this Act) ... So this bill reaches back in time. Frankly, we have supported retrospective legislation in the past in terms of its effect. But let the government know that that is what they are doing. They are taking away existing rights and they can only do it in a retrospective fashion. So the minister's advice does not add up in relation to that because it is retrospective in effect. That is the only reason that you are bringing the bill-that there is an existing application that you say is a legitimate application. As a result of the High Court's decision in Wilson's case, as a result of the recent Federal Court decisions, this whole thing could be resolved without any doubt whatsoever by the minister using someone within the Attorney-General's Department. He has got the advice from Father Frank Brennan in relation to this. He can pick up all the existing material that was picked up by Justice Mathews and that he now has. It is all publicly available material. They could go through the motions and this could be resolved within a month. They could allow a reporting date of 14 days after further submissions are received. The High Court in Wilson's case says quite emphatically in that joint judgment that the reporter is not expressly required to hold a hearing. What I am saying to you is: this is a quicker, neater and cleaner solution. We do not need to say, 'I'll drop my legal opinion, you drop your legal opinion, which lawyer is better.' Here, there is cross-party support now and a concession. Fact No.1, indisputable: no protection order exists. Your government solicitors were in the Federal Court recently in relation to Boobera Lagoon. In the matter of Boobera Lagoon, there is a positive report, a report that says a desecration is occurring-a desecration being the skiing on the lagoon. The desecration in this instance would be the building of the bridge, but there is no positive report in existence. This is what happened in the Federal Court before Justice Foster. The legal advisers took it before Justice Foster on 17 October. Who was there? The Australian Government Solicitor for the respondents. This is what Justice Foster says: The Lagoon is claimed by the applicant, Toomelah Boggabilla Local Aboriginal Land Council (""the Land Council""), to be a ""significant Aboriginal area"" within the meaning of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. The Land Council also claims that the use of the Lagoon for the purpose of water-skiing threatens it with serious injury or desecration within the meaning of the Act. Further on: In accordance with s 1O(1)(c) of the Act, the Minister has received a report from Mr Hal Wootten QC dealing with the matters referred to in s 10(4). The report has recommended the making of a declaration, inter alia, for the banning of water-skiing on the lagoon for a period of 10 years from 1 May 1996. This report was received by the Minister on 20 April 1996. The Minister, however, has not yet made a decision in relation to the Land Council's application. That failure to make such a decision is the subject of application in these proceedings for appropriate relief. A further application was made to the Minister !lnder s 9 for an emergency declaration as defined m that section. That application was refused by the Minister on 14 October 1996. That refusal is also the subject of an application for review in these proceedings, it being asserted that there was no rational basis for the refusal, and that the decision was vitiated by error of law. The aspect of the proceedings that comes before the Court today is a claim by the Land Council for interlocutory relief pending the determination of the proceedings. Further on: There is, however, a necessary threshold question in this aspect of the proceeding, namely, whether the Court has power to make such an order. Section 9 of the Act was considered by Lockhart J in Wamba Wamba Local Aboriginal Land Council & Anor v Minister Administering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Islander Heritage Protection Act. . . ... the power conferred upon the Minister by s 9(1) to make an emergency declaration was facultative and not imperative. I respectfully agree with this construction of the section. In other words, it was a discretion that he had-'may'. Further on: In this context his Honour remarked (at 250): ""It is not for this Court to enter into the merits of the dispute between the parties. The juridical function is to ensure that any actions of the first respondent which may be contrary to law (including any failure to observe the rules of natural justice) are corrected. In my opinion it has not been shown that the first respondent acted contrary to law or failed to observe the rules of natural justice or that this Court is otherwise entitled to intervene in this matter."" It is, in my viewthis is Justice Fosterquite clear that the Court, at a final hearing in these proceedings, would have no power to order the Minister to make a declaration under s 9(1). It could only set aside a decision making or refusing a declaration and then remit the matter to the Minister for a fresh decision in accordance with the law. In this regard it must be borne in mind that the Minister may, in his discretion, refrain from making a declaration even though he is satisfied as to the matters referred to in social security 9(1)(b)(i) and (ii). Is it possible, then, for the Court at an interlocuSouth tory level to order the Minister to make the declaration sought in these proceedings? He goes on: The operation of s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act was considered in Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Mailanga. Further on there is this quote: Even in relation to such matters, the power is restricted to the making of the ""kinds"" of orders, whether final or interlocutory, are capable of properly being seen as ""appropriate"" to be made by the Federal Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction. At page 179 Beaumont J said further, in relation to the section and its operation, that: ... the stream cannot rise higher than its source. Further on: . .. as a matter power or jurisdiction, if release can be ordered at the final hearing, it must also be within the court's competence to make such an order at the interim stage, if this is otherwise appropriate. In my view, having regard to these observations, s 23 cannot, in the present case, empower me to make an order at an interlocutory stage which could not, for the reasons given in Wamba Wamba, be made at a final hearing. Similarly, s 16(1)(d) of the ADJR Act cannot have this effect. Accordingly, I am satisfied that I do not have the power to make the order sought. This must result in the decision that I dismiss this aspect of the application and I so order. In other words, this government is currently involved in legal proceedings where there is a positive report under the heritage protection act in relation to Boobera Lagoon and indigenous people are powerless to force the minister to exercise his discretion in favour of protection of the lagoon. The same principles apply. Why? Because on all the law, on any proper reading of the act, on any proper construction of the act, in Justice Mathews's report at page 12 it says that the minister has an absolute discretion, even if there is a positive report. That is why this legislation is unnecessary. All it does is cause further pain, further misery and further suffering to the indigenous community in Australia. It allows the cheer squad to go out and feel vindicated, but it is not good law. The same week that this legislation was announced we had the symbol for the 2000 Olympics unveiled and we saw that it incorporates Aboriginal symbols. What sort of message is that? Actions must speak louder than words. We are getting the mea culpa in relation to what is happening on one side of the debate that is occurring at the moment, but on the other side of the debate special legislation is the first port of call for Century Zinc and special legislation is the next port of call for the Hindmarsh Island affair. There are 161 pages of amendments in the bill to amend the 127-page Native Title Act. The reality is that what is happening here is not necessary. This is a lazy government. It is a lazy minister who does not want to go through the processes. What are they saying? The minister opposite, who has been arguing for ages about the frivolous and vexatious nature of the original application, is now left arguing that it is not frivolous and vexatious and that that is why we need special legislation. You gave it away when you tabled the Mathews report in the Senate. That is why you do not need this legislation. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the construction of the Hindmarsh Island bridge can now proceed without further delay and without prejudicing the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975"". (Time expired)",76
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHRIS EVANS,Is the motion seconded?,78
164,Mr HOLDING,CHRIS EVANS,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,78
165,Mr MCLACHLAN,CHRIS EVANS,"I watched with great interest the Labor Party squirm over this Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996. I watched with even greater interest the day after the bill was announced that there was great consternation amongst the Labor Party, so much so that the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), did not even turn up in the House. I noticed in the press that the shadow minister, who has just been speaking, said that this bill would not be supported by Labor. On the other hand, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said: I want to take a close look at that. It would good thing to finalise the issue one way or another. I listened with some care to the minister and I did not hear whether he said he was going to support this bill or not. I heard the amendments that he said he was going move-amendments, I have to say, that will not help the cause.",78
166,Mr MELHAM,CHRIS EVANS,Why not?,79
167,Mr MCLACHLAN,CHRIS EVANS,"I will come to that in a second. I have listened very carefully those nonsensical amendments and I have say that I have not heard whether the Labor Party is going to oppose this bill or not. might well smile because the fact of matter is that you do not know yet. not made up your mind whether you are going to oppose the bill or not. At the outset, I would like to say that hope the opposition votes against the bill because if consistency means anything in this place there is no other position the Labor Party can take. I think I heard the shadow else. minister give some credence-not in so many words-to the idea that the secret women's business might have had some merit. I not, but I think I heard that. If the Labor Party votes for the bill, it put itself in a dilemma. It will thereby admit that for two years, at unbelievable cost and unbelievable anguish, it supported the wrong cause. Alternatively, it will show that it always knew it was supporting the wrong cause and now it knows the political up. Make no mistake: the political game is up. In my state, everybody knows that the secret women's business was not true. You never mentioned it, except to give some slight credence to the fact that you might believe some of it had some merit. But it is up",79
168,Mr MELHAM,CHRIS EVANS,Read Mathews's report.,79
169,Mr MCLACHLAN,CHRIS EVANS,"It is up because the tru-h is out. We gave you a go. You just royally wrong.' qUieten down. I listened to you belt the whathave-you out of those people who stood for the truth in this matter when you sat up the back there shouting out for months on end, so you can just quieten down while we have our say. The political game is up for you because the truth is out and everybody knows it. In be a my state the people know the truth and they are sick to death of your support for those shadow who peddle the fabrications. As I say, if it were the second course you took, then that prosecution of the wrong cause to was not only the support of a grand set of deceptions but deception in itself. The Labor party, from early 1994, consistently worked to have the Hindmarsh Island Bridge banned. I suspect that they thought it would look good to a certain constituency-not necessarily an to Aboriginal constituency, although some to Aboriginals took a ride on the coach, but really to appeal to that soft centre of political You thought which will take on causes which the sound as though they accord with some You have sympathetic or concerned view. It does not matter-and it did not matter, did it?-that the damage that was wrought, I financial and emotional, was sometimes incalculable. In this case it was incalculable, even to those they purported to support. It mattered little that the truth lay somewhere The Labor Party did not oppose this bridge because it was going to harm the environhope ment, although that argument had some merit-not overwhelming, but some merit. It will did not oppose the bridge because of federal government expenditure, because there was to be none. It sought to interfere in the affairs of the state. Remember, the state government builds the bridge. The state of South Australia builds the bridge. The federal government game is does not build the bridge. It sought to interfere in the affairs of the state of South Australia after exhaustive reports and reviews which concluded that that bridge, for one reason or another, had to go ahead. It was contractual as much as anything. But the federal Labor government knew better and it sought to interfere for its own political purposes-and I have to say, 'You got it right I would have been prepared to forgive the former federal government after the first delvings into this matter because of the less than satisfactory report by Professor Cheryl Saunders. That report was requested by the minister in April 1994 and provided in July of that year. But by the end of 1994 it was crystal clear that the elastic believability near breaking point. You plunged on. We became aware, when we were on the other side of the House, by mid-1994 that the matter was open to very great doubt. So on 9 November 1994 we moved a motion to disallow former Minister Tickner's 25-year ban on the building of that bridge. The overriding ingredient from that moment on was that the truth of the matter seemed to be irrelevant-irrelevant not only to the federal Labor government but to the media at large, I have to say. We pointed out in that November that Professor Saunders had not been near the South Australian Museum, a reasonable repository of anthropological knowledge, one would have thought. We pointed out that the main proponent of the secret women's business, Doreen Kartinyeri, had previously written that she did not know much about the culture, customs and language of her people. She was talking about the Ngarrindjeri culture, customs and language. We pointed out that the place that Doreen Kartinyeri described as secret women's business was supposed to be an exact place, yet Professor Cheryl Saunders said in the report that it comprised 100 square kilometres. We pointed out that no-one but Kartinyeri seemed to have this knowledge. We pointed out that Saunders's report was categorically wrong on one fundamental point to do with Mr Justice Sam Jacobs's report. He described her view of his report on that matter as 'outrageous'. We pointed out that this matter of secret women's business had never been raised, even indirectly, by anyone ever before in the context of the Ngarrindjeri people. We pointed out that the matter of secret women's business had never been raised by any of the anthropologists in respect of that much researched area and that much researched people. Very importantly, I pointed out that the parliament was about to vote-you all voted--on the disallowance motion on evidence that you were not allowed to see. You refused yourselves the luxury of seeing the evidence upon which you were about to vote. It was locked up in some envelopes that nowas one was allowed to see or look at. At the end of that debate you voted to support the declaration to ban the bridge, fundamentally on the secret women's business. It was locked up in the envelopes. You voted for it. At that moment all the people in the Labor Party, including your colleagues in the Senate, voted for a conspiracy of fabrications, concoctions, inventions, lies and deceit the like of which this country has hardly ever seen in its history. That is what you voted for, and you stuck to it for the next year and a half. What is more, you did it on the basis of evidence that you held to be sacred. You were not allowed to look at it, but you held it to be sacred. Later, when the former government and large elements of the media said that I had affronted the whole race by placing copies of the so-called secret women's business on the table of this House, the government reviled me and anybody-I repeat: anybody-who supported the view that this secret women's business was open to doubt. Let me remind you of the accusations that were variously made in this chamber. They included 'exploiting Aboriginals for political purposes', 'deceivers who are inept', and 'the untruths and the lies that the member for Barker had himself perpetrated'. And all of this time you were supporting a proposition inside some envelopes which you had never seen, which a judge could not see, which counsel was not allowed to argue and which led everybody to the eventual grand fabrication. And you were, in fact, the catalyst for that fabrication. Last week the Leader of the Opposition said in this House, on what was called the race debate, 'Messages must always contain what we actually believe'-that is, messages out there. What did you actually believe about the secret women's business? Did you believe it? Or are you just fools? Or didn't you care? What did the Leader of the Opposition believe when he was sitting over here? Did he believe it or did he just castigate us and call us liars all the time in this House on this subject? I will tell you what I think he believed: he did not believe any of it. He just followed the party line-go down the soft centre and see if you can make sure that your political opposition gets a bath. The problem was that it all went wrong. The Labor Party knew that it was nigh on impossible for anyone to challenge the idea publicly that something called 'secret women's business' could be bunkum. You sat behind that knowledge and you used the Ngarrindjeri people to give support to a conspiracy of fraud with no regard to the truth. What else is that if it is not racism? Not the racism of the ignorant bigot-but, much worse, the racism of the half-intelligent calculator. What you had not reckoned with was that the impossible would happen: that some other Ngarrindjeri women-for who else could actually overthrow the political correctness of the day, as no-one else could do it?-would display enormous courage and overthrow the lies of the fabricators of Hindmarsh Island. Mr Latham interjecting",79
170,Mr MCLACHLAN,CHRIS EVANS,"Why don't you just sit down because you were not around the place then. Just sit down and quieten down. Who was in this conspiracy? Lawyers, new wave anthropologists, feminists, some Ngarrindjeri women and the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement of South Australia. W-ho was the cheer squad? The cheer squad was certain Aboriginal leaders. Where are those - boriginal leaders who were so public about it? They are very quiet on the subject now. Mr Latham-Who stole the mail ? You stole Tickner's mail.",81
171,Mr MCLACHLAN,CHRIS EVANS,"The member for - otham (Mr Crean) has some papers belonglDg to the Leader of the National Partv of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I don't think he has given them back. I might be wrong about that, but I have got this sneaking suspicion that he has still got them locked up somewhere. Nevertheless, vou will talk to him about it tomorrow, wO'n't you-the stuff he took out of the Leader of the Opposition' s room? Would you like to check on that? Mr Latham interjecting",81
172,Mr MCLACHLAN,CHRIS EVANS,"No, it didn't belong to the Leader of the Opposition? Why don't you keep him quiet? Everybody else respected what you had to say until he came into this chamber. It is time you kept him quiet.",81
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHRIS EVANS,Order! I ask the minister to return to the debate.,81
174,Mr MCLACHLAN,CHRIS EVANS,"Who else was in the cheer squad? The journalists who simply followed the Labor government line and the i?dependent Australian Broadcasting Corporation. They were as independent on this as they are on the subject of 'save our funding'. - Some of those people followed the Australian Labor Party to the hilt. Ho- did the truth force its way out of your watertIght bottle? The only way it could re-l1y:--ec.ause three or four very courageous NJarnndJen women finally found their consciences. Not that there was any guilt, but the conscience of further silence was too much for them. They were joined by more and the number became 13 women-an unlucky number for the Labor Party and for the conspirators. Three of those women are up there in the gallery. You ought to have a look at those people because they had the courage to stand up to the nonsense that you people supported. They are right up there in the front and second rows of that gallery. They are not the cheer squad, they are the people",81
175,Mr MELHAM,CHRIS EVANS,I don't sit in judgment on anyone.,81
176,Mr MCLACHLAN,CHRIS EVANS,"They passed judgment on you as being part of the conspiracy. Dorothy Wilson is up there. Dorothy Wilson saw the whole conspiracy from start to tinish, supported by your people.",81
177,Mr MELHAM,CHRIS EVANS,Mathews blew vou out of the water ,81
178,Mr MCLACHLAN,CHRIS EVANS,"Forget about Mathews. She was your reporter in the High Court. Six to seven said that she was wrongly appointed. Dorothy Wilson knew most of the story. After a heart-rending deliberation, she decided that the truth needed to come out. You should talk to her. You should talk to those people. You are the shadow minister. It would do you good. You should talk to them because none of your people ever spoke to them. They didn't speak to them, and you should. Mrs Dulci Wilson is up there too. She went off to represent the Salvation Army in London in 1957 to speak for the Aboriginal people. Mr Latham-It's not our role to speak to the Aboriginal people.",81
179,Mr MCLACHLAN,CHRIS EVANS,"It is not in your role to speak to the Aboriginal people? It is time you took a new view because you should do that. There were others. Later, you and large elements of the media said that I affronted the whole of the Aboriginal race- 'exploiting Aboriginals for political purposes', 'deceivers who are inept' - all those things- 'opposition members routinely lie', 'untruths' and so on. But I knew that I could not prove those things were fakes.",82
180,Mr MELHAM,CHRIS EVANS,I didn't utter a word on this.,82
181,Mr MCLACHLAN,CHRIS EVANS,"No. of course you didn't. Why would you? Why would you utter a word? You should be ashamed of everything that you did. All of these people voted against that disallowance motion. They voted, having seen none of the evidence at all. They were the judges that day. You were the judges in the Senate as well. An invention you supported set to deceive the nation and the courts, a fraudulent forgery which you gave succour to. You gave succour to that invention in cash through ATSIC to the ALRMSA. In the parliament you voted for the liars in the press with rampant criticism of anyone who had any doubt on this matter. That is the fact. You rampantly castigated anyone who put any doubt on this matter. You ignored those people who stood up and. finally, in the South Australian royal commission, after 16 weeks. were proven to be right. The truth either disappeared into a morass of your obsequious sanctioning. Alternatively, your behaviour was worse than that. Mr Melham interjecting",82
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHRIS EVANS,"Order! The member fcr Banks! Mr MCLACHLAN'-You know, I kept reasonably quiet when you were speaking, but you do not pass the same obligation back. Your friend has got you out of control, I fear. Your Labor Party declared the development of this bridge banned without seeing the evidence. Do you know what happened? When you were challenged in the various cases that surrounded this matter, 19 out of 20 judges who were involved in this and allied matters deliberated against your view. The High Court decision on the validity of Justice Mathews was six to seven against; Tickner v. W. in Western Australia. four out of four against; Tickner v. Chapman in South Australia, four out of four against; Tickner v. Bropho-you used the case-four out of four against. Do you know what you argued in the Bropho case? You argued that the minister for Aboriginal affairs needed a section 10 report. Do you know what the court said? It said, 'Not unless it was frivolous or vexatious.' You are now arguing that another report is not necessary. Is that what you are arguing? If you are, that is consistently stupid. You know, and you ought to know, the results of that will be another judicial inquiry. You know it as well as I do. and that is why you are trying to delay it with this little procedure you are going through. You know very well that this bill is not contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act.",82
183,Mr MELHAM,CHRIS EVANS,Support the amendment.,82
184,Mr MCLACHLAN,CHRIS EVANS,"No, of course not. It is unnecessary . You still have not said whethand er you are going to vote for this bill. I have got a sneaking suspicion that in the end you will buckle and vote for this bill, but I sure hope you don't. As the South Australian royal commission found after 16 weeks of evidence, you got cleaned up by those people up there who had the courage to stand up and tel! the truth. Who were the perpetrators of your line? Tickner, Lavarch. Henzel! and Beazley-the current Leader of the Opposition. You would be very silly if you continued to take the view that you have taken. I have said that this legislation is not inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. In fact, it will be later legislation and, as well, is not inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. That is the advice of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams)-and you know it. And that is why the bill is coming forward. So in the end this matter was not to do with whether a bridge should or shouldn't be built. It was not about the developers, the Chapmans-whether they should be supported. It was nothing to do with that. It was about an invention of such proportions that it could have changed the very nature of the law had it been perpetrated. (Time expired)",82
185,Mr HOLDING,CHRIS EVANS,"I can understand the honourable Minister for Defence, the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), putting an argument of selfjustification relating to his personal involvement in the matters before this House. I can remember well the incident where the honourable minister established his view of political morality. It was an interesting view. If a member of this parliament receives a package that is wrongly directed by members of the staff of this parliament to him, and a member of his staff opens it in innocence and discovers that it is not meant for the recipient and that a mistake has been made, I would have thought-if we are talking about morality-that the member of staff, or you, would have put a sign on it saying 'Opened in error' and would have returned it to the officer so that the mistake could be rectified. But that was not the position of the Minister for Defence. We listened to the bile that emanated in this chamber from his speech. He is still guilty. He knows what any 10-year-old child knows.",83
186,Mr SLIPPER,CHRIS EVANS,"Clyde, you don't believe this.",83
187,Mr HOLDING,CHRIS EVANS,"I believe that if my child did this I would say, 'You go to the person to Whom this package belongs and apologise by saying, ""I am sorry I opened it, and I am sorry I looked at it.'"" What you did is beneath contempt, and you know it. The essential argument is this: is this legislation necessary? I know a bit about this legislation-I ought to; I introduced it. On that occasion, it was voted against, quite substantially, by the then opposition. The member for Barker was not present on that occasion, but I invite honourable members to go back to that when we now listen to speeches saying how committed this government is to the preservation of Aboriginal cultural heritage. Read the debate.",83
188,Mr SLIPPER,CHRIS EVANS,Look at your own record.,83
189,Mr HOLDING,CHRIS EVANS,"Let me tell you about my record on this very issue. I am very happy to tell you about it. I was the minister who introduced the legislation, and in the first instance it was used by me, as minister, to protect the women's dreaming site at Alice Springs. The minister does have discretion. When this new minister came into this House, I stood up and pleaded that he be given time because it is a difficult and complex area of administration. In my view-having had several portfolios-it is the most difficult and the most complex. The minister, when he was under attack, was good enough to quote the speech that I made pleading that he be gi ven time. Does anybody say that the terms of this legislation do not give the minister discretion? If they do, they are wrong. The minister's discretion is ultimately the final arbiter as to the application of this legislation. As minister, I used it to defend Aboriginal women's cultural beliefs in Alice Springs. I received a lot of criticism, a lot of abuse, from the then leader of the Northern Territory parliament. Basically, the minister has a discretion to determine the nature of the report. He has discretion as to the length of it. He has discretion to put a time limit on it. I can understand the member for Barker wanting to sound himself off, but the reality is that at this stage there is nothing to stop this government commencing this bridge tomorrow. You do not need this legislation.",83
190,Mr SLIPPER,CHRIS EVANS,The legal advice doesn't say that.,83
191,Mr HOLDING,CHRIS EVANS,"I will show you the legal advice that I have received-and it does say that. If, indeed, a claim had to be considered by the minister-a claim by the same group, or perhaps another group of Aboriginal women-he would be entitled, exercising his discretion, to say, 'I do not propose to call for a report. I am using my discretion, and I say that this application is vexatious, and that is the end of the matter.'",83
192,Mr SLIPPER,CHRIS EVANS,Then you are back in the courts again.,84
193,Mr HOLDING,CHRIS EVANS,"I would have thought that there is no legal remedy available at this stage to the women who brought this complaint in the first case. So this is the real question: is this legislation necessary? I believe, on any objective test, that it is not. Is there anybody on that side of the House who believes that the minister has the capacity to say, 'I will not hear a further application in this matter and will treat it as vexatious,' that is beyond his power or beyond his jurisdiction? The answer is that he has that capacity. But perhaps some of his ministerial colleagues do not have the same tolerance and the same level of understanding that I have given the minister. I can think of no greater cause for a vote of no confidence from fellow ministers than to say, 'Look, we know you have the discretion, we know you can say that this has been in and out of the courts and subject to challenge.' They know he can say, 'I'm going to regard any further application that stops the bridge as vexatious. That is it.' But do they trust him? Do any of you opposite genuinely believe that if there were a further application in respect of this matter the minister would not dismiss it, that he would not use his powers of discretion, his capacity to say, 'This is vexatious. These people have had their day in court. That is it'? You should stand by your minister and his right to determine the agenda in what is a very complex and difficult area. If you want to remove the discretion of the minister by way of legislation every time there is an application by a group of Aboriginal people who come to him on the basis that he has a responsibility to administer this act in accordance with the power entrusted to him by this parliament-you might say, 'Oh, well, some of the Aboriginal people have said he is a bit of a dill; some of the Aboriginal people and some of his political opponents say he is hopeless' - in that situation he is entitled to the defence of his colleagues. It is a complex and difficult area. One thing of which you can be absolutely certain-it is not about getting in helicopters and flying around to have army generals salute you and present you with flags-is that it is a complex and difficult area and he is not entitled to the vote of no confidence that is being shown to him in this House by his ministerial colleagues so that the Minister for Defence can exercise his political bile and his political envy. Mr MCLachlan-But he wants to do it; he actually wants to do it. Isn't that strange?",84
194,Mr HOLDING,CHRIS EVANS,"He does not need this legislation-and his own advisers would have told him that. If you had one ounce of integrity and respect for Aboriginal affairs, you would concede the honour of that position. But you never have. One might forgive you for acting like an adolescent child when you wanted to open somebody else's mail, but there is no justification here. You showed your contempt in your belief in what Aboriginal people might feel deeply about when you walked in here and threw it on the table. You did not know at that stage that the courts would say something different. It was a question of your intent. It was a contemptible act and it remains a contemptible act.",84
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHRIS EVANS,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member might address his remarks through the chair.,84
196,Mr HOLDING,CHRIS EVANS,"I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. I hold you and your office in great respect. I wish I could hold the Minister for Defence in great respect. I believe the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is deserving of some understanding-I have said that before in this House-because the minister has to prove himself right, because he is feeling guilty like a cheap post office box robber who wants to overcome his sense of guilt. Look at the parliamentary record on this very issue. Look at the things that were said. Deep in your hearts you do not believe that Aboriginal people have a right to protect their culture. Some of the claims that will be made will not be accurate. Some such claims the minister will reject, as I have rejected them. So let us not hear the kind of argument that came from the Minister for Defence. The House is entitled to ask itself whether this legislation is really needed. Do we really need to say as to a minister's discretion in respect of this one exercise, 'We are going to pass special legislation to deprive you of your capacity to exercise discretion'? What a nonsense argument. What happens if there is an application tomorrow in respect of Uluru? What if somebody wants to build something there and the Aboriginal people believe it is a matter that they should properly draw to the attention of their minister to seek him to exercise his discretion under this act on behalf of the parliament, and somebody like the Minister for Defence says, 'Hang on, there are a couple of vested interests here that we might have to look after. There might be an election coming up. Let's not trust the minister. Let's bring a piece of legislation into the parliament so that we can catch up and settle a few political scores in the vexed area of Aboriginal affairs and try to get the important cultural relationships right between a dominant white community and an indigenous culture'? The responsibilities exercised by any minister for Aboriginal affairs is heavy indeed, and the one thing you can be absolutely certain of, even if he gets it right 90 per cent of the time, is that 10 per cent of the time he will make mistakes. There is no point, I believe, if you look at the history of this portfolio, in not conceding that argument. I believe, and I say quite frankly with all the good will in the world, that Minister Tickner made some mistakes on this particular issue.",84
197,Mr SLIPPER,CHRIS EVANS,He was incompetent.,85
198,Mr HOLDING,CHRIS EVANS,"He made some mistakes. But that does not mean that we should have the political exercise of squaring off, that we take the time of this parliament to introduce legislation which, on one view of it, is a massive act of no confidence in your own minister-except that I know and you know that if this matter were to come before the minister again on a further application he would be expected to say, 'Enough is enough. Any further application in respect of this particular project' - because there is no order at this stage-'is vexatious, and I will not exercise my power under the act. I will not even call for a report.'",85
199,Mr SLIPPER,CHRIS EVANS,"Would you, Clyde?",85
200,Mr HOLDING,CHRIS EVANS,"Yes. The one thing that Aboriginal people understand from their ministers is that they have to be dealt with honestly and with integrity. Even when mistakes are made, if a government acts with honesty and integrity, that will produce an appropriate response, not immediately but over the long term. This legislation is unnecessary. In his heart, the Minister for Defence knows it is unnecessary. This parliament is again going down a track that it should not even contemplate and thi.s government should not even contemplate. It IS a base political exercise. For the Minister for Defence it is a regrettable exercise in selfjustification, pleading to some of his mates in the gallery. I understand that; we have all been around long enough to know that. This legislation also constitutes, as a result of the perpetration of this sort of attitude, as significant a vote of no-confidence in your own minister for Aboriginal affairs as I have ever seen perpetrated by any government. I find it regrettable that, yet again, on the basis of understanding some of the difficulties and the complexities of this portfolio, I am prepared to say that I believe that the minister would try to exercise his discretion fairly and honestly and with some sense of integrity. If this matter came before him again-I do not see how it can-I cannot think of any further legal argument that would have any force in any of our courts for more than five minutes. The matter is at an end. There is no prevailing order. So, if the government of South Australia wants to get on with building the bridge, they would do better to go ahead and do it. They do not need this legislation. The government does not need this legislation. This minister does not need this legislation. Mr MCLachlan-You don't need it either; you need it like a hole in the head.",85
201,Mr HOLDING,CHRIS EVANS,"It is an act of political squaring off. You ought to have a little more respect for your colleagues. Your portfolio is comparatively easy. It does not have the sorts of problems that the minister for Aboriginal affairs has to meet on a daily basis. When you get out of a helicopter, all the people for whom who are responsible stand to attention and salute, and you like that. There will never be a day when the minister for Aboriginal affairs gets out of a helicopter and the Aboriginal people, thank God, stand back and salute. They are fighting desperately to find their place in Australian society. Again, the minister should not be treated in this way by his own government. It is interesting to look at what we have to expose to the world, what we are going to do in the year 2000. What do you lean to? Aboriginal culture and Aboriginal music. Do you think you can treat them the way you are treating them now and they will all line up like good little boys, and you can get them to clap and wrap themselves in the Union Jack? You are heading for a situation which can be a cultural disaster for this country. So think deeply. You did not think deeply about this legislation. It ought to be withdrawn and the minister ought to be given the right to get on with his job.",86
202,Mr SLIPPER,CHRIS EVANS,"I was particularly disappointed at the contribution made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), and also by the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). Over the last 12 months these people and their colleagues have sought cynically to manipulate this whole issue of 'women's business', which was found to be an absolute fabrication. I do not often quote anthropologists in this place, but I would like to quote Dr Ron Brunton, an anthropologist with the Institute of Public Affairs. He commented on this particular activity which has resulted in the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996, which is before the House. He was referring to the way in which there have been a number of inquiries into the actions of the former Minister Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, who had sought to prevent the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. Referring to the Labor Party's conduct, he said: This fiasco serves as an unhappy metaphor for much that has been wrong with Aboriginal politics in Australia in recent years. Aboriginal heritage concerns were cynically exploited by people with an anti-development agenda. Influential people in the churches, the media, politics and the anthropology profession showed that they prefer Aboriginals who make adversarial claims-no matter how deceitful or iII-founded-to Aboriginals who approach their history and culture with integrity. Matters that could readily have been dismissed had key people shown a modicum of good judgment and probity require costly, politicised and unnecessarily duplicated enquiries before they can be resolved. Widespread ignorance about Aboriginal cultures allows ridiculous statements to be taken seriously, and moral posturing drowns out common sense. The shadow minister claims that this legislation is unnecessary. He tells us that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) should be able simply to act to authorise the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. Opinions received by the government are to the contrary. Advice from a broad range of government bodies indicates that the minister either has to go back to a further inquiry that will cost another more than $1 million or else we have to bring in this legislation. Indeed, if this legislation is not carried by this parliament, well over $7 million will have been spent proving the right of the South Australian government and the developers to construct a bridge. The advice comes from the Attorney General's Department, the Australian Government Solicitor and the Office of Indigenous Affairs. Those opposite might have advice to the contrary, but the simple fact is that the government has received advice from very reputable legal sources. We are told that this legislation is necessary if we are to get the bridge to go ahead. People who were the original developers have gone broke because of delays. It has been found that the former government conspired with people who were for prepared to do anything and say anything to prevent the bridge being constructed. I would like to applaud the Aboriginal women who have been in the gallery today. They are people who have had the guts to stand up and say that they are sick and tired of their culture being fabricated. They are sick and tired of people being prepared to do anything and say anything to stop this bridge being constructed. Isn't it terrible that a certain number of people in society, including the former minister for Aboriginal affairs, were prepared to stoop to such a tactic? They treated Aboriginal beliefs with such contempt that they were prepared to manufacture Aboriginal beliefs to prevent this bridge from being constructed. In all the times the former minister for Aboriginal affairs was tested in a court, 19 judges out of 20 found that the former minister was not handling this area of Aboriginal affairs well at all. The whole thrust of the debate that we have heard from the other side is that this legislation is not necessary. The shadow minister tells us that the minister should simply authorise the construction of the bridge. The minister is supposed to override the legal advice he has received. The shadow minister and the former minister have failed to tell us what would happen if the minister ignored all of the legal advice and proceeded to authorise the construction of the bridge. You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I know that this matter would simply end up once again in the courts. There would be a continuing legal mire. There would be enormous legal expenses built up. Cynical lawyers would continue to rip off the community. They would continue to rip off Aboriginal people. They would continue to trample over the rights of the women who had the guts to stand up and say that the so called secret women's business was absolutely fabricated. The people on the other side have come into this place and opposed this legislation. Now, of course, they are virtually saying that the former minister was incompetent. They admit that the former government did not handle this matter well. But when we come forward with a proposal which is clear, which is concise, and which says once and for all, 'Let's restore certainty,' they oppose this legislation. I think that indicates that they really do not have the interests of Aboriginals at heart. When one looks at the shocking record of 13 years of Labor government in the area of Aboriginal affairs, one realises that it is absolutely hypocritical of them to be criticising this government and to be opposing this bill. Over the last 20-odd years, Aboriginals have had some billions of dollars spent in the interests of their welfare. Most reasonable Australians do not oppose expenditure designed to improve Aboriginal health and Aboriginal housing or expenditure designed to reduce infant mortality problems and to improve educational standards. The attitude taken, though, by those opposite and the attitude taken by ATSIC in promoting the actions of former minister Tickner destroys the natural sympathy which most reasonable Australians have for the plight of Aboriginal people. It is appalling that people have the absolute hide to come in here and oppose what this government is doing. We have a program to redress Aboriginal needs. We aim to improve their health, we aim to improve their housing, we aim to improve their educational standards, we aim to make sure that ATSIC is more accountable, and we aim to make sure that moneys spent in the area of Aboriginal affairs attract the same level of accountability as other expenditure of government moneys. Yet every time that we try to do something to improve the plight of Aboriginal people, we find that those opposite, whose record is so dreadful, object to what we are seeking to do. Had I had more time. I could have outlined some of the appalling elements of Labor's legacy to Aboriginals. Let me just mention briefly that, after 13 years, 14,000 dwellings are still required to meet Aboriginal housing needs in urban, rural and remote locations. In rural and remote areas, around 41,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live in such overcrowded conditions that they require additional housing. About 40 per cent of houses in rural and regional areas require major repair or replacement. That is only one area of Aboriginal affairs. I have got page after page that I could outline. But the fact of the matter is that the former government was a failure. They were long on rhetoric short on action. Over a very long period of time they prevented the Hindmarsh Island Bridge from being constructed. We had five inquiries. Those five inquiries cost well over $6 million. The shadow minister would have us legal advice we have received. He would have us simply override that legal advice. He would have the now minister authorise the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. Of course, at the end of the day, what would happen: the matter would go back before the court. There would be an injunction issued against the construction of the bridge. There would have to be yet another inquiry at a cost to the Australian taxpayerof more than $1 million. The former government had these inquiries. They even sought to appoint Justice Mathews to conduct an inquiry. The court very clearly ruled that Justice Mathews had no right to appointed. But even Justice Mathews pointed out in her report-which, of course, is longer valid because her appointment was not valid-that there was no evidence that Aboand riginal beliefs would be desecrated should bridge be constructed. The report handed down by the royal commissioner in South Australia is very clear. I will obviously to continue my speech when the House resumes, but I just want to point out in the minute or so available to me what the royal commissioner said: There was a fabrication of the women's business. The whole of the women's business tion. In particular, the claim that there was spiritual and cultural significance of Hindmarsh Island within the Aboriginal tradition of Ngarrindjeri women which was crucial for the reproduction of the Ngarrindjeri people and of the cosmos which supported their existence was fabricated. The claim that the women's business required the prohibition of the construction of the bridge was fabricated. The purpose of the fabrication was to obtain a declaration for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the honourable Robert Tickner MP to prevent the construction of a bridge between Goolwa and Hindmarsh Island. We have had a situation where the Labor Party in office sought to frustrate the construction of this bridge. They were prepared to conspire, they were prepared to do anyand thing, to prevent this bridge from being constructed. They were even prepared to trample on the sacred beliefs of Aboriginal people. I applaud those women who had the guts to say that they had had enough and that they did not in any way support what the reject the Labor government tried to do. Debate interrupted. NA",86
203,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 you know p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjoum. Workplace Relations Legislation",88
204,Mr MCMULLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Tomorrow it seems certain that the clock will start ticking towards the end of many fundamental award conditions for Australian workers because the Senate will be considering amendments to the Workplace be Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. As a result of the deal between the no government and the Democrats, the Senate will undoubtedly pass section 89A of the bill then consequential matters, following the upon which there will be an 18-month timetable before all award matters for Australian workers-except what are now 20 so-called have allowable matters-will disappear. All of those provisions will come under pressure from the proclamation of the bilI. Any that survive the 18 months will disappear at the end of that period, unless workers can negotiate an agreement to win back conditions they was a fabricaalready have. This change represents a threat to the security of working conditions for millions of Australian workers, particularly those who depend upon the award for their actual rather than merely their minimum conditions, which is about one-third of Australian workers. It also represents a breach of two election promises which-silly us-we thought were probably even core promises, that is, the first promise that no worker will be worse off and the second that no worker would have their award conditions taken away under a Howard government. Mr Howard said in October last year that no Australian worker would have their award conditions taken away under a Howard government, and the legislation destroy directly does that. In case you thought that somehow or other the deal between the Australian government and the Democrats might have protected workers in this case, it is far from the truth. All that deal does is reduce by two the numhave ber of award conditions that will be lost. That did come as a surprise to many Australian workers, particularly those who heard Senator Kernot's speech to the Australian Education Union on 15 June when she quoted Mr Howard who had said, 'No worker in Australenterprise is under the Howard industrial relations are, policy can have his or her award conditions taken away,' and then went on to criticise bill saying it proposed stripping back awards to just 18 conditions. Workers will lose access to dozens of current award entitlements on 15 June. Unforstress tunately, on 6 November, that is effectively what she is going to vote for-reducing those dozens of conditions by only two. The minister has tried, from time to time, to come in here to trivialise the conditions which will be lost. Even those which he deems trivial are important to many workers in many places, but there are some very basic conditions and rights that are affected by these changes. I will seek the opportunity tomorrow to perhaps illustrate some more them. Let me just refer this evening to the hospia tality industry and its award. It is evident, the face of it, that at least 16 conditions provided for under that award will disappear soon. as a result of this legislation and the workers will have to seek to negotiate an agreement win them back. People might argue about small whether there are more that will be lost. will be an interesting case before the sion. At least these 16 clearly will, including the section on sexual harassment and, particular, subclause 14.1.2 of the award, which says: An employer shall not dismiss an employee on the grounds of refusal to dress in a manner which would cause that employee embarrassment. What does that mean? That means bar staff cannot be forced to be topless by their emthe ployer under threat of the sack. That should forever the idea that this process does anything about the interests of Australian women, protecting their rights and their dignity. What these changes overall mean for Australian workers, many of whom think they already had too much enterprise bargaining, is that now they will have to enter into enterprise bargaining just to win back conditions they already have. The government, after promising the opposite, takes away their conditions and requires them to enter into bargaining just to stay where they let alone the greater hurdles that the bill puts in their way to seek to improve their the conditions, to seek to improve their living standards. The workers of Australia, who are already suffering-as the Department of Industrial Relations report says-increased as a result of the pressures of enterprise bargaining, are no longer going to have the choice about whether they enter that bargain; they will be required to do so just to retain existing conditions. (Time expired) Small Business",88
205,Mr SOMLYAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Fairfax) (10.35 p.m.)Last week the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force was released. The report included 62 recommendations, largely aimed at freeing small business from the of burden of government red tape. If a recent example of bureaucratic bungling concerning small business in my electorate of Fairfax on is any example of what operators have had to deal with, this report comes not a minute too The incident to which I refer is an incredto ible example of vilification which has cost a business in Fairfax valuable productiviThat ty hours as well as possibly damaging its commisreputation and goodwill. Last week, on Thursday, 31 October, the Killyptus Products in Company, owned and operated by a husband and wife team on the Sunshine Coast, received a telephone call from their pet supplies distributor in Brisbane. To the horror of these small business owners, their distributor explained that one of their products had been removed from the shelves of retail outlets on orders of a federal Department of Primary Industries and Energy inspector. They had absolutely no idea and no warning that this was about to take place. Naturally, their first call was to the DPI in Brisbane. They asked why their product was being removed from the shelves of pet supply outlets and they asked the chief inspector to direct his DPI inspector in the field to stop his rounds until the position had been clarified. According to my constituent, the story then developed as follows. I quote from their letter: He infonned us that he had no way of contacting him in the field ... 'Him' being the field inspector. The letter continuesHe then told me he would find out why the product was being removed and ring me back, which he did 15 minutes later. He said that he supported his officer because 'we were on the NRA hit list'. After discussions with the National Registration Authority, it was revealed that NRA patrols travel the country checking the wording on labels. As it turns out, an NRA representative had noticed the words 'low irritant' on a bottle of their pet shampoo some 12 months earlier-a product which, by the way, has never been required to be registered with the NRA. The same label had been used by this business for five years and had not changed. It had previously been approved by the Queensland state Department of Primary Industries. The NRA then claimed that it had written to the business advising them of its concern and had received no reply. Interestingly enough, they had received regular correspondence from the NRA during the same period but this time the NRA wrote to a previous address on an old bottle. One section of NRA wrote to the correct address, another section to the incorrect address. The NRA officer then incorrectly assumed that their business had shut down and proceeded with the clearing of the shelves. This is nothing short of negligence. During their discussions with the NRA, my constituents claim that they were told that the words in question, 'low irritant', posed a problem because the claim was something that could not be proven. They said that the argument used against them was, 'Dogs do not talk, so how do you know it is low irritant?' In short, the NRA demanded that they remove all the products from the shelves of retail outlets and cross out the two words. Understandably, my constituents were stunned by this incredible suggestion. Finally, the NRA consulted a vet, and contacted the business owners the following day to advise that everything was okay after all and their product would be removed from the so-called hit list. In 24 hours a small business had its product removed from a pet shop retail outlet, had been told by a DPIE inspector that dogs do not talk, and then was advised that everything was okay. Well, it is not okay. I will not tolerate Gestapo style tactics being used on my constituents by bureaucratic Rambos hiding behind the legitimacy of legislation passed in the parliament. We promised to get small business back into business. We promised to cut red tape. The sooner we act on the recommendations of the task force the better. This small business has had 13 years of this sort of rubbish and I am pleased to say that the government will act on this as it has already promised. I call on the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) to review the need for the NRA to exist or at least to investigate its operations through a parliamentary committee. Second Sydney Airport",89
206,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"Prospect) (10.40 p.m.)Yesterday, while speaking on my private member's motion, I called on the members of this House to put away their political hatchets, jettison their political baggage and give serious consideration to the case for Goulburn as a site for Sydney's second airport-a site that, when serviced by the Sydney-Canberra very fast train, seems to me to make an awful lot of sense. During my time in this parliament, certainly during my 25 years of public life, I think I have been fairly up-front. I would hope that I have treated members of the opposing parties with as much candour, sincerity and honesty as I have treated members of my own party. Yesterday, in my private member's speech, I asked for the same sincerity and can dour to be shown by the government members to the motion I put forward. I did not insist that they agree with my proposition, merely that they approach it with open eyes and a clear mind and not dismiss it out of hand. The member for Hughes (Mrs Vale), I am glad to see, was able to do so. I appreciated her comments made in the House last night and I warmly support her fight to move Sydney's second airport outside the Sydney basin, led most admirably by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). However, it was unfortunately not possible for the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit). Not only did he denigrate my suggestions with the politically biased rhetoric and thinking I had implored members to reject but he even questioned my reasons for starting the debate. The member for Lowe claimed not only that I had ulterior and malicious motives in putting forward my motion but also that the federal parliamentary Labor Party had colluded with me in the process. I reject his slimy accusations. Not only do I reject them but I feel I must address them. The member for Lowe stated in his speech: The underlying intention of the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) is, without doubt, to limit Sydney to the one international airport-that is, KSA ... What absolutely unmitigated tripe! Sydney needs a second airport, a second airport which will go some way to relieving the people of Sydney of their intolerable aircraft noise burden. What I object to is the notion that this will best be achieved by building a second international airport on the doorstep of thousands of other Sydneysiders-be it at Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy-subjecting them to the same, if not worse, noise levels. I do not wish to delay the building of Sydney'S second airport any more than the hopelessly misguided member for Lowe. I just do not want to see a repeat of the mistakes that have been made at Kingsford Smith. After he attacked my motives, the member for Lowe sought to challenge my argument with what he must believe passes as constructive debate. Unfortunately, the member for Lowe, to the obvious embarrassment of members of his own party, only succeeded in exhibiting the fact that he entered this chamber thoroughly unburdened with the intelligence required to contribute to the discussion. He stated: Why does the honourable member stop at Goulbum? Why not throw in Wilton, Richmond, Newcastle and Wollongong? The member for Lowe not only must have rocks in his head but must be as deaf as Helen Keller was blind. I suggest Goulburn as a site for the airport only in conjunction with a very fast train service which seems destined to be built between Sydney and Canberra, and possibly extended to Melbourne some time in the near future. Unless my geography is incorrect, Wilton, Richmond, Newcastle and Wollongong are not directly on the way to Canberra as Goulburn is. Perhaps the member for Lowe needs a new prescription for his glasses. Perhaps he just needs to go back to Geography 101. The member for Lowe states that, because Goulburn finished last in the site selection process in 1985, any further suggestion that it should be looked at again is ludicrous. If my memory serves me correctly, Holsworthy finished second last in that site selection process in 1985 and yet it has not stopped the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) thinking it worthy enough to warrant further consideration. Again, the member for Lowe lets his dim light shinedim being the operative word. The member for Lowe complains that a very fast train would cost $2.5 billion to build, implying that this extra cost would be borne by the government. What has the member for Lowe been doing for these last few months? The very fast train will be financed and operated by private business-at no cost to the government. It will employ hundreds of people; it will have many positive economic spin-offs. Do the member for Lowe and the government not want this project to go ahead? And what of his inane argument that you could not have a very fast train servicing an airport at Goulburn because families would have to spend hundreds of dollars catching the train to see them off at the airport? Oh please! Of course, they cannot say goodbye at the train station! That is just illogical, isn't it? Well, it is certainly too logical for the member for Lowe. He also raises the bogus argument that Goulburn cannot be operated because the site is affected by fog approximately 50 days per year. My God, what does he think they do at Heathrow airport when a London peasouper rolls in-land the planes on Buckingham Palace? I ask the member for Lowe: what about the microwave landing system, or MLS, which will supersede instrument landing systems by the end of this decade, virtually making landing aircraft in poor conditions a non-issue? What about Lockheed Martin's autonomous precision approach and landing system which offers airlines the ability to operate in reduced visibility free of any dependence on ground based equipment? What about the CHURPs autopilot system presently being developed right here in Australia by BHP senior research scientist Dr David Stirling, which will revolutionise takeoffs and landings by computer early next century? The member for Lowe has shown time and time again in this House his incapacity to grasp an issue and make some sense of it. I know it must be hard for him, but for the sake of his constituents and the rest of Sydney who want a solution to the aircraft noise problem I do implore him to look hard enough within himself to find the intelligence which would enable him to make a constructive contribution to this debate. Otherwise, I suggest he stays in his office and continues to watch it on his TV set. (Time expired) Hawkesbury River System",90
207,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to place on record my deep concern for the Hawkesbury River system, which forms the southern boundary of my electorate of Robertson. The Hawkesbury River system is the longest river on the east coast of Australia, being some 460 kilometres in length. It has four name changes on its flow to the sea: starting at the Mulwarry Ponds, it becomes the Wollondilly, the Warragamba, the Nepean and finally the Hawkesbury River. I have a great affinity with this mighty river, having spent most of my life either playing in or working on the river. Even today I still live on the banks of this river. Unfortunately, I spend far too little time enjoying its beauty these days. I am not unique in claiming a long history with the Hawkesbury. This river has been a lifeline for the colony of Sydney and today it still supports a successful fishing and prawning industry hand in hand with the multimillion dollar Sydney rock oyster industry. There are many families who are third and fourth generation oyster farmers or fishermen on the river-families like the Buies, the Thompsons, the Johnsons, the Handys, the Singletons, the Davidsons, the Deas and many more who have made their living from the Hawkesbury River. The river not only has supported these industries but is now a jewel in the crown of New South Wales tourism. Each weekend, thousands of Sydney siders flock to the Hawkesbury River to swim, to fish-yes, the river still provides some of the best fishing around-to ski, to sail, to hire a houseboat, to enjoy a wonderful meal at one of the many restaurants in the area or just to sit and take in the breathtaking scenery. The river is the major fresh water supply for the city of Sydney. There are a number of dams and weirs being situated on the river. Major dams in the catchment include the Warragamba Dam on the Warragamba River, which is by far the largest. The Upper Nepean system also contains four dams: the Cataract Dam, the Cordeaux Dam, Avon Dam and the Nepean Dam. The Woronora system includes the Woronora Dam and the Prospect Reservoir. There are also four small dams in the Blue Mountains catchment area. As Sydney has grown with its urban sprawl, particularly to the west and to the south-west, the environmental pressures being placed on the river system have become almost intolerable, particularly in the Nepean-Upper Hawkesbury reaches. There are currently 21 sewage treatment plants operated by the Sydney Water Board in the Hawkesbury Nepean catchment. In addition, there are 20 licensed sewage treatment plants in the catchment, although their combined loads are relatively small in comparison with those from Sydney Water Board's plants. This is an appalling situation. This magnificent river will not survive if we allow this ridiculous situation to continue. We cannot expect the Hawkesbury River system to absorb the urban run-off and sewage outfall from most of Sydney without have a catastrophic effect on the water quality of the river. Thousands of people depend upon the Hawkesbury River for their livelihood and hundreds of thousands of others enjoy the amenities of the river each year. The technology is available to improve the water quality. Companies such as Memtec based in Windsor lead the world in water microfiltration systems. Other companies such as Land and Marine Environmental Researchers have developed sophisticated monitoring equipment, such as stratacam, enabling instant data on sedimentation to be collected. Already the river quality is improving. Tangible positive signs are appearing. Dolphins are again being seen in the river for the first time in many years. The fishing is improving. The prawn catches are larger and the future for the river will be bright if the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill and the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill are passed by the Senate, allowing funds to be used to continue the fight to restore this magnificent river. If the Natural Heritage Trust is established, $85 million over five years will be provided to the national river care initiative. How can those in the other place who claim so loudly that they wish to protect our environment even consider not supporting the government's magnificent proposals to restore this and other waterways that are such an important part of our unique environment and contribute so much to our economy? I appeal to honourable senators to support the Telstra bill and provide the $1.15 billion to the Australian environment. Multiculturalism: Electorate of Scullin",92
208,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"The only regret I have about the debate last week on the bipartisan motion on racial tolerance was that not more than 11 members were able to participate. An even fuller debate than was possible would have revealed an even greater degree of unanimity of views than was possible in the debate. All members of this House bring to this place the experience of their upbringing and their life experiences. For all but the three years when I lived in the ACT I have lived in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, in suburbs which can be characterised as working class and in suburbs which are characterised by their high migrant population. I consider that I had within those communities a privileged upbringing. My father was the local GP, who became the local state MP and then became the local federal member. But, essentially, the electorate of Scullin has many characteristics that set it apart from other electorates. It essentially epitomises many of the positive characteristics of Australia. The analysis by the Parliamentary Library based on the 1991 census reveals that 36 per cent of the electorate of Scullin were born overseas, that some 21 per cent of the population were born in southern Europe-the major source countries being Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece-and that some 4.4 per cent of the population were born in Asia. An even clearer illustration of the ethnic diversity of the electorate of Scullin is exemplified by the languages that are spoken at home-52.3 per cent of people live in homes where only English is spoken; therefore, in nearly 48 per cent of homes other languages are spoken. The major languages are: Italian, 14 per cent; Macedonian, 10 per cent; and Greek, seven per cent. One can understand that for a community with that degree of diversity to function properly a great degree of tolerance has to be shown. I believe that the electorate of Scullin, as a microcosm of Australia, shows that through the development of the values we hold so dear, which were epitomised by the agreement to the motion on racial tolerance in this place last week, we can build on the strengths of cultural diversity in a tolerant and open society. It can also be illustrated that those people who live in such communities can show a great degree of loyalty not only to their families, not only to their local communities, not only to their ethnic backgrounds but also to their adopted country, Australia. It is with great worry that, as evidenced by the present debate that has been generated, for whatever reasons, the type of tolerance that we have learnt to live with should be questioned. The range and diversity of the electorate I live in is also illustrated by the religious background of the people. The major religions in my electorate are Catholic, 39.5 per cent, and Orthodox, 18.5 per cent. I was a member of the local council when the local Islamic community put in an application to start a community centre. That community centre has now developed into a fully fledged mosque. At the time, because it was different, some people queried whether they could learn to live with a functioning mosque. If one visits Thomastown now and sees the magnificent building that is the mosque, one can understand that that mosque was able to function because of the tolerance that abounds in the community. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people within the electorate number only 275. If you look at the wage ranges of the people of Scullin they could consider themselves to be in the disadvantaged income bracket. When people look at the plight of Aboriginal people they know that they are at an even greater disadvantage, and they are willing to ensure that those needs are addressed. (Time expired) Australia Council Funding",93
209,Mr ENTSCH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise here tonight to comment on some of the reci-ient- of Australia Council funding, as detmled In the 1995-96 annual report. While many worthy organisations, groups and individuals receive desperately needed financ:ial support to pursue and realise their respectIve cultural, creative and artistic goals, I to question the suitability of some of the recipients and their contribution to the cultural development of our nation. The report is rather interesting. The Trades and Labour Council of the ACT Inc. received $58,0-0. The Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union of Tasmania received $15,000. The Trades and Labour Council of the Northern Territory received $25,000. The Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council received $17,445. The United Trade Unions and Labour Council of South Australia received $43,665. The Ipswich Trades Hall and Labour Day Queensland received $6,970. The Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council received another $480. It is interesting that the ACTU Queensland branch received $10,000. The ACTU Queensland branch received another $26,165. One has to wonder what contribution they would make to community cultural development. I would suggest that they are possibly running courses to teach their members how they can destroy public property like they did here recently at our magnificent Parliament House. I would suggest very strongly that we need to look very closely at who are going to be the recipients of this type of funding. It is specifically targeted. Worthy organisations in my electorate-the Reef Festival Committee, the Tribal Colours of the .Pacific that I have spoken about previously In the House and the Kuranda Amphitheatre, to name just a few-have missed out. They tried last year to get funding but unfortunately they missed out. There are a lot of other organisations in my electorate that tried very hard to get funding from the Australia Council to support very worthy activities. It concerns me that unions are taking advantage of this. I would suggest that in the future we need to have a look at this very closely. I am sure there were far more worthy recipients. I hope that in the next round of allocated grants organisations like the ones in my electorate that I have mentioned will be given priority over trade unions. Australia Council Funding",94
210,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"Even have though I might describe it a sham that there is a greater degree of freedom of speech, I feel provoked by the comments of the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) about some of the grants made by the Australia Council to make some remarks. I think the comments of the honourable member for Leichhardt are based on the premise that workers should not be involved in culture. I, like he does, have some trouble from time to time with what the Australia Council mayor may not grant. In fact, from questions on notice I have asked or from information I have tried to get from the Australia Council, there has only ever been one grant to an individual from the electorate of Scullin over the last three or four years. But what the honourable member has to understand is that the Australia Council operates at arm's length. The Australia Council, in funding some of those projects sponsored by unions, has ensured that working-class Australians have had exposure to many forms of culture. Many of the things that have been funded by the Australia Council have allowed culture to be brought into the workplace-poetry at lunch times, things like that. What is the difficulty? The member for Leichhardt scoffs. Why not have the exposure? In the absence of these grants from the Australia Council some of the people I represent in this place, the battlers of Australia, would have no exposure and no opportunity to enjoy the riches of culture that Australia can provide. He should not scoff at those types of things.",94

(2) Is he able to say what Article 14(3)(d) of the ICCPR states. (3) Has his attention been drawn to the High Court case of Dietrich v. The Queen (1992), in particular, the High Court's finding that the courts possess undoubted power to stay criminal proceedings which will result in an unfair trial, the right to a fair trial being a central pillar of our criminal justice system and that the power to grant a stay necessarily extends to a case in which representation of the accused by counsel is essential to a fair trial, as it is in most cases in which an accused is charged with a serious offence. (4) Does he support the finding of the High Court in its decision referred to in part (3). (5) Has the Government reduced its legal aid budget by the sum of $33m each year for three years from July 1997; if so, will this lead to a drastically underfunded and ineffective legal aid system in Australia. (6) Is it a fact that Government cuts to its legal aid budget will lead to a situation where persons will (a) seek an indefinite stay of their trial on the basis of the High Court's ruling in Dietrich v. The Queen (1992) that individuals suffering from inadequate legal representation, and therefore having no access to a fair trial, have a right to have their trials stayed, since insufficient legal aid funding will force legal practitioners to withdraw their representation from cases when funding for an individual's case is exhausted, (b) conclude their court actions early or (c) represent themselves.

(8) Has his attention been drawn to recent comments made by the Victorian Attorney-General, Mrs J. Wade, the former President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, the former Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr B. Bongiorno QC and the Managing Director of the NSW Legal Aid Commission, Mr M. Cramsie, all alerting the Government to the inequities that will develop in Australian society and the legal system should the cuts in Commonwealth funding for legal aid go ahead; if so, what is his response. (9) Are the reservations expressed in parts (7) and (8) by those individuals, all from different political backgrounds and all with extensive legal experience, indicative of a general apprehensiveness and concern within the legal profession regarding the Government's decision to cut its legal aid budget. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's questions are as folIows: (1) Yes. (2) Article 14(3)(d) of the ICCPR states the following: In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the following minimum guarantees, in full equality: To be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance assigned to him, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any such case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it; (3) Yes. (4) The Government acknowledges the decision in Dietrich v. The Queen and is working with the States and Territories to develop legislation to deal with the impact of the decision on the provision of legal aid services. (5) The Commonwealth believes that a proper apportionment of responsibility for legal aid between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories will lead to a reduced requirement for Commonwealth funding. This will mean the Commonwealth's contribution will be reduced annually by $33.158m. It is a matter for each State and Territory to meet its funding responsibility for its legislation. (6) It is not possible to predict whether any of the situations outlined in the honourable member's question will occur. The Commonwealth will meet its obligations for those charged with criminal offences under Commonwealth legislation. It is a matter for each State and Territory to meet its obligations for legal aid funding for those charged with criminal offences under State or Territory law. (7) At their meeting on 12 July 1996, the ing Committee of Attorneys-General, noting the Commonwealth's dissent, endorsed the following resolution: The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, recognising that those people for whom the Commonwealth has traditionally had a special responsibility-the unemployed, recipients of pensions and other Commonwealth benefits, students, migrants, aboriginal people as-must receive the highest priority in any such review, regardless of the different legal responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, so that people in need are not disadvantaged by any changes in the arrangements for funding legal aid, resolves that any changes to legal aid funding should be based on guidelines to be developed by State and Commonwealth Attorneys-General in conjunction with meetings of SCAG. My response is that the Commonwealth is no longer willing to subsidise State law matters. (8) I am aware of the recent comments by those mentioned in the honourable member's question. The Commonwealth believes that a proper apportionment of responsibility for legal aid between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories will lead to a reduced requirement for Commonwealth funding. I understand that Mr Bernard Bongiorno QC addressed a meeting at the Fitzroy Town Hall on 11 August 1996. In his address he said that it was not sufficient for State Ministers to blame the Commonwealth, but that the primary responsibility for legal aid lay with the State Government which should pick up the shortfall in funding. (9) There may be some concern in the community and the legal profession over the Government's - ction to change legal aid funding arrangements. It IS to be expected that people who are concerned about access to justice for those in need in the community would have a view on this issue. The changes that the Government has announced will ensure that the legal assistance for matters arising under Commonwealth law will be maintained, and will no longer be subject to the pressures faced by legal aid commissions from an increasing demand to provide assistance for criminal matters which mostly arise under State and Territory laws. In future it will be for State and Territory governments to decide what approach to take to deal with the issue instead of relying on what has been, in effect, a Commonwealth subsidy for State and Territory law matters. Australian Service Medal (Question No. 775) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Defence Stand- Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 19 September 1996: (l) How many applications has the Medals Validation Unit (Navy) received for the Australian Service Medal. (2) How many staff are employed to process these applications. (3) When will successful applicants be awarded and veter- the Australian Service Medal. Mrs Bishop--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Between 19 April 1994 and 29 October 1996, 6,620. (2) Two staff employed full-time, other staff assist when their workloads permit. (3) As at 29 October 1996, 2,489 Australian Service Medal 1945-75 and Clasps have been issued. A further 643 medals have been validated and are awaiting Vice-Regal approval and another 1,000 are presently being engraved prior to despatch. However, as Service Records are not computerised, all validation of awards has to be done manually and some delay in despatch of awards is inevitable. Strehlow Collection (Question No. 823) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 16 October 1996: What has been the history of the Strehlow collection or collections since the answer to question No. 2578 (Hansard, 19 September 1995, page 1266).",118
213,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,STATE POPULATION,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question. The Strehlow collection consists in large part of highly secret-sacred objects collected earlier this century by the late Professor T.G.H. (Ted) Strehlow. The collection supposedly had been purchased by the Northern Territory Government but it later was discovered that Strehlow's widow, Dr K. Strehlow, had retained some items. At the time of Mr Hollis' previous question in August 1995 drawn-out negotiations between Dr Strehlow and the Central Land Council (CLC) had led to an agreement for the sale of the retained component of the collection to the CLC. This transaction was funded by ATSIC. Among the material which had been retained by Dr Strehlow was such material as field notes, photographic records and cinefilm. These extremely valuable materials now have been transferred to the Northern Territory Government to be lodged in the Strehlow Research Centre, a joint CommonwealthTerritory funded institution housing the greater part of the Strehlow collection. The CLC began research to identify the rightful custodians of the sacred objects some years back, and was well advanced at the time of the finalisation of negotiations in 1995. Following further research and extremely sensitive consultations the CLC took physical custody of all but a few items in September 1996. These left-over items were regarded by Aboriginal people consulted by the CLC as too powerful to be dealt with at this time, and remain in the custody of the Museum of South Australia. Since taking control of the greater number of objects in September the CLC already has restored a number of items to the custody of their traditional owners.",126
