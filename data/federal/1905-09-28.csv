1,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-Genera""' whether, in view of the OFFICES. revelations which have taken place as to the terrible sweating that is going on in contract post-offices, it having been stated amongst other things that married men are being paid as little as jQi per week, he will refrain from letting any further contracts' until arrangements are made for the payment of a minimum wage and the consequent protection of emploves in such offices? Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - Inquiries are being made into the matter. I can assure the honourable member that the Department do not propose to allow sweating, and that immediate steps wil 1 be taken to put a stop to anything of that kind.

8,Mr REID,Unknown,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he is not aware that serious inconvenience and confusion exists in consequence of the great delay in passing the Papua Bill. He will doubtless remember that at the end of last session only one topic- a specially vexed one, I admit-require d to be considered, and I strongly suggest that some steps should be taken to complete the consideration of the measure without further delay.",13
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I thoroughly agree with the right honourable gentleman, and have been watching anxiously, from the first day of the session, for an opportunity to dispose of the Bill.. Unfortunately, however, the one question that has to be dealt with is of such importance, and is one upon which the House is so divided, that, in the absence of some understanding with regard to it, the measure would probably be lost. It is in the hope of saving the measure that I am endeavouring to arrive at some fair arrangement in regard to that matter.",13
10,Mr REID,Unknown,I hope that the Prime Minister's efforts will be crowned with success. MILITARY CLERKS.,13
11,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"the Attorneyto afford General, upon notice Whether the military clerks who were in the employment of any State at the establishment of the Commonwealth are eligible for appointment to a corresponding division of the Public Service the Commonwealth, under Section 33 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act?",13
12,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The reply of the Atof the torney-General is as follows:I find it impossible to give one answer that apply to all the cases included in the honmember's question. Each case will have to considered on its own facts, but the Government will endeavour to afford every officer the fullest of obtaining the benefits intended to given by section 33 of the Public Service Act. NA AUSTRALIA. Mr BRUC E SMIT H (Parkes) - I move- 1. That, in the opinion of this House, in view of the facts that the Japanese people have placed in the front rank of civilized nations; that they have proved themselves to be one of most progressive peoples in the world jithat, as they have become the honoured and friend and ally of the British people, and therefore of the British Empire; because of their high national character; and because they have become one of the greatest naval and military BIL L. powers of the world : the time has arrived for differentiating the Japanese people from other Asiatic races with whom they have been impliedly grouped under the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901, and for placing them, in their relationship to the people of Australia, upon the same footing of international amity ns that which is now extended to European peoples. 9 2. That the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 should be so amended as to admit of the regulation of the admission of the Japanese people to Australia being made the subject of diplomatic negotiation and mutual arrangement, subject to any proposed treaty being submitted to the approval of Parliament, or so as to atlmit of the Japanese language being .included with those of European nations as the basis of an educational test of the rights of immigrants : thus to remove from the Japanese people the implied stigma, of which they have complained, of being grouped with other Asiatic races as "" prohibited immigrants."" Whatever other honourable members may think with regard to the motion, I consider it one of the gravest importance,, because it will afford this House an opportunity to recede from the step which it took in 1901 in regard to the Japanese nation- a step which I then regarded, and still, regard, as a diplomatic mistake of the first order. It is a singular fact that, although this notice of motion has been on the business paper for nearly twelve months, I am afforded the first opportunity to bring it forward, upon the very day on which there appears in the daily press a detailed statement of the second alliance entered into between the mother country and Japan. I do not hesitate to say that that alliance is one of the most intimate diplomatic alliances that the mother country has made in modern times. It is in the nature of a diplomatic marriage, because each nation has paid the other the compliment of agreeing to afford mutual assistance, for better or for worse, in the event of war during the next ten years. One cannot read the second clause of that treaty without feeling 1 hat the mother country, of which we always acknowledge the greatness, and of which' we all feel proud, has paid the Japanese nation the most profound compliment. In order to show the far-reaching effects of this agreement, I would point out that it is provided in article 2 that if by reason of unprovoked attack or aggressive action, wherever arising, on the part of any other power or powers, either of the contracting parties should be involved in war for the defence of the territorial rights or interests mentioned in the preamble of the treaty, the other power shall immediately come to the assistance of her ally, conduct the war in common, and make peace in mutual agreement with her. This intimate alliance and diplomatic marriage has been effected with a nation in whose face we have slammed the door; and it seems to me that the motion affords us an admirable opportunity for reconsidering the step which' we took in 1901, though we can Mr Bruce Smith. hardly take that course today with the same grace that would have characterized similar action on our part in that year. The motion has, I fear, not been understood by more than a small number of honourable members. I have gleaned from conversations which I have had with many members that they were under the impression that I was seeking to induce the 'House to alter the law in such a way as to permit of the introduction of Japanese into this country without reasonable limit. I wish honourable members to understand that I am attempting nothing of the kind-no t that my view of the Japanese is not sufficiently liberal to incline me to do so, if I saw an opportunity of giving practical effect to my wish; but I recognise that as this Parliament is constituted the chances of inducing it to go back on the principle of restriction are hopeless at the-present time. All I am now asking is that the House shall deal with the Japanese people in the manner in which they asked us to deal with them in 1901, namely, to take them out of the category of Asiatic nations generallv with whom they have been grouped, and to deal with them in the same way and in the same spirit that the mother country has adopted in - regard to the much greater question of a common ground of defence in war. All I ask the House to do is to pass a resolution, which will authorize the Government to take some legislative step that will recognise the great national power of the Japanese people, as well as their international claims to our consideration, at the same time taking whatever precautions are required to guard against an unlimited influx of Japanese-if there should be any fear of such a thing in the future. It is necessary that I should deal briefly with the correspondence which took place, not only between the Commonwealth and the Japanese people, but between some of the States authorities, especially those of New South Wales, and the Japanese people prior to the passing of the Act which has so much offended them in their national pride. I know that anything I can say on ray own account would not receive very much consideration at the h*mds of many honourable members.",13
13,Mr FISHER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Why should the honourable and learned member sav that?,14
14,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I say it in no unpleasant spirit, but - I have noticed that whenever I have spoken upon questions of this kind I have been credited with taking a rather singular view; and my opinions have not been regarded as worthy of quite as much consideration as those of many honourable members whose views seem to be of a more elastic charthe acter.",14
15,Mr FISHER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I venture to say that honourable member's speeches are more engard tertaining, or are more generally read, than those of the honourable and learned memportance ber.",15
16,Mr BRUCESMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I am obliged to the honourable member for his observaIt tion, but it does not accord with the pression which I had gleaned. I am very glad to learn that my impression was a wrong one. I have acted upon the assumpyears tion I have indicated. In my endeavours to lay before the House material which my judgment ought to induce it the manner I have suggested, I have attempted to collect data from various sources-fro m the press, and from memlearned bers of this House whose opinions are more likely to carry weight than my own. I am very much afraid, therefore, that a in which the honourable member large part of my speech will consist rather to be applying of the reproduction of other people's in a broad philosophical opinions than of an expression of thoughts, to which I have frequently given peculiarly utterance in this Chamber. my hearers to possess general knowledge of the history of deal Japan, because I contend that this wav. is a question which involves the national in the world-authorities pride and self-respect of a great nation; and the extent to which that pride and have pronounced self-respect are valued by that nation I cannot be fully understood unless we posthem. sess some knowledge of its history. I small but interesting know that until a very few years agountil Japan loomed up as a possible oppoMelbourne, nent of Russia- a large proportion of people of Australia were under the impresfor sion that it was a barbarous nation the fleet of the Japanese arrived in tralia, I not only saw in the press, I heard from different members of the public, exclamations of the most profound surprise that Japan should possess an organized army, a navy, and a form of government. That state of ignorance has passed away, and the world now knows much that it did know previously. Still it is necessary, order to understand the national character and morale of the Japanese, to extent to which they have been offended by our action as a Parliament in 1901. It tion, is some satisfaction to me to reflect that, in that year, I stood in this House with' very few other honourable members to vindicate the cause of the Japanese. I knew nature of the correspondence which had passed between the representatives of Japan no and at least one State Government in reto this question; and I understood how that representative had emphasized the imof the Japanese being treated upon terms which would, at least, entitle them to be placed upon the 'same footing as some of the smaller European nations. was in consequence of my knowledge imof these people, of their national power, of their self-respect, of their civilization, and of their morality, that I contended five ago that we ought to treat them in a very different manner from that in in which we have treated them in the Immito act in gration Restriction Act..",15
17,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Did the honourable and member use the term "" morality "" ?",15
18,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Yes. I didoot use it, perhaps, in the Sunday-school sense seems it. I am using it sense, and my own I say that it is a word which is applicable to the Japanese I assume people. I think I shall satisfy the a certain honourable member, if he will allow me to with that attribute in a less restricted that some of the greatest authorities whose opinions he will admit are entitled to respectthe judgment which have just uttered in regard to Recently there have been two books published, one by the honourable member for entitled Japan and the the East, and the other by Colonel Bell, who, some years, filled the position of When United States Consul in New South Wales. AusIn addition to these works, an interesting but brochure has been written by Senator Pulsford, entitled, The British Empire and the Relations of Asia and Australasia.",15
19,Mr THOMAS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,S t ill another book has civilized been published by Mr Cole.,15
20,Mr BRUCESMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"That is so. In Senator Pulsford's book the author sumnot marizes the history of Japan in two in paragraphs, which I shall take the liberty of reading to the House. Speaking .of realise the China and Japan, he saysThese Empires, for feneration after generacentury after century, asked nothing of the rest of the world, save to be left alone. The world-speciall y Great Britain-woul d not leave them alone, but by fire and sword won from reluctant peoples rights of trade and residence. As history is counted, the years were but few since British guns had thundered at the portals of one Eastern country after another, and demanded that all doors be opened to the Britisher, not only for trade, but for residence. This historical fact certainly carried with it some counter obligations, even if there were no such things possible as international treaties or courtesy. Those who demand a privilege should be careful how they withdraw a similar privilege. Colonel Bell, who is an able thinker, has put in a very succinct . way - the same aspect of the question in a small work called Little Giants of the East. He saysJapan, to the great busy world fifty years ago, was little more than a geographical expression. True, a few foreign traders knew something of its resources, - and a few more knew of it as the 'home of happy, smiling, artistic heathens, who associated with their worshipped their earthly despot, and painted fantastic figures on small and trifling things; but, to the many, the notions regarding Japan were of dreamy vagueness. It was in 1853 that Commodore Perry chored off Unagai; and, under the persuasive influence of the American guns an official communication was received by the Japanese vernment from President Philmore. The next year the first modern Japanese treaty was with a foreign power, and soon a flood of poured in which startled this wonderful nation into resolute action. Japan was not aroused from "" savagery"" a few years; but, having evolved splendid capafor bilities, with unparalleled alacrity she moved out of a dark and narrow path, into a higher, a broader, a nobler, and better sphere of thought and action-and never raw Tecruit handled armour more dexterously. It was not the sudden development of an intellect; it was the applidoubt cation of an intellect already developed to new fields of action. I have said that the Japanese are a proud, self-respecting, and sensitive people, and the correspondence which passed between them and the Commonwealth - preceded as it was by; correspondence between the then Premier of New South Wales and the representative of Japan in that State-clearly shows that the public men of Australia had had placed before them the full effect which this legislation - was ilikely to have upon the Japanese people. I do not hesitate to say that the urgent correspondence of a great country was never treated with scanter courtesy than was this Japanese correspondence by the public men of Australia. I have here a letter, written by the Japanese Consul to Mr Bruce Smith. the Premier of New South Wales in 1897, from which I propose to read a short extract.",15
21,Mr WILKINSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Who was Premier of New South Wales at that time?,16
22,Mr BRUCESMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I think it was the right honourable member for East Sydney. That circumstance, however, does not affect my opinion as to its. 6haracter. The Japanese Consul wrote as follows: Sir,-As Consul for Japan, I deem it my duty to formally enter my protest against the unfriendly character of the legislation now proposed with regard to the immigration of aliens. Permit me to say that, so"" far as Japan is concerned, New South Wales has no reason to fear alien immigration. The Japanese Government does not wish to lose any of its subjects, and so far as the people themselves are concerned, they are under no necessity to emigrateas may be judged from the fact that wages have nearly doubled within the last three years, consequent upon the marked development that has taken place in many industrial pursuits. I may say here that, when the question gods, was before this Parliament in 1901, I had an opportunity of looking carefully into certain figures which were laid on the table by the BaTton Government, showing the annumber of the arrivals and departures of Japanese, Chinese, and of people of other GoEastern nations, in and from Australia. I. quoted those figures then to show that dursigned ing the two years immediately preceding light 1901, a larger number of Japanese had left 'Australia than had entered it. Consequently, in I contended that there was no justification legislation of what I then described and still consider to be, ""an hysterical character."" The statement that the Japanese were not new anxious to enter Australia-howeve r much persons who entertain racial prejudice may it-is substantiated by the figures which were laid upon the table of this House by the then Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton. The Japanese Consul went on to sayGovernment Although I am without instructions on the point. I do not hesitate to say that the Government of Japan will be quite prepared at any time to make an arrangement by treaty or otherwise, that will practically secure for New South Wales, so far as Japan is concerned, all that the proposed legislation can secure. In the course of his letter, the Japanese Consul enumerated a number of developments in Japanese enterprise, and saidIn conclusion, I desire to express my most earnest hope that nothing will be allowed to occur calculated to check the development of the commercial intercourse of the two countries, and to destroy the friendly feeling that now exists in Japan towards New South Wales. That correspondence took place in 1897. In 1899, Mr Eitaki wrote to the Premier of New South Wales upon the same subject, and from his letter I make the following brief extract: Mv Government, I am sure, will be quite ready, at anv moment, to give any assurance, or to enter into any suitable arrangement, for controlling emigration to New South Wales.; and they do not wish it to be believed for a moment that they have any thought or wish to promote Japanese emigration to your shores, or elsewhere. In May, 1901, the Federation had already been established ; and when it became known that legislation of the character to which objection had been taken in 1897 was likely to be submitted for the approval of this Parliament, Mr Eitaki addressed a letter to Sir Edmund Barton, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. From that epistle I shall make two extracts which contain its gist. The writer saidThe friendship that exists between the Empires of Great Britain and Japan leads me to suppose that your Government would not, willingly, take steps, calculated to wound the feelings of the people whom it is my privilege to represent. The Japanese belong to an Empire whose standard of civilization is so much higher than that of kanakasI ask honourable members to take particular notice of the point which was emphasized and italicized in this letter in 1901, because it forms the basis of my motionnegroes, Pacific Islanders, Indians, or other Eastern peoples, that to refer to them in the same terms cannot but be regarded in the light of n reproach, which is hardly warranted by the fact of the shade of the national complexion. My Government recognises distinctly the right of the Government of Australia to limit in any way it thinks fit the number of those persons who may be allowed to land and settle in Australia, and also to draw distinctions between persons who may, or who may not be admitted. As Japan is under no necessity' to find an outlet for her population, my Government would readily consent to any arrangement, by which nil that Australia seeks, so far as the Japanese are concerned, would be at once conceded. Might I suggest, therefore, that your Government formulate some proposal, which, being accepted by my Government, would allow of the people of Japan being excluded from the operation of any Act which, directly or indirectly, imposed a tax on immigrants on the ground of colour. In September, 1901, the Japanese Consul again wroteAn impression appears tc exist in some.quarters, and to find voice in certain sections of the Australian press, that Australia is in danger of an influx of Japanese immigrants. I have already endeavoured to show that this impression is altogether erroneous, and in support of this position I have been requested by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Tokio to bring under your notice some clauses of the Japanese Act (passed in 1896, and amended this year, 1901) for the regulation and control of emigration and the protection of Japanese emigrants. Under this Act it is provided that no Japanese may go abroad without first applying to the Government (in writing) for permission to do so, and his application .must be accompanied by a guarantee, signed by two or more responsible sureties, for the good conduct of the emigrant while abroad. On receipt of such application, the Government may grant a passport, provided that it is satisfied as to the character of the applicant, the position of the sureties, and also that there is no danger of the emigrant's presence being in any way offensive to the people of the country whither he intends to go. I would respectfully ask you to refer to the extract from my letter to the Right Hon. G. H . Reid, dated 16th May, i8qq, which I enclosed in my letter to you of the 3rd May last. The extract reads as follows :- "" My Government, I am sure, will be quite ready at any moment to give any assurance, or to enter into any suitable arrangements for controlling immigration to Australia.""",16
23,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Are these bonds given as a guarantee of the good conduct of the emigrants while abroad? Mr BRU CE SMITH - Ur- Eitaki says so.,17
24,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"If they are of"" any value, the Government of Western Australia should be able to recover something under them.",17
25,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"No Government is omnipotent; no Government could absolutely regulate the conduct of its people when abroad, although it might take every precaution Mr Mahon:-But I am referring to 1 recognised bad characters, who were introduced into Western Australia from Japan. Mr BRU CE SMITH - I have just put before the House the statement of a Minister of a great nation, and I think we might well pay that Minister and the nation itself the compliment of presuming ' that, if there were any lapses from the principle contained in the Act to which he refers, they were of an accidental character, and that the Government of Japan could not be held responsible for them. I think that is the fairest explanation.",17
26,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,That is possible.,17
27,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"If we began to look closely into the circumstances of our own people, I think we should be able to enumerate hundreds of cases in which the implied guarantee of our Governments has not always been justified by those whose conduct is vouched for.",17
28,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Has not the honourable and learned member heard that certain Japanese were imported into Western Australia for immoral purposes? Mr BRUC E SMITH - - I have not. On 14th September, 1901, Mr Eitaki again addressed the Prime Minister. shall not read the letter, because it merely reiterates the protests made in .former communications against the passing of legislation of a character offensive to the Japanese. He pointed out in it the character of certain legislation that had been passed in Japan, and requested that some effort should be made to enter into a treaty by which the desired exclusion might be Asiatics effected. In the same month Mr Eitaki addressed a further letter to Minister with reference to the proposed education test. The following extract from it is certainly interesting: In Japanese schools and other educational establishments the most approved European methods are adopted, and the most important works on science, literature, ait, politics, &c., which are published in Europe from time to time are translated into Japanese for the use of students. Thus a Japanese, without being acquainted with any other language than his own, is frequently up to a very high educational standard in the most advanced branches of study, by means of a liberal use of these translations. I cannot imagine any sufficient reason why the Japanese language should not be regarded as upon the same footing with, say, the Turkish, the Russian, the Greek, the Polish, the Norwegian, the Austrian, or the Portuguese, or why, if an immigrant of any of the nationalities I have mentioned 'may be examined in his own language, the same courtesy should not be extended to the Japanese. . . . That paragraph has a bearing upon the aspect of the question now under consideration. In the Immigration Restriction Bill, as introduced, it was provided that if any European immigrant could pass an examination of fifty words in an European language, he should be considered entitled to land here. It was reasonable that the Japanese should think that, if the passing of an educational test in such"" languages as the Greek, the Polish, the Norwegian, or the Austrian, high were a sufficient guarantee that the immigrant was educated in such a way as to entitle him to come into Australia, the these letterspassing of an examination in the language of Japan ,'should be Qpnsidened' equally clear satisfactory, having regard to the position in which their nation stood in further letter was addressed by Mr Eitaki to the Prime Minister on 18th September, 1901, and still another on 20th September. I ask honourable members to notice what an immense volume of correspondence took place on the one side, in order that they may appreciate what I have to say with regard to the scant I courtesy afforded by the answers which were sent. On 20th Septembei, the Japanese Consul addressed a letter to the Prime - Minister, in which he referred to the Mansard report of' a speech made by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat-the present Prime Minister-in which he saidWe hold that the test should exclude alien as well as the people of Japan, against whom the measure is primarily aimed. the Prime Mr Eitaki went on to sayMy request is that the Japanese may be treated in the same manner as an European nation. The Bill is unmistakably and confessedly turned at the Japanese, upon grounds which must form the subject of the strongest possible protest should it be passed. law, On the 5th October, 1901, he again wroteMy correspondence, however, was not fortunate enough to produce the desired effect, inasmuch as the educational test decided upon is racial, pure and simple . . . the subsequent insertion of the word "" European "" in an amendment . . . emphasizes the intention of the Bill to make racial distinctions. I think honourable members will recognise that so long as the Immigration Restriction Bill was so worded as to require the passing of an educational test in the English language the Japanese offered no objection, because all European and Eastern nations were treated alike. But when the Bill was so amended as to require an immigrant to pass an examination in an European language, it was held that the differentiation of the Japanese language from those of all Europeans was such as to give rise to a sense of injury to their national pride. In this last letter, Mr Eitaki statedI have received a cable from His Imperial Japanese Majesty's Government, stating that they consider the two Bills named clearly make a racial discrimination, and requesting me, on that account, to convey to Your Excellency their dissatisfaction with those measures. Senator Pulsford says, very pertinently, of This mass of correspondence makes it perfectly with what thoroughness, perseverance, authority, and unfailing good temper the Japanese representatives sought recognition of the 1901. A wishes and claims of Japan. I now wish to show the House how this long series of letters addressed first to the Premier of New South Wales, and, subsequently, to the Prime Minister of Australia, was dealt with. The Premier of New South Wales answered in these terms - and this is the only letter which I find on record as a reply to the three that were directed to him, as Senator Pulsford observes, in suchl an exceedingly good-tempered spiritSir,- I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 24th inst., and hasten to assure you that the proposed legislation to which you refer proceeds from no unfriendly feeling towards the Japanese Government,_ but simply from a desire to prevent a state of tilings which might give rise to much agitation and friction within our borders. The Prime Minister of Australia wrote even more vaguely, in answer to the series of something like eight long diplomatic lettersSir,- T have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the n t h , 16th, and 20th inst., on the subject of the effect of the Immigration Restriction Bill (now before Parliament). So far as Japanese are concerned, I need scarcely say that your representations are receiving the fullest consideration of the Government. This, so far as I have been able to ascertain-and I shall be glad to be correctedis the only letter which was ever sent by the Prime Minister to the Japanese Consul, in acknowledgment of the many communications to which I have referred. I submit that the Japanese authorities were treated in an off-hand manner. Apparently, it was not suflicient to have passed legislation of this kind. I cannot conceive why the Japanese Consul should not have been addressed in a spirit of diplomatic friendliness. It might have been pointed out that --whateve r the Japanese might think of the attitude of Australia-so long as the people of the Commonwealth entertained a fear that the Japanese might come some day in large numbers to our shores, it was necessary to take steps to give assurances against such an influx. H a d that been done, I think that the Japanese would have felt that they had at least been paid the compliment of receiving a clear, explicit, and straightforward explanation for the action of the Commonwealth. Pulsford uses even stronger language with regard to this correspondence. He writesIt can safely be asserted that the whole records of consular and diplomatic correspondence contain few, if any, instances of an offer so courteously and repeatedly made by a great and friendly nation being so contemptuously ignored. As the House knows, notwithstanding these protests-despit e our larger knowledge of Japan, and our growing .recognition of its national pride-the Bill was passed. I,, and others, (protested against it. I do not like to use unguarded: language, but at the time there was a sort of exaltation throughout the country, and every one seemed to respond to the demand that the Commonwealth should be freed from all - possible contact with any race which was not absolutely white or pure in. the eyes of the people of Australia. What I contend is, that whilst we may have been justified from the point of view of ""the people"" in passing a Bill to exclude Eastern races, we were not justified in differentiating between this great nation and all the other nations of the world, of which perhaps not more than four can be compared to her. We were not justified in so differentiating between them and all the European nations, as to say, "" We do not even intend to provide that your language shall be one of those in which an educational test may be made.""",18
29,Mr HUTCHISON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Why was it decided to have an educational test?,19
30,Mr BRUCESMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I can only say that many of us regarded the measure as a most hypocritical one. It was not honestly intended that educational fitness should be the qualification for admission to the Commonwealth. The provision in question was an indirect and politically'dishonest method of overcoming a difficulty, and was designed to give the Government a plausible sort of excuse for keeping the Japanese out of the country.",19
31,Mr HUTCHISON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,That is a departure from the line of argument which the honourable and learned member has so far pursued.,19
32,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Surely not. It is only another reason why we might have been more straightforward with the Japanese. We knew that we were not dealing with a dull, stupid, uneducated race; and when we found that we were legislating in regard to a people as intelligent as ourselves, it would have been better for us Senator to have said in a straightforward way, "" We shall not allow Asiatics into Australia, until we see how public opinion evolves.""  emanate from? Why does not the honourable and learned member tell us the facts about the matter ? Was it not due to a suggestion of Mr Chamberlain?",19
33,Mr BRUCESMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I am telling the House the facts as I know them, and I shall be very glad if the honourable member will supplement my statement. He mentions Mr Chamberlain, but I could, if it were necessary to do so, in a very short time find a copy of a despatch sent by Mr. Chamberlain to the Commonwealth Government, in which it is pointed out that, although we may have ample justification for excluding men from Australia On the ground that they are diseased, criminal, or dirty, we have no justification for excluding them on the ground of their colour. The Prime Minister will remember the communication to which I refer.  lain recommend the adoption of the education test?",20
34,Mr BRUCESMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I must decline just now to reply to a series of more or less irrelevant questions on this subject, because I desire to preserve some sort of sequence in my remarks. I contend --thoug h I am not going to spend time in discussing this aspect of the case, because I think the House recognises the truth of what I am about to say-that the Japanese rank with the people of the first four nations of Europe. No one who has looked closely into their civilization, habits, government, constitution, and administration, can doubt that, whilst the world has believed them to be asleep, or continuing in the old exclusive manner of living which they followed for manv centuries, they have really been making tremendous strides in every channel of human activity. Twentyfive years ago, when I was a law student in England, reading at the Temple, I met scores of young Japanese, who also were studying law, in order, that they might take back to Japan a full knowledge of the legal system of Great Britain.",20
35,Mr MALONEY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The honourable learned member might have met Hindoos there as well. It is they who gain all the scholarships.,20
36,Mr BRUCESMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I learnt from them that for ten or fifteen years past the same thing had been going on in every department of life, although the outer world did not know of it. A few who had travelled or read works about Japan knew of it, and those who have looked into their history, and are acquainted with their present condition, are aware that, for the last itit. very forty years, they have been making an advance such as has been unheard of in the cord'sof anyothernation. In 1901 I reminded the House that Japan is our all y ; and 1 could not then understand why we, who professed to desire the consolidation of the British Empire-by which is meant, i "" suppose, the wish to make it more compact, by harmonizing one part with another, and the whole with the outside world-could , in face of the fact that England was making Japan her greatest national friend,, act so insultingly towards her. BecauseEngland has no compact in existence, nor has had any such compact in modern years, which will compare for its "" intimacy "" that is the only word that I can use ire regard to this compact-wit h that with Japan.",20
37,Mr CROUCH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,No r for its limitations.,20
38,Mr BRUCESMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"It s limitations, are very small. If the honourable and learned member has read it carefully, he (must know that it is an undertaking on the part of both countries to come to the rescue of each other if the status quo should ever be interfered with by another nation,either as affecting Japan, or as affecting Great Britain in India, China, Japan, or Corea. It is a big thing for the English people to undertake to abide by the status quo which Japan has brought about in the East, but their quid f r o quo is in the undertaking of the Japanese to help England if the status quo in India should be aggressively affected in any way. I challenge the honourable and learned member to name any treaty or alliance which has been entered* into by Great Britain with any other country during the last fifty years which will compare with this treaty for what I have called intimacy and mutual trust. I have said that the Japanese as a nation are hurt, and I could, if necessary, quote the statements of fifty Japanese public men to support that assertion. I shall quote, the remarks of one or two very prominent men, to show and what the feeling is in this matter on the part of the Japanese, and I am sure that honourable members, however strongly they may hold the opinion that these people should be excludedfrom Australia, will not shut their ears to this evidence that our action has greatly hurt the pride of the Japanese people. ' Mr Zumoto, the editor of the Jafancse Times, one of the leading Japanese newspapers, has said I have written very much against it. I think _ unfair, and we feel very strongly about reI shall quote only a line or two from the remarks of each authority, because these communications are lengthy. Dr Hodzumi, a talented and influential member House of Peers, has saidIt is unjust to make distinction on account of colour. When the coloured Egyptians and Arabians were civilized the white races of Europe were uncivilized. If one people look down upon another as inferior, there is enmity, and, besides, intercourse and trade are prevented. The trade question is a very important one. I do not wish to ask support for my motion on considerations of pounds, shillings, and pence; I wish it to be supported on grounds of international respect. I want honourable members, if they can, to take so broad a view of this question that, notwithstanding our desire to exclude all coloured races from Australia, we shall at least act like gentlemen towards the people of other nations, and tell them, ""We shall treat with you and converse with you, although we as a people are strongly prejudiced against your coming to this country. At the same time we are ready to discuss the matter with you, and to tell you honestly what our reasons for this feeling are-ho w much moral, how much economic-so that some mutually respectful conclusion may be arrived at."" A well-known Vice-Minister of Finance, Dr Sakatani. has said- I consider it an Act against humanity at large, and detrimental to the interests of the Australians themselves. All Japanese are against it as an offence to our nation. Communications have appeared in the newson papers within the last day or two which clearly show that there is a likelihood an enormous wool trade growing up between Australia and Japan, and honourable members know that already Japan has esand tablished differential rates, giving an adthey vantage of 15 per cent, to Queensland compared with"" the rest of Australia, merely because that State was in the past ready to deal with her on treaty lines. How Japan will discriminate between Queensland goods and goods passing Mr Oishi as follows:through Queensland I do not know, but the existence of such differential rates shows the extent to which national feeling has operated in the minds of the Japanese. the Honourable members, and especially those who represent Queensland, know that the they had suffered. effect of the treaty has been most satisfacThose tory-that Japan has observed her part the undertaking, and that Queensland has had no need to protest against any breach. Dr Nitobe, the author of that very able interesting little book, entitled Bushido, or of the The Soul of Japan, saysWhen coming home from London to Japan I applied for a passage at Ceylon, but none of the captains of the ships would take me. I then applied to "" Cook's"" for an explanation, and they informed me that the reason was because I was a coloured man. I think that the Act is a wrong against humanity, and will be. an injury to Australia itself, especially to Queensland, and I think it cannot last. Could a greater insult to a man of culture and fine feeling be imagined ? Count Okuma, one of Japan's leading statesmen, has saidWhen I was Foreign Minister, seventeen years ago, the Australian legislators were considering the question of excluding the Japanese. I then represented to the .English Government that such a course would be a wrong to humanity, and against the interests of the Australians themselves, and that the English Government should advise the Australians not to take such a course. About seven years ago, when I was again Foreign Minister, the question of Japanese exclusion was again raised. I then represented to the British Government that such a course would be offensive and wrong, particularly as the Japanese nation was making such great advances in civilization and material progress. I have many other quotations from Japanese holding, high positions. Mr Noma, a member of the House of Reprsentatives, has said I brought the matter before the House, and all the members agreed with me that it was an insulting action towards our people. I wish honourable members to understand that this subject has been brought before the Parliament of Japan, which is elected a franchise as free as our own; and our action has been condemned by the members of of the Japanese House of RepresentativesSo keenly did my countrymen feel the slight that I think they would sooner fight Australia America on this excluding question than would fight the Russians on the vexatious as territorial question. In 1902 Mr Oishi brought the matter forward, and the House again condemned such an insulting piece of legislation against Japan. The Japanese Weekly Mail reports With regard to the Australian Exclusion Bill , Mr Oishi spoke in the strongest terms. Hedeclared that a gross insult had been put upon Japanese nation; an insult which a thousand years would not wipe out. The whole of the people were in mourning about the indignity extracts ought to convince honourable of members that this is a matter which is not being; lightly treated in Japan. The comments which have been made upon our and action there have all been of the most peaceful and friendly character, but they ought to suffice to show that the Japanese national pride has been seriously wounded; and. in view of that fact, we ought to consider whether it is not possible to effect the purpose of our legislation by diplomatic means, so as to save this great nation from offence, and our own good name as a discreet people.",20
39,Mr CROUCH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Does not the honourable and learned member think that the Chinese also are hurt by our action?,22
40,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"They have not expressed themselves in the same way; and, moreover, I do not think that they have so far qualified themselves as the Japanese have done by their progress, or by their enlightenment, to receive the same consideration at our hands. Perhaps I recognise as fully as does the honourable and learned member, the prospect that in the near future the Chinese, under the tutorship of Japan, will realise the strength of their position, and the possibilities of their people; but, at present, China is not so educating herself, or distinguishing herself, among progressive peoples, as to make the call upon us so strong as that which Japan puts forward. However, my feeling in this matter is such that if the honourable and learned member for Corio, will. bring forward a suitable motion, relating to the Chinese, I shall be happy to co-operate with him. I have had to look on many sides to obtain material in support of my motion, because I recognise that I might stand here for a very long time, and speak my own personal opinions of the civilization, culture, morality, and progress of the Japanese without making much impression upon, honourable members. honourable members are not prepared to take the step that I am now aboub to propose, they must decline, with the full knowledge that the extreme progress which has been made by the Japanese people is now being generally admitted, and has secured for them the respect of Europe. The conditions of today are very different from those which obtained in 1901. Our knowledge of Japan and of the Japanese is very much greater than was then the case, and the position which the Tapanese occupy is very much more forward. A l together, Tapan. occuoies towards Australia a. very different position from that whirh she filled in 1901. In that year we might have taken the step I am now proposing, as an act of national courtesy, but today we shall have to act rather from considerations of international policy, because we know that Japan has become one of the great factors of the world's jpeace. Honourable members may recollect a wellworn text which recommends us in certain cases to make peace quickly. It is not, however, upon that ground that I am asking the House to move in this matter, because in all the literature that has come under my notice, I have never read of one phrase used by the Taonnese which would indicate that they were likely to allow their disappointment or pride to prompt them to say an angry word about us. In fact, magnanimity is a national characteristic which will lead the Japanese rather to heap coals of fire upon our heads than to utter words of anger. I remember one remark of the Marquis Ito spoken by him after he had commented on the action of the Australian people, and the effect it would have upon the Japanese. He said that he wondered what the Australian people would say if some day when they were in trouble, the Japanese sent their fleet down into their waters-to help them out of their difficulty ! That is the spirit of the Japanese people, and no Britisher who has not studied their national characteristics can thoroughly realise their magnanimity with regard to others who have given them offence. I have not met with one report of an utterance by a Japanese politician or public man, in which anv angry spirit was allowed to escape. All that was indicated was a feeling of disappointment and offended pride at the way in which their nation had been treated. I should like to quote an utterance of the honourable member for Gippsland, which If seems to me to accurately present the position today. In the course of an interview on 13th June, he said, with regard to JapanThe question as to what Australia should do, in view of the altered condition in the East, is a big one-the whole situation will require to be carefully considered by the Federal Government. It' must be apparent to every thinking man that the sense of security we have always considered we derived from our great distance from the bases of all the great military or naval powers of the world, has now been removed. We now find one of the great naval and military powers of the earth within a very short distance of our shores. That puts us in a very different position from that which we considered we occupied heretofore. . . It is fortunate for us that the great power that has recently arisen in the East is friendly with Great Britain. She is an ally of the Empire. Of course, that condition of things might not always continue. The honourable member for Melbourne recently visited Japan, and wrote a little book describing his impressions. If I were asked to make a succinct summary of that publication I should say that the honourable started from Australia with very many .racial prejudices, and a determination to keep all Asiatics out of Australia. The book shows that his visit to Japan has caused him to completely shed all the grounds for his prejudices; although I am bound to say that it demonstrates that his prejudices continue, and that he is as determined as ever to keep the races of the East out of Australia.",22
41,Mr MALONEY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable and learned member's conclusion is right, but it is based on wrong premises. Mr BRUC E SMITH - The book has been very valuable to me. It contains a number of extracts of a very interesting character, and is written in a very eloquent and informing manner. that the honourable member kept his eyes and his ears open all the time he was in Japan.",23
42,Mr MALONEY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The language used is that of my companion, Mr Francis Myers.",23
43,Mr BRUCESMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I take it that the ideas expressed are those of the honourable member. In the course of his book he says- N It should hardly be necessary now, in face of the handling of battalions on land, and of battle-ships at sea, to deal with the notion that the Japs are a small people in all things; that their industries are petty, that steam hammers, blast furnaces, and the control of mills where spindles in millions whirr, are beyond them. They never were incapable of great, colossal,' even Titanic, works. Read Rudyard Kipling's account of their ancient fortifications. He wrote well of them in his book of the Seven Seas. Look at their stupendous castings in bronze, the mighty wood work of their temples. Turn back to their armadas of the thirteenth century. Though selfexcluded from the world, they have been well abreast of the world in all arts and industries; and now in the world they take their place in front along the whole line. That is the testimony of a member of the Labour Party in thas House, who has opened his mind to whatever impressions might be made upon it by travel in Japan during the past few months. timony as to 'the reasonableness ofi my motion has been borne by several sections of the press. The Argus, in speakinc not of my motion, but generally of the movement which I am seeking to further, said:Probably hex Government will be as ready to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government in limiting Japanese immigration in our direction as Australia can desire; but, as a great power, member admitted into the fraternity of civilized nations - and the result of the war must be to place her in that position-sh e will need to be approached with a courtesy and a consideration hitherto conspicuous by their absence. With tact on our part, there should be no real reason why Great Britain's ally should not become our permanent friend. Some persons are under the impression that the civilization of the Japanese is a kind of veneer, and that if you probe deeply into the national life of the Japanese you will find barbarism,, as you findi the' Tartar nature under the skin of a Russian. A very interesting observation was 'made recently by a Japanese Ambassador at one of the European courts. The New York Times saysA Japanese ambassador, at one of the EuroIt shows pean Courts, recently pointed out that, though his country had for many years charmed the Western world with its exquisite works of arteven those of its workmen-it was excluded from the list of civilized nations up to the beginning of the Twentieth Century; "" but,"" said the am°bassador, "" within the past year we have managed to slay some 70,000 Europeans, and we are suddenly accepted as civilized."" Japan has been able to take such intelligent care of her soldiers-that is, to save lives-that the record of no other nation is one-fourth as creditable; and she has employed the armies cared for in this scientific manner solely for the defence of her vital interests. The Melbourne Herald, which occasionally indulges in a cosmopolitan spirit in its leading articles, has paid its tribute to the national character of the Japanese. In its issue of 29th May, it said, comparing the dissipation of the Russian Army with the conduct of that of JapanOn the one hand we have the Japanese filled with patriotism of the highest order-self-reliant , well-disciplined, and fully realizing the importance of the situation they are called upon toface, and determined to face it. In the same issue the following quotation from a writer in the Fortnightly Review is published. He speaks of the steady, sober bravery and fervid patriotism of the Japanese, as distinguished from the national character of their enemies. Some tes- This motion was placed upon the business paper in November last, and the Dailv Mail thereupon published an article which is distinctly interesting, as it shows in advance what a very important section of the English press has to say with regard to this intended step on the part of a member of this House. It expressed itself as follows: The motion of which Mr Bruce Smith gave notice yesterday in the Australian Federal House of Representatives will evoke a feeling of gratitude and satisfaction both in England and Japan. His reason for the proposal is that Japan, by her work of civilization and reform, has shown her right to be regarded as one of the great nations of the world. Japan is England's ally; and it were only right and proper that the subjects of a State, whose policy, as we know, from a note of Lord Lansdowne's, is identical with that of England, should be treated with a full measure of respect by the New England of the Southern Hemisphere. Like the Italians of the Risor Gimento, they have conquered the world's esteem in battle; and whatever the issue of the present struggle, their conduct during it will be embalmed in history as one of the most precious examples of human fortitude and devotion in the hour of tribulationThe war may be said to have made an end of the ancient superstitions regarding the illimitable gulf between Europe and Asia. In Japan the impartial observers of the world have seen a State which obeys the Western code of honour, whose subjects make war in the most chivalrous manner, whose statesmen keep the pledges which they give, whose people are ready to a man to be killed for a great idea. The hard things which are said today about Japan upon the continent were said forty years ago about Sardinia, and will hereafter be said about any State which arises to disturb the existing conditions of world power. But they cannot hide the fact that Japan is in the right, and fighting, as we in England believe, for a cause which is the highest and greatest to be conceived by man-he r freedom, her integrity, her very existence as a nation. Quite apart from the war, however, the question which we have to consider is: Are the Japanese as a nation worthy of Australian consideration ? members will notice that I do not at present ask that they shall be pernuttad to enter Australia. I merely ask that we shall deal with them by treaty, in order that their national ifeeling may not be wounded, as it has hitherto been. not suggest that they shall be permitted to enter Australia in large numbers, but I wish to ask whether they are worthy of our trust? That question ought to be answered without the slightest hesitation. The mere fact that the mother country has entered into so remarkable a treaty with them should be conclusive evidence that they are so worthy. But if we must look more rilosely into the history of Japan as a nation, and the morale of her people, let us see how she stands when compared with other nations. In the first place, it is well known-and I regard it as one of the Mr Bruce Smith. greatest tributes to her stability as a nation-that she has lived for 2,500 years under the same line of monarchy. For twenty-five centuries there has not been the. slightest departure from the Imperial line of descent from which the present Mikado springs. That is certainly a strong argument in favour of national stability, and that .is the attribute to which the British nation should look more than to any other. Japan had her census as far back as 86 B . C It is recorded in her history that at the time the people in Great Britain - prior to the visit of Caesar-were running about with their bodies painted, the Japanese had established a census, and as late as 658 A.D - that is, 400 years before the Norman conquest-the y had systematized it to such an extent that it could be relied upon as a trustworthy record of her population. In 1900, no less than 13,000 foreigners visited Japan. That nation had advanced to such an extent that no difficulty appears to have been experienced by outsiders in entering her territory and travelling through it. Only the other day I heard some honourable member say that the Japanese really excluded other races from their country, and that consequently other nations were justified in retaliating. In refutation of that statement. I would point out that it is recorded in statistical works - the accuracy of which there is no reason to doubt-that no less than' 13,000 foreigners-one-sixt h of whom were Britishersvisited Japan in 1900, without any embargo being placed upon their movements.",23
44,Mr RONALD,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,A visit is one thing; and Honourable domicile is another.,24
45,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I am not asking that the Japanese should be allowed even to visit Australia. But I shall show in a moment what Canada and the United I do States have recently done in this connection.,24
46,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The Japanese can and do visit us freely ,24
47,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Certainly , they do.",24
48,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable and learned member knows that, but the statement which he made just now is capable of a wrong interpretation.",24
49,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Certain classes of Japanese come here at the present time without experiencing any difficulty. That 1 fact, however, only strengthens mv argument. If we allow them to enter this country, surely they are entitled to expect us to deal with them in the less offensive way I suggest-that is, by treaty-so that their intercourse with us other than by mere \visits may be regulated in a manner which is not calculated to wound their national pride. I am aware that my speech must resemble an historical essay; but the nature of the case demands that I should put before the House the character and history of the Japanese, whom we have hitherto treated in so arbitrary a way, and whom I wish should be treated differently in the future. I come now to some testimony with regard to the monarch who stands at the end of a dynasty which extends for 2,500 years without a break. In his book, Colonel Bell saysWhile I deny that the achievements of Japan are more wonderful than those of the British race, though the latter was struggling upward for near two hundred years, and the former was rushing forward but forty, every student must confess that in the whole range of history, there has never appeared another man, who in far-seeing wisdom, in a generous love of justice, in keenness of perception, in enlightened statesmanship, and patriotism, worthy to be compared with this Oriental potentate; and to my notion, the ablest statesman and diplomats of this age, are those now controlling the destinies of our Eastern ally. I hold in my hand a manifesto from which I should like honourable members to allow me to read four short extracts. It was the first of the kind issued by the present Mikado, in later years, when the desire for reform became accentuated in Japan. It reads1. That a deliberative Assembly should be formed, and all measures decided by public opinion. 2. That the principles of social economy should be studied by all classes of the people.' ,3. That the foundation of the Empire may be firmly established, we should seek knowledge throughout the whole world. 4. All old and absurd customs should be discarded, and impartiality and justice should become the basis of action. I say that if any reigning monarch had been asked to lay down four great primary principles upon which the success of a nation could be founded, he could not have outlined four more succinct and comprehensive principles than which I have quoted. Many people in this country, and; elsewhere, are under the impression that the daily life of Japan of today is regulated by old, crusted, con servative principles which we should con953 sider unworthy of a civilized people. But honourable members will observe that the Japanese themselves are here admonished by their Mikado to discard all old and absurd customs, and to make impartiality and justice the basis of action.",24
50,Mr CROUCH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,He r practice is altogether different.,25
51,Mr BRUCESMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I should like to say that if we ourselves were to be judged by precept and practice, and if true Christianity were taken as the basis of conduct in our own country, we should find that there is a greater chasm between the actual and the ideal than is to be found in any other country in the world. There is no country in which one standard is being preached, and another practised morn than is the case in our own. I would therefore ask the honourable and learned member for Corio. who has had a legal training, to consider for a moment the logic of his interruption. What possible bearing can it have on my present contention? I am not suggesting that we should shake hands with the Japanesethat our people should be compelled to intermarry with them-in short, that we should take them fo our national bosom. I am merely urging that we should deal with them in a diplomatic manner, in order that we may regulate their inability to enter our country. The Constitution of Japan is one which everv honourable member would do well to studv. I had the advantage of receiving a copv of it some four years ago, and I venture to say that it is one of the most enlightened Constitutions that the world has seen. Everybody is aware of the immense trouble which was taken in its preparation and drafting. The Marquis Ito-on e of the most eminent statesmen in the world-spen t years in Germany, the United States, and Great Britain, during which time his attention was almost exclusively devoted to the drafting of a Constitution for Japan, because the adoption of that Constitution was to mark an entirely new era in the history of that country. It placed her people and affairs upon an entirely new basis, and substituted for a those rational despotism- a despotism which was certainly in the hands of a very wise man- a system of representative government which is as liberal as is our own. I now propose to read some of the views which have been expressed regarding that Constitution. No less a person than James Bryce saidHe looked upon the work of drafting a contion of the people. stitutional form of Government upon the tions, history, and usages of a people whose memories reach back so far as an extraordinary success. Mr Herbert Spencer said'He considered it an almost miraculous that the new Constitution of Japan did lence to the traditions and history of so a race. The late J. G. Blaine, statesman and the journalist of the United States, pronounced it "" the most perfect Constitution in strucrepresentatives ture that he had ever read "" ; and Baron Kaneko, one of its four authors, recently reproduced in the Century Magazine some important opinions upon it, in order that the world might know what leading Euroone peans thought of that great work. Baron Kaneko himself said'The adoption of a constitutional form vernment proves to the world that it is our to 'follow in the footsteps of civilized nations; and the record of our Parliamentary proceedto ings must show that we possess the capacity master the mechanism of liberal Government; that Japan, by her earnest study of modern science, her keen appreciation of the benefits of civilization, her strong perception of national responsibility, and her perseverance in mastering the principles of right conduct, as accepted by civilized peoples, has justly earned a place in the family of nations. If we look to her Parliament, what do we rind ? She has a House of Representatives, like our own, and a House of Peers. But in connection with the House of Peers, Ave find a novel feature, which is suggestive evea to ourselves. That branch of the Legislature includes not only Princes of the blood and Peers, but men of distinguished service, of remarkable erudition, and representatives of the highest taxpaying section of the people. In Japan it is held that the particular district which can show that it has paidi the largest share of the taxation of the country shall be entitled to send representatives into the House of Peers to take part in checking its legislation.",25
52,Mr CROUCH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"That provision is copied from England, where wealthy brewers are made members of the House of Lords.",26
53,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"It is scarcely copied from England, because it does not provide that men who have succeeded in industry merelv shall enter the House of Peers. The Japanese Constitution makes provision for the nomination to that branch of the Legislature of men of distinguished service, Mr of remarkable erudition, and of representatives of the highest taxpaying secEvery Englishman tradilooks upon the practice of transferring wealthy brewers, who may, possibly, never have opened their mouths in the House of Commons, into the House of Lords, as an abuse of a fine principle. feat There is no justification whatever for no viodeclaring that the procedure in Japan ancient finds a parallel in the old country. In Japan, the Constitution merely allows district which has paid the highest proportion of the revenue, to nominate its own in the House of Peers. It is very unfair to attempt to introduce a parallel which has no application, whatever. Let us now look at Japan's Courts of Justice. 'In that country we find that there is Supreme Court- a sort of Privy Council-seve n Appeal Courts, forty-nine local Superior Courts, and 310 District Courts. of GoThey have seven Judges to every Supreme desire Court, five to every Appeal Court, three every local Court, and one to every Disto trict Court. Colonel Bell, who visited^ the Parliament and the Courts of Japan, saidIn no Legislative Assembly or Court of law whose sitting I have ever attended, is there more earnest dignity and decorum. That is striking testimony to the way in which the Parliament of Japan and its Courts are conducted. Their laws were codified and systematized as far back as 1882, and again in 1889, and I may also say-althoug h being a senior member of a the Bar myself, I cannot claim that it redounds to their credit-that they have an organized Bar of advocates for suitors before their different Courts. Their Parliament is as deliberative and at least as levelheaded as our own. Their laws are as certain as our own, their Bench is as pure as our own, and their Bar is as honourable as our own.",26
54,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Can a foreigner own property in Japan?,26
55,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I cannot undertake to give opinions on Japanese law. It is very difficult now-a-days to say what is the English or Australian law, but it would be much more difficult for an Australian to express an opinion on a Japanese law point. I hope, therefore, that the honourable member will not put such questions to me. The population of Japan in 1903 was 46,732,000, and an interesting fact bearing on our present loss of population in Australia is that her excess of births over deaths in the same year was 542,000. I wish to refer briefly to the character of her of people. My first witness, if I may speak in Nisi privs language, is the honourable member for Melbourne, who, in a little book upon Japan which he recently pubMikado lished, writesWe do not understand these people. twaddle about the little brown man and the key man is altogether misleading-ma y be disasis trously misleading. I ask honourable members to note point. The writer continuesThough I have called this chapter the "" Head of the P e r i l ,"" I do not propose for one moment to stint my admiration or modify in any way my appreciation of the people of whom I have seen a little, and-taken some pains to understand. If I find concentrated here the wisdom of Solon, the patriotism of Brutus, the heroism of Leonidas, and the war genius of Julius Cais.ir, all the more terrible is the peril to us, once that head begins to direct the movements of the appallingly gigantic body, as yet but dimly discerned, It is a head in which exquisite pathos and tenderest sentiment are blent with iron determination, and courage which is absolutely identical with the back to back courage of sternest despair; identical with the courage of the Zulu, who went on because certain death was behind ; and with that of the Moslem, who saw, plain as the rising day, beyond death, the voluptuous paradise. And with all that there is a love of country, such as, with all deference, I do not think even an Australian can understand. I think that testimony like this-comin g as it does from an honourable member who stands in the forefront, of the party took such active steps to exclude the JapanApart ese from Australia-as to the national character and morality of the people of that country, is of the highest value. If I Suyematsuwere in a Court of law I should regard the honourable member as a witness on the other side who had made valuable admissions, school and carrying much more weight than the asseessence verations of one's own witnesses. He says, furtherThey honour their parents who begot and bore them, and their forefathers, to all generations. A working race, a fighting race, a clean, law abiding race, a courteous, cheerful race. Could we have stronger testimony than this from the honourable member, who so lately visited Japan? Will the House now permit me to quote from the Tokio correspondent of the Times, who in May of the current year wroteThere is a foolish notion, surviving all that we have seen during the war, that the Japanese, not being a Christian nation, cannot possess what some Russian writer loftily describes as certain fundamental principles of morality and justice, now upon which the West plumes itself. If Christianity has any connection with the teaching its founder,, the Japanese might well claim to be the best Christians of us all. I wish, too, to read to the House a manifesto, or sort of moral code, issued by the to the schools of Japan. Manifestos of this kind are issued from time to time The by His Majesty, and are read to the schools monon important national festival days. This what the Mikado said, and I think it is one of the most touching series of admonithat tions that I have ever readIt is our wish that you, our loyal subjects, at all times honour and obey your parents, and love your brothers and sisters. Man and wife should live together in peace and love. Be faithful to your friend. Practice self-sacrifice and self-possession. Be just and honest in all your dealings. Be merciful.

The honourable - member for Melbourne, from whose book I have taken this address, concludes with these words, which emphasize the whole pointIn giving these rules, the Mikado solemnly promised to keep them himself, and made the which same promise for his successor. from outside criticism, I have here a very valuable extract from an article in the Nineteenth Century, written by Baron „ Our moral notions do not materially di'lTer from either the Greek ethics of the Platonian the moral teaching of the Gospel in and purport. Morality has been a feature in Japanese education for centuries. It has developed side by side with Bushido or chivalry, the dicta being chiefly founded on the precepts of Confucius. He quotes the following admonition from the Emperor to his people:- . It is our desire that you, our subjects, be dutiful to your parents and well disposed tQ your brothers and sistersand so' on, in the terms of the manifesto I have just read. He cmtinuesThroughout all grades of the educational system in Japan this Imperial code forms the basi3 of the moral and ethical teachings. Regular hours are devoted in the State schools to lessons in this law; and on the great days of festival it is read aloud, and addresses given on its precepts. I shall now read an extract from a leading article recently published in the Age, which is a great tribute to the national character of the Japanese, and which I think they are entitled to have read throughout tralia- , Beneath all this amazing power of devoted operation for a common national ideal there must, of course, be a solid ground of individual character; and the elements that go to make day-cannibals-whil that form the most interesting part of the study which the Jap has drawn upon himself by his prowess. In the first place, his religion looks nebulous to us, on account of our different point of view. What it lacks in definiteness of dogma and mythology it makes up for in depth of sentiment-affection , which is the motive power of active morality, is the inner spirit of the taught them agricultural pursuits. Japanese religion. The intense appreciation family affection in Japan causes the people to possessions of the Japanese people. practice kindness and consideration from their earliest years. The passage to the civic virtues is then easy. Family affection widens to friendhas ship and friendship to patriotism. Hence whole Japanese ethical system, known Bushido, rests without dogma on the principle that the highest - satisfaction is to be found the exchange of kindness. Bushido makes interests of the family the concern of each ber, it makes the interests of the State the contioncern of each family. I might make further quotations from the Age, bearing equally important testimony to the worth of these people; but I shall content myself by quoting again from the book published by the honourable member for MelbourneI have no desire to raise a scare or to promote any distrust of our allies-the Japanese. No man appreciates more highly than myself their masterly action in war, and patient, untiring industry in peace. I gladly bear evidence, also, to their magnanimity and level headedness in triumph, and to their fine toleration in matters of faith and form. Passing ever other quotations, I propose to read a tribute from the enemy of the Japanese, which was published in the R/tss, one of the most popular of the newspapers of St.' Petersburg: All the stories told of the brutality of Japanese have been shown to be unfounded. Our soldiers, who have been prisoners, and escaped, are unanimous as to the kindness shown them by the Japanese. And the same feeling is expressed in letters coming from prisoners of war. A feeling of mutual respect has grown up between ourselves and the Japanese. Our opinion of the Japanese has completely altered. My limit of time has been almost reached, and I am anxious to come to some of the more substantial testimonies with regard to the civilization of these people. I have before me testimony as to Japanese statesmanship, and also testimony from various Mr Bruce Smith. sources as to the Japanese civilizing and colonizing policy. I have also a resume of an article which appeared in the Times, giving an account of the astonishing work Auswhich has heen done by the Japanese Government in colonizing the island of Forcomosa. They found in the interior of »that island people of no higher grade than are those of the interior of New Guinea toe pirates and a variety of other criminal classes were living on the coast. But since entering into possession of the island, they have established manufactories there, constructed .railways, opened up mines, built for the people, and Forof mosa is now one of the most promising A striking contrast of some of the work that been done by our own people is offered the by the honourable member for Melbourne, as whose testimony the House will see I in highly value, regarding it, as I do, in the the nature of admissions by the other side. memHe says, speaking of Western colonizaI find it impossible to doubt that in their own lands and in their own waters the Easterners, as represented by the Japs and the Chinese, must henceforth be regarded as invincible, and not to be touched aggressively with any impunity. And, following immediately on that appears the advisability-nay , the urgent' necessity-of every power of the West considering forthwith its position in the East. A reckless and rapacious inconsiderateness has so far characterized all their exploitations, for every "" Sphere of Influence"" is but a field of exploitation. The one object has been to make profit-that - is, to drag away the wealth, the accumulated produce of the East for the support and enrichment of the West. All talk of civilization and Christianization is mere pretence and humbug. Wherever the West has. settled down in most force, there degradation of the native people is most deplorable. Bryce states this plainly as regards Canton, and it is true all along the coast. The white settlements are made up of a few high-class officials, some few of the them, it may be admitted, white flowers of the garden of our highest civilization. But the bulk is vile: and in the general system there are elements mixed, repulsive to honest democratic ideas, as insulting and offensive to the great our soldiers, people trespassed on. That passage and the facts it embodies offer a very striking contrast with the effect which Japanese colonization has had upon Formosa. For want of time, I pass away from a mass of interesting matter to quotations in a more concrete and statistical form. I have in my possession today two most valuable and complete statistical works on Japan. One is called the Financial and Economical Annual of Japan, and the other Japan in the Beginning of the Twentieth Century. Both have been translated into English, and both have attached to them diagrams cf a most careful and scientific character. I do not hesitate to assert that no country in the world is at the present time publishing statistical works which are more carefully and scientifically prepared, or more beautifully and informingly illustrated by their diagrams, than are those published in Japaln. Thesje works treat of finances, loans, currency, money market, banks, clearing Ijouses, army, navy, post and telegrapas, railways, shipping, education, colonization, and industries. They show that the trade of Japan with the outside world is worth something like £21,500,000; the trade with Europe being worth about .£9,500.000, and the trade with Asia about £12,000,000. Japan's trade with British India is worth about .£5,000,000 a year, and with Great Britain about the same. In Japan there are 28,000 public schools, attended by 5,085,000 scholars, and - 1,676 private schools, attended by 173,000 scholars. 109,000 professors, and teachers in the public institutions of the country, and 8,000 in the private institutions. Japan's schools are classified as primary, blind, deaf and dumb, normal, higher normal, middle, higher girls, high, universities, special, and technical. There are seventy-eight high schools and 400 technical schools. Occupying university chairs are twenty-nine professors of law, twenty-seven professors of medicine, twenty-one professors of literature, twenty-one professors of science, and twenty-two professors of agriculture. There are also special schools which give instruction in agriculture, commerce, navigation, and fisheries. The Japanese Imperial library contains 419,000 volumes, and there are forty-nine country libraries, containing 408,000 volumes. A writer on Japanese education says :The Japanese have an intense love for learning. There are about 30,000 schools, 100,000 teachers, and 5,000,000 scholars in Japan. Ninety per cent, of the boys, and 71 per cent, of the girls, throughout the entire country are receiving an education. The Government schools are all secular, and neither of the four religions of the country-Buddhism , Shintoism, Confucianism, or Christianity-is taught, but good moral science is taught in them all. In the school books they are taught to be honest and truthful, and sober and modest, polite and respectful to their parents, and to their brothers and sisters, and neighbours, and charitable to the poor; to train and cultivate their moral faculties; to train and cultivate their intellectual faculties, and to be upright in every thought, word, and action In the matter of writing Japanese excel; they are beautiful penmen, and good draughtsmen. Education is compulsory in Japan; the school attendance is exceedingly good. I quote the following return from the Japan Times, July iS, 1903 :"" The number of Japanese boys and girls who were of school age at the end of the 34th fiscal .year (1901). was 6,497,489, of whom 776,565, that is, 12 per cent., did not attend any school. The causes of non-attendance were poverty in 84 per cent, of the cases, sickness in 13 per cent., and miscellaneous causes in 3 per cent. There were, in 1902, 250,072 pupils studying English, while only 8,973 pupils were studying ofher languages foreign to the Japanese, a great compliment to the country to which we belong. Although Japan has a population of only about 47,000,000, and a territory of about 163,000 square miles, while Russia has a population of about 130,000,000, and a territory of nearly 9,000,000 square miles, Japan has more pupils in her schools than there are in the Russian schools. In There are Japan's elementary schools there are 4,302,000 pupils while in Russia's elementary schools there are only 4,193,000 pupils. In Japan, 92 in every 1,000 of the inhabitants go to school, and in Russia only 32 in every 1,000. The figures for . secondary schools and universities are 1 equally in Japan's favour. The Japanese are great readers of both books and newspapers. I find that in one year the books taken from the public libraries numbered 668,703. The greatest number of books read in that year related to mathematical science arirl medicine. In the next class were those relating to history, biography, geography, travels, and voyages. Then came those relating to literature and language. Next came those relating to law, politics, sociology, economy, and sta-tistics. After them came those relating to arts, industries, engineering, and military and naval science, while the rest were encyclopedias or related to miscellaneous subjects. Apparently no works of fiction were supplied by these libraries; or, if such books were issued, there is no record of them. Japan encourages inventions; 7.000 patents have been granted in that country, together with 21,000 trade marksand 2,000 designs. The Department of State records a farming, population of 28,000,000. There is an agricultural department, whose branches deal with irrigatiran, drainage, reclamation, and zation, and in connection with which there are experimental farms for instruction in agriculture, sericulture, cattle and horse breeding, while .publications on agricultural subjects are issued. a hypothec bank, with local branches, which makes advances to farmers for .all purposes of their industry. coal, oil, iron, copper, and sjulphur is carried on in the country. ; Coming to the finances, I find that the public revenue is 251,000,000 yens, or ,£25,000,000 a year, and the public expenditure yens, or £24,500,000, a year. Japan's national debt was yens, or ,£59,500,000, which is little more than two-thirds of the public debt of New South Wales, and about the same as that of Victoria; although Japan has managed to buy for herself one of the finest navies in the world, and has proved herself superior to one of the greatest European militarv powers. In banking, Japan is as much to ""the fore as is Australia. banks doing, business there are the Bank of Japan, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Hypothec Bank"" of Japan, the local Hypothec Banks, the Hokkaido Jiank, the Industrial Bank of Japan, besides ordinary banks and savings banks. In 1902, Japan's despatches of foreign mails, including parcels, papers, and letters, numbered 6,776,000, and the 7,010,000. Sixty thousand foreign moneyorders were issued, and domestic money-orders. In the Postal savings banks of the country, in 1903, there were 2,859,000 depositors. million telegraphic messages were despatched throughout Japan in 1902, and 600,000 foreign telegraphic messages were sent away. There are 30,000 subscribers in that country. mestic postage in 1902 208,000,000 letters, 484,000,000 cards, 149,000,000 newspapers and magazines, 48,000,000 other packages, 10,000,000 parcels, or 900,000,000 posted articles in all. Thirty-seven million pounds have been invested in railways in Japan, there being 3,010 miles of private lines and 1,226 of Government lines, Her shipping, in 1902, included 1,441 steamers, aggregating 610,000 tons; 3,977 sailing vessels, aggregating 336,000 tons; and junks, aggregating 2,351,000 tons. figures show that Japan is progressing by leaps and bounds, in a way in which proMr Bruce Smith. fertili- bably no other country has progressed in the world's history. I invite those who doubt the wisdom of the modest step which breeding, I advocate to look into these statistical works for themselves. If they do, they will There is be astonished at the proportion of the track and national concerns of Japan. It may be asked, what are other countries doing in Mining for this matter? I would refer, first, to the example of Canada. A cable of the 26th April stated that the Canadian Dominion House of Commons had disallowed British Columbia legislation against Japanese im245,000,000 migrants, on the ground that such restricIn 1903, tions were incompatible with British Im6 595,000,000 perial interests. In Senator Pulsford's book on The British Empire and the Relations of Asia and Australia, there is an account of the steps which President Roosevelt has taken to insure the courteous treatment of Japanese citizens, and only this week it was reported that an American Chamber of Commerce has asked the President of the United States of America to The recommend Congress to pass legislation which will promote harmony between the United States and Japan. On the 23rd June, a cable message stated that Canada Colonization had invited Great Britain to ask Japan to include the Dominion in the terms of the Anglo-Japanese treaty of 1904. I do not wish to prolong my remarks, because the time allowed by the Standing Orders for arrivals the discussion of motions has nearly expired. I only wish to say, in conclusion, 9,000,000 that I have heard a little song which speaks of "" lovers in the shade "" and "" summer friends."" Japan is now in the sumSeventeen mer of her existence, and I find great satisfaction in the reflection that four years ago, when she was not the Power which she is today, and, as far as Australian telephone public opinion was concerned, stood "" in Her do- the shade,"" I had realized her strength, included her progress, her importance, and her post- future, and then asked what I ask now. I beg the House to take a liberal view of this and question. Honourable members will see clearly that the motion does not ask that the Japanese shall be admitted to our shores, if we are not yet ready to go so far in our liberal policy. If we are not cosmopolitan enough, if we are not liberal enough, to see the advantages of having Japanese amongst us, let 18,742 us at least arrange in a friendly way for These their exclusion, so that a self-respecting nation will not feel called upon to sacrifice its just feelings of national pride. Debate (on motion by Mr BROWN) journed. HO ME RULE FOR IRELAND . Debate resumed from 31st August (vide page 1796)) on motion by Mr HIG GINSThat an humble Address be presented to His stand-point. Majesty as follows :MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY : We, Your Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects, the Members of the House of Representaphatic tives, in Parliament assembled, desire most nestly in our name and on behalf of the whom we represent, to express our unswerving loyalty and devotion - to Your Majesty's person and Government. We have observed with feelings of profound satisfaction the evidence afforded by recent lation and recent debates in the Houses of liament of the United Kingdom, of a sincere desire now to deal justly with Ireland; and particular we congratulate the people of United Kingdom on the remarkable Act directed towards the settlement of the land question, on the concession to the people of Ireland measure of Local Government for municipal purposes. But the sad history of Ireland since Act of Union shows that no British Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the nomic and social conditions,of Ireland. Enjoying and appreciating as we do the sings of Home Rule here, we would humbly express the hope that a just measure of Home Rule may be granted to the people of Ireland. They ask for it through their representativesnever has request more clear, consistent, tinuous been made by any nation. As subjects of Your Majesty we are interested in the and contentment of all parts of the Empire, and we desire to see this long-standing grievance at the very heart of the Empire removed. is our desire for the solidarity and permanence of the Empire, as a Power making for peace and civilization, that must be our excuse mitting to Your Majesty this respectful petition.",26
56,Mr RONALD,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Southern Melbourne) I have very few remarks to add which I have already uttered in support of this motion. When I previously addressed pleasure the House I omitted to explain why the movement. motion had passed from my hands into those of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. The explanation more is a very simple one. When I first proHavingparticularly posed to take action in this matter, I conamong sulted the honourable and learned member, and asked him to table a motion on the aspirations subject. At that time he was not prepared Home to do so, and I then stated that if no one else took action I was prepared to table a motion myself. Afterwards I found that of the honourable and learned member was preLinlithgow pared to take an active part in bringing the matter before the House, and I readily oath, 959 adgave way to him, knowing that he, as an Irishman and an enthusiastic Home Ruler, would do full justice to the subject. Moreover, I had already addressed the House on the matter, and I did not wish to inflict myself upon honourable members a second time. I desired, further, that the subject should be dealt with from a fresh The honourable member for Dalley recently made an assertion, which I think calls for an immediate and emcontradiction. He stated that the earMarquis of Linlithgow, formerly Governorpeople General of the Commonwealth, was an Orangeman, the evident intention being to support the organization by lending to it the weight and dignity of a highly-esteemed legisgentleman, and to a corresponding degree to Parprejudice-the cause of Home Rule for Irei n ' land. I challenged the honourable member the for proof in support of his statement, but he was unable to furnish it. I think it is and unfortunate 'that the name of the first of a Governor General of the Commonwealth the should have been dragged into a debate of this kind, in association with an organizaecotion whose aim is to set one section of the community at the throats of the other secblestion, and which lives upon the prejudices of the past. I believe that the Marquis of Linlithgow has had an inquiry addressed to him as to whether he was ever assoand conciated with the Orange institution, and, peace although no reply has yet been received, a letter has been addressed to me by a gentleman who h's so confident that the It statement made by the honourable member for Dalley is without foundation that he for subis prepared to make a liberal donation to any charitable; institution named by the honourable member for Dalley if if can be proved that his statement is correct. to those He writes as follows :I received the paper you sent, and with much read your speech on the Home Rule I consider the statement made by Mr Wilks should be challenged. He stated, "" That the province of Ulster was opposed to Home Rule for Ireland."" He also referred to my native county; Down. been in that county, and brought up Presbyterians in that county, I have had good opportunity of knowing the feelings and of the people, and know as a positive fact that they are almost to a man in favour of Rule, and have from time to time for years elected members to the British Parliament, pledged to Home Rule, among them a relative mine. Another statement made was that Lord was an Orangeman. I feel confident that statement was untrue, and if it can be proved.that he has ever taken the Orangeman's I am willing to give a liberal donation to a charitable institution, feeling confident that that honourable gentleman has too high a sense of honour to take so vile an oath. If the Marquis of Linlithgow had associated himself with the Orange movement, his connection with it would not have enhanced the prestige of the society, but would have caused that eminent gentleman to fall greatly in the esteem of a large number of citizens of the Commonwealth. I refuse to believe the statement until it is proved beyond all doubt to be true. We have already demonstrated that upon political, national, and moral grounds we are perfectly entitled to express our opinion that it is desirable to grant autonomy to Ireland. We have answered the objections which have been advanced in support of the hands-off policy, namely, the contention that we are not justified in interfering with the domestic policy of the Empire, to the extent contemplated. We have pointed to a number of precedents which are furnished by the history of the Empire, and I submit that the interchange of opinions between the Legislatures in the various portions of His Majesty's dominions are calculated to lay the foundation of a practical Imperial or Anglo-Celtic Federation. not for one moment suppose that the Imperial Parliament will regard our action in presenting an address to His Majesty upon the subject of Home Rule for Ireland as an impertinence or as any undue interference by us in matters beyond our province. No such intention' underlies the proposal. They did not so regard the kindred motion which was passed three times in Canada. The attitude of certain honourable members in opposition to this motion is perfectly intelligible. They think that an attempt is being made to intro duce a disturbing element into our political life. I am sorry to say that the disturbing element of factional prejudices is already in operation amongst us, and that our political affairs cannot be established upon a reasonably secure basis until the present vexed question of Home Rule for - Ireland is settled. I believe that the resolution will be accepted by the British Parliament in the spirit in which it is conceived. It contains one paragraph which I should prefer to see excised; but I can assure honourable rnembers that there is no intention to commit an impertinence or to affront the Imperial authorities. I need not delay the House any further, because I have already spoken at Mr Ronald. considerable length on a former occasion. I hope sincerely that the motion will be agreed to by a large majority, and that we shall be able to demonstrate to the Imperial authorities that, apart from anything approaching a meddlesome spirit, we take a lively interest in the domestic affairs of the nation. Further, I hope that the interchange of opinions between the Legislatures of the nation may prove to be the beginning of a closer and more tangible union, which may ultimately take the form of a Federation of the Anglo-Celtic races. Referring'once more to the statement of the honourable member for Dalley, that the Marquis of Linlithgow was connected with the Orange institution at one time, I wish to say that, even if our former Governor General was induced to join the organizastion, he could not have been aware of the hideous oath by which he would be required to bind himself to carry out the objects of the order. I feel perfectly sure that he will give an emphatic denial to the statement.",31
57,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO," I do not think any one can ever have his attention I do drawn to any question affecting the welfare of the people of Ireland without expressing the strongest possible sympathy with the Irish people in reference to the long and dark period of oppression and injustice through which they have passed at the hands of the superior power of Great Britain. No man can become familiar with Irish history without feelings of profound indignation at the intolerance and injustice which animated the dominant power in its dealings with the Irish people. But there is no doubt that, many df the miseries of Ireland were not due to op: pression or injustice. Some of the saddest aspects of Irish history are presented by the bitter feuds which have paralyzed the real power of the Irish race for many centuries. If they had been as united in the defence of their rights as the smaller population of Scotland has been, they would have been able to stand side by side in those days, as the patriots' of Scotland did, and we may be sure that many a dark page of wrong and hardship would never have been written in the history of the Irish race. One of the sources of their weakness was the intense dissension which in those days seemed to mark the relations of the various divisions of the Irish people, and one cannot help regretting that even today they are divided by differences of the bitterest kind. I would also say that no one can help expressing his highest admiration for the character of the Irish people. The effect of oppression and wrong upon national character has often been disastrous. Many noble (peoples have been bent down by oppression andi wrong until they have lost the noblest attributes of their national temperament. But we are glad to know that, in spite of the wrongs which they suffered in those dark centuries, the inhabitants of Ireland stand before the world today as one of the most generous, virtuous, and gifted peoples on the face of the globe. Another of their attributes which excites-and ought to excite-the gratitude of every loyal subject of the Empire, is that they repaid oppression and injustice by magnificent services .to Great Britain. Their achievements on the battle-fields, which helped to win the E m pire, their brilliance in diplomacy, their signal services in the governing circles of the nation, have been such as to excite admiration. I have said enough to show that I approach this subject with no unworthy feeling, with no disparaging element of scepticism as to the worth of the Irish race. I now come to the motion,- which is under consideration. Whilst there are many sentiments in the proposed Address which must elicit our approval, we have to ask ourselves: ""What is the practical point of these resolutions "" ? It. is that a request, in the form of a petition to the King, shall be submitted in the name of the House of Representatives of the Australian Commonwealth, asking the people, the Government, and the representatives of the United Kingdom, through the Sovereign, to make a vital change in the system ofi parliamentary government which prevails there. I encounter, upon the very threshold of this proposal, one or two most serious difficulties. In the first place, whilst upon every matter which affects any ;part of the E m pire it is the undoubted right of every British subject to express his opinionswhilst he has the right to appear upon any . platform to ventilate any grievances-whe n we seek to express our opinions, not in our individual capacity, but as embodying the views of Parliament,* and as representing the voice and judgment of the people, we have one or two preliminary questions to consider. The first is : "" What right has the House of Representatives in this Commonwealth to propose to interfere in [roo] one of the burning questions of political controversy in the mother country today?""",32
58,Mr HIGGINS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,It has been done by Canada.,33
59,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I confess that I do not take my rules of public conduct from actions in Canada, or even in the United States.",33
60,Mr CARPENTER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,We took a certain course of action in regard to the introduction of Chinese into South Africa.,33
61,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The House may have done so, but I do not bind myself down to that. A great, deal of the prominence which has been given to the subject of Home Rule for Ireland, in the United States, Canada, and Australia, has been prompted less by a regard for the welfare of the Irish people than by a desire to make political capital out of Irish disputes.",33
62,Mr HIGGINS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Then there must be a very strong feeling behind it.,33
63,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Whateve r the feelings of the people may be, they have the freest means of expressing them, both in the press and by public meeting. But the question which I wish to put to honourable members is : "" What right has this Parliament to interfere with the Legislature of the mother country in a matter of internal concern, and to ddrecu the form which legislative changes in Great Britain shall take "" ?",33
64,Mr HIGGINS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Have-w e no interest in the mother country?,33
65,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"We have the deepest interest in a number of things with which it is not our business to meddle. For example, we have the deepest interest in the legislation which is enacted by the British Parliament, but have we the power, or the right, to interfere with the processes of that legislation?",33
66,Mr HIGGINS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Will the right honourable member,33
67,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I hope that my honourable friend will recollect that he opened this debate.,33
68,Mr HIGGINS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,And the right honourable member was not present at the time.,33
69,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I hope that the honourable and learned member will forgive - me for that. May I suggest to him that he will have an opportunity of replying to my statements, and that it is extremely inconvenient to be constantly interrupted upon a matter of grave importance, and one to which I wish to address myself with all the earnestness at my command.",33
70,Mr HIGGINS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"If the right honourable member objects to interruption, I shall be silent.",34
71,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I repeat, we must draw the sharpest possible line between, the right which we enjoy as individual subject's of the K i ng to express, in any way we please, our opinions upon any question coming within the wide range of Imperial politics, and the proposition that this House should make an official representation to the British Parliament upon a question which is not an Australian question, and one that excites the most vital differences of opinion in the three kingdoms- a question which has divided people in the mother country as very few great questions have done. know where is the basis of our right to make such a representation? been sent into this Parliament to attend to the politics and the business of the Commonwealth. We have not been sent here to interfere with the people or Parliament of the United Kingdom upon any matter of domestic concern, or in regard to any alteration of the British parliamenperial tary system. I do not know what may have been the experience of other honourable memnever bers, but during my public life, which braces a period of twenty-five years, I never been asked at any public meeting my opinion upon the subject of Home Rule for Ireland. Only once did the matter come before me in the course of my public career. I recollect that a long time ago representative of a great English journal - waited upon public men in Australia their opinions upon the subject of Rule for Ireland, and in the course of interviews he called upon me. I at once told him that I declined to be interviewed upon that question. I absolutely declined then, as I, will decline now, to incorporate false issues with Australian politics. We a sufficient number of burning questions of contract. our own to attend to without complicating the politics of Australia with inquiries whether a man does, or does not, believe Home Rule for Ireland. If that subject came before the people of Australia, would excite just as lively a difference opinion here as it does in the mother try. Thus we should add a burning issue to Australian politics which is, in my ment, absolutely foreign to it. I view with ing questions today. the greatest apprehension any interference by one part of the Empire with the political concerns of another part. What has made the harmony of our wonderful E m pire possible? What has made it possible to develop the self-governing rights of different parts of the Empire but the marvellous wisdom which has led our great self governing bodies to mind their own business? I ask honourable members to regard just for a moment the immovable respect of that mighty Mother of Parliaments-the British House of Commonsfor the self-governing rights of the dependencies to which she gave the freedom which attaches, or ought to attach, to parliamentary institutions. How tempted the British Parliament must have been to address petitions to the King in. reference to'many developments in the Commonwealth I wish to Legislature? How tempted that Parliament, which stands above us all. and which We have by a few words in a Statute could wipe out all our liberties tomorrow",34
72,Mr CARPENTER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Nonsense .,34
73,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I do not say that such a thing is probable, but nevertheless the ImParliament technically possesses that power. Our Australian Constitution could have been called into being had it not embeen endorsed by an Act of the Imperial have Parliament. I make these references only for the purpose of showing the marvellous self-control of that great Parliament. We have set up harriers against the trade of the country which gave us our political the freedom. But does the House of Commons present a petition to the King, asking him to ask to communicate with the Commonwealth Home Government, to complain of the exhis ercise of our legislative freedom, even against the mother country herself? We have passed Acts which make our fellow countrymen in England, Scotland, and Ireland liable to imprisonment if they come have to Australia under conditions of honest Does the House of Commons rise in indignation, and present a petition to the K in g , complaining of that use of in our undoubted powers of legislation? Throughout all the vagaries of colonial it legislation, that mighty author of all our of powers and liberties stands by and respects counour independence-respect s our right to work out our own political destiny in our judgown way. The Empire is full of burnThey are to be found in the mother country, in Canada, in India, and in South Africa. country is wisely! left to deal with its own political destiny, its own political factions, and its own political agitations. Local agitations are never allowed to spread all over the surface of the Empire. There are occasions when it is well and fitting that these Parliaments should adopt an Imperial attitude. There are times of grief and of rejoicing in the history of the Empire when the Parliaments of the self-governing dependencies can show their sympathy with the mother country, and reveal to all nations the close connection which exists between one part of the Empire and another. But we must draw a sharp distinction between such occasions, which reveal sentiments of sympathy and loyalty which all men share, and which lead to a unanimous demonstration of good will, and occasions which reveal vital differences of opinion, setting one loyal subject against Nothing in our parliamentary history seems more ridiculous to me than this attempt to debate in the Parliament of the Commonwealth the parliamentary conditions of the mother country. Nothing, seems to me to be more sublimely ridiculous and impertinent. If the House of Commons were to discuss our Constitution-if it were to discuss some alteration in our parliamentary system-w e can imagine how our honourable friends would rise as one man in patriotic resentment at such interference with our right to manage our own Parliament, our own policy, and our own political destinies, in our own way. But what that mighty mother of all our Parliaments does not and dare not do, some of us are prepared to do in a spirit of cool complacency. We presume to cross the seas and to enter into a political controversy in the mother country on the very eve of a general election, at which this question of Home Rule for Ireland will be one of the principal issues. We make our appearance in the presence of K in g Edward, and constitute ourselves his advisers in regard to the shape that a British political agitation should take. We propose to try our hand at reforming the parliamentary relations which now unite the three kingdoms. The proposal to do so is, I think, foolish and absolutely wrong,. We hear again and again the question: "" What harm can there be ? We are asking only for an extension to Ireland of that system of self-government which we en[100]- 2 Each joy."" I think that is the strongest way in which the position could be put. Great Britain has been generous and wise enough to extend parliamentary independence to Canada, South Africa, and Australia, and some wish to say to the mother country"" Since you have done this for us, we ask you to do the same for Ireland."" That sort of statement, which is a very common one, is based upon a most superficial view. On what state of affairs did the agitation for colonial parliamentary independence arise? Gentlemen were sent across the seas to this distant dependency of the Crown to assume despotic power in the management of this country, and the agitation for parliamentary independence was an agitation against a state of irresponsible despotism. The person who was put into Government House owed no responsibility to the Australian people; he was responsible only to the Imperial Government. It was a natuanother. ral and manly desire, springing from the genius of the British race, that led us to demand a change-to desire to exchange for the despotism of the person sent out from the mother country some system of parliamentary government. We had no Parliament when we fought, and so we fought for and won the parliamentary institutions that we now possess. The moment the mother country granted parliamentary institutions to Canada, Australia, and other parts of the Empire, she granted with it an an implied power to demand even r tually separation. The corollary of the grant of the right to manage our own affairs in our own Parliament is the right to separate from the mother country, when the people of this country desire to do so. That is one difference between the two cases. If those who granted self-government to Canada or Australia did not realise that the grant of that right carried with it the right to separate-the right to absolute independence if desired, they failed to know what every statesman should have known. Let us suppose that the people of Australia decided the connection between Australia and the mother country should cease, and that decision was endorsed by the two Houses of Parliament, which carried resolutions after a general election on the point in favour of the severance of the tie which binds us to the mother country. How could Great Britain, which gave us the right to manage our own affairs as a free people, with a free Parliament, draw her sword to destroy the aspirations of that free people expressed by that free Parliament? What English statesman would contemplate such a situation?",34
74,Mr FISHER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Let us apply that argument to the position of Ireland.,36
75,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I am just going to do so. I am dealing first of all with the position of Australia; and if honourable members will give me the opportunity I will deal with the case of Ireland. I am pointing out, in reply to an argument, in which Ireland and Australia are placed on the same basis, that there are distinctions between the two. Mr M ' AHON - Did not Ireland have a Parliament in 1782, without expressing any desire to separate?",36
76,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Quite so. The history.of that Parliament, and of the methods which suppressed it, must be known to the honourable member.",36
77,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Certainly .,36
78,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"No one with the most superficial knowledge of the way in which that Parliament was taken from Ireland can help feeling ashamed at the infamous tactics that were employed. But I wish to return to two points in respect of which there is a vital difference between Ireland and Australia. I should have mentioned first of all that there is no analogy between the condition of Ireland and that of our own self-governing Colonies in reference to the demand for parliamentary institutions. We asked for parliamentary institutions because we had none, and because there was no Parliament of any kind in which we were represented. Australia, as I have said, instead of having a Parliament, had a despot, and had to. choose between the two. Is it a matter for surprise that we should have longed for a Parliament? But Ireland is not in that position. is not an outcast. Mr M'AHON - Sh e is very nearly so.",36
79,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,S h e mav not value her representation in the Imperial Parliament,36
80,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,H as any attention ever been paid to the voice of the Irish representatives in the British Parliament?,36
81,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Irelan d may not value her position in the Imperial Parliament; but the fact remains that on the only basis that the democracy of the Empire acknowledges - the basis of manhood and womanhood, the basis of population-sh e has a larger share of representation today in the British Parliament than have the people of England or of Scotland. The difference between the position of Australia and that of Ireland is that when we sought self-government we had no Parliament and no pretence to a share of representation in any Parliament.",36
82,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Surely that was not right.,36
83,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I am not saying that it was. I am simply pointing out that on the basis of union-of the three kingdoms being one-this is an important fact. On any other basis my argument would altogether fail. If the position taken up is that Ireland should be an independent community, that she has for centuries prayed for independence, that her aspiration is to be free, and that there should be an Irish' nation as well as an Irish Parliament, a different line of argument will have to be followed. I am assuming, however, that the Irish people do not wish for independence. I am asuming that they are content to remain within the United Kingdom, and that they do not wish to break off their connection with the British Parliament. On that basis I say that the British Parliament is one in which' Ireland holds a fair share of representation. It would be just as wise to ask that Scotland should dominate the British Parliament while she remains one of the three kingdoms, as it would be to ask that Ireland should do so. I wish, however, to point out that Ireland has representation in the grandest of all Parliaments. We may talk of the Canadian Parliament, or of that of Australia; but what are they when compared with the grand Imperial Parliament, which has the destinies of a fifth of the human race within its grasp? Ireland has a share, and a fair She share, of representation, in the greatest Parliament the world has ever seen. The agitation 'now is for a modification of that relationship, and I am willing to take as perfectly loyal and sincere the profession that this desire for an Irish Parliament is not the prelude to a demand for total separation from the mother country. There are grave reasons in the history of Irish political agitation for a belief that, the profession that Home Rule for Ireland is sought only because of a desire for the extension of the parliamentary life of the Empire, and not in order to assert independence and bring about separation, is not as genuine as it might be. was - a time when any people with the slightest spark of manhood would have rebelled against the English power and the English connection. There was a time when I should not have stood here for a moment to gainsay the right of the Irish people to any remedy of the wrongs under which they suffered. There is no doubt that the desire to make Ireland a real partner in this great Parliament-the desire to give the Irish people an honest share in the rights and liberties of Englishmen and Scotchmenhas been very tardy. It was in a very tardy and grudging way that the English people of seventy, eighty, or a hundred years ago gave Ireland any! sort of share in the rights of free men. If the people of Ireland at such a time had risen in rebellion and cast off the British yoke, no man who respects human rights would have said that they were not entitled to do so. I am happy to say, however, that a different relationship has grown up between the Irish people and the rest of the people of the United Kingdom. Reparation has been tardy, but it has been magnificent. No one can forget the grand part that Gladstone, played in redeeming the character of the British people in their dealings with Ireland-n o one can forget that mighty effort which disestablished the dominant .church, then representing only a fraction of the people. No one can forget that Mr Gladstone",36
84,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,W as a Home Ruler.,37
85,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"He was, and his motives in declaring for Home Rule were of the noblest character. There is no doubt that Gladstone's inspiration was a noble one. He believed that, by extending self-governing institutions to Ireland, he would crown the real, true, and lasting union between the Irish people and the people of Great Britain. But I am addressing a House of Parliament in this distant part of the King's dominions, in which it is proposed to express an opinion in favour of a radical change in the parliamentary institutions of a self-governing community.",37
86,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,In favour of what Mr . Gladstone advocated.,37
87,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The name of Gladstone is one that I revere; but it should remind us that one of the best inspirations of his policy was the maintenance of ithe right of people to manage their own affairs. Shall we be managing our own affairs if we at There this time interfere in a parliamentary struggle which will presently be submitted to the arbitrament of a General Election in the United Kingdom? There may be members who were sent into this House to express the voice of their constituents on the question of Home Rule for Ireland, but I am not one of them. During the past twenty-five years I have never been asked by my electors one single question on this subject. If I am to vote on it, as the representative of East Sydney, surely I must first know what the electors of East Sydney think in regard to it? My private opinion is quite anothejr imatter. The seventy-five members of this House can, every one of them, go on to the platforms of Australia, and express their opinions on the subject of Home Rule in the freest way possible. They can address public meetings on the subject; but, in doing so, they will be expressing only their own views and opinions. They have, so far as I know, no right to represent the views of their constituents. The expression of our individual views outside this Chamber is one thing, and the expression of our views as the representatives of the Australian people is another. Our action here should be based only on opinions submitted to our constituents, and after their opinions have been ascertained-no t by a secret method, or by guessing or jumping at conclusions-bu t as the result of open discussion. My honourable friends must admit that if this question be put before the country as a live political issue for the next elections, it would turn Australian politics upside down. Speaking of the constituencies generally, no one can say what their verdict would be in regard to it. We have no right to arrogate to ourselves the power to speak on behalf of the Australian people when they have not authorized us to do so, and when we have not asked for authority to do so. As I have said, we can declare our own opinions on this subject outside, but we have no right to use the name of Parliament in expressing them as if they were the opinions of the people. This issue has never been before the people. I decline to countenance any such action.. This discussion will, unhappily, tend to bring the question into the arena of Australian politics. Will not the fact that honourable members voted on this subject here be remembered by their constituents when they review their actions? But do we wish to complicate the burning questions which will have to be settled at the next election in Australia with the question concerning the right sort of Parliament to have in the mother country-whethe r there shall be one Parliament for England, Scotland, and Ireland, or one for England and Scotland, and another for Ireland ? The issue may come to this: A candidate may say to the Socialists in his constituency - and I have no doubt that in many cases it would be a determining appeal - "" I am not a Socialist, Michael; but I am a Home R u l e r "" ; or "" I am a Socialist, Andrew; but I am not a Home Ruler."" I regard the question of Home Rule for Ireland as one which must be left for determination to the good sense and intelligence of the 41,000,000 of the British people. It has nothing to do with the politics of Australia.",37
88,Mr THOMAS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"A lot of votes are given now for or against a candidate, according to his religion.",38
89,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable member reminds me of a state of things which I think no one wishes to aggravate. The honourable member for .'Gwydir-to show how near we are to sectarianquestions in discussing the subject of Home Rule-whe n I jocularly mentioned Home Rule a few days ago, seriously exclaimed, ""What right have you to raise the sectarian question?"" A representative of the people mixes up sectarian issues with the Home Rule question so closely that I could not mention Home Rule without being accused of raising the sectarian issue.",38
90,Mr THOMAS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,It was the way in which the right honourable member mentioned Home Rule that made the honourable member for Gwydir exclaim.,38
91,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The interjection of the honourable member for the Barrier reminded me of the occurrence, and enables me to add that those who wish to preserve the politics of Australia from side issues should avoid intruding this question of Home Rule. I wish again to emphasize the fact that every member whom I am addressing has a perfect right to talk about Home Rule outside the House. As a British subject, he can hold meetings to advocate it, he can write articles in support of it, and he can seek to influence the people upon in every conceivable way. But in this House Ave are not authorized by our electors to express their opinions on the subject. We are free to govern Australia; we are free to take up all sorts of matters,, as they arise, in the exigencies of Australian legislation, whether they have been before the electors or not. But I draw a sharp line between the use of our consciences, our judgments, and our advocacy in Australia of Australian reforms, and the arrogation of a right to speak for the 4,000,000 of Australian people on a subject which has nothing to do with Australian politics. Surely if Ave think we are competent to vA'ork out our own destinies, Ave might gi\ e the people of the mother 7 country equal credit for ability to Avorkout their political destinies. Do A\-e think that we can shed a luminous ray of statesmanship upon this troublesome problem by merely expressing our opinion ? For that is all the motion amounts to. It asks that we shall express our individual opinion that Home Rule for Ireland is an advisable thing for the Imperial Parliament to agree to. The vital point on which this question turns is one which the English, Irish, and Scotch people must settle for themselves. It is this : Will the extension of a special Parliament to the Irish people, Avhilst no special Parliament is extended to the English or Scotch people, strengthen or AA'eaken the tie which unites Ireland AA'ith the United Kingdom? As Ave settle that question, Ave settle the question of an Irish Parliament. Those Avho honestlv belieA-e that this change will strengthen the tie betAveen Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to advocate it in every way they can, but I say to them, ""Advocate it in your OAvn names. Express your o\yn vieAvs. Do not put forward the expression of your views as if your constituents had empOAvered you to express their vieAvs, and to express them in the Avav in which you have expressed your OAvn AdeAvs."" That is the strong distinction which I draAV. The question Avhether the granting of a Parliament to Ireland will Aveaken or strengthen' the relations betAveen Ireland and Great Britain is the vital point. There is nopossibility of a separation betAveen England' and Ireland so long as the British Empirelasts ; it is inconceivable. Tust think onwhat a diminutive base that vast and marvellous superstructure of Empire, which overshadoAvs the Avhole earth today, rests.. Fracture the base upon which our mighty Empire stands, and you seal the doom. of that Empire. I leave it to the wisdom of the people in the mother country to decide this burning question. It is within the province of their politics, while it is not within the province of our politics. I leave it to them to settle this .great problem, which affects the happiness and welfare of the Irish and British people. No man has a more earnest desire than I have that such a settlement mav be arrived at as will strengthen and increase the prosperity of Ireland, while preserving the - stability of the Empire. I do not think I should act fairly if I did not put the position which I take up plainly before the House, and, in order that honourable members may take a course which will probably be more satisfactory than negativing the motion, or agreeing to the previous question, I have a proposal to make. thought at one time of moving the previous question; but I felt that such a course might be thought to be unsympathetic with respect to the legitimate aspirations of the Irish people. I have no desire to take up any unkind attitude with respect to that once oppressed and once wronged people. I have no desire to add in the least degree to the misfortunes of that country. But I put the Ireland of today before the world as a country which has been treated more generously than any other - during the last twenty years. So ardent has been the desire even of the resolute - opponents of Home Rule, the Conservative Party of England, to do some long delayed measure of justice to Ireland that the principles of British legislation have c-een strained to breaking point in favour, not of the dominant power of the landlords and tenants of the great rural districts of England and Scotland, but of the people of Ireland. £100,000,000 of British money have been pledged to place the Irish landlords and tenants in .a position that British landlords and tenants have never occupied and never will - occupy. That is, I say, a magnificent proof of the generosity of the dominant power, which might have employed the most barbarous methods of past ages for the purpose of oppression and wrong. But in the brighter stage upon which the relations of England and Ireland have - entered, we see the unbending Tories forgetting all their principles and prejudices with regard to the ownership of land in their endeavours to place the Irish tenants upon a better footing than they ever occupied before.",38
92,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,They have put millions of money into the pockets of the landlords.,39
93,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"But millions of the English people have not landed estates. The honourable member's statement might applyto a few fortunate gentlemen who have large estates in Ireland, but that daring departure from all maxims of British law in reference to the ownership of land would have been impossible if it had not proceeded from a generous impulse of the whole British people. I look upon that as a sign of brighter days, because the generous treatment of a generous people like the Irish race must yield a rich harvest of goodwill and understanding.",39
94,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"That was an act of geneI rosity to the Irish landlords, who have been enriched to the extent of £12,000,000.",39
95,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"That is one view of the matter; but does the honourable member forget the improvements effected in the condition of the Irish tenants. I think that there is some reference in the resolution before us to the enormous benefits conferred on the Irish peasantry, who were at one time in a condition of the utmost misery. We know that now the tenant can stand up against his landlord in the face of the law, and obtain some justiceand generous justice too. In conclusion, I desire to say that no man wishes Ireland a more generous measure of prosperity and contentment than I do, but I leave this question of parliamentary policy and parliamentary change, to the august tribunal of the people of the United K in gdom, and, so far as I am concerned, I shall stand against the intrusion into this Parliament of burning questions which have created so much bad blood and bad feeling in other parts of the Empire. I move as an amendment That all the words after "" That "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :- "" whilst in full sympathy with every movement calculated to advance the best interests of Ireland, this House declines to petition His Majesty either in favour of or against a change in the parliamentary system which at present prevpils in the United Kingdom1. Because this House does not consider such matters within its legitimate province ; 2. Because they will shortly become issues in an appeal to the electors of Great Britain and Ireland, in which this House has no right to interfere; and 3. Because this House confidently relies upon the fairness and wisdom of the British people for the removal of every just Irish grievance in the manner most likely to promote the welfare of the Irish people and the stability of the Empire.""",39
96,Mr HIGGINS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"On a point of order, may I ask your ruling, Mr Speaker; as to whether the amendment is not in effect a negative of the motion? The right honourable and learned member declines to petition H is Majesty, and gives certain reasons for his refusal. I think that we ""are entitled to ask honourable members to vote upon the straight clear-cut issue whether they are in favour of the petition or not.",40
97,Mr SPEAKER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"To my mind, there are three possible issues; one is to declare - in favour of the petition as it stands, another is to negative the proposal to petition altogether, and the third possible issue is such a one as that presented by the amendment,' which comes between the two extremes. That is the position so far as I gather it from having heard the amendment read, and if my impression be correct the amendment is perfectly in order. If, after I have had time to further consider the amendment, I find that it is merely an expanded negative, it will be my duty to rule it out of order. At present I think it is more in the natuie of the "" previous question,"" and therefore in order.",40
98,Mr CAMERON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO," I speak upon this question under a great disability, since I am called upon to follow the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney, who has just treated the House to a most eloquent speech. I stand at the further disadvantage of having received from a number of my constituents a request that I should support the motion. I recognise the fact that if I do not comply with their desire I shall excite a considerable amount of animosity in my electorate, which may have a disastrous personal effect in the future. However, I have never hesitated to do what I believe to be right; and, when I remember that some time ago I opposed the motion in favour of petitioning the English Parliament against the introduction of Chinese labour into the Transvaal, on the ground that we had no right to interfere in such matters, I do not see how I can support the present proposal. On the occasion referred to I expressed the opinion that the English Government would treat the petition with contempt, and my prediction proved to be a true one. In dealing with this matter we must remember that the decision of the Irish people to cast in their lot with Great Britain was arrived at in their own Parliament, and, although it has been asserted that certain members of that Legislature were bought over by Lord Castlereagh, the fact remains that the representatives of the Irish people, of their own free will, deliberately entered into the union. Under, these circumstances, it seems to me that we have no right whatever to interfere. We must also remember that Scotland, which at that time was in exactly the same position as Ireland, has never asked for a Parliament of her own.",40
99,Mr RONALD,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Yes , she has.",40
100,Mr CAMERON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"We . k n o w that there are always discontented people in every community, and it is possible that a few Scotchmen may have desired to see a Scotch Parliament established, but there never has been an expression by the Scotch people of a unanimous desire to have a Parliament of their own. It is quite possible that Great Britain may in time grant powers of administration to the Irish people similar to those which are now exercised by the London County Council- a system of, local government which has latterly come much into vogue in Great Britain-bu t it is not for us to say that the time is ripe for any such change. What does this proposal mean? Does any honourable member suppose that the Irish people will be content to have a local Parliament which will have no voice in matters relating to the army and navy? Is it not recognised that this is merely the thin end of the wedgethat the more the Irish people get, the more they will want? What have the people of Ireland been doing during the last twenty years? They have been agitating for Home Rule, not by legitimate means, but by means of incendiary methods. It cannot be said that the Irish people have been unjustly treated so f ar as their representation in the British Parliament is concerned. Some time ago, when a redistribution of seats in the British Parliament was proposed, it was established beyond doubt that, in proportion to population, Ireland possessed more representatives than England, and considerably more than Scotland. If the motion be carried, we shall deliberately invite the Imperial authorities to administer a snub, and we shall deserve it. Honourable members must remember that I warned them as to what would be the result of forwarding a petition to the Imperial Government on the subject of the introduction of Chinese into' the Transvaal. It is true that only five honourable members joined with me in voting against that proposal. How was the petition received ? Were we not, in effect, told to mind our own If we adopt this motion I am satisfied that similar treatment will be meted out to us. Are we perpetually to invite "" snubs,"" and to remain silent under them ? I do hope that honourable members will exhibit a little common sense upon the present occasion. God knows we have enough to do to mind our affairs, without attempting to interfere in matters which do not concern us. I am perfectly aware that the views which I am expressing will prejudicially affect my position at election time; but I am indifferent to any such consideration. I maintain that during the past fifteen or twenty years the people of Ireland have received the very greatest consideration at the hands of the British Parliament, and even if I stand alone, I shall be found opposing any motion which contemplates interference by this branch of the Legislature in a matter in which we are not concerned.",40
101,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO," When the motion in reference to the introduction of Chinese labour into South Africa was submitted in this House, I was one of those who protested against it. I take up a precisely similar attitude upon the present occasion. The question of the wrongs of Ireland is one upon which honourable members may Hold their individual opinions, but as a deliberative body this House has no right to discuss it. A motion of this character must inevitably engender class bitterness. I hold certain views upon the question of Home Rule for Ireland, but t contend that it is not a matter upon which we should pelled to vote, inasmuch as it in no way affects the Commonwealth. Mr KING O'MALLEY - What would the honourable member think if the Imperial awav authorities closed the Tasmanian Parliathink from ment?",41
102,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The British Legislature has no power to take any such action. But let me suppose that the House Commons recommended the people of Tasber mania to secede from the Federation. Australia ? What would be the effect upon this House ? Why, every member would be heard violently protesting against its action.",41
103,Mr RONALD,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,There is no analogy between the two things.,41
104,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,There is a perfect analogy. In many respects the House of Commons has more right to dictate to us business ? than we have to dictate to it.,41
105,Mr RONALD,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,We are not dictating.,41
106,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"We are attempting to interfere in a matter which does not concern us, and we are endeavouring to coerce members of the House of Commons upon that question.",41
107,Mr RONALD,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,B y forwarding them a respectful request?,41
108,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"It is a request-wit h a bludgeon at their heads. If we agree to this motion, we might just as well adopt a resolution affirming that the crofters in the Hebrides off the coast of Scotland should be granted a system of Home Rule.",41
109,Mr DAVID THOMSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,They have never asked for it.,41
110,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"It is true that they have not asked for it, but why should we not take up the question on their behalf? The same remark is applicable to the inhabitants of Wales. From time to time the Welsh people havfe laboured under many grievances. Surely they have the same right to be cut off from the British Parliament as have the people of Ireland. I protest against any action being taken upon the lines indicated by this motion. We know that for many years the subject of Home Rule for Ireland has been a burning one in British politics.",41
111,Mr KING OMALLEY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,It is the weak be comspot in the British Empire.,41
112,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I do not agree with the honourable member. It has been implied that if Home Rule be not granted to Ireland the peoDle of that country will break that the British Empire. I do ndf> they will. As honourable members are aware, there are two distinct and separate sections in Ireland.",41
113,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,What are their relative of proportions? Would the honourable memallow a minority to rule a majority in,41
114,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Certainl y not. In the north-western corner of Ireland there is the section which is known as the Ulster Irish, and in the southern and south-eastern portions of that country the other section is to be found. Both sections have rendered yeoman service to the Empire in all parts of the world, and both are entitled to every consideration at the hands of the Imperial Parliament. But I would point out that during recent years the Irish people have been extremely well represented in the House of Commons. As a matter of fact, they are far better represented there than are the people of Wales and Scotland. It - is not our province to take cognizance of wrongs which were committed many years ago. We have only to consider the character of recent legislation by the Imperial Parliament to see that determined efforts are being - made to relieve the ills from which Ireland has suffered. The primary object of the Land Purchase Act whio'h is in operation at the present time is to settle the Irish pea- santry upon the soil. That Act is of a most liberal character. The leaders of the Irish party in the House of Commons are perfectly satisfied that Great Britain has dealt with Ireland in a very generous manner indeed.",42
115,Mr RONALD,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Nobod y denies that.,42
116,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Then the honourable member must admit that a successful attempt has been made to redtess the wrongs from which the Irish people previously suffered.,42
117,Mr RONALD,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Stil l the people of Ireland have a right to demand self-government.,42
118,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"They wish to revert to the parliamentary days of Grattan-and I am proud to know that I! bear the name of that illustrious man. If Home Rule is to be granted to Ireland, why should it not be granted to Scotland? Why should we not make representations in favour of the people of Scotland being granted a Parliament of their own ? I hold that we have no right to deal with this question, and I regret that it has been brought forward. I have always felt that it is undesirable that the class bitterness which exists in the old land should be stirred upi in Australia. It should be our wish to keep ourselves and our politics free from such matters. We should confine our attention to questions affecting the people of the Commonwealth. Home Rule for Ireland is not a matter that directly affects one individuals in Australia, nor can it be said that it affects us externally. It is one that does not come within our sphere ofi external influence, and I therefore protest against such, a motion being submitted to the HouseIf the amendment be in order, I shall certainly support it, and if not, I shall do my best to so amend the motion that honourable members may show by their votes that they feel, not only that this House has no right whatever to deal with the question, but that it is highly undesirable that the Parliament of Australia should be brought into contact with the class bitterness of the old land.",42
119,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO," The Question that has been put before the House by the honourable member for Southern Melbourne, and subsequently by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, is a very prickly one, and, like most prickly things-especiall y nettlesneeds to be firmly grasped. I do not propose to hedge on the advisableness of the Commonwealth Parliament considering the question of Home Rule being granted to a country to which our legislative deliberations do mot extend. The right honourable member for East Sydney, in moving the amendment now before the Chair, very clearlv placed three, facts before the House'. He urged, first of all, that we had absolutely no mandate from the people of Australia to consider this question; and, secondly, that even if we had, we have no right to interfere. Finallv, he contended, with great force, from the point of view of any one who loves the Empire, that it is neither expedient nor wise for the House to meddle in matters over which it has 'no control. I think that the right honourable member proved each of these contentions up to the hilt. I must sav that I regret that the advocates of this proposal have not seen fit to attempt to Tebut any of his arguments.",42
120,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,There is not much to rebut.,42
121,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"That is entirely a matter of opinion. I believe, however, that the people of the Commonwealth will hold that there is much to be rebutted. Honourable members who have been supporting the motion, and who, at the inception of the debate, were most anxious to speak, are silent when, argument is met with argument.",42
122,Mr MAHON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The honourable member surely does not think that the mover of the motion should speak twice?,42
123,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,He has the right to discuss every amendment that may be submitted.,43
124,Mr TUDOR,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Le t us take a vote.,43
125,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The r e are some honourable members who dare not speak to the question, and their only desire is that we should proceed to a division. Those who were at one time so anxious to speak in support of the motion are now not at all eager to do so, the reason being that the arguments adduced in opposition to it are obviously irrefutable. The question of whether we have a mandate from the people of Australia to deal with this matter is covered by the amendment. I have no hesitation in saying that if any honourable member, were to *go before his constituents and tell them frankly that he considered they had instructed him to vote for the' motion, they would not be so keen to again entrust hilm with their confidence. Honourable membeirs may go on the public platform and try to educate their constituents up or down to their appreciation of this proposal, but they have no right to attempt to use the House as an educational medium for the people of Australia in respect of questions that do not concern the well-being of the Commonwealth.",43
126,Mr KING OMALLEY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,A r e we not part of the Empire?,43
127,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"We are part of the E m pire, every self-governing section of which has complete local autonomy.",43
128,Mr KING OMALLEY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,E x c e p t Ireland.,43
129,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"A r e we yet to learn that Ireland has no representation in the House of Commons? Are we to understand that the States of Australia, because they have not eachl exclusive control of the Commonwealth, are not represented in the Federal Parliament? Are Victoria apd New South Wales not autonomous States? their peoples self-representeHi in the Commonwealth of Australia? And vet the honourable member tells us that Ireland has no Parliamentary representation. He forgets that Ireland is as near to the place of meeting of the Imperial Parliament as is Svdney to the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. Mr G . B . EDWARDS - And that she has more than her fair share of representation in the British Parliament.",43
130,Mr KEIXY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Considerably more. What have we to do with the cry for Home Rule? We have not yet been told what Home Rule is. A friend of mine, when asked "" A r e you in favour of Home R u l e ? "" replied, ""It largely depends upon what Home Rule is . "" Until we know what Home Rule is, how can we be expected to express an opinion upon the question of whether it shall be given to a part of the Empire over which we have no control ? The question is not whether Home Rule shall be granted, but whether we ought to obtrude our interference at a critical time, and attempt to unduly influence the electors of another part of the Empire with respect to a matter that concerns them, and them alone. Those who have dealt at length with the maltreatment-and I use the word ""maltreatment"" advisedlywhich the people of Ireland suffered in centuries gone by at the hands of the mother country, may well be asked whether they can find in the long range of history the case of any country which, in the centuries long passed, did not maltreat its dependencies, or its people. Let us look, for example, at France, and endeavour to ascertain whether there is any demand on the part of the descendants of the Huguenots for separation from the central authority. We find among those people nothing but the most loyal devotion to the great country of which they form a part. In the great heart of the Irish people, when it is ujntroubled by political agitation, we also find expressions of the most loyal devotion to the inspiration andi ideal of Empire, and satisfaction with Ireland's part in the Empire. Do honourable members opposite deny that that is so? Their silence shows that they know that my statement is correct. If the matter be not sufficiently clear to honourable members, they have only to look at the motion which has been put before the House. It beginsAre not We, Your Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects, the members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, desire most earnestly in our name and on behalf of the people whom we represent, to express our unswerving loyalty and. devotion to Your Majesty's person and Government. Can they speak on Home Rule on behalf of their electors?",43
131,Mr GB EDWARDS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Where did they get the mandate?,43
132,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"That is the point. The motion continuesWe have observed with feelings of profound satisfaction the evidence afforded by recent legislation and recent debates in the Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom, of a sincere desire now to deal justly with IrelandThis, I believe, is the blarney-stone; but if those responsible for the' motion have sincerely used these words, they are surely prepared to leave to this beneficent authority, which is now ready, according to their own statement, to deal with Ireland fairly, the destinies and future prosperity of that country, which we all wish well. these words were not sufficient, the motion continuesand in particular we congratulate the people of the United Kingdom on the remarkable Act directed towards the settlement of the land question, and on the concession .to the people of Ireland of a measure of local government for municipal purposes. It has been said by an honourable member, who has spoken in support of the motion - I think it was the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne - that Home Rule for Ireland does not mean absolute separate autonomy for that country.",43
133,Mr KING OMALLEY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Of course not.,44
134,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The motion itself declares that those honourable members who tell us that they do not wish Ireland to have complete autonomy are congratulating the people of the United Kingdom on having granted to the people of that country a measure of local government for municipal purposes.,44
135,Mr RONALD,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,What of that?,44
136,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"It shows that the Parliament, which it is proposed to insult with the concluding sentences of_ this message, is prepared to deal justly with the people of Ireland, and has already agreed that a considerable measure of that partial autonomy, of which the framers of the motion say they are in favour, shall be granted to her. _ I think it is clear from the opening sentences of the motion that those responsible for it feel that the Parliament of the United Kingdom is eminently fitted to deal, and to deal justly, with the people of Ireland. Having that view. I entirely fail to understand the reason for the insult comprised within the concluding sentences of the proposed petition.",44
137,Mr CAMERON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Rea d them.,44
138,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The motion goes on to say thatThe sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no British Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland. Those who are responsible for the motion say in one sentence that the Imperial Par-;, liament is eminently just, and anxious to deal with the question of Ireland's wrongs, and in another that no British Parliament can deal with the question. Surely that is a most extraordinary contradiction. Are honourable members sincere when they say that they have observed in the Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom "" a sinAs if cere desire now to deal justly with Ireland,"" and add that ""no British Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions of Ireland "" ? Are those honourable gentlemen casuistical? Do they put both statements in order that they may snare voters, or are they unable to make up theft minds as to which statement is true?",44
139,Mr CAMERON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,They should abide by one statement or the other.,44
140,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Yes . As has been pointed out, although we are asked to express our opinion on this subject as ""the members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled,"" we have no mandate to deal with it from the people whom we represent. Why, then, should an obvious misstatement be made in this proposed humble address to His Majesty the King? Surely, if we owe anything to the constitutional head of this great Empire, it is to fearlessly tell the truth-if , indeed, we do. not owe that duty to our self-respect and the sense of conscience which even politicians may be expected to possess. But the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne does not ask for absolute local autonomy for Ireland, although he speaks of us as ""enjoying and appreciating the blessings of Home Rule,"" and therefore asking for similar advantages for that country. All he asks for is "" that a just measure of Home Rule may be granted to the people of Ireland."" What is "" a just measure of Home Rule "" ? Again, we are told that the people of Ireland have asked for Home Rule through their representatives. Where are those representatives asking for it ? Are they asking for it in Australia, where, we can Hear them, or in the Hous.es of Parliament at Westminster, in the heart, of the Empire, where the people of the United Kingdom can hear them? Are we in as good a nosition to know how ""clearly,"" ""insistently,"" and ""continuously"" they are asking for Home Rule as are the members of the Imperial Parliament, to whom, and among whom, they are making this request? Surely the Parliament of the United Kingdom is better able to deal with and decide this question than is the Parliament of Australia. I sincerely believe in the absolute loyalty and devotion of the Irish people, and am proud of the fact that I am descended from Irish stock. Therefore, I ask, why should it be inferred that, if the request of the people of Ireland for Home Rule is not granted, they will do something which may imperil the ""peace and integrity of the Empire"" to which I believe they, as well as we, are proud to belong? The motion contains a series of contradictions, which should justify any deliberative assembly in rejecting it.",44
141,Mr CAMERON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Such a motion should not be moved in this Parliament until the people of Australia have expressed their opinions on the subject.,45
142,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"E x a c t l y , and I intend, when I continue my remarks on a future occasion, to put that view very strongly before honourable members. The movers of the motion sayIt is our desire for the solidarity and permanence of the Empire, as a power making for peace and civilization, that must be our excuse for submitting to Your Majesty this respectful petition. The petitioners, then, themselves admit that an ""excuse"" is necessary for this proposed offensive interference with the self-governing rights of another part of the Empire !",45
143,Mr CAMERON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"What sort of excuse will they make to their constituents, who have not authorized them to deal with this question?",45
144,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,They seem anxious to pass a motion which will appease all sections. It is a singular thing that those who profess to be satisfied that the Imperial Parliament intends to deal justly and properly with Ireland are the men who propose this gratuitous interference with the self-governing rights of Great Britain.,45
145,Mr HIGGINS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I am sorry that a man with the good name of Kelly should stonewall a motion of this kind.,45
146,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I am surprised that an honourable member of the name of Higgins should draft a motion so full of casuistry. If he regards this question as so urgent, and has the welfare of the people of Ire973 land so much at heart, why does he not resign his seat in this House and himself lead a crusade in Great Britain to obtain from the electors of that Parliament, in whose trustworthiness and inherent goodness he has expressed so much confidence, the alleged rights which the eloquence of the representatives of Ireland in that Parliament have been unable to obtain for her? I ask leave to continue my remarks on the resumption of the debate. Leave granted; debate adjourned. SUPPLY (Formal). 9 STANDING ORDERS COMMITTEE : LIMITATIO N OF SPEECHES - FEDERALCAPITALSITE IMMIGRATI ON RESTRICTION ACT-CUS TO MS VALUATION OF IMPORT S. Question-That Mr Speaker do now leave the Chair, and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supplyproposed.",45
147,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO," In the ordinary course of parliamentary business, the Government have the control of business and the power to arrange the subjects which shall engage the attention of honourable members, and I am very glad that this wise provision has been made to enable honourable members of all parties to discuss matters of public importance which do not happen to present themselves for consideration in the ordinary course of public business.",45
148,Mr THOMAS,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Then the honourable member would not have dispensed with this arrangement under the new Standing Orders which he intended to propose.,45
149,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I have such a painful sense of the value of public time, and of the manner in which honourable members opposite waste it by making ill-timed interjections, that I decline to be drawn off the track of my observations to discuss trivialities with the honourable member. Although my present position in this Chamber is not precisely the same that it was a few months ago, I still retain the views I expressed when I occupied the position of leader of the Government. Although it may seem to militate against the interests of the Opposition, I am prepared to give the present Government the same earnest support that I would have accorded to the members of mv own party, if they grapple with the difficulty arising from the delivery 9 of unduly long addresses in this Chamber. It will be impossible for us to acquire a reputation for 'business aptitude, and for the despatch of public business in a proper >vay, unless the expression of the individual -.njws of honourable members on various questions which come up for discussion are regulated by some standard, and limited in some manner. I am glad to say that my late honourable colleague, the honourable and learned member for Corinella, who practically represented the late Government on the Standing Orders Committee, has bestowed considerable attention upon this question. I do not know whether he has brought the result of his labours before the Standing Orders Committee.",45
150,Mr MCCAY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Yes , I did do so; but Committee did not think too much of them, and therefore did not adopt my proposals.",46
151,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I understand that my honourable friend's object was to arrive at some method of limiting the length of speeches in this Chamber. Viewing this question entirely apart from its party aspect, I would strongly urge the Government, without waiting for the f u ll consideration of the Standing Orders, to grapple with the difficulty. I admit that one of the obstacles in the way of dealing with the Standing Orders in the course of a busy session arises from the fact that they present innumerable topics for discussion, and must therefore occupy a large amount of valuable time. At the same time, I consider that the House will continue to occupy an altogether wrong position until a wellthought-out and complete code of Standing Orders is adopted. It is a reflection upon this Parliament that, although over four vears have elapsed since the establishment of the parliamentary government of the Commonwealth, we are still at the mercy of temporary Standing Orders, which, were intended merely to fill up a gap until we could' get into working order and adopt a complete set of Standing Orders adapted to our v I was exposed to considerable ridicule^ because I laid great stress upon this subject, but I have no hesitation in saying as leader of the Opposition what I stated as the head of the late Government, namely, that the business of the Commonwealth Parliament will never be properly considered or despatched until we have a proper set of Standing Orders. It is easy to emplov ridicule in attacking those who are taking up a sensible attitude, and I think Supply [REPRESENTATIVES.] (Formal). that ridicule was never more misapplied than in connection with my endeavour to place in the forefront of the Ministerial programme the question of new Standing Orders. I do not think that any honourable member on this side of the House has occupied the attention of honourable members for more than three hours at any one time this session. I most nearly approached that limit in my speech on the Bonus for Manufactures Bill , which occupied two hours and three-quarters. With that exception, I do not think that any member of the Opposition has occupied more than one hour and a half at any one time.",46
152,Mr HUMECOOK,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The honourable memi: the ber for Macquarie occupied four hours on one occasion.,46
153,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"That was prior to the current session. That was when the honourable member was speaking .from my notes on the Tariff, and the incident has become ancient history. We were all very excited on the subject of the Tariff, and perhaps we expressed our views at inordinate length. So far as the present session is concerned, I think I may say that the members of the Opposition have not so far abused their rights as members by making speeches of inordinate duration.",46
154,Mr BAMFORD,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Some of them speak very frequently.,46
155,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"D u r in g the last month I have done what I never did before. I have actually read through the Hansard reports, and I wish to say that I never read a collection of abler speeches in connection with' ordinary topics of legislation than those delivered by honourable members on this side of the House. Their deliverances were pregnant with the most cogent arguments in favour of the views they were advocating, and there was an entire absence of ill-feeling. In fact, I think my honourable friends'had a tendency-to minimize the evils of the present Administrarequirements. tion, and the incapacity shown by the Minister of Trade and Customs to understand the measures which he had introduced. I think that my honourable friends carried political generosity to an extreme in the mildness of their criticisms of the Government in connection with the provisions of the Commerce Bill . I do not wish to rebuke my honourable friends for their forbearance, because I think that is an admirable Quality. No Opposition ever performed its duty of intelligent and moderate criticism more efficiently and more sonably than did my honourable friends. When the late Government were in office under the mistaken idea that they were occupying their position subject to a written understanding with some honourable members-that turned out to be a chimerical notion-the y were exposed to speeches from honourable members then sitting on this side of the Chamber, two of which occupied four hours each, or a total of eight hoursthe period which the present Prime Minister very properly allots to the parliamentary day's work. The honourable member for Darling, who, I am sure, has endearedTiimself to all honourable members, especially by the kindness of his references to ""our travelling arrangements, (and the honourable member for Gwydir, who is not so capable of the friendly emotions of human nature, but who has many excellent qualities, delivered speeches on matters of no importance which together occupied nearly nine hours. I do not suppose that during the whole of his public career the ""Vice President of the Executive Council, who supports the dignity of his onerous office with becoming modesty and with a due sense of shame, and who is one of the most brainy among the silent members of Parliament, has consumed so much time as was occupied by the two honourable members referred to in discussing side issues. In fact, their exertions have produced such an unhappy effect upon them that they have since been mentally paralyzed. Who would now expose the honourable member for Darling or the honourable member for Gwydir to the cruelty of a five hours' speech ? Irrespective of all these party considerations, and of the question of what sort of men are in office, I say that no Government will ever be able to render a proper account of their trust as leaders in the performance of parliamentary and legislative duty until they adopt some means or other to curtail the abuse of the privilege of speech. I am glad to say that no such abuse has occurred during the reign of the present Administration. That fact is entirely owing to the character for political sagacity and moderation borne by honourable members on this side of the House. They have carried the high traditions of the late Administration even into the cold shades of Opposition, and the present Government have not been exposed to the strain of speeches of four or five hours in length. I hope the V 975 rea- Government will take the same view that I do as to the urgency of introducing a complete code of Standing Orders. I do not at all appreciate the marvellous devices which are being sprung upon an astonished Parliament Ly the Standing Orders Committee. I could understand the Committee laying upon the table a set of Standing Orders aimed at speeches of undue length, which have been the curse of all Australian Parliaments; but, as a matter of fact, the Committee have no new proposals to make beyond one of a remarkable character, which has excited the ridicule and contempt of the whole of the Australian people. Where is the inconvenience in forming a quorum if there are twenty-five honourable members within the precincts of the House ? It simply imposes on those honourable members who do not happen to be present at the particular moment when the bells are rung, the trouble of walking from one or other of the ante-rooms into the Chamber. If honourable members are in their party rooms, they have merely to walk a few yards in order to make their appearance here. If they are in the billiard-room, the refreshment-room, the writing-room, or the library, the only inconvenience to which they are exposed is that of having to walk a few yards. The Constitution is very clear upon this subject. It declares that, in the absence of legislative provision to the contrary, the attendance of twenty-five"" out of seventy-five members shall be necessary for the transaction of public business. I should be the last individual in the world to be so unreasonable as to suggest that twenty-five honourable members ought to be in the Chamber every moment that the House is sitting. But in view of the express direction contained in the Constitution. I do say that, if any honourable member draws attention to the fact that the statutory number of members is not present, a quorum should be formed. Why should a novel standing order be proposed to meet the convenience of four or five honourable members who wish to absent themselves from the' proceedings of this Chamber? It strikes me as being one of the most ludicrous efforts at reform of which 1I have ever heard. Instead of drawing the bands tighter, it is actually proposed to make them looser. Under the operation of the suggested Standing Order, honourable members might remain for hours outside the Chamber, attending either to their own private business or to public affairs, whilst the House continued to transact the business of the country with only five or six honourable members present, so long as the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees was satisfied that there was a quorum within the precincts of the House. Thus, while five or six honourable members might be in the billiard-room, another five or six in the refreshment-room, a similar number in the library and the party-rooms, and five or six more in the vaults engaging in gymnastic exercises, under this precious Standing Order business could proceed so long as the Speaker was satisfied that a quorum was within the precincts of the building. Is that the sort of reform that we ought to expect from the Government? Surely one of the reasons why excellent work should now be done is to be found in the fact that the Government occupy an invidious position. Here . is a Ministry which, outside of itself, numbers only four or five supporters in its own party. Surely honourable gentlemen in that position might, hope to make up for the ignominy of it by endeavouring to improve the methods of transacting public business. But the onlyemanation of their genius in reference to conduct of parliamentary business is a suggestion to render the easy life of honourable members still more.easy, by making the transaction of public business in the absence of a quorum equivalent to its transaction in the presence of a quorum. I believe that we shall hear no more of that proposal. It has apparently been buried. If the Government had been in earnest about it they would have submitted that Standing Order by itself, and have brought it into operation without delay. But they felt-and properly so-^that they had made a false step, and that there was only one method of escape from it, namely, by burying this new-fangled idea in 400 or 500 other orders, so that we should, for some time to come, hear no more about it. I say again that if any honourable member upon this side 'of the House occupied four or five hours in delivering a speech - as some, honourable members opposite did when I was in office!-I would heartily applaud the Government if they submitted a Standing Order to put. an end to such an abuse of privilege. No man has a right to occupy such a large share of the public time. I. should not speak so long as I do, but for the fact that I am very frequently absent from the House, and that I do not often occupy its time. I would, however, always Mr Reid. attach a safeguard to the time limit. I would make that limit a thoroughly liberal one, and I would attach to it a provision that, without debate, the question might be put to the House or Committee- "" That the honourable member be further heard."" If any honourable member were addressing himself to a subject of large importance and complexity, which called for a speech beyond the usual limits, I am sure that the sense of fairness of the House would immediately allow the Standing Order to be relaxed. We all know that in the warmest conflicts that have taken place in this House, the moment an appeal has been made to the fairness of honourable members, that appeal has never been in vain. With such a safeguard as I have indicated, a time limit might very well be imposed upon speeches. However, the urgency of this matter seems to have disappeared, since my honourable friends have gone over to the other side of the Chamber. Before I conclude my remarks, there is one matter to which I wish to refer, because since I last addressed myself to it, I have had an the opportunity of considering the difficulty which was then presented to me by, the Prime Minister. I refer to the settlement of the trouble connected with the Federal Capital. I had never previously, considered the difficulty as to whether it was within our power to pass a measure which would give the High Court an opportunity of settling such questions as those involved, by means of some friendly arrangement. Of course, I do not pretend to express any very weighty opinion, because I recognise that there are members in this House who have studied constitutional, matters much more thoroughly than I have done. Nevertheless, I have taken an opportunity of referring to our Constitution upon this subject, and I should like to express the opinion at which I have arrived in reference to the powers which we, by legislation, can confer upon the High Court. I am sorry to see in the newspapers a statement by the Premier of New South Wales to the effect that he considers that a recent communication from the Prime Minister frustrates the hope of a peaceful settlement of these difficulties.",46
156,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,He goes on to say that 1 that is due to mv entertaining a different view of the law from himself.,48
157,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I suppose that the correspondence will be made public.,48
158,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I have written to him expressing my willingness to allow it to be made public.,49
159,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I hope that the Prime Minister has not been advised that it is beyond our powers to pass a Bill to enable this vexed question to be settled.,49
160,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Oh , no-quite the contrary. In explanation, perhaps, I may be allowed to say",49
161,Mr SPEAKER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Order ! This is not question time.,49
162,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I think that, with the consent of the House, the Prime Minister might be allowed a certain amount of latitude.",49
163,Mr SPEAKER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I am very much opposed to any step being taken which will establish a precedent, and that a very bad precedent. The House is not in Committee. Perhaps the Prime Minister might give the desired information in the form of a brief interjection.",49
164,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"When the right honourable member was speaking the other evening, I interjected that my idea was that a short Bill should be passed, connected with the Act already on the statute-book, which would enable all the questions, which the Premier of New South Wales desires to raise, to be raised before the Court. I am still of that opinion, and I have offered to take action in the matter. .",49
165,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"3 am extremely glad to hear the Prime Minister's statement. I do not think that I could add any weight to the learned advice ""that he Has received, but having carefully considered the section in the Constitution which relates to the Seat of Government, I have come to the conclusion that no real difficulty should be experienced in the way of an appeal to the High Court. Of course there is the technical view that the ordinary working of the machinery of that tribunal is by means of litigation and contest; but I do not think that I am expressing a very strange opinion when I say that its higher function is to settle any matter connected with the Constitution which involves a difficulty of interpretation, or in respect of which there is a conflict of judgment, as between the Commonwealth and the States. What possible objection can there be when the two parties interested agree to invite a friendly decision by this judicial tribunal? It would be only the most technical and lawyer-like mind which couldi imagine difficulties in the way of such a Bill being passed as the Pirime Minister suggests. If the Premier of New South Wales does not entertain the overtures which, I understand, the Prime Minister has made, to the effect that some such measure should be passed in order to enable this vexed question to be referred to the High Court, I shall be profoundly disappointed. I think that our experience in reference to matters of conflict between the Commonwealth and the States is sufficiently painful to compel us to adopt the most amicable and peaceful method of settling in every case the question in dispute. I can conceive of no more fair method of deciding the question in dispute in reference to the Seat of Government than that of an agreement between the parties to the dispute to submit a special case to the High! Court, in which both sides could be heard.",49
166,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"We can drive a survey peg, and the Government of New South Wales can challenge our action and sue us for so doing.",49
167,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I saw the difficulty associated with that proposal, and mentioned it. It might be met by an agreement to regard the Act in a certain light, but the initial difficulty which attends the driving of a peg in New South Wales territory is that we can drive a stake to determine the site of the Capital only within territory which has been granted to or acquired by 1 the Commonwealth.",49
168,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,We shall get a decision on that point by driving the stake.,49
169,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I should not care if the State would accept that act as being sufficient to bring the matter before the High Court. I am not at all concerned with the mere formal method of bringing the question before the Court, for there should be no difficulty in regard to it. My difficulty in reference to the proposal to drive a stake is that, - under the Constitution, the determination of the site of the Capital hinges upon a prior consideration-the acquisition by the Commonwealth either by grant or purchase, of a territory. Until we have a territory we cannot have a sits for the Capital.",49
170,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,That would be precisely the first question to come before the High Court.,49
171,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Sectio n 125 of the Constitution provides thatThe seat of the Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the ParliamentThat is a matter, as we put it, for the determination of the Federal Parliamentand shall beThis hinges on our determinationwithin territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. That marks the next step. We may mine the site of the Capital whenever we please. The moment we pass a Bill declaring that the Federal Capital shall be in a certain locality, we exercise our stitutional power. We have the right to take that step without any reference, cept in a friendly way, to the State of New South Wales; but dependent upon all the taking of that step is another stage which certainly concerns the people of South Wales, and in respect of which they have a right-unles s the .Commonwere wealth Government takes action under Property Acquisition Act-to be consulted. That Act confers on the Commonwealth Government the right to acquire land for any public purpose, and it is wide I think, to allow of the exercise of the powers necessary to the Commonbe wealth when determining upon a Capital site. But until this Parliament had deterral mined on a particular site, it would be idle for the Commonwealth Government to look for a territory. The Parliament must first decide where the Capital is to be. The next step is one regarding which there should be consultation between the Commonwealth and the Government of New South Wales for the Capital can be only t in territory that has been granted or acment quired. That being so, the Commonwealth Government cannot drive a stake into part of New South Wales that does not form portion of the territory granted to acquired by it.",49
172,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I agree that we cannot do so effectively now; but, by passing short machinery Bill, which I have sugis gested to the Premier of New South Wales, we shall be able to drive a survey peg so to raise that very issue, as well as all other issues which depend upon it.",50
173,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I am pointing out that we can drive a stake only in territory that has been granted to or acquired by us.,50
174,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"We can put. that point in issue .by the short machinery Bill which I have referred, and will determine whether or not we have this power.",50
175,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Do the Commonwealth Government contend that, after the ParWales liament has decided where the Capital shall be, they may-withou t having acquired or obtained a grant of land from New South Wales-driv e in a peg in New South Wales territory? I doubt whether the Commonwealth Government have that power. It is, at all events, a question deterfor our serious consideration.",50
176,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I claim that when we pass the Bill I have mentioned, we shall be able conto do so. In any event, the honourable and learned member's contention that we cannot exdo so will then be decided. By passing, a little machinery Bill, we shall assert, at events, a colorable right to take this step, and the High Court will decide New whether or not we can legally do so.",50
177,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Unles s the course adopted the result of friendly mutual arrangethe ment, it might put the Commonwealth Government in a false position.",50
178,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I have been endeavourenough, ing to secure that arrangement.",50
179,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I admit that anything car> made a pretext for a friendly settlement ; but I should like to warn the FedeGovernment against taking a step with respect to which they must be defeated, unless a mutual arrangement has been arrived at. I would warn the Government against taking such a step in the absence of any such agreement, because, so far as I can see, until territory in New South Wales shall have been granted to, or acquired by, the Commonwealth, the Federal Governwill have no power to drive a stake into a single inch of New South Wales territory. any There is no doubt that the Commonwealth Parliament has a right to pass a Bill deteror mining where the Capital shall ""be. But the Constitution then steps in, and says, in effect: ""After the Commonwealth a Parliament has decided where the Capital to be, it cannot exercise rights of ownership or occupation in New South Wales as for the purposes of the Capital, except it the acquires, or has had granted to it, the territory which it desires.""",50
180,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Unles s we pass a machinery Bill, making the present Act effective for this very purpose. That, at all events, to is our contention; and it wil] be settled the High Court by the High Court.",50
181,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Whils t we can do a great many things, no Act passed by this Legislature can alter the rights of New South under the Constitution. In spite of any Act we may pass, New South Wales has the constitutional right to say to the Commonwealth- "" You may select your site ; that is a matter to be determined by yourselves. We have no objection to your doing so. but it is, after all, only a preliminary step. Once you have selected your site, that selection must remain in abeyance, so far as New South Wales is concerned, until you have gone further, under section 125 of the Constitution, and have had granted to you or have acquired, under the Property Acquisition Act, a legal basis of occupancy."" The only way in which the Commonwealth can occupy an inch of New South Wales is by exercising some right which it possesses under the Constitution. The Constitution declares that the Seat of Government shall be determined by the Commonwealth Parliament, and it then goes on to deal with a matter regarding which the Federal Government is not supreme, unless it exercises certain powers under the Property Acquisition Act. The grant can come only from the Government of New South Wales. The word "" grant "" implies the giving of land by the owner, which', in this case, is New South Wales. The Commonwealth can acquire the land only by mutual arrangement or by the exercise of statutory powers. There appears to be no chance of a mutual arrangement being .arrived at, because, I understand, the Parliament of New South Wales objects to the selection of Dalgety. The next point is that, since a mutual arrangement is impossible, New South Wales must either grant, or we must acquire, under our own statute, the territory within which we propose to establish the Federal Capital. So far as this point is concerned, I think that New South Wales would be successful before the High Court. Let us suppose that, having selected Dal gety, under our undoubted constitutional powers, we proceed to drive a stake in a piece of land in the neighbourhood . That might be done by the consent of New South Wales. But, assuming that there was no such' assent-assumin g that the selection was opposed by the Parliament of New - South Wales-then , in the absence of the acquisition of property under the Act to which I have already referred, or of a grant by the Parliament of New South Wales, the driving of a stake by our representative would clearly be an unauthorized act. In dealing with this question, which has excited so much feeling, I should be very sorry to see the Commonwealth take any sort of step, except by consent, in the direction of the assertion of a right, to interfere with the territory of New South Wales, because it would be a step which the High Court would have to repudiate. That would be a false step which no one would desire to see the Government take.",50
182,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I am advised that if we drove a peg in connection with a survey, for the purposes of the Act now on our statute-book, we should, if we had the necessary machinery already provided by means of a short Bill , raise the very issues to which the honourable member has referred, in such a form that the High Court could determine them.",51
183,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"As I have not seen the Bill in question, I cannot express a definite opinion in regard to that point, but I wish to emphatically warn the Government against taking a step that might be found ultimately to be unauthorized.",51
184,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,That is what we are anxious to avoid.,51
185,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"In the meantime I am anxious that the question should be settled. The sooner we close up and heal these sores, wherever they occur, the better for the Commonwealth and the States. I suggest to the Prime Minister that it would be well for him to take the House as fully as possible into his confidence, and that on receipt of a letter, which is not of a confidential character, from the Premier of New South Wales, he should put it before honourable members, and so keep us in touch with the progress of negotiations. There is a very strong feeling in New South Wales that the matter is being played with.",51
186,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The correspondence will show that it is not.,51
187,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I am sure that the Govern1 ment do not wish that to be the case.,51
188,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I have written today to the Premier of New South Wales, stating that I shall be most happy to have the correspondence made public as soon as he pleases.",51
189,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I pass now from this to another matter which relates to the Department of Trade and Customs. I am sorry that the Minister is not present, but I am quite satisfied that he is engaged elsewhere in the discharge of public duties.",51
190,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,He will be here presently.,51
191,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I wish to bring under the attention of the Government the question of the valuation of harvesters. My desire is to avoid the introduction of any sort of party feeling, and to deal with this case from the highest possible stand-point. I am sure that it is to the interest of any Government to inspire in the minds of the community a feeling that, whatever its fiscal views may be, it is anxious honestly to administer the Tariff, and to act just as fairly to importers as to any one else. It is to the interests of any Government to show that the Department of Trade and Customs, in its administration of Statute law, knows no bias-that the rights of every man, no matter how humble or inoffensive he may be, are fairly considered. I strongly - urge the Prime Minister Io recall the facts of this case. If any one had told me that in Australia an interested party could walk into the Customs House, and cause to be altered the decision of the. Department, which had been established by a previous Minister, after inquiries had been conducted in Canada, South America, and South Australia, I should have hesitated to believe it. I thoroughly admire the enterprise of the MCKays, in connection with the Sunshine harvesters. I do not wish to associate myself with any unfriendliness to a firm which, I think, has shown a marvellous amount of invention and enterprise. I look upon a man who invents an improved method",52
192,Mr CONROY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The MCKays did not do that. An Australian firm was using the invention long before the MCKays used it.,52
193,Mr ROBINSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The MCKays have done as much pirating of inventions as any firm in the world has done.,52
194,Mr CONROY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,A South Australian firm used the same principle years ago.,52
195,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I do not wish to give undeserved praise, neither do I desire to do injustice. I can speak only according to my own knowledge and belief. I do not know of the pirating referred to. If there has been any, I have no sympathy with it.",52
196,Mr KNOX,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I do not think it is right to. say that the firm has pirated.,52
197,Mr CONROY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I am afraid that it has.,52
198,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I will not find any one guilty of piracy until it has been proved against him. My impression of the MCKays is a most favourable one, and I regard their business as a grand Australian industry, which I do not wish to see crippled. But it is a matter of serious concern to the public that an Australian manufacturer, however estimable, has been allowedto go i|nto the Customs House, and cause the decision of a previous Minister, come to after a full inquiry and the most careful consideration of all the facts available, to Le altered without an opportunity being given, to the firm prejudicially affected thereby to answer the representations made by him.",52
199,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The alteration was not made until the officers of the Department had advised: that it should be made.,52
200,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I have the greatest respect for the officers of our public departments. My own antecedents, as a one-time public servant, cause me to feel greaf respect foE the public servants of Australia, and I have not a word to say against them. But they are only human, like the rest of us. The point I am making is that the books of the Massey-Harris Company were closely investigated by one of the highest officers in the Customs Department of Canada, the investigation concerning not only the profits and quotations of the particular machines imported into Australia, but the basis of cost and profit applied to all the firm's manufactures, and the result was a certificate to the honesty of the firm's valuations.",52
201,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The officers of our Customs Department had suspected for years that those machines were being undervalued for Customs purposes. It was no sudden suspicion.,52
202,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"But I cannot understand a public officer making one recommendation to one Minister, and another recommendation to another Minister only two months later.",52
203,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Later information was available then.,52
204,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"If a Minister altered his decision within two months, he would be asked to give the reason, and I think that the officers of the Department should explain why they altered their recommendation in this case. At first they stated that £ 3 8 ios. was a fair valuation.",52
205,Mr DEAKIN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,At that time they could not prove that the machines were worthmore.,52
206,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The statement was madeafter the Customs Department of Canada had assisted the Commonwealth Government in the investigation to which I have referred, Let me put the case without referring to the Sunshine harvester, or any ' particular article of manufacture. The Government had a doubt in respect to the valuations of an importer, and asked for information as to the value of the import from the Customs authorities of the country of manufacture. The books of the manufacturer were'thoroughly investigated, and the report received was that the valuation was an honest one. But the Government did not stop at that. They were not satisfied with the information received from Canada, and they telegraphed, through the Governor General, to Buenos Ayres, whence they obtained confirmatory opinions from the - British Consul. Then they investigated the books of Messrs. Clutterbuck, at Adelaide, to whom for many years the Massey-Harris people had been selling their machines. The honourable member for Gippsland exhausted every means of information available in Canada, South America, and South Australia, and was satisfied with the recommendation of his officers that the valuations of the importing firm were correct. A change of Government occurred, however, and on the representations of a rival manufacturer, who said that he had received a. letter from a man in Italy, the same officers without referring the matter to the firm whose actions were in question, the statement of this interested person, and a new Minister brought into operation a section of the Customs Act which prevents them from going into open Court to prove their innocence. a monstrous state of things. on the part of the' Department does not inspire confidence. Of course, Ministers are responsible for the actions of their officers, but I am putting the blame on the officers of the Department to meet the interjection to which I am replying. the thorough investigation to which I have referred, the officers of the Department reversed their original recommendation, because of the representation of an interested business rival to the firm affected. free-trader like the honourable member for North Sydney had been Minister of Trade and Customs, and, on representations made by an importer behind the back of an Australian manufacturer, had reversed the decision of a protectionist predecessor, come to after thorough inquiry, Lringin -; into operation a section of the Customs Act, preventing that manufacturer from vindicating 'himself, the country would have rung with justifiable indignation.",52
207,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Is not the Minister going to give the Massey-Harris Company an opportunity to vindicate themselves ?,53
208,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"In administering the laws of the country we must not be biased by personal feeling. We desire that the highest standard of administration shall be set. If the protectionists wish to increase the duty on harvesters, there is an honourable and honest way to do so. This method of acting unjustly to an importer cannot commend itself to those who are anxious for the maintenance of the purity of our Departmental administration. The Minister of Trade and Customs has made a statement to this House on the subject which 'has placed a different complexion upon it, and we on this side said at the time, "" That is a very fair proposition."" So long as the right thing is done, we do not wish to make too much of any little error that may have been committed in doing it. The'Minister of Trade and Customs promised to give these people an opportunity to prove their bond fides, by showing that the Department was wrong, and that they were right. I have been led to fear that that opportunity is to be denied, though I do not credit the rumour. I accept the statement of the Minister made in accepted the presence of honourable members.",53
209,Mr JOHNSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Not after what happened last night?,53
210,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I must deal with one thing at a time. I do not wish to import side That is issues into this matter. I am making an Such action appeal to the Government for the honest administration of the laws of the Commonwealth, and I do not wish to prejudice it by making observations which may awaken controversy. After Mr JOHNSON - Las t night's proceedings show that the Minister's word cannot be taken.",53
211,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"We can deal with that matter by-and-by. I wish to deal with the If a subject on which I am speaking entirely by itself. I hope that the Minister will perform his promise to give this firm an opportunity to show their bona fides by a proper legal investigation. If they have done wrong, we do not wish to shelter them - We do not carry our fiscal preferences so far as to wish to shield importers who have defrauded the revenue. But if we have regard to our own reputation, we must pay a similar regard to the reputation of others. If this firm have been cheating the Customs, they have, considering the investigations which have been made, proved themselves most elaborate swindlers, and I do not care how heavily they may be punished. But it is beneath the dignity of the Commonwealth to keep them in their present position longer than is absolutely necessary. I have never seen or had the remotest intercourse with any member of the firm. I do not know them, nor do I wish to know them. Information has been conveyed to me that the Massey-Harris Company invited the Government to send an officer to Adelaide to inspect the books of Messrs. Clutterbuck, who buy these machines from them. Customs officer was despatched to Adelaide and was afforded an opportunity to go through the books of the firm there. I am given to understand that he found that the Massey-Harris Company, who import the harvesters in Melbourne at a Customs valuation of £38 ios., absolutely sell them to Messrs. Clutterbuck in Adelaide at £40 each. Now, this firm might have had an opportunity of compromising this matter. I do not wish to break confidence too far, but I believe that if they had chosen to confess themselves guilty, by consenting to a compromise, they could have done so; but they very naturally-and I think very honourably-declined to arrive at any compromise. They refused to accept a proposal that the valuation for duty purposes should be reduced by £10, that is to say, from £65 r o £55That offer was made to them by the Customs authorities some few days ago. I do not suggest that the offer was conveyed officially or formally, but it was made to the Massey-Harris Company through their solicitor. In the course of an interview which that gentleman had with the Comptroller-General, it was put to him in this way, ""What about making the value £55 ? "" That would bring the valuation down by £10. The solicitor, I think very fairly and honestly, absolutely refused to accept any compromise with regard to the valuation of the article. If the facts be as I have stated-and I have every reason to believe that I have been correctly informed-the Massey-Harris Company acted, in a perfectly honest manner, their sire being that the whole question should be tested. Mr MCKay, in his evidence before the Tariff Commission, at question 16422.. stated that the value of the harvesters delivered by the Massev-Harris Company in Buenos Ayres was £60. Sworn in* voices, covering several years' exportations of harvesters to Buenos Ayres, have been Mr Reid. sent out from Toronto, in Canada. I have the invoices, which were handed to me, not by the Massey-Harris Company, but by an honourable member of this House. The notarial certificate-the sworn declarationidentifies every one of the invoices, which show that in the early stages of the export business, the value of the harvesters was a little higher than at present. Some invoices for 1902 show that the value placed on the machines was $240, which, roughly speaking, would be equivalent to about £ 4 8 . That was at a time when the busiA ness was in its infancy, and orders were limited. There are other invoices, covering the last two years, and dating from 22nd August, 1903, onwards, which show that the price at which the harvesters have been delivered in Buenos Ayres by the MassevHarris Company is $225, or about £ 4 5 . I understand that these sales were on credit, instead of for cash. The $225 is the f.o.b. price, and that seems to have been the rule throughout the two years. I do not wish' to attribute any intentional mis-statements to Mr MCKay. I shall assume that he was misinformed. But it is strange that a man who ought to have known the facts so well should have been so misled. According to his sworn evidence, the value of these machines delivered in Buenos Ayres was £ 6 0 , or £ 1 5 over and above the value given in the sworn invoices covering a period of two years. I wish to put the matter in the fairest way as regards Mr MCKay, and I am willing to assume that he was deceived. The facts, however, only tend to show how dangerous it is for the Customs Department to rush to conclusions merely on the strength of statements made by interested persons. The Customs authorities were ready to take action on the evidence which Mr MCKay was able to produce to them in respect to the price of harvesterstsent to Italy. It now transpires that the quotation given in the case referred to was for a single harvester, which was ordered through the London agent of the Massey-Harris Company. The machine therefore had to bear transhipment charges. de- I hope that the Minister will carry out the promise he made to the House, that the Massey-Harris Company should have an opportunity to appeal against his decision. In the first place, the Minister's promise stands; and, in the second place, it is a matter of common justice to a company who complain that they have been wrongly treated that they should be allowed to justify, their allegations. I do not wish to introduce any party spirit into this matter, but I most earnestly ask the Minister to give the Massey-Harris Company an opportunity to appeal against a decision which was arrived at behind their backs, at the instance of a trade rival. I now wish to say one or two words with reference to a paragraph which appears in this morning's newspapers, to the effect that the views expressed by the leader of the Labour P.arty, and also, I believe, endorsed by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, in favour of an amendment of the contract section of the Immigration Restriction tion Act, are not shared by all the members of the Labour Party; that, in fact, if the members of that party are not equally divided upon the subject, a considerable number of them are opposed to any alteration of the section. I should be very sorry to think that the statement is true, because immediately the leader of the Labour Party announced his readiness to have the Act amended I hastened to express my gratification, and to assure the Government that the Opposition would be only too glad to help them to amend the Act. I hope that, whatever may be the state of feeling in the Labour Party, the Government will have the courage to carry out their announced intention. It has been declared that the Government propose to amend the section, and that they are only delaying their proposals until they can be carefully drafted-it is alleged that a great deal of difficulty will be experienced in the drafting-and embodied in their immigration policy. I only wish to say, by way of an antidote to the statement contained in the press-if such an antidote be necessary-that , supposing the members of the Labour Party show any opposition to this portion of the Government programme, there will be no sort of ehendeavour on the part of the .Opposition to embarrass the Government by withdrawing support from them. No matter what difficulty the Government may be confronted with in respect of their friends and supporters in their praiseworthy endeavour to amend the section, I think I may promise, on. behalf of the whole of the members of the Opposition, a loyal and solid support, irrespective of party temptations or party advantage. I cannot help feeling that, apart from any question of immigration, or of adding to our population, we cannot, except by an amendment of the Act, dispose of the slanders upon the Commonwealth, in many cases absolutely untrue, ill-founded, and malicious, and in some instances sent from Australia by Australians. One of the worse features of these slanders is that many of them are fabricated in Australia, and are made to impose on the ignorance of English journalists.",53
212,Mr BAMFORD,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The honourable member for Oxley is not altogether guiltless.,55
213,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Nobod y who knows that honourable member will imagine for a moment that he made the misstatement in quesdeliberately. The fact is that he made a mistake in regard to the law, just as Full Courts sometimes do. Nobody would accuse him of being actuated by any malicious motive. I am very anxious ""that we shall establish friendly relations with the people of the mother country. That is a matter of vital importance to us. It is of no use attempting to dispel slanders upon Australia when, upon the face of our own laws, this charge can be truthfully levelled against us-that if an Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman endeavours to come here as an honest working man-no t as a loafer - and for that purpose enters into an honest business engagement at the Australian rate of wages, he can be sent to gaol for six months, and the only way in which he can escape that penalty is by finding two sureties, who will guarantee that he shall be transported from the shores of Australia. What a mockery such a condition of things is upon the word "" transportation "" I It is.a word that we have always associated with the criminal class, but Australia has invented a new kind of transportation in order to drive back to their own land our fellow-countrymen, whose only offence i i that they have an honest job ahead of them. The Labour Party may well wish to help us to remove that stigma. Let us surround the provision as carefully as we think is necessary, let us stipulate all sorts of safeguards, let us provide that any agreement which! is deceptive as to the ordinary rates of wages obtaining here shall be torn up by the nearest magistrate: but when we have safeguarded our law in that respect, do not let us lay the hand of the policeman upon an honest fellow-countryman. What idle talk it is to say that a man who works under contract is a sort of slave or helot! How many men in Australia fo-day do not work under an agreement for wages? And what a tremendous reflection it is upon our own people when it is suggested that the man viho is not rich enough to be free from the necessity of engaging in honest work, under an honest contract, is an inferior person, and ought to be treated as a slave or a criminal!",55
214,Mr WEBSTER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Does not the right honourable member think that he is exaggerating?,56
215,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,There is no exaggeration in the cold language of an Act of Parliament. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - Did not the right honourable member vote for that provision?,56
216,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,No .,56
217,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Did not the right honourable member speak in its favour?,56
218,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,No .,56
219,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Was not the right honourable member interviewed in regard to it, and did he not approve of it?",56
220,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,No .,56
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I have the report of an interview, in which the right honourable member said that he approved of the law, but not of its administration.",56
222,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,That remark had reference to quite another matter. Honourable members will recollect that last election curred a good deal of abuse because I went round Australia using the strongest language that I could employ in condemnation of this very provision.,56
223,Mr WEBSTER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The right honourable member voted for the third reading of the Bill.,56
224,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"If the honourable member says I did, I will admit it. Even then, I occupy only the same position as that occupied by every other hqnorable member. .The honourable member for Kooyong supported the third; reading of the measure. But did he know that he was voting for a law of that character? As a matter of fact, he actually went to the table, and asked the then Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, what the provision meant, fltnd he was informed that it was only intended to deal with contract labour. I do not say that honourable members' ought not to have understood its meaning, but I do say that when a layman like the' honourable member for Kooyong had the assurance of the Prime Minister that a certain clause in a Bill meant a certain thing, he was entitled to believe it.",56
225,Mr WEBSTER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,How about the right honourable member himself?,56
226,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"If honourable members can get clear of the personal element, I am quite prepared to submit to any censure which I may deserve. But now that we kinow what the law is, there is no need to pretend ignorance of it.",56
227,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Can the right honourable member tell me what individuals have been kept out of the Commonwealth under section, 3 of the Immigration Restriction Act, except those who came to Australia under contract ?",56
228,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I should like to ask another question which will supply the honourable and learned member with a very good answer. Let us suppose that a law were in force as to stealing, affid that the punishment for theft was six months' imprisonment. Let us further assume that nobody steals, and 1 as a result, nobody is sent to gaol. Does that fact alter the law? Is it not because a thief is liable to imprisonment for stealing that many people do not steal ? What decent man will come 12,000 miles under an agreement which is a fraud on Commonwealth law, if he is liable to six months' imprisonment for so doing? What British workman will come to a country when his choice lies between "" sneaking"" in, and I in- imprisonment in case of detection ?",56
229,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The right honourable member knows that that is not a fair presentation of the case. He himself voted for the law.,56
230,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I never voted for it.,56
231,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Then the right honourable member paired in its favour.,56
232,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I did not.,56
233,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The right honourable member should have done one thing or the other, at any rate.",56
234,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable and learned member is now getting back to the case of the six potters. He is reviving a very unpleasant recollection. In effect, he says that if I ' did not do a certain thing, I ought to have done it, amd, therefore, he is entitled to say that I did it. Mr HUGHES.""-Will the right honourable member say that he voted against the proposal ?",56
235,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Probably I was absent on the occasion in question, in which circumstances I should be fined £ 1 . under the (proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne.",56
236,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,That is a nice way of getting out of the difficulty.,56
237,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I thought that .the honour the able and learned member expressed in favour of an amendment of the Act only a day or two ago?,57
238,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I did, and I am of the same opinion still.",57
239,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I hope that the Government will pay attention to that declaration.,57
240,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I say, further, that the Act has never been, put in force, except under the circumstances to which the right honourable member has referred.",57
241,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"That is simply because there has never been a man who was criminal enough to break the law. The law provides that an Englishman, who is a manual labourer, shall be a prohibited immigrant if he comes here under contract, and that he shall be liable to six months' imprisonment. The honourable member's justification for that law is that nobody has attempted to get into gaol. What man will come to Australia from the old country while such a law operates? The English workman is not yet reduced to such a pitiable condition that he is obliged to travel 12,000 miles to become a member of the criminal class.",57
242,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,How does he get into the United States?,57
243,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"That is another conundrum. Surely the honourable and learned member does not place British subjects coming to Australia in the same category as foreigners going to the United States? There is not a single American-eve n though he may have a hundred contracts in his pocketwho is prevented from entering the United States. I wish the honourable and learned member to recollect that there is not 'an American in any part of the world who cannot return to his own country under contract. The laws of the United States do not shut out a single American citizen, and the honourable and learned member ought not to place our fellow British subjects on the same footing as foreigners and aliens. We may keep our gaols for aliens if we choose, but we have no right to open the doors of our prisons to honest British subjects, whose only offence is that they come here, not to loaf on the people of Australia, but to do honest work. I should like to remind honourable members that there is no conspiracy, so far as the statute-book of the Commonwealth is concerned, to misrepresent Australia. Under section 3 of Immigration Restriction Act, the followhimself ing are prohibited immigrants :Any persons under a contract or an agreement to perform manual labour within the Commonwealth.",57
244,Mr TUDOR,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Hear , hear.",57
245,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"That is a grand provision, no doubt, for my honourable friend, but I would remind him that the greatness of Australia has been built up more by the manual labourers of the mother country than by any other class.",57
246,Mr TUDOR,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,It has not been built up by manual labourers under contract.,57
247,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"What a dreadful offence it is to possess a bit of writing, in reference to one's wages. Has the honourable member never worked for wages?",57
248,Mr TUDOR,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Not under contract.,57
249,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable member is one of the swells of the labour market. Surely he knows that no man can work for another unless he is under some form of contract. If he works for weekly wages, he is under contract.",57
250,Mr TUDOR,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,It is quite possible to be employed upon piece-work.,57
251,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Is not that a contract? I suppose that the man who is employed on piece-work is a gentleman, while the individual who labours for a weekly wage is a criminal. What aristocratic distinctions are being made in the labour market!",57
252,Mr TUDOR,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The right honourable member has never had to work, and consequently does not understand it.",57
253,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I can get more as the result of ten minutes' work than the honourable member can earn in a year. I repeat, that a man employed upon piecework is nevertheless under a contract. The only difference in the two cases consists in the measure of payment. The man does not get so much a day, but a lump sum, for the work that he carries out. Whether the honourable member is working under contract or not, we all know that hundreds of thousands of workers in Australia are receiving daily or weeklywages. That, will not be denied. Would any man tell the Australian miner, who gets so much a day or so much a week from his employer, that he is not the equal of the man who is on piece work?",57
254,Mr TUDOR,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,But miners are not under contract.,57
255,Mr SPEAKER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The honourable member for Yarra will have an opportunity presently to reply.,57
256,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I wish to point out that no man would stand up before the hundreds of thousands of workers in Australia who, under a contract to serve their employers, receive so much per day, and declare that because they serve under contract they are inferior, and not fit to take their place side their fellow-workers.",58
257,Mr WEBSTER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,No one has said anything of the kind.,58
258,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I am sure of that.,58
259,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Every man is under a contract of some sort.,58
260,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I will continue if my honourable friends will allow me.,58
261,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The right honourable gentleman is under a contract, the terms of which are fairly obvious.",58
262,Mr TUDOR,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,A contract to fill in time.,58
263,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Thes e interruptions do not conduce to the speedy expression of one's views. I might as well be .at a monkey show as seek to talk to honourable members in the Ministerial corner.,58
264,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Can the honourable member tell us,58
265,Mr SPEAKER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"If honourable members below the gangway desire to reply to the right honourable member for East Sydney they will have an opportunity later on to do so. I ask them not to interrupt him. Air. HUGHES - May I say, sir",58
266,Mr SPEAKER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Does the honourable and learned member rise to a point of order ?,58
267,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I merely wish to say that every interjection I have made has been directly invited by the remarks of the right honourable member.,58
268,Mr SPEAKER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Such a fact in no wav justifies the interruption of a speech.,58
269,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I should like to withdraw the invitation. The wretched pretence that there is a difference between these two classes of contracts because, in the one they are made in Australia, while in the other they relate to men who come from the mother country under agreement to work in Australia, instead of entering into a contract when they reach here, is one of those shallow subterfuges which show the extremities to which my honourable friends of the Labour Party are driven. I am quite familiar with the interjections that have been made while I have been dealing with this question. When I went all over Australia, denouncing the contract section of the Immigration Restriction Act, I was met - with precisely the same ejaculations from various suspicious characters in different parts of the halls in which I spoke. It was quite a common thing to hear such interjections as "" Why, they are bondsmen,"" ""They are chattels,"" or ""They are slaves."" I say, with all respect, be- that a working man in the mother country is probably just as respectable, and as honest, as is any member of the Labour Party, or of any other party in this House. In my opinion, so long as this law exists, we are justly exposed to truthful, honest, well-founded accusations that, by our laws, we are treating our fellow countrymen in England, Ireland, and Scotland as other nations treat aliens. I suppose that is a fair statement to make. We have been told that the laws of Canada shut out men under contract. That is again only half a truth. Canada does not shut out a single emigrant from England. Ireland, or Scotland; she does not by any such law exclude a. single subject of King Edward. Some of our honourable friends feel hurt because the people of England say unkind things about Australia, Australian laws, and Australian Parliaments; but, so long as this law remains on our statute-book, the English people are entitled 'to refer to it in terms of the strongest reprobation.",58
270,Mr WEBSTER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Why did not the right honourable member seek to amend the Act when he was in office?,58
271,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Because there were too many men of the stamp of the honourable member in the' House - There was no chance of amending the law while I was in office.,58
272,Mr WEBSTER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The right honourable gentleman did not try to do so.,58
273,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I appealed to the people of Australia to return to this House sensible men, who would pass such an amendcase, ment. Instead of doing so, they returned other men in large numbers. I intend, if I live, to make precisely the same appeal to the electors on a future occasion, and am very happy to think that I shall then have the cordial support of the leader of the Labour Party. Speaking for himself, that honourable member said, quite recently, "" Oh, it has been a very unfortunate piece of business. We do not want to shut out honest working men, coming from the old country. Our desire is only to prevent men from entering into deceptive agreements to work in Australia. We merely want to prevent the introduction of contract labour at the time of a strike."" The honourable member did not profess to speak for his party; but I am very happy to think that at the next election I shall have his support in my endeavours to secure the return of men who arc prepared to amend this law. With reference to the proposal of the Government to submit a comprehensive scheme for the promotion of immigration, I have only to say that any well-considered proposal with that object in view will receive the support of nearly all, if not every one, of the members of the Opposition. The matter is one of great importance to Australia; but the mere promise to encourage immigration will be of no avail. I hope to see the Government, in a very short time, submit their immigration policy. When they do so, I think that they will find that they have a number of friends on this side of the House. Whatever the attitude of honourable members sitting below the p-angway may be, I can safely say that, if the Government seek to pass measures designed to promote immigration, the Opposition will set aside what they think are well-founded grievances, and support them. The Government are in power. We feel that we cannot shift them, and while they remain in office we are anxious to assist them to carry out any useful work of which we approve. When they take this step they will learn who are their best friends in the House. In view of the contract which has been entered into by the Government of New South Wales, I hope that the Government will make some statement with reference to the Manufactures Encouragement, Bill .",58
274,Mr SPEAKER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I must request the right honourable member not to discuss the Manufactures Encouragement Bill .,59
275,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I shall put myself in order by referring to the contract which has just ""been entered into between the Government of New South Wales and Mr . Sandford. I may express my very great pleasure that Air. Sandford, instead of the syndicate of which we have heard, is to have an opportunity to carry out this great work. As a resident of New South Wales, I heartily approve of the arrangement which the Government of that State has made with him. One grand feature of the contract is that it will save the Commonwealth a/n expenditure of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , which it can ill-afford to make. The arrangement made with Mr Sandford by the Government of New South! Wales will cover abour ^500.000 worth of material.",59
276,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,That will be approximately the value of the manufactured article.,59
277,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The Government estimate that under the contract they, will pay only 6.7 per cent, more than they would have to pay for the imported article.",59
278,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Seve n per cent.,59
279,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Betwee n 6 and 7 per cent. That means, at the most, about ^ 3 5 , 0 0 0 on the total expenditure of ,£500,000,. and this increased expenditure will be borne cheerfully by the people of New South Wales. I think that the House mav congratulate itself that, as the result of this agreement, we are placed in such a position that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill may well find its way under the table. It is time some statement was made to the House with reference to the intentions of the Government in this regard Has the Treasurer provided in this year's Estimates for the £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 proposed to be expended under that Bill ?",59
280,Sir JOHN FORREST,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,No . Provision is made in the Bil l itself for the expenditure.,59
281,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"When such provision is made in a Bill , the Treasurer usually makes some explanation in regard to it, but I do not think the right honourable gentleman referred to it in the course of his Budget statement. May I) take it that the Government intend to abandon the Manufactures Encouragement Bill ?",59
282,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,W a it a little while.,59
283,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable gentleman knows that he has ino chance of passing it through the House. I hope, at alt events, that he will make a statement in regard to his intention as to the valuation of harvesters. I understand that he made a promise to the House some time ago that he would give the firm in question am opportunity to prove their bona fides in a Court of Justice.",59
284,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO," I am quite prepared to make a statement with regard to the valuation of harvesters, but do not intend to deal with the matter at any great length. I was engaged in receiving a deputation when the right honourable member for East Sydney commenced his speech, but the Prime Minister took mv place, and would have replied in my stead had: I been unable to be present. When I entered the House, the right honourable gentlemanwas dealing with the question of harvesters. I may say that I am collecting some of the invoices showing the price at which harvesters are being sold in South America. The information which I obtained in regard, to the point in. dispute was that these machines were valued there at £ 4 1 when they crossed the border, but in a report which I received, it was pointed out that too much importance could not be attached to that fact, inasmuch as there was no duty to be paid, and the valuation was merely a fanciful one. That may, or may not, be correct.",59
285,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"But voices quoted by the leader of the Opposition related to actual sales. Sir WILLTAM. LYNE - Invoices , and especially those from America, do not always represent the true value of the goods to which they refer.",60
286,Mr CONROY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Mr MCKav valued his own machines at only £ 2 6 each.,60
287,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"That was a computation made on the basis of certain evidence said to have been given by Mr. MCKay when he was before the Tariff Commission. I have not gone into that calculation, but I am familiar with what Mr. MCKay said when before the Commission as to the value and the price of the MasseyHarris machines. The rieht honourable member for East Sydney stated that I promised the House that I would, allow the firm concerned to commence proceedings against the Government in a court of law. Whilst he was speaking, I turned to the Hansard reporfi of mv speech on the occasion in question, and found that what I said was as follows: I may say at once that if the Massey-Harris Company have any reliable facts or data to bring before me, I should like to have them submitted for my consideration. If they then commenced proceedings against the Government, I should be very much disposed not to place any impediment in their way, but to give them every facility. I cannot say anything fairer than that. My only desire is that there shall be a true valuation for the purposes of the Customs, and to see that fair play is meted out to all. A few weeks afterwards the MasseyHarris people, with their solicitor, waited on me, and showed me certain documents, which I asked them to leave. They preferred not to do that, but said that they would send copies. After a week or two, or perhaps longer, I received those copies, and then took action, with a view to finding out a little more than was disclosed on the papers. There was an extraordinary difference between the freight charges put down by the Massey-Harris people for the carriage of their harvesters from New York to Australia, and the freight charges paid by MCKay to send his harvesters from Australia to South America, the amount in one case being about £ 7 or £ 7 ios., and in the other about 30s.",60
288,Mr CONROY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,A Sunshine harvester could not be sent from Melbourne to Sydney for 30s.,60
289,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I am' speaking from memory, but the amounts were practhe in- tically what I have mentioned. In explanation, I was informed by the representative of the Massey-Harris Company that the Sunshine harvesters were packed differently from the way in which their harvesters were packed, and therefore cost less to transport, but I have not had a sufficient explanation of the difference.",60
290,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"It would be easy to find out the actual freight charged, by ascertaining the measurement.",60
291,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"In connection with the transport of goods from the interior of America to the seaboard, there are arrangements whereby manufacturers, railway companies, and agents all gain certain pickings. An article is ordered at a very low price, and excessive freights are charged for sending it by rail or other conveyance to the seaboard', part of which is returned to the manufacturer. At the port of export-the f.o.b. port-thes e charges, are deducted, and the Customs valuation is made on the price, less that deduction. By that pernicious system our Customs Department were losing between £30,000 and £40,000 a year in connection with the importation of machinery.",60
292,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I agree with the Minister that it is a pernicious system. The last Government dealt with it.,60
293,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"When I took control of the Customs Department, the country was losing from £30,000 to £40,000 a year in the way I have described, and I made a regulation providing that the Customs valuation should be the f.o.b. price at the port of export with all charges added, instead of the f.o.b. price with a deduction of the charges for transport between the place of manufacture and the port of export.",60
294,Mr BROWN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Does that regulation apply to all imports?,60
295,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"f t is of general application. With regard to goods coming from Canada through New York, the charges between the Canadian and United States border, and the port of export-the f.o.b. port-ar e not interfered with. mention this matter to showhow difficult it is to get at the truth in connection with freight charges. I find that harvesters are now being made in many towns in Australia. When I was at Corowa, about six weeks since. I saw at the local show harvesters which had been made in the town by a manufacturer named Henderson, who used to have works in Victoria, and farmers who had bought them told me that they were as good as could be obtained anywhere.",60
296,Mr CONROY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,What was the price?,61
297,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"^ 8 0 . If what a son of Mr Henderson told me in regard to the cost of harvesters is anything like correct, I am not far out in the valuation which I have put upon imported harvesters.",61
298,Mr CONROY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I can buy a from May, in South Australia, for £ 6 2 .",61
299,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"A little while ago I sent one of my best officers to South Australia to go through the books of Messrs. Clutterbuck Bros., a firm which have been purchasing harvesters from the Massey-Harris Company, and he has brought back with him a good deal of information. He tells me that three years ago only forty or forty-one harvesters were imported into and sold in South Australia by the Massey-Harris Company; that two years ago the importation had increased to seventy or eighty machines; and that last year no fewer than 450 or 470 were imported; and of course the manufacture of a like number in Australia prevented.",61
300,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable gentleman surely would not use the Customs regulathe tions to alter the Tariff? . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I think that the right honourable gentleman will acquit having attempted to do anything of kind. A case which has just arisen connection with a certain legal opinion, fecting, I am told, T,000 people in Victoria, who will be thrown out of employmentthough I think that that must be an exagthem too highlv. geration-show s that I am powerless to interfere with' an interpretation of the Tariff. Honourable members have accused me of being able to increase and lower duties; but the instance to which I shows that I am powerless to do so, I would not attempt to interfere atrainst the opinion of our Crown law officers. With regard to imported harvesters, I want to get at a fair valuation, and I think that, with the information which I have obtained, II shall be able to get pretty close to a fair valuation. I have been promised certain further iniormation next week, and when I have received it I will inform honourable members what will ultimately be done in this matter. I think it will not then be said that I have taken any unfair action.",61
301,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The honourable gentleman promised to give the Massey-Harris Company an opportunity to test his decision.,61
302,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I am not anxious to run the Commonwealth into the law courts. I spoke of the exhaustive examination which I am making as a preliminary to what I said about allowing these gentlemen to test the matter., After this examination-has been made, I can only repeat the words which I have quoted, but I harvester am not going to open the door recklessly to an expensive action.",61
303,Mr ROBINSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Why not, if the honourable gentleman is perfectly certain that his valuation is correct? The company will have to pay the costs of the action.",61
304,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I have not said that I am certain of the precise amount; but I am certain that the original valuations were much too low.,61
305,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Will the Minister fulfi l his promise to give the firm a chance to appeal ? Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - I have repeated the words that I used; and when I have dealt with the matter there will be no cause of complaint. I do not know that honourable members wish for a further explanation now. I should only like to add that result of my action has been, not to increase the price' of harvesters to the farmers, but to decrease it. No doubt the me of light thrown on the whole subject is the the reason why harvesters can now be bought in more cheaply than they could be bought afbefore this occurrence arose.",61
306,Mr JOHNSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The farmers have found out that the manufacturers were charging,61
307,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Probably that is so. The increase of the valuation would have had the effect of raising the price of imported harvesters by £ 2 16s. had the refer additional duty been charged on to the and farmers; but. as a matter of fact, these harvesters can now be bought more cheaply than they could be bought last season. I have shown that a harvester manufactured at Corowa is sold at £ 8 0 , and I believe that harvesters are also made near Yarrawonga, and at Junee or Wagga. . It has been said that my action will cause the Massey-Harris people to commence operations in Australia. I should be glad if it had that effect. I should welcome both the Massey-Harris people and the International Harvester Company if they would commence to manufacture here.",61
308,Mr CONROY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"£80 is altogether too much for a harvester. I can buy one in Adelaide for £62. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - The price of the Sunshine harvester in Melbourne has been £ 8 1 for one size, and ,£84 for another. The leader of the Opposition referred to the? action of the Government of New South Wales in entering into a contract with Mr Sandford, of the Eskbaink ironworks for thd supply of iron and steel required for public works. I have already stated, through the press, that I am very glad indeed that Mr Sandford.'has been so lucky as to secure a very good bonus. But I am not .prepared to make any announcement with regard to the Bonus for Manufactures Bill at the present time. A though Mr Sandford has entered into a contract to supply the iron and steel required by the Government of New Soutii Wales, he wall receive no consideration in connection, with the requirements of private consumers of those commodities in that State. Furthermore, the arrangement entered into by Mr Sandford will confer no benefit on the other States. In considering the question of iron and steel production, we have to take a broad view of the requirements of the States. The leader of the Opposition referred to the dreadful sequences which hadi followed upon the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. I am under the impression that rhe right honourable gentleman voted for the third reading of that Ball, and some time ago, when speaking in reference to the contract clause, he said that he approved of the law, but abhorred the administration.",62
309,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"My statement related to the whole Act, aind not to the contract clause only.",62
310,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The right honourable gentleman's statement was made in connection wjth the six hatters' case.,62
311,Mr REID,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I was referring to the opera- so. tion of the Act in preventing the introduction of coloured aliens.,62
312,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I do not wish to labour this question, but I consider that a great deal of injury has been done to Australia by the persistent misrepresentation of the facts by the Australian metropolitan press, whose statements have been republished in England, and have created a very nasty impression. The object of the Act is to prevent employers from introducing workmen under contract at rates of wages lower than those which prevail in Australia, and - thlat aim seems to me to be a very proper one. We have been repeatedly and maliciously slandered by persons who have stated that no British subject can come to Australia. It should be clearlv understood that no obstacle is imposed to the free immigration of British subjects into Australia, so long as they have not entered into contracts to work at wages lower than those which are current within the Commonwealth.",62
313,Mr HUGHES,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I believe that more people have come here 'since the Act was passed than arrived during the corresponding period prior to its being brought into force.,62
314,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Precisely . The Prime Minister has already indicated the l - attitude of the Government with respect to the question of amending the contract section of the Immigration Restriction Act, and I need say nothing further on that point. I hope that I have satisfied honourable members opposite that I have acted! in a spirit of fairness in the harvester case, and that my action will have a salutary effect.",62
315,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO," The leader of the Opposition referred to a matter which concerns me personally. I allude to the proposed Standing Order by means con- of which it is intended to incorporate in our rules a practice which obtains in the House of Commons. I desire to take the. full responsibility attaching to me in that particular matter. The Government did not in any way influence my action. The members of the Standing Orders Committee are appointed by the House, and although various parties are represented on> it, I take it that honourable members divest themselves entirely of their party predilections in discussing matters which come before the Committee.",62
316,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"No , they do not.",62
317,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Then ""they should do",62
318,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"On looking at the division list, we find that all the Ministerialists voted for the proposed new Standing Order, whilst all the members of the Opposition disapproved of it.",62
319,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"It is absurd to suggest that the proposal was regarded as of a party character. If the proposal made - by the honourable and learned member for Corinella had been pressed, I should have voted for that also. I indicated by my conduct that I did not support the Standing Order adopted by the Committee merely because it emanated from a member of the party, with which I happened to be connected. I can assure honourable members that party considerations did not enter into the discussion of the matter. Until I went to a meeting of the Committee, which was called for the transaction of ordinary routine business, I had no idea that any proposition of the kind was to be brought forward. When, however, it was submitted, Ithought it was a good one, and I supported it accordingly. I still adhere to that opinion. It was not proposed in order to deny honourable members the opportunity to call for a quorum when only a few members are present in the Chamber, but it was designed to prevent one or two honourable members from penalizing the whole House.",63
320,Mr ROBINSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,It was intended to permit a number of honourable members to dodge their attendance in the Chamber.,63
321,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The honourable and - learned member is welcome to his opinion; but I am sure that his estimate of the morality of the members of the Standing Orders Committee will not be generallyaccepted.,63
322,Mr ROBINSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The honourable member cannot deny that there was an organized attempt on the part of Ministers and their - supporters to relieve members of the duty - of attending and taking part in the debates.,63
323,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I absolutely deny that anything of the kind occurred, and I have better opportunities of ascertaining the facts than has the honourable and learned member. I wish to take the responsibility of my - own action in the matter, and to assure honourable members that the Government had nothing whatever to do with it. . I have never been content to allow other people to bear the burden of responsibility which properly belongs to me. I am not here to excuse the Government, but I desire to assure honourable members that I acted entirely of my own volition, and was not inspired by any act, word, or deed on the part of the Government. I know that I hold my position on the Standing Orders Committee by virtue of the office to which I have been elected by honourable members, and I feel sure that they will not regard me as capable of betraying their confidence by giving my support to anv and every proposal brought forward by the Government of which I happen to be a supporter. The honourable and learned member for Corinella will bear me out when I say that I assured him over and over again that I was prepared to assist him in securing the adoption of the Standing Order which he proposed.",63
324,Mr MCCAY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I have never denied that.,63
325,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,No ; but honourable members are endeavouring to impart to the Standing Orders Committee a strictly partu character.,63
326,Mr MCCAY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I am not prepared to deny the propriety of that.,63
327,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable and learned member has changed his opinion on that and a number of other questions. The Standing Order in question was passed at the ordinary weekly meeting of the Standing Orders Committee, and was not confirmed until fourteen days later.",63
328,Mr ROBINSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,By its action the Committee drove one very good man off that body.,63
329,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,That is a very unfair suggestion. The honourable member for Gippsland did not indicate his intention to retire from the Committee until after the motion was carried.,63
330,Mr MCCAY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,It was adopted at an earlier meeting.,63
331,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"But it was not ""finally"" adopted; in fact, a proposal was made at a subsequent meeting to rescind it, and another motion had to be moved regarding the printing of the Orders. The honourable member voted on both questions.",63
332,Mr CROUCH,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Did not a full account of the proceedings of the Committee get into the press?,63
333,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"No , only a very imperfect version of the matter was published in. the press. The leader of the Opposition has declared that the Standing Order to which I refer would permit public business to be transacted in the absence of a quorum. What I wish to emphasize is thar under its operation no motion could be carried either in the House or in Committee unless a quorum were within the precincts of the building. No single word, letter, line, or clause of a Bill could be adopted unless a quorum were present.",63
334,Mr ROBINSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Not if a division were not called for?,64
335,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable and learned member will admit that there is a duty devolving upon members of the Opposition. Surely there should be at least two of their number present, and these would be sufficient to secure a division upon any matter.",64
336,Mr ROBINSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The honourable member is hedging upon hisfirst-statement.,64
337,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I am not hedging at all. The Constitution does not assume that a quorum shall consist of Ministerial supporters. It is just as incumbent upon members of the Opposition to assist in keeping a quorum as it is upon the Government.,64
338,Mr WILSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,It is the duty of the vernment to keep a quorum.,64
339,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,What is the honourable member's authority for that statement? is the business of honourable members who are elected to this House to quorum.,64
340,Mr ROBINSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable member wishes to give them an opportunity to outside the Chamber. Air. SALMON - The honourable and him learned member is making a statement which is unworthy of him - I have to provide any such opportunity. My denumbers, there are usually proportion sire is to prevent a constant recurrence of more-honorabl the spectaclewhich we witnessed last this side of 'the eChamber night, when a most deliberate attempt was the Government benches. Iashave made to count out the House.",64
341,Mr ROBINSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,What about last session when a similar attempt was made in conas nexion with the Budget by the very honorupon able member who proposed this new Standtirely the ing Order?,64
342,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I recognise that orable members who are strongly opposed to any particular measure are justified endeavouring to secure its defeat. But it is not a legitimate thing for honourable members to impede the business of the country by rising half-a-dozen times in many minutes to direct attention to the state of the House, when they know permembers fectly well that there is a quorum within acres of ground ! call. If honourable members possess rights, they should also recollect that they have responsibilities. I would ask any impartion. tial observer to say whether there have not been more members present upon this side of the House during the past two months than there have been upon the Opposition benches ?",64
343,Mr KELLY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Now we see the party spirit.,64
344,Mr SALAION,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Honourable members by their interjections are inducing me to make statements which I have no desire to make. A-Iy last words are that, as honourable members have rights, they also have responsibilities, and as the rights of the minority are properly safeguarded under our Standing Orders, I ask that the rights of the majority shall receive some attention. We should not place it within the power of any honourable member, acting merely on caprice, to obstruct the transaction of public business by continually drawing attention to the state of the House. Mr DUGAL D THOMSO N (North Sydney) - The extraordinary speech of the Gohonorable member for Laanecoorie merits some reply.",64

346,Mr SALMON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Not an unprovoked one.

It must be recollected that there are two parties other side of the House. I endisagree with the definition of ""purposes of a quorum"" which was given by the honhonorable member for Laanecoorie. I claim that the attendance of a quorum, as in provided for in the Constitution, means the presence of at least twenty-five honourable membersin this Chamber, not their presence within the precincts of Parliaas ment. What an absurdity it would be, in fixing a' quorum, to imply that honourable might be scattered over several Air. SALMON - That is not the proposiMr DUGAL D THOAISON - It is. The honourable member has stated that by adopting the proposed new Standing Order we shall merely be following the practice of the British Parliament. I shall not debate that question at the present stage, but I do not think that his statement is correct. Then I take strong, exception to an interjection which was made by the honourable member for Gwydir. deliberately-and he adhered to his statement, despite the fact that it was contradicted-that when the honourable and learned member for Corinella proposed, and I seconded, a motion, at a meeting of the Standing Orders Committee, in favour of limiting the speeches of honourable members, we were members of the late Government. I have here the minutes of the meetings of that Committee. From these I find that notice of the motion in question was given on 17th August last. The present Government came into office upon 7th July. I learn from the records that the honourable and learned member for Corinella movedThat this Committee is of opinion that some method of limitation of debate should be provided in the Standing Orders. That was on the 17th August, some time after he had vacated office. August the following statement appears in the minutes of proceedings of the Committee :Mr MCCay submitting Standing Orders for the purpose of limiting debate, the Committee deliberated. The Committee took no action in the matter.",64
347,Mr WEBSTER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,Why did they drop it?,65
348,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"Because there was a generally expressed opinion that it would not prove as time-saving in operation as was anticipated. It was recognised that discussion might be prolonged in other ways, and one member of the Committee declared that he did not approve of the adoption of these arbitrary means to curtail debate, because they usually defeated their own ends.",65
349,Mr MCCAY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"On e other member stated that, at best, the proposal would only have a moral effect.",65
350,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"That is so. As a result, it was decided to take no further action. In the light of this evidence, the honourable member for Gwydir must see that his statement was made without knowledge.",65
351,Mr WEBSTER,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable member, whilst he was a member of the late Government, intended to take action, if he did not actually do so. [101]",65
352,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable member is now declaring what were our intentions. Does he mean to say that two members of the Standing Orders Committee who are members of the Opposition supported a proposal which was intended to shorten the proceedings of Parliament He stated whilst another Ministry was in office, for the benefit of a Government which had ceased to exist? The honourable member adhered to his statement, which should have been withdrawn immediately it was denied. I maintain that members of the Opposition have shown quite as much desire as have the Government to legitimately curtail debate. The honourable member for Laanecoorie also alluded to an attempt which was made last night to count out the House, as if similar tactics had not been frequently-and upon two occasions successfully-resorte d to during the term of office of the previous Government. Yet he expressed abhorrence and surprise that anything of the sort should have been attempted. I should not have risen had he not made an attack upon the Opposition which was altogether unjustifiable. Coming to the question of the valuation of On 24th harvesters for the purposes of the Customs, I would point out that the Minister has clearly indicated that he has allowed himself to be influenced by certain matters to which he should really give no consideration. He stated! that he found that the sale of imported harvesters in South) Australia had largely increased.",65
353,Mr BROWN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The demand is increasing.,65
354,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,I hope that it is a sign of increasing cultivation. The fact that there has been an increase in the sale of these machines in South Australia should' not influence the honourable gentleman in dealing with this question.,65
355,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,It does not.,65
356,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The Minister should not allow himself to be influenced by that fact, any more than a free trade Minister should allow himself to be influenced by a reduction of imports.",65
357,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"It does not influence me. I merely mentioned that in a report which I had received, it was shown that this increase had taken place.",65
358,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I believe that it was after the officers had investigated the books of the South Australian importer that they advised that the valuation of £ 3 8 ""ios. should be accepted as the correct import price. I think that the Minister must recognise that charged as he is with the duty of protecting the revenue, and of seeing that trade is honestly conducted, he ought to institute legal proceedings against any firm, which, in his opinion, has been defrauding the Customs. This firm certainly has been doing so, if the valuation of £ 6 5 is the true one. If such proceedings are not to be taken the opportunity of having the question settled in a court of law should be given the importers. the impression that he had already promised to give the firm in question an opportunity to test the correctness of his decision. When he says, in effect, to them - "" I am not prepared to punish you, as I ought to do, if , as I allege, you have bean under-valuing your imports,"" he ought also to say, "" I am prepared to give you an opportunity to show that I am wrong, and if you prove your case, I shall i.evise the valuation."" The honourable gentleman stated that certain firms in the United States and Canada were over-estimating the railway and steam-boat charges from the place of manufacture to the port of shipment. I quite agree that under the old practice, there was a great danger of that being done. For some reason or other the practice was adopted of accepting as the basis of valuation the rates ruling for goods at a particular market in the country of . manufacture, regardless of whether that market was on the coastline or in the centre of a large continent. opening was given for fraud-for the un'due inflation of railway charges, and the consequent reduction of the cost 'at factory. I quite agree that the new system is one that ought to have been adopted from the first, and that the f.o.b. price at the port »f export should be accepted. I think the Minister said that he was satisfied that there was a great deal of under-valuing taking place in connection with exports from America. Sir WILT . IAMLYNE - That is so.",65
359,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I do not conditions-tha know whether he has considered the sirableness of applying some check in countries of export. In order to protect their revenue, the Americans insist that sworn valuations of exports to that country shall be made at the port of shipment fore the American Consul, who has an opportunity there to ascertain whether or the values are correct. If fraud has been --committed in this direction, it may be desirable for the Minister to consider the advisability of resorting to this system in the United States. I wish now to allude briefly to the present system of rating telephones. This is a matter to which I have previously 'drawn the attention of Ministers, and I was under the impression that it was to receive consideration. There are some regulations in force which do not fit the conditions to which they apply. If twenty-five applications to I was under be connected with the telephone service are received at the one time from a suburb which may have suddenly sprung into existence, a charge of only £ 5 per annum is made i(n respect of each subscriber, but in a suburb where there may be 100 subscribers who have applied at different times to be connected, a charge of £ 6 per annum may be made. In another case we have the strange anomaly that in a thickly-populated suburb which may be regarded as part of the city itself, and where there are perhaps 100 or 200 subscribers beyond the mile limit, a charge of £ 6 per annum is made, whilst those living in a suburb fourteen or fifteen miles away from the central exchange-san d where the cost of making the connection is consequently much greater-hav e to pay only £5 P e r annum, although there may not be more than twenty-five or thirty subscribers there. The regulations simply take into account the distance from the centre, and not the density of subscribers. I In this way, an should not have alluded to this matter, but for the fact that a promise has been made on more than one occasion, that it will receive consideration. I understood from the late Postmaster-General that these regulations were about to be revised. I do not attach any blame to the present Minister, because I know that he has not been long in office,, and could not reasonably be ex- pected to have already attended to all these matters; but I think it necessary that the Telephone Department, which is a business one, should have its regulations framed upon business lines. If it be shown that its regulations do not meet the existing t they bristle with irritating deanomalies, and have given rise to legitithe mate complaints-the y ought certainlv to be re-consideredi. I think that the Postmaster-General will admit that it is absurd that regulations should provide that twentybefive subscribers to the telephone service, living fourteen miles away from the central not source of the connection, should have to pay only ; £ 5 each per annum, when, perhaps, 100 or 200 closely packed subscribers within a mile and a half of the very same centre have to pay a higher'rate. I trust that the Minister will give consideration to the regulations, and recognise the necessity for their amendment.",66
360,Mr MALONEY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO," I should not have spoken but for the extreme bitterness which characterized the remarks made by the honourable member for North Sydney with reference to the position of the honourable member for Laanecoorie as a member of the Standing Orders Committee. I find that, although there have been some twenty-five meetings of that Committee, the honourable member for A orth Sydney has attended only three of them.",67

366,Mr MALONEY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"The honourable ber also attacked the honourable member Gwydir for what was, after all, a mere settlers in country districts. technical mistake. The honourable member for Gwydir might have been able to exwill plain it as readily as the honourable member for North Sydney has explained his absence from the meetings of the Standing Orders Committee. The leader of the Opposition has only attended one out of twenty-five meetings of this Committee, and yet he dares to criticise those who have attended regularly. I think that when these facts are placed before the public they will cognise the true value of his criticisms.",67
367,Mr CONROY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO," I very much regret that the Standing Orders were susview pended to allow the Wireless Telegraphy ral Bill to be rushed through, with the result that I did not have an opportunity to [IOT]- 2 99S on the motion that it be read a third time. In my opinion, the measure is so framed that, unless very liberal regulations be made under it, the people of the Commonwealth will be entirely deprived of the advantages which science is now offering us in the direction of wireless telegraphy. It would Le a great boon to residents of country districts to b""e able to communicate with their friends miles and miles away by means of this cheap and effective system, but unfortunately the provisions of the Bill are so stringent that, unless the Postmaster-General is careful to frame liberal regulations, private Individuals will find themselves absolutely unT able to avail themselves of it. He must see that the officials of the was Telegraph Department do not seek to impose harsher restrictions than are necessary upon any one attempting to use this the method of telegraphing, to the serious inA n un' result of our legislation is that all improvements are practically blocked by it, and there can be no such ""thing as pro",67

369,Mr CONROY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"It is natural for departmental officers who have been brought as up in a groove to be averse to changes, I think that the Postmaster-General will see that the regulations are framed in liberal spirit, so as not to hinder the development of the wireless telegraphy system. At the present time a very heavy penalty, can be imposed upon any one who uses it. I feel sure that the honourable gentleman memwill do all that he can to improve the for means of communication available to I have been glad to learn from him privately that he do all that he can, consistently with the maintenance of the revenue, to provide conveniences for communication to the public, but the maintenance of the revenue should not be the only consideration, because it must be borne in mind that we cannot open up the country without expense. The leader of the Opposition referred to the Capital Site question, and I cannot too reearnestly urge the Ministry to bring about some settlement of that question. The state of affairs is rather complicated, in of the fact that the Postmaster-Genenaturally desires the retention of D a l gety; but I still assert that that place is speak too f ar from the main railway line 9 between Melbourne and Sydney to be a suitable site for the Federal Capital.",67
370,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,The honourable and learned member spoke very well of it once.,68
371,Mr CONROY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO,"I have always said that it was as good as the suggested site near Tumut, but my view is that the Capital should be established close to the overland railway line, so that speedy access may be had to it from the capitals of the States, where the bulk of the legislators of the Commonwealth will always reside. If the Federal Capital is placed in a dis-. trict away from the main line, all mails will be at least half a day longer in transit each way, which would be a great objection in these days of quickness of travelling and rapidity of communication. I should have been willing to see the Constitution amended, so that a site might be chosen anywhere within the mother State. the country within 100 miles of Sydney had been made available, the Federal Parliament would long since have chosen a suitable site, and we should now be meeting in a Parliament House belonging to the Commonwealth. When this Parliament meets in the Federal Capital, the New South Wales representatives will gain a great advantage, because they will have much less travelling to do, while the Victorian representatives, who so strongly objected to expenses being granted to members, will find that the cost of living, when one has to spend part of at least four days everv week in travelling, is considerable. allowance given to us under the Constitution may be sufficient for a member who resides in Melbourne, it is altogether too little to a representative coming from another State. I very much regret that the Minister has not brought in a Redistribution of Seats Bill , so that we might know exactly how we shall find ourselves at the next elections. I am aflraid that the method which they are pursuing will cause us to g© before the electors on the same distribution as took effect at the last general elections, which will be very unfair for New South Wales at least, because, although that State is contributing towards the expenses of Federation on the population basis, she is not represented in this House in proportion to her population.",68
372,Mr MALONEY,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO," The honourable member for North Sydney has informed me that he was appointed to the Standing Orders Committee in November of last year, and has attended three of the Supply [REPRESENTATIVES.] (Formal). six meetings which have been held since that time. He has also assured me that he had no intention to make a bitter attack on the honourable member for Laanecoorie. I wish, therefore, to-withdraw what I said on the subject.",68
373,Mr CAMERON,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO," I was not present when the honourable and learned member for Wannon referred to the valuation of imported harvesters, but I distinctly heard the Minister of Trade and Customs say that he would not throw any obstacle in the way of the importing company, if they wished to prove their bona fides, i This evening, however, the honourable member for North Sydney informed the House that the Minister has not yet done anything in the matter, and I therefore ask him to give the House an assurance, for the sake of his own reputation, and that of the Commonwealth, that he If will give these people an opportunity to prove that they have not been guilty of fraud, by taking proceedings against them. I do not defend attempts to defraud, and should like to see such attempts punished.",68
374,Mr BROWN,ADMISSION OF JAPANESE TO," I think that the Postmaster-General, in common with most honourable members, recognises the important part which telephones play in connection with the development of our territory, and I therefore ask him to consider the advisability of bringing more prominently under the notice of the public the means 'provided for their convenience. When a telephone exchange is established, While the the names of the persons whose residences are connected with it appear on the list which is made available to the public. But there are manv cases in which country homes or stations are connected by private telephone lines with the nearest telegraph office, and I suggest that some method should be adopted of acquainting the public with the fact that these means of communication exist. For instance, if residents in Melbourne could consult a list showing the country homes connected bytelephone, they would probably be induced to avail themselves of the facilities offered, and would thus bring additional revenue to the Department. I hope that the Minister will give this matter his attention.",68
