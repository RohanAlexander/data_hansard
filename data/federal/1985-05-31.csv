0,NA,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"NA FIRST SESSION OF THE THIRTY-FOURTH PARLIAMENT The House of Representatives, on 23 May 1985, fixed an earlier day of meeting. Mr Speaker summoned the House of Representatives Friday, 31 May 1985",13
1,Mr SPEAKER ,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"Hon, Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. NA NA Motion (by Mr Young) proposed: That(I) standing order 48A, as amended by sessional order, be suspended for this sitting, and (2) so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the following items of business taking precedence this sitting: (a) the reporting and consideration forthwith of a message from the Senate relating to the Repatriation Legislation Amendment Bill; (b) a special adjournment motion; (c) a motion for leave of absence to all Members, and (d) a motion for adjournment of the House. EmptyHere position) (3.02)-I move the following Senate, amendment: Thatafter paragraph (2) (a), the following paragraphs inserted: (aa) a period of questions without notice for one hour;",13
2,Mr YOUNG ,SESSIONAL ORDERS,"An hour?'r NA Hansard 1985 (FIRST PERIOD) adjourned to 20 August 1985, unless Mr Speaker to meet on Friday, 31 May 1985, at 3.00 p.m. EmptyHere to hear this explanation about jellyback. We want to hear jellyback and boofhead together. I continue: (ab) discussion of the matter of public importance submitted by the Leader of the Opposition today; and (ac) debates to be initiated in respect of: (i) the assets test changes; (ii) the $1 billion provisional tax miscalculation; (iii) the severe capital gains tax proposed by the Treasurer; and (iv) the depreciation in value of the Australian dollar. of all other business for I move that amendment today because this Government is engaging in an abuse of the Parliament unprecedented in the Commonwealth's history. In a profligate waste of tens of thousands of the taxpayers' dollars this Government has recalled the House during the recess, while trying ' to evade the scrutiny of the House in session and suppressing Question Time and the discussion of matters of public importance. Now, interestingly the Government is scurrying out of the leaving in limbo at least 18 Bills, 16 of which it has classified as essential. Not only do those opposite mismanage the Government and the Parliament and have to get us to come back, be but 18 pieces of legislation, 16 of which they had classified as essential, will not even go through the Parliament. You will need to do more than what you are doing now.",13
3,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Order! I remind honourable members on my right that they are in the House of Representatives of the Parliament of Australia, not in the Canadian Parliament. I ask them to desist from banging their desks. EmptyHere this Government, comprising small and diminished men, attempts to use the House of Representatives of the people of Australia as if it were an adjunct of the Enmore branch of the Australian Labor Party. There is no doubt that this Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) is trying to apply to this Parliament the lessons in political control that he has learned by attending the right wing factions of his own Party and the lessons handed down to him, seemingly, by his new tutor, the present Treasurer ( Mr Keating), who is, after all, the man who presided over the New South Wales ALP in its most tarnished hours. The Treasurer is so totally seized of his Prime Minister's decisiveness that the story doing the rounds of the ALP in this building is that he calls his Prime Minister 'jellyback'-presumably, with all the Treasurer's normal expletives deleted.",14
4,Mr HUNT ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Who does? EmptyHere first thing I was asked at a Press conference today. Today, respect for the forms of the House requires the amendment of the motion before the Chair so that the House can proceed with its Question Time and with its debate on a matter of public importance. Today, form is not the only matter at stake. Today, form follows substance. Today, the substance is the Government's accountability to the House of Representatives. Since this House rose a week ago, we have had a further decline in the dollar, the announcement of the capital gains taxing, the fiddles with the assets test and numerous other elements that deserve to be discussed. On only two previous occasions in .the nation's history has the Parliament been recalled for a sitting such as this on a day other than that specified in the special adjournment motion. The first was in 1940 in the dark days of military threat to this country, when the Parliament was recalled to consider Australia's national security; and the second was in 1975 when the financial scandals surrounding the Whitlam Government forced it to try to account to the nation. Now we know that it is being written that there is a whiff of Whitlam in the air. That is the only way that one could equate the recalling of this Parliament with that loan scandal. The Whitlam Government's attempt to arrest its political haemorrhaging was futile and so too will be the nonsense that is being carried out here today. This session was called today because the Government failed to consult with the veterans organisations before changing the entitlements of Australia's own veterans. Because of this breach of trust, the Senate amended the Government's legislation to impose a six months sunset clause to compel the Government belatedly to meet its promise to consult with the veterans associations. So the Governinent, as a consequence of its breach of promise, has recalled the House. I have indicated the sorts of issues that ought to be dealt with, the sorts of matters that have arisen since the House of Representatives adjourned. First of all, within about 36 hours of the House rising, the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe) introduced administrative changes to the assets test. He would not indicate to this Parliament that the old inequities which made the assets test a national disgrace are left unchanged and he would not indicate that the assets test itself is an anomaly, inherently unjust, unfair, discriminatory against one section of the community, and for that reason will be abolished by us-not amended, not tinkered with, not fiddled with behind the scenes to continue the inequities. Why did the Government skulk away and leave it until the weekend after the House rose to announce those administrative changes? It is because it was not prepared to defend them in this Parliament. The Government is not prepared to answer questions on the assets test today because it knows what the assets test has cost and what it ought to have cost because of its unfairness. In the last two days we have learned about the capital gains tax. During the election campaign I went around the country saying, 'As certain as night follows day you will get a capital gains tax' and the people of Australia are getting it. They now know that, as certain as an express train coming at them, the Government will dump a capital gains tax on them. Why will the Government not discuss it with u- today? Why will it not give us time to ask the Treasurer why he has got death duties as well as this capital gains tax in the present proposal? That is the present proposal. The Government knows that the demands for a capital gains tax are by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, by the Left, and by the Centre Left; they want death duties and gift duties. The Government is wrapping them up in the proposal that the Treasurer's office, with some extraordinary degree of political sagacity, leaked to the newspapers for publication yesterday. This is only the start of the matters that ought to be discussed. What about the continuing decline of the dollar? The decline has been brought about by the assessments made of the international community of old jellyback's economic policies. If jellyback has not got the spine to come in here today and defend his Government we at least have got the guts to stand up and say to the people of Australia: 'These matters have to be discussed'. I do not know why the Treasurer referred to him as jellyback in regard to the performance of the Parliament to date; I would have chosen worse terminology, but I would like to hear from the Treasurer why he did so. Was it the twists and turns on tertiary fees? Was it the twists and turns on taxation? I do not know. The House is entitled to an explanation of the obvious deep-seated division in the ranks of the Government between the Treasurer and the Prime Minister.",14
5,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,Order! The Leader of the Opposition's time has expired. Is the amendment seconded?,15
6,Mr HOWARD ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Bennelong) (3.12)- Mr Speaker, I second the amendment. There is another reason, in addition to those listed by the EmptyHere are being denied Question Time today. It is to be found on the front page of the Australian Financial Review. The Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) has been busy leaking against his Treasurer ( Mr Keating). That is what has been happening. He does not like the fact that over the last few weeks the Treasurer has been getting some good headlines. I know what goes on in that corner office when Treasurers start getting good headlines. I can tell honourable members that. I have not the slightest doubt that those minder mates of the Prime Minister have come in and said: 'Hey, Bob, this is getting a bit out of hand'. After all, the Treasurer is supposed to be the Prime Minister's supporter; he is not supposed to be the Prime Minister's guider or leader. The Prime Minister cannot tolerate a situation where every day he is muttering out of the side of his mouth: 'I do not know whether he is in or out of the cart. I do not know whether he is with me or against me on taxation reform'. His minders are, no doubt, saying to him: 'Look, you used to be Mr 74 per cent. The only way you are going to get back to anything like it is for you to put this down. You cannot have people running around saying that the Treasurer is leading you by the nose. I will tell you what you have got to do. You have got to go to the members of the Press and tell them how tough you were in dealing with the Premiers. That is what you have got to do. You have got to say that you went in there, lined them up and said: ""I will have none of this Treasury weakness. I am going to demand that we go to the Premiers Conference with a really tough line on the States. We are really going to hold them back. We are really going to screw them down. We are really going to demontrate how strong we are. In the process we are going to tell them all that Bob did it; that if it had not been for the strength displayed by the Prime Minister over his permissive Treasurer, this tough line would not have been taken"". The reality is that we saw in this morning's Press the clearest possible evidence that this Prime Minister is taking a lunge at the person who has been the closest ally in his Government. Everybody knows that when open conflict develops between Prime Ministers and Treasurers in government, those governments are in very big trouble. Mr O'Neil-You would know.",15
7,Mr HOWARD,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"That is right. As far as I am concerned, this is the best possible example that we have had in a long time of this occurring. We have seen on the front page of the Australian Financial Review a very dramatic illustration of this Prime Minister's craven populism, his frantic inability to accept a reduction in his personal popularity. It is an illustration that he is lurching from one poll which reduces his popularity and his esteem to another. He cannot stand the credit and the publicity that his Treasurer gets for the courage that he is displaying in pushing ahead on matters related to good taxation reform. What does the Prime Minister do? He resorts to the cheap device of going to the front page of the Australian Financial Review, beating his chest and saying: 'Wasn't I tough, wasn't I clever? The Treasurer wanted to be weak but I was prepared to be strong. I was prepared to take those Premiers on. I was prepared to tell them what their duty was and the Treasurer was not prepared to do that.' I think that is the clearest sign yet of how nervous this Prime Minister is about his devalued authority. We hear talk about the devaluation of our dollar. The devalued authority of the Prime Minister, of his leadership, his esteem and his respect, have really been brought home today when he has resorted to the cheap and demeaning device of deliberately leaking a story that is meant to be damaging to the man who has given him more respectability and more support within his own Government than any other member of that Government. .",15
8,Mr YOUNG ,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Port Adelaide-Leader of the House) (3.18)-The Government will not agree to the Opposition's amendment. We are somewhat persuaded in our opinion by the Opposition's lack of performance at Question Time over the last three months, It has been unable to fill out 45 minutes of Question Time for the last three months; so it is showing a fair bit of audacity to ask for an hour today, In fact, a quick check of the records shows that the Leader of the OppoEmptyHere Opposition ( Mr Howard) and the Leader of the National Party ( Mr Sinclair) have asked 45 per cent of all the questions that have come from the other side, They have not made one dint on the Government in the three months in which this House has been sitting, I would have thought that the most positive way this Parliament might have exercised its voice today would have been to congratulate the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) for the work they did yesterday on behalf of all the people of Australia, That was not something that the honourable member for Bennelong-the $9,6 billion man-was able to achieve during his term as Treasurer because of the malice of Mal. It is not the whiff of Whitlam that we are worried about; it is the perfume of the colt from Kooyong, That is what we on the front bench of this side of the House cannot get over, We are here today because the Senate has amended a piece of essential legislation which was part of the Government's economic statement. We are here because of actions that were taken by the Opposition, not actions that were taken by the Government. We are here to deal with the matter that has been presented to the Parliament. Nothing the Opposition has said in the last three months has influenced the way in which this Government is determining to make decisions on behalf of all Australians, One of the great benefits of bringing the House together is that we are able to put on notice and put on display this feeble Opposition, Every time Opposition members are on display it becomes automatic that our term in office will be prolonged, Every time people are able to witness the inadequacy of the Opposition it is of advantage to us, The Opposition wants lin hour for Question Time, What a joke! Any observer of Parliament who looks at Question Time over the last three months will see that the Opposition has not made any dint at all in the Government. It is absolutely ludicrous, As I have said, we shall deal with the business that we have come here to deal with, I move: That the question be now put. Question put.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Crime: Use of Computers Mr Jacobi asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 22 February 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to estimat- by criminologist Mr Allen Perry in The Advertiser of 21 May 1984, that computer crime is costing Australia $500 million a year, but that only I per cent or 2 per cent of computer crimes are ever detected, and even then not all crimes are reported to police or prosecuted. (2) Has his attention also been drawn to an article in Future Age of 7 May 1984, which claimed that the consensus of Australian law and crime experts is that Australian authorities are yet to find out what on with computer crime and even if they did know"" there is a feeling they would not be able to tackle it effectively. (3) Is he able to say whether the Victorian Attorney General is planning to legislate against computer-related crimes. (4) Is it a fact, as claimed by Francine MCNiff in the Future Age article referred to in part (2), that the jurisdiction of State criminal courts State can determine only those offences occurring within its own geographical limits, whereas with computer crime and abuse, state and national boundaries are almost non-existent, as the user of a computer in Tasmania could quite feasibly perpetrate an abuse on a computer in Darwin, Brisbane or even Hong Kong. (5) Are there conceptual difficulties in, drafting lation to deal with computer-related crime, as claimed by the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions, including the problems of identification, in terms of legal concept, of property that can be the subject of an offence allied to theft and the facilitating of methods of proving an offence in a court so that the very sophisticated concepts involved in computers can be understood by a lay tribunal. (6) Has his attention been drawn to reported comments of Chief Inspector Brown of the Victorian Fraud Squad that the only remedies available for computer crimes in which the computer tool, are 'Band-Aid prosecutions', such as charging an offender with theft of the piece of paper on which he had printed the information from a computer file rather than with the theft of the information itself; if so can this be substantiated. (7) Does he have evidence to substantiate that a national solution to computer crime and an innovative approach to computer law, is needed; if so, will he urgently consider my repeated requests for a reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission on crime committed through or in connection with the use of computers. Mr Lionel Bo-enThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As stated in answer to Question No. 1356 (Hansard,4 September 1984, page 435) the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has this matter under active consideration. Ministers have agreed that uniform legislation is NA necessary in view of the transborder nature of this criminal activity. There are novel and difficult problems (Question No.4) associated with the preparation of legislation to deal with computer-related crimes. I am confident that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General will be able to agree on effective model legislation for enactment by all jurisdictions in Australia. As the Standing Committee is giving this matter attention I reiterate my previous advice that it would not be appropriate at this time to refer the matter, to the Australian Law Reform Commission. National Takeovers Code (Question No. 7) Mr Jacobi asked the Attorney-General, upon is actually going notice, on 22 February 1985: (1) ,Has his attention been drawn to a recent statement by his predecessor relating to the area of concern that the normal judicial process is inappropriate for the authoritative and expeditious resolution of disputes which arise under th- National Takeovers Code. (2) Is it a fact that parties to a takeover litigation qtay have to wait for more than 6 months for the final resolution of a dispute by the High Court. is territorial, in that each (3) Will he initiate urgent discussions within the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities with a view to setting up an expert tribunal to deal effectively and expeditiously with all disputes arising under the Takeovers Code. (4) Is it a fact that, because of the lengthy delays invollegisved, an appellate court might find it impracticable to grant the relief sought by a plaintiff in takeover litigation even though the plaintiff's legal arguments are accepted. , (5) Can he say whether parties to takover litigation with very meritorious cases have been forced to abandon appeals from dubious single judge decisions because delays within the appellate court system appear to make it extraordinarily difficult for an appellate court to satisfactorily unscramble a takeover.",23
20,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: is a target, rather than just a (I) to (5) In the light of concerns such as those expressed by the honourable member, the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities has referred to the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee for inquiry and review the questions of: (a) the appropriateness of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act 1980 as a mechanism for regulating takeovers in Australia; and (b) the appropriateness of existing mechanisms for review of decisions of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), and any related matters. The Committee has given high priority to the reference on takeovers. Its review of this matter is still in progress. In view of the wide range of matters referred to it, the Committee has not yet begun work on the reference on appeals under co-operative companies and securities legislation. I do not wish to pre-empt the review on the above matters being undertaken by the Committee. However, I note that views similar to those of the honourable member and my predecessor have been expressed by Mr Jim Bain, Chairman of the Stock Exchange of Sydney, and Mr Leigh Masel, when Chairman of the NCSC. The new chairman of the NCSC, Mr Henry Bosch, is very con-, cerned to ensure that business regulation is kept as simple as possible and that disputes arising as part of takeovers are handled speedily and expertly. The proposal of an expert tribunal may provide a suitable mechanism in that regard. In the meantime, the matter is with the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. The Ministerial Council as a whole will consider the Committee's views as soon as they are available. Extradition Treaties Mr Blanchard asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 22 February 1985: With which countries does Australia (a) have extradition treaties and when was each treaty last reviewed in order to test its effectiveness in modern international law and (b) not have existing extradition treaties and for what reasons.",24
21,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australia's extradition arrangements fall into four categories. \. Australia has succeeeded to a number of treaties relating to extradition negotiated by Great Britain which may be referred to as 'inherited' treaties. Australia has 'inherited' treaties with Albania, Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Ecuador, EI Salvador, Finland, France, Greece, Guatamala, Haiti, Hungary, Iceland, Spain, Iraq, Liberia, Luxemburg, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, San Marino, Switzerland, Thailand, Uruguay and Yugoslavia. 2. In recent years Australia has concluded modern extradition treaties with the Sweden, Israel, Austria, and Finland. 3. The Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966 has been applied on the basis of 'reciprocity' to South Africa thus enabling Australia to make requests for extradition of those countries and to consider requests for extradition by those countries. 4. The Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act 1966 regulates extradition between Australia and Commonwealth countries declared under the Act. Commonwealth countries declared under the Act include: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Cyprus, Dominica, Fiji, The Gambia, Ghana, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Grenada, Guyana, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Nauru, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, St Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and The Grenadines, The Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Western Samoa, Zambia, Zimbabwe. 5. 'Inherited' treaties are substantially similar in their terms and the effectiveness of many of them has been demonstrated when Australia has acceded to requests, or has itself made requests, for extradition pursuant to these treaties. Nevertheless the Extradition Task Force has identified some areas common to many inherited treaties that are archaic and approaches have been made to several countries to replace these treaties with modern treaties. All countries thus far approached have responded favourably. 6. Australia does not have extradition arrangements with a number of countries for a variety of reasons. In relation to some countries, it is considered inappropriate for political reasons to negotiate extradition treaties. The system of justice in some countries differs so markedly from (Question No. 46) the Australian system that there is no reasonable basis for negotiation. Some countries have indicated that they can give no priority to concluding extradition arrangements, which are likely to be seldom used. 7. It would not be appropriate to canvass in detail the reasons for which Australia does not have extradition arrangements with individual countries. Extradition Treaties (Question No. 52) Mr N. A. Brown asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 22 February 1985: What stage has been reached in the negotiations for extradition treaties with (a) Finland, (b) Denmark, (c) Norway, (d) the Federal Republic of Germany, (e) the Philippines and (f) Indonesia and when is it anticipated that each of these negotiations will be concluded.",25
22,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A treaty with the Federal Republic of Germany has been signed and awaits ratification. It is anticipated that ratification will take place this year. Instruments of ratification of a treaty with Finland were exchanged on 15 March 1985. United States of America, Italy, Approaches have been made to both the Philippines and Indonesia with a view to concluding modern extradition arrangements. Australia is awaiting a response from Brazil, Ireland a'nd each of these countries. Negotiations for treaties with Denmark and Norway should conclude during 1985.

Mr Barry Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The honourable member refers to a recommendation made by the OECD Examiners in their recently released report reviewing Australia's National Science Policies.

Department of Social Security (Question No. 455) Mr Braithwaite asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 26 March 1985: (I) Which quasi autonomous non-government organisations are under the jurisdiction of the Minister's Department. (2) What was the expenditure of each organisation in 1983-84 and what are their budgets in 1984-85.",42
38,Mr HOWE ,TIWI LAND COUNCIL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The only areas which could be considered to fall within the meaning of the honourable member's question are: (i) The University of New South Wales Social Welfare Research Unit which is funded by the Commonwealth to undertake and sponsor research work on social welfare issues in Australia. (ii) The Commissioner for Commonwealth Government Employees Compensation-a statutory office holder. He is responsible for determining matters arising under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971, which provides workers' compensation benefits for persons employed by Commonwealth Government departments and authorities. (2) (i) An amount of $636,000 was provided to the Social Welfare Research Centre in accordance with the agreement in the 1983-84 financial year. Payments to the Centre will total approximately $696,000 in 1984-85. (ii) The salary and allowances of the Commissioner were $54,000 in 1983-84 and are expected to be $59,000 in 1984-85.

Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program (Question No. 481) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: (I) What amount did the Government allocate and/or spend on road expenditure in (a) 1982-83, (b) 1983-84 and (c) 1984-85 in each category of road, in each State, under the local roads grant legislation from the ABRD Program. (2) What amount did the States provide for each category in each of the years. (3) What was the percentage change for (a) the total federal expenditure and (b) each category of road, in each of these years. EmptyHere able member's question is as follows: (I) The Australian Bicentennial Road Development (ABRD) Trust Fund Act does not specify a formal allocation of moneys among States and/or road categories in respect of any particular year of the ABRD Program. The Act only provides for the total revenues paid to the Trust Fund over the full duration of the Program to be allocated among States and/or road categories in accordance with specified percentages. Figures are published annually in association with the Federal Budget setting out an indicative allocation among States and categories of revenues estimated to be paid into the Trust Fund during the particular year. However, it should be noted that these allocations do not provide the sole basis for the distribution of payments from the Trust Fund in any particular year. The amounts paid from the Trust Fund also take account of the differing rates of progress achieved on construction works in respective States and categories during the year. Figures released in conjunction with the 1982, 1983 and 1984 Budgets detailed the following indicative allocations of estimated ABRD revenue,in relation to the years 1982-83, 1983-84 and 1984-85 respectively: ABRD-INDlCATIVE ALLOCATIONS-1982-83 ($M) Urban Rural National Arterial Arterial Local Roads Roads Roads Roads Total 26.3 15.8 7,9 7.7 57.7 12.0 12.9 6.4 5.4 36.7 16.3 11.7 5.9 5.3 39.2 7.9 7.0 3.5 3.9 22.3 4) 4.1 2.0 2.1 12.9 2.2 2.0 1.0 1.4 6.6 2.6 0.5 0.3 1.2 4.6 72.0 54.0 27.0 27.0 180.0 $150 million for payments from the ABRD Trust Fund in that of progress likely to be achieved on construction work funded New South Wales Victoria Queensland Western Australia South Australia Tasmania.

Dural FM Repeater Station Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: (I) What is the current position concerning complaints about radio interference with the Dural FM repeater station. (2) What has happened to a prosecution which, according to his Department reply to a Senate estimates committee in September 1984, was before a court at that time. (3) Is it a fact that departmental cars fitted with special detection equipment are rarely used because of lack of qualified officers. (4) Is it also a fact that Mr R. L. Lear, of Blaxland, NSW, had his amateur radio licence and his CB radio licence cancelled some time ago, but is still broadcasting.",43
39,Mr DUFFY ,TIWI LAND COUNCIL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Recent radio interference involving the Dural FM repeater station resulted mainly from the activities of one person. Since my Department took regulatory action against him on 10 January 1985, there has been only one official complaint of interference concerning the repeater station, which occurred on 12 March 1985. (2) In September 1984 there were a number of prosecutions pending in relation to misuse of the Dural repeater station, -.yhich mainly involved the one person. While a number of prosecutions have already led to convictions, there are others which have yet to be dealt with by the Court.

Included among this equipment are some recently purchased items which are used solely for direction finding of radiocommunication transmitting stations. As considerable skill is required to use these devices the Department has provided field staff with special training in their operation. (4) (a) Mr Lear's amateur licence lapsed on 6 September 1982 for non-payment of the appropriate fee. His request of 30 September 1983 to renew the licence was refused by my Department in view of his previous misuse of radio equipment. (b) Mr Lear's CB licence was revoked for misuse of radio equipment on 19 October 1983. (c) My Department informs me that Mr Lear is no longer involved in operating equipment for radio transmission purposes as he is in gaol. Special Air Services Regiment (Question No. 530) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 28 March 1985: (I) Does the counter-terrorist component of the Special Air Services Regiment receive regular training in handling incidents involving the possible use by terrorist groups of nuclear devices. (2) Do-s the Special Air Services Regiment hold stocks of equipment necessary for such missions and how often are designated personnel able to train using this equipment. ' (3) Is all this equipment portable by air; if not, are stocks held on both the east and west coasts and what is the estimated time to deploy the Special Air Services Regiment from Perth in response to a possible nuclear terrorist incident on the east coast.",45
40,Mr BEAZLEY ,TIWI LAND COUNCIL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) to (3) Public knowledge of the scope of training of the counter-terrorist force and the nature and location of its equipment may adversely affect the chance of successfully resolving terrorist incidents. The Government does not therefore consider it appropriate to comment on these matters. United Nations General Assembly Resolution Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 28 March 1985: In view of Australian endorsement of resolution 39/72G, in the United Nations General Assembly, what specific measures does the Australian Government propose in order to discharge its obligations, particularly in relation to (a) sub-paragraph 7, (b) sub-paragraph 8, and (c) sub-paragraph 9.",46
41,Mr HAYDEN ,TIWI LAND COUNCIL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australia co-sponsored United Nations General Assembly resolution 39/72G (1984). It did so as an expression of the abhorrence of apartheid felt by the Australian Government and people. The resolution requested states to consider taking various steps in their relations with South Africa. The Government has given careful and sympathetic consideration to the proposals in the resolution and has concluded that Government action accords clearly and closely with the thrust of the resolution, as shown by the following information. Operative paragraph 7 of resolution 39/72G: 7 (a) The Government makes no investments in or loans to South Africa. Pending the imposition of mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa by the United Nations Security Council, which the Government is prepared to support and, if adopted, to implement, the Government will request Australian companies operating in South Africa to abide by the voluntary code of conduct, the terms of which I announced in the House of Representatives on 18 April. 7 (b) All Government promotion of trade with South Africa has ceased. 7 (c) Australia conducts no military or intelligence cooperation with South Africa. In the interests of law enforcement in Australia occasional contact is maintained between the law enforcement authorities. 7 (d) There is no nuclear collaboration between Australia and South Africa. Operative paragraph 8 of resolution 39/72G: 8 (a) Australia contributes to various multilateral funds designed to provide ance for Namibian and South African students. Some of the recipient bodies are solely concerned with Namibia while others have wider objectives and interests but include Namibians in their programs. Australia has pledged $A220,OOO in 1985 to a number of United Nations funds for southern Africa, which include the United Nations Education and Training Program for Southern Africa (UNETPSA) and the United Nations Fund for Namibia (UNFN). Since 1978 Namibians have been awarded scholarships under the auspices of the Commonwealth of Nations to study in Australia. There are five students currently studying in Australia. A Namibian participated in the Foreign Service Training Course of the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1984. Australia's membership of the UN Council for Namibia is an indication of the Government's concern over the territory and its people. Australia provides educational assistance (scholar39/72G ships) to South Africans disadvantaged by apartheid to (Question No. 545) pursue tertiary and other studies in South Africa. 8 (b) On 26 October 1983 the Government announced that it was prepared to see the establishment in Australia of information offices for the South West African People's Organisation (SW APO) and the African National Congress (ANC). The ANC established an information office in Australia in December 1983 and a SWAPO representative arrived in Australia on 25 March 1985 to do the same. Australia does not provide direct support to African liberation movements. 8 (c) The Australian Government supports the efforts of the Front Line States and the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) to promote and strengthen regional and national economic development to reduce dependence on South Africa. Australia provides bilateral and multilateral assistance to the Front Line States mostly in terms of food aid. While the Government is not currently considering an increase in allocation of aid to SADCC and the Front Line States, it is developing a program of long term aid to Africa which is intended to focus on food security. The Australian Government was also active in the recent International Development Agency (IDA) negotiations and was one of the first countries to offer a contribution additional to its previous proportionallevel. Operative paragraph 9 of resolution 39/72G: The Australian Government does not provide assistance to South Africa in academic, cultural or sporting fields: neither does it encourage the development of relations in these areas. In keeping with its rejection of apartheid, the Government has a strong policy of discouraging all forms of representative sporting contact between Australia and South Africa. In 1983 the Government established a program whereby prominent opponents of apartheid are invited to Australia as guests-ofgovernment. Bishop Desmond Tutu and Dr Alan Boesak, both prominent opponents of the South African Government, have visited Australia under this program. As mentioned under 8 (a) above the Government has established a scholarship program for black South Africans disadvantaged by apartheid. Termination of Railway Services educational and training assist(Question No. 555) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 28 March 1985: (I) What criteria are used by the Australian National Railways Commission in relation to changing or terminating railway services in Tasmania and South Australia. (2) Is the criteria identical for both States. EmptyHere able member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) The Australian National Railways Commission (AN) has advised me lation to changing or terminating railway services are identical in all areas served by AN rail services. Section 18 (I) of the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 requires that AN conduct its operations ' . . . in a manner that accords with sound commercial practice'. To meet this statutory requirement the Commission compares the changes in revenue and the changes in expenditure which would occur from service changes or cessations. Decisions are taken based on the results of these financial analyses, supplemented by information of the effects of changes on AN staff and on those communities which would be affected by service reductions. The provisions of the railway transfer agreements between the Commonwealth and South Australia and Tasmania must also be taken into account. These agreements require, in certain circumstances, the approval of Commonwealth and State Ministers for - Transport before changes ca!1 occur. Australia's Sea Lines Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 10 May 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the many 1985 edition of Pacific Defence Reporter entitled 'Australia's Vulnerable Sea the article which states that it appeared from material available either that Defence strategy does not recognise the importance of the defence of overseas trade, or that the defence of overseas trade had been placed in the 'too hard basket', and that the Government in arriving at its decision on the submarine short list should not opt for cheap and unproven designs offered by companies with little or no blue-water experience. (2) Is it a fact that neutral merchant shipping in times of hostilities between other nations or groups of nations. (3) Does Australia depend largely on there being free movement of maritime trade, both import and export, in order to sustain its agricultural, transport, mining and manufacturing industries. (4) Can he assure those individuals or organisations in the Australian community looking to him as their principal ministerial decision maker that he will take an active role in Cabinet discussions on the choice of a new submarine design for'the RAN, given the requirement that will be placed on these vessels to ensure that Australian sea lines of communication remain open. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) These matters are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Defence and should be directed to him. (3) Yes. (4) The Submarine Project will have implications for many aspects of Australia's trade. Accordingly I have been taking a close interest in the decisions irivolved in progressing the Project. Pensions: Division of Parkes (Question No. 1053) that the criteria it uses in reMr Cobb asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 10 May 1985: (I) How many pensioners were there each month in each category of pension in the Electoral Division of Parkes from I December 1984 to 10 May 1985. (2) How many pensions in each category have (a) cancelled and (b) reduced. (3) How many pensioners in each category have had their fringe benefits (a) cancelled and (b) reduced. (4) What percentage of pensioners in each category have been affected by the assets test. (5) How many pensioners in the Division have not yet lodged the assets test forms.",46
42,Mr HOWE ,TIWI LAND COUNCIL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) to (5) The information sought is not available. Relevant statistics for geographical areas smaller than States and Territories are available only by Social Security regions and by postcode districts. Tables showing the (Question No. 1048) number of pensioners whose pension has been reduced or cancelled, by Social Security region and by postcode districts, have been prepared but are too voluminous for incorporation in Hansard.

Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism Mr Blunt asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 10 May 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to a report in Inside Tourism on 6 May 1985, that the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism is about to be relieved of this portfolio and that this action will be timed to coincide with the axing of tourism incentives under the Export Market Development (EMDG) scheme. (2) Is it a fact, that he is taking this decision as a result of the industry's uproar about cutbacks to the EMDG scheme.",47

Cadet Units (Question No. 1067) Mr Sinclair asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 14 May 1985: (I) How many of the 20 regional cadet units proposed (Question No. 1066) by his predecessor in his press statement of 16 August 1984 have been raised. (2) Where have these units been raised, what is the strength of each and what funding does each receive from the Commonwealth. (3) How many cadet units were in operation in March 1983, what was their total strength and what was their total funding from the Commonwealth. (4) How many cadet units have ceased operation since (a) March 1983 and (b) the announcement of new Commonwealth funding arrangements for such units.",48
45,Mr BEAZLEY ,IIRCU,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The new scheme introduced in financial Year 1984/85 proposed that 20 Regional Cadet Units would be raised throughout Australia. As at 20 May 1985, 13 Regional Cadet Units have been forined with sub-units in a total of 22 locations. Negotiations are in progress with suitable community sponsors to raise Regional Cadet Units at seven new locations before July 1985. (2)Location Strength (as at 30 March) Woodridge, Qld 214 Canterbury, NSW 58 Punchbowl, NSW 143 Shalvey, NSW 87 Ingleburn, NSW 4 (raised 1 March 1985) Camden,NSW 87 Fairfield, NSW 76 Grafton, NSW 39 Erina,NSW (raised 8 March 1985) Wollongong, NSW 5 (raised 8 March 1985) Unit 40RCU 41 RCU 50RCU 51 RCU 60RCU 70RCU Each of these units receives full support from the Army. This includes an annual camp of seven days with a travel subsidy of $10 per head, issue of limited personal equipment and uniforms, payment of allowances to Officers of Cadets, fostering and limited training support from Army Reserve units including the training of Officers of Cadets, and the loan of weapons and training stores. The budget provision for Financial Year 1984/85 was $2 million. The actual expenditure for the Financial Year is now expected to be about $2.6 million. (3) 166 Cadet units were in operation in March 1983 with a total strength of about 20,600. The cost of operating the scheme during Financial Year 1983/84 was about $11 million. (4) In March 1983, there were 166 cadet units. Before the scheme was restructured on I July 1984, 167 cadet units were operating.

Australian Capital Territory Railway Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 14 May 1985: (1) What is the arrangement between the State Rail Authority of NSW (SRA) and the Australian National Railways' Commission (AN) For the ACT railway. (2) What is the 'nominal' rental referred to by him. (3) What other costs of either a recurrent maintenance or capital nature will the Commonwealth still bear. (4) What amount will AN save each year by this arrangement. (5) If there is a saving to AN and an increased cost to the SRA why have there been reductions in the Canberra/Sydney passenger Fares and Freight charges. EmptyHere able member's question is as follows: (I) An agency agreement covering the total operation and control of the ACT railway was signed by AN and the SRA on 5 May 1985 For a period of 25 years or such shorter period as may result From its termination by an Act oFthe Commonwealth Parliament. (2) The 'nominal' rental is a licence Fee of $1.00 per annum payable by the SRA to AN. (3) The Commonwealth bears no costs For recurrent maintenance or capital expenditure after the commencementdate of 5 May 1985. (4) Based on operating losses since 1982-83 AN expects to save in excess of $0.5 million per annum as a result of the agreement. (5) Prior to the SRA taking over total operations of the ACT Railway, freight rates between NSW stations and Canberra were charged at intersystem railways of Australia rates. These provide for terminal charges at both points of origin and destination as well as a line haul charge. Following the agreement, the SRA has adopted its own internal basis of charging which has produced lower rates. Rail passenger Fares prior to the takeover by the SRA comprised an SRA component based on a distance Formula and an AN component. After the takeover, the AN component was removed. As the Sydney-Canberra distance falls within the same distance formula range as Sydney-Queanbeyan, the SRA component remained the same thus producing a Fare decrease. Passenger fares and freight rates between Sydney and Canberra are now a matter solely For the SRA to determine. The agreement between the SRA and AN also provides, in general, that Fares, Freight rates and services to and from Canberra shall be maintained after the transFer at levels not less favourable than those which apply to users of the remainder of the SRA's network.

Brown asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 22 February 1985: (1) When was it first brought to the attention of the Government that Mr Robert Trimbole was in Ireland (Eire). (2) What stage had been reached in any action then being taken to conclude an extradition treaty or reciprocal extradition arrangements with Ireland when it was first brought to the notice of the Government that Mr Trimbole was in Ireland.",52
54,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,FACILITIES AND PROJECTS BRANCH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Attorney-General's Department received advice from the Australian Federal Police on Tuesday, 23 October 1984 that a person thought to be Robert Trimbole was suspected of beihg in Ireland. That information became more definite later that day and was confirmed late on Wednesday, 24 October 1984. (2) Negotiations between officials . for an extradition treaty with Ireland took place in Dublin in June 1972. Follow up correspondence continued intermittently until 1977 without finality. Thereafter until mid-1983, the matter was substantially inactive. In January 1982 the Irish Treaty File was put away into the Department's Registry , and was not retrieved until July 1983. In mid-1983 work commenced on the settling of a model extradition treaty incorporating the latest developments in international extradition law. The model treaty was to be the basis for negotiations with countries with which extradition arrangements did not then exist. By October 1984 the model treaty had been substantially settled between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department. On 3 October 1984 Professor Ivan Shearer of well the University of New South Wales, a recognised expert in extradition law, was asked to comment on the, model treaty. As at 23 October 1984 the work before 1977 on the Irish Treaty had been overtaken by the development of the model treaty. The negotiation of a modern Extradition Treaty with Ireland has been taking place and is at an advanced stage. On confirmation of Robert Trimbole's being in Ireland, Australia moved immediately to negotiate and put in place extradition arrangements with Ireland pursuant to sub-section 10(4) of the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966. Those arrangements were subsequently upheld by the High Court of Australia and the High Court 'of Ireland. Imported Grain Harvesters Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 25 February 1985: (I) What is the cost per annum to the Australian wheat industry of the 15 per cent tariff applying to imported grain harvesters. (2) How many jobs in the Australian harvester manufacturing industry is this tariff designed to protect and what is the effective subsidy to each job from the wheat industry. (3) Is it feasible for the same protection to be afforded the manufacturers through a bounty paid by the community as a whole; If so, what would be the annual cost of such a bounty. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The tariff does not apply to all imported grain harvesters as the Government decided that tariff concessions would apply to very larg- machines not produced locally. Specific data for the wheat industry on the annual user cost of the 15 per cent tariff applying to imports of grain harvesters is not available. For the grains and oilseeds industries the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC) estimated the user cost to be of the order of $Ilm per annum. The lAC based its estimate (contained in its Report no. 320 'Grain Harvesters' of 18 May 1983) on 1982 levels of imports and local production. This is the latest estimate available. The total user cost to the wheat industry would, of course, be less. The lAC also estimated that, in aggregate, the 15 per cent tariff on imported harvesters increased the materials input costs of the graingrowing industry as a whole by approximately I per cent. (2) The industry currently employs about 670 people. Their share in the benefits from the tariff assistance would be equivalent to a value of up to about $16,500 per annum, depending on the extent to which shareholders and those not directly employed in the industry also benefit. The extent to which this represents a net transfer of income from grain producers (including their employees and suppliers) is dependent on the level of benefits which they also derive from Government assistance to grain producers and rural industries generally, as as judgment as to the level that prices, and repair and maintenance costs, would be in the absence of any local manufacturing capability. (3) It is technically feasible to provide assistance for local production of grain harvesters by way of a bounty. This would directly amount to about $1.3m per annum according to the lAC's estimate, but this excludes the revenue foregone from the abolition of the tariff which was estimated at $7.6m in 1983-84 and also excludes the costs of administering the bounty. Oil Pricing Policy: Farm Costs (Question No. 136) Mr Beddall asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 19 March 1985: (Question No. 95) (I) It is the Government's intention to introduce a subsidy to reduce the impact of the world oil parity pricing policy; if not, will it consider introducing such a subsidy. (2) Are farm costs higher under this Government than under the Fraser Government. (3) What effects have this Government's economic policies had on primary producers in Australia. (4) What effect is the reduced level of the Australian dollar having on primary producers in Australia. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's questiqn is as follows: (I) The Government does not inten- in-r-ducing as-b­ sidy to reduce the impact of its crude 011 Import panty pricing policy. A subsidy would distort the pattern of resource use and encourage waste. The Government has, however, announced its intention to review the pricing and allocation arrangements with a view to the possible introduction of a free market. Notwithstanding import parity pricing, Australian fuel prices have changed very little in real terms since 1980 and they have consistently compared very Favourably with countries like Japan, France and Britain. The Following table provides an indication of international retail petrol prices: NA PETROL PRICES (a) Italy Japan France Norway Spain Austria Netherlands Sweden United Kingdom Federal Republic of Germany New Zealand Greece Turkey Canada United States Australia (b) (a) International retail prices quoted are based on latest inFormation receive- From Australian overseas posts. Automatice gasoline prices are For the most commonly used grade of automotive gasoline in that country, at 'Full-service' prices. (b) Department of Resources and Energy estimate based on latest available cities, subsequent Prices Surveillance Authority determinations, allowance For discounts, and advice From the Australian Automotive Chamber of Commerce. Note: Prices have been converted For most countries at 6 March 1985 exchange rates. The OECD countries not included in the table are Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland. According to the lEA all have average petrol prices above Australia's. (2) The rate of increase in the price of Farm inputs for 1984-85 is approximately 6 per cent. This compares with an average rate of increases of 12.6 per cent experienced in the previous six years. (3) The Government's sound approach to economic management has benefited the rural sector in several ways.

58,Mr WILLIS ,INDICATIVE INTERNATIONAL RETAIL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is: (1) The latest figure of 5.6 per cent as at 31 March 1985. (2) 2.5 per cent of total funding under the Community Employment Program (CEP) approved in Queensland in 1984-85 has been in the Woodridge Commonwealth Employment Serice area. (3) The level of CEP funding approved in any area is largely dependent upon local sponsors putting forward wothwhile projects which meet the guidelines, objectives and priorities of the Program. Every effort has already been made by both Commonwealth and State field staff to assist potential sponsors in the Woodridge area in the development of CEP proposals. In addition, the CEP State Consultative Committee attempts to ensure an equitable distribution of CEP funds on the basis of regional levels of unemployment. Since the commencement of the CEP in Queensland, 37 projects creating 343 jobs and involving CEP funding of $3,387,569 have been approved in the Woodridge CES area. In 1984-85, CEP funding of$I,091,626 for II projects creating 116 jobs has already been approved.

59,Mr HOLDING ,INDICATIVE INTERNATIONAL RETAIL,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (I) Aboriginal Development Commission Department of Aboriginal Affairs NA This number includes American Express, Diners Club and Bankcard. The Department of Finance through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has provided the following advice with respect to Parts 2-5 of the question: (2) Credit Cards available to officers are issued by American Express International (Amex), Diners Club International, The Australian Telecommunications Commission (Telecom), The Australian National Airlines Commission (TAA), Ansett Airlines of Australia Ltd (Ansett). (3) There are normally no membership or service fees applicable to TAA, Ansett or Telecom credit cards. In respect of Amex and Diners Club credit cards, a departmental secretary may approve reimbursement of the annual membership fee to an officer in accordance with Finance Direction 34/25. Amex and Diners Club have introduced special annual membership rates for officers who apply for and are issued with credit cards through 'Corporate Card' Schemes that were negotiated with the Department of Finance-usually of the order of$IO-12 . (4) The issue of TAA, Ansett and Telecom credit cards to nominated senior officers, e.g. departmental secretaries and their deputies has been long standing. There are no restrictions on the level of officers who may apply for Amex or Diners Club credit cards. However, before a credit card is issued under the 'Corporate Card' Scheme, a department must be satisfied that an officer has a 'work-related' need for the card. (5) TAA, Ansett and Telecom credit cards are intended for use by senior officers where there is an urgent need to use the services of those bodies for official purposes in circumstances that do not allow the usual procedures to be followed, such as outside normal business hours or in locations remote from the department's office. Amex and Diners Club cards are subject to the limitations placed on the cards by Amex or Diners Club. Officers are responsible to meet all expenditure charged to their card account. Expenditure of an official nature incurred by the use of credit cards is subject to normal reimbursement procedures to which the disciplines of the Audit Act and other relevant legislation are applied. Other charges including interest etc that the officer chooses to incur in using these cards are the personal reCredit Cards sponsibility of that officer.

(4) What percentage of pensioners have been affected by the assets test. (5) How many people have not yet lodged the asset test forms.",64
72,Mr HOWE ,CLASSES OF SOVIET NAVAL WARSHIPS,"The answer to the honourable , member's question is as follows: (I) The full year savings in Social Security pension outlays from the introduction of the assets test is estimated to be $ 104.9m based on assets test forms processed to the end of the March 1985. The final full year savings will be higher because more forms will be processed and some of the people whose pensions have been suspended for failure to return the forms will in fact be cancelled. The comparable figure for the Department of Veterans' Affairs as at 5 April 1985 is $23.5m. (2) (a) and (b) As at the end of March 198523,443 Social Security pensions had been reduced and 30,832 Social Security pensions had been cancelled as a result of the assets test.

Australian Bicentennial Road Development: Allocation to New South Wales Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 17 April 1985: (I) Does the Australian bicentennial road development (ABRD) allocation to New South Wales include a specific allowance to be used by State Government Ministers to promote themselves in conjunction with ABRD projects. (2) In view of his criticism of the Queensland Government for seeking false credit for road projects fully paid for by the Federal Government, is he prepared to (a) instruct the New South Wales Minister for Roads that ABRD funds are not to be used for self-promotion (b) reduce the present or future ABRD grants by the amount spent by the New South Wales Minister associating himself with ABRD projects and (c) take out press advertisements or make public statements, pointing out that the New South Wales Government does not fund specified ABRD projects. EmptyHere able member's question is as follows: (I) No. (2) (a) and (b) See answer to part I. (c) The conditions under which Federal assistance is provided to the States for Australian Bicentennial Road Development (ABRD) projects were developed by the previous Government and are set down in the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Act 1982. The Act provides that assistance is conditional upon States arranging for signs to be erected and maintained in the vicinity of ABRD projects indicating that the projects are being funded from the ABRD Trust Fund. The Act does not specify any further requirements in respect of recognition of Federal funding of ABRD projects. The Government is concerned to ensure credit for Federally funded road projects. Accordingly, the Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Bill provides that the provision of Federal financial assistance to the States under the Australian Land Transport Program will be conditional upon the States: (i) arranging for signs acknowledging the source of funding to be erected and maintained adjacent to national and arterial road projects funded from the Australian Land Transport Trust Fund; (ii) according such other public recognition of funding of projects from the Australian Land Transport Trust Fund as the Minister requires; (iii) complying with any requirements specified by the Minister relating to traffic signs, near national highway projects funded from the Australian Land Transport Trust Fund. Melbourne Cricket Ground: Over-Award Mr Burr asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 18 April 1985: Is the agreement with building unions, working at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, to receive $83.65 per week in over award payments within the terms of the prices and (Question No. 768) incomes accord.",64
73,Mr WILLIS ,CLASSES OF SOVIET NAVAL WARSHIPS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government has consistently taken the view ""that all such claims should be processed through the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in accordance with the National Wage Fixation Principles. In the case of the Melbourne Cricket Ground site allowance, the parties privately agreed on a site allowance amounting to an extra $83.65 per week, despite the decision of 25 February 1985 by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which found that an allowance of that magnitude could not be justified. The matter was heard again before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on 24 April 1985 and the Government appeared as an intervener at those proceedings. The Government submitted that the process by which the allowance was agreed to at the MCG was clearly outside the terms of the Wage Fixation Principles, was contrary to the site allowance procedures specified in the relevant awards, was contrary to the terms of the Building Industry Agreement, and was clearly prejudicial to the Government's wages policy which requires an orderly and responsible approach in dealing with claims of such a nature. Federated Ship Painters and Dockers' Union (Question No. 774) Mr Burr asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 18 April 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the actions by the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers' Union in Sydney in demanding repair work that is not ordered by shipowners. (2) Is it a fact that shipowners have been told by the union that their vessels will not be released from the port until work demanded by the union has been completed. . (3) How many ships which have berthed in Sydney over the past 12 months have been boarded by members of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers' Union for the purpose of demanding repair work. (4) What was the cost of work which was carried out in this way and who has paid it. (5) Has any estimate been made of the additional cost of freight by bogus repair work. (6) Has he established whether demands by the union fit within the criminal charge of extortion. the display of signs, other than (7) What action has he planned to prevent unwarranted and disruptive claims in the future.",65
74,Mr WILLIS ,CLASSES OF SOVIET NAVAL WARSHIPS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is: Payments (I) Yes. (Question No. 773) (2) The campaign involves ship repair unions demanding certain repairs on foreign flag vessels prior to their departure and maritime unions delaying departure until that work is carried ou t. (3) I am a ware of 34 vessels which have berthed in Sydney over the past 12 months which have had demands placed on them fqr certain repair work to be undertaken. (4) The cost of the repair work undertaken on those vessels is estimated to be in the vicinity of $1.3m. That figure may in some instances also include the cost of repairs relating to ship safety required by Department of Transport Marine Surveyors. The cost of repairs has been met by shipowners. (5) The Government is not aware of any plans by shippers to increase the cost of shipping as a result of the unions' campaign. (6) The Government neither approves nor condones the use of intimidating tactics by any group in our society, including trade unions. I am aware that there exist certain unsubstantiated allegations that the campaign by ship repair unions involves threats of extortion. The Government is of the view that allegations of this nature should be pursued with the relevant law enforcement agency. (7) Separate discussions have recently been held with both the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Chamber of Shipping concerning this issue. Those discussions have resulted in a number of positive initiatives which are currently being further developed. Such initiatives should lead to a minimisation of industrial action of this nature. Further discussions on this issue will be held with the parties in the near future. On the wider front the Government is extremely concerned at the problems presently affecting the ship repair industry and in that context has taken a number of steps aimed at overcoming those problems. Specific Government initiatives affecting the industry will be determined in consultation with the industry and in the light oflhe report of the tripartite Working Party established at last year's Quadripartite Ship Repair Industry meeting to develop options for the industry. The Government believes that it is essential for all parties to take a positive approach if we are to address the problems of the ship repair industry. 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83 1983-84 1984-85 (a) ( ) denotes decrease (a) Year to date rn addition, from 1 March 1985 'Standby' and 'Advance Purchase' conditional discounts of 10 per cent and 20 per cent respectively have applied on certain interstate passenger services.

(2) What have been the reasons for each adjustment. EmptyHere able member's question is as follows: The Australian National Railways Commission (AN) is advised that its rates and charges vary by widely differing amounts for various traffic, depending on cost increases, market/competitive factors and agreements with customers and other rail systems. AN has provided the following details with respect to freight and passenger rates and fares. (I) For wagon load traffic (intersystem and AN mainland intrasystem), the average rates of change in rates for each year from 1980/81 are as follows: Actual Real (per cent) (per cent) 1980-81 10.3 -21.0 0.9-11.6 1981-82 9.5-19.0 (0.9)-8.6 1982-83 6.0 (5.5) 1983-84 7.0-8.0 0.2-1.2 1984-85 (a) 8.5-12.0 ( ) denotes decrease (a) Year to date For small consignments annual average rate increases since 1981-82 have been approximately 15.5 per cent (6.0 per cent in real terms), reflecting a large number of changes in individual rates, loading minima, and the continuing very poor level of cost recovery. For passenger traffic, the average rates of change in fares for South Australia country and intersystem travel from 1980-81 are as follows: Actual (per cent) Real (per cent) South Australia South Australia Country Interstate Country Interstate 13.4 14.0-18.7 4.0 4.6-9.3 25.0 23.1-26.3 14.6 12.7-15.9 18.0 10.4 6.5 (1.1) 9.6 6.0 2.8 (0.8) 20.2-30.4 11.0-15.7 prior to 1980-81· is not readily available.

Department of Social Security: Poverty Line (Question No. 800) (Question No. 787) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 19 April 1985: What is the current (a) Melbourne University (b) Social Welfare Policy Secretariat (i) before tax labour force poverty line and (ii) at home poverty line, for (A) a married couple without children, (B) a married couple with one child, (C) a married couple with two children, (D) a single parent with one child, (E) a single parent with two children and (F) a single person.",67
76,Mr HOWE ,CLASSES OF SOVIET NAVAL WARSHIPS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (i) and (ii) The Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne calculates poverty lines each quarter. These lines are based on the methods and assumptions used by Professor Ronald Henderson in the First Main Report of tLe Commission of Inquiry into Poverty (April 1975) except that they are updated by movements in seasonally adjusted household disposable income per head-an after-tax concept (Professor Henderson's original line was updated by movements in seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings, a pre-tax concept). The Institute's poverty lines for the December quarter 1984 (the latest available) are as follows: Head Head not working working $ $ (A) married couple without 169.10 145.20 children (B) married couple with one 203.20 179.30 child 237.40 213.50 children (D) single parent with one 162.20 138.30 child (Question No. 798) (E) single parent with two chil- 196.40 172.50 dren (F) single person 126.40 102.50 (b) (i) and (ii) The former Social Welfare Policy Secretariat (now the Policy Coordination Unit of the Department of Community Services) does not calculate poverty lines. In its Report on Poverty Measuremen( published in 1981, the Secretariat discussed the strengths and weaknesses of alternative methods of equating the incomes of families of different compositions so that families with low income in relation to their needs could be identified. The Report did not recommend a set of dollar amounts which could be used as poverty lines. Community Youth Support S<;heme: Allocation Dr Watson asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 19 April 1985: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the comment in the 'Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Programs' that the distribution of Community Youth Support Scheme (CYSS) projects is inequitable. (2) Is it a fact that at the time of the compilation of the report the number of unemployed people under the age of 25 years for each CYSS project was (a) 1,351 in Queensland and (b) 485 in Tasmania. (3) Is it also a fact that at the time of the compilation of the report that expenditure under CYSS for each unemployed person under the age of 25 years was (a) $46 in Queensland and (b) $113 in Tasmania. (4) What are the reasons for these discrepancies. (5) What action will the Government take to bring funding in both States to the same level.",67
77,Mr WILLIS ,CLASSES OF SOVIET NAVAL WARSHIPS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) (a) Yes. (b) No. The figure contained in the report is486. (3) (a) Yes. (b) Yes. (4) The primary reason for the imbalance between the CYSS funds allocated to Queensland and Tasmania is the practice adopted by the former Government, from the Scheme's inception, of allocating funds on the basis of submissions received and without particular attention to the need for an equitable spread based on the distribution of youth unemployment. An additional factor that has contributed to the disparities in funding between the two States is the comparatively large number of small CYSS projects established in Tasmania to serve relatively isolated communities. (5) The Government is aware that, historically, both Queensland and New South Wales have been relatively disadvantaged in respect of the availability of CYSS services, but it does not propose to redress the imbalance by decreasing the current funding to CYSS projects iri Tasmania or to those in other States or Territories. It has, however, been possible to move in a limited way towards reducing inequities between States, by allocating funds set aside over the last two years for new projects, upgrading existing projects and special of each State's share of youth unemployment. The future distribution of CYSS funds between the States is receiving detailed consideration in the context of the current consultations concerning the Kirby Committee's recommendations including the possible establishment of an Australian Youth Service. Subject, of course, to the outcome of those consultations, both Queensland and New South Wales will be given priority in the allocation.of any funds subsequently provided for new projects and for upgrading existing projects. By this means, and over time we will be able to achieve substantially greater equity in the allocation of CYSS funds. Pensions: Assets Test of Funds . (Question No. 824) (Question No. 823) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 19 April 1985: What is (a) the number and (b) the percentage of (i) pensioners, and (ii) pensioners who own a farming property, who will have their pensions affected by the pensioner assets test.",68
78,Mr HOWE ,CLASSES OF SOVIET NAVAL WARSHIPS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . (I) (a) and (b) As at the end of March 1985 54,275 Social Security pensions had been cancelled or reduced as a result of the assets test. This represented 2.6 per cent of Social Security pensioners as at 8 March 1985. The comparable figures for repatriation service pensions paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs were 12,739 and 3.3 per cent. (2) (a) and (b) The information requested in respect of pensioners owning a farming property is not available because many pensioners whose pensions were cancelled under the assets test did not disclose either the nature or amount of their assets. However, the following statistics are available for Social Security pensioners who were affected by the assets test conversion on 8 March 1985 for implementation on pay day 21 March 1985. Number Cancelled Self cancelled .18,751 Cancelled on assessment* With farm ** 4,253 Without farm 5,840 10,093 Total Cancelled 28,844 Number Reduced* With farm ** 5,000 Without farm 17,494 Total Reduced 22,494 * In these cases, the pensioners supplied details of their assets holdings. ** Includes farms, market gardens and hobby farms. At 8 March 1985 there were 2,052,607 Social Security pensioners. The comparable figues are not available for repatriation service pensioners. Family Income Supplement initiative grants, on the basis (Question No. 830) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 22 April 1985: Is it a fact that for eligibility for family income supplement the gross family income must be not more than $219 per week; if so, how does this cater for a small business or farming family whose gross income exceeds this figure but which is exceeded by its cost, thus creating a negative income to support the family.",68
79,Mr HOWE ,CLASSES OF SOVIET NAVAL WARSHIPS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Family income supplement (FIS) is an income tested non-taxable allowance of up to $14 a week for each child under 16 or dependent full-time student aged 16-24 inclusive. The maximum rate of FIS is payable only where parental income does not exceed a prescribed limit which is currently $223 a week. This limit is increased each May and November in line with CPI changes. Where parental income exceeds the prescribed limit, the maximum rate is reduced by one half of the excess income. Thus, the level of income at which FIS ceases to be payable is higher than the prescribed limit by $28 a week for each child. Income is defined in the Social Security Act as ' . . . personal earnings, moneys, valuable consideration or profits earned, derived or received by that person for his own use or benefit by any means from any source. .'. In assessing income of a ance is made for costs incl,lrred in running the business. Hume Highway: Dual Carriageway Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 22 April 1985: (I) Has the original target date for the completion of a dual carriageway four-lane Hume Highway between Sydney and Melbourne, of 1988, now been abandoned. (2) What is the current target date for the completion of the carriageway. (3) Why has progress on this project been slower in New South Wales than Victoria in pro rata terms. EmptyHere able member's question is as follows: (I) It is the Federal Government's objective to achieve a minimum four-lane standard on the Sydney-Melbourne National Highway by 1988, the Bicentennial year. Accordingly, I have advised my State counterparts in New South Wales and Victoria that this is the Federal Government's first priority for the National Highway network. Achievement of this objective will depend on a number of factors. the most important being movements in construction costs, the speedy resolution of possible environmental problems, and design and engineering capacity constraints. (2) Completion to dual carriageway standard throughout the entire length of the Sydney-Melbourne National Highway will not be undertaken the basis of traffic volumes. (3) The rate of progress in New South Wales and Victoria has been similar in terms of length of new dual carriageway constructed to date. As at December 1984, the length of dual carriageway in Victoria was 160 km and in New South Wales 159 km. As the section of the National Highway in Victoria is considerably shorter than that in New South Wales, Victoria has less dual carriageway work to ,finish. Considerable progress has been achieved in New South Wales, despite rugged terrain with its consequent implications for both speed and cost of construction. Albury-Wodonga By-Pass (Question No. 834) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 22 April 1985: (I) Was, 1988 the original target date for the completion of the Albury-Wodonga by-pass under the National Highway Program; (2) Is it a fact that the main section of the Wodonga part of the by-pass has now been completed but the Albury part is still only in the planning stage. (3) What is the current target date for the completion of the Albury by-pass and will necessary federal funding be available upon completion of all planning and design work. EmptyHere business, allowable member's question is as follows: (I) No. The Federal Government's objective is to achieve a minimum four-lane standard on the SydneyMelbourne National Highway by 1988.' Most of the (Question No. 833) present highway through Albury /Wodonga is four-lane standard and there are some sections of dual carriageway. (2) Yes. (3) It is proposed that Albury will be by-passed. However, the exact timing and route for this have not yet been determined. A Fedenil/State/Local Government Committee comprising officers of the Federal Department of Transport, the New South Wales Department of Main Roads, Victorian Road Construction Authority, Albury Wodonga Development Corporation and Councils of Albury and Wodonga has been examining the bypass options. Hydraulic investigations have been completed and four possible routes are to be considered. The Federal Government will consider construction and funding of the by-pass in the context of its overall national highway objectives in due course. Hume Highway Expenditure (Question No. 836) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 22 April 1985: What amount has been expended by the Federal Government on the Hume Highway between Sydney and Melbourne in each year since 1970. EmptyHere able member's question is as follows: Year Expenditure until it can be justified on ($m) 1974-75 32.782 1975-76 45.486 1976-77 53.521 1977-78 61.744 1978-79 59.979 1979-80 64.225 1980-81 63.274 1981-82 50.027 1982-83 61.096 1983-84 102.769 The Federal Government established the national highway system in 1974 and the H ume Highway was declared a National Highway in that year. Prior to that date the Federal Government was not involved in funding specific roads or roadworks. Expenditure on the Hume Highway by the Federal Government from 1970 to 1974 is, therefore, not seperately identified. Electorate of Wan non: Pensions Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 22 April 1985: (I) How many pensions in the electoral division of Wannon to the date of the answer to this question have been (a) reduced and (b) cancelled as a result of the introduction of the assets test.

Papua New Guinea: Canned Meat Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 7 May 1985: (I) Has a ban been applied to imports of some canned meat products into Papua New Guinea. (2) What was the value of Australian exports of canned meat to PNG over each of the last 3 years and what proportion of total Australian canned meat exports do these exports represent. (3) What action has he taken to develop market opportunities for the products no longer entering PNG. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1982-83 1983-84 1984-85 (to Mar 1985) * Canned ham excluded, not covered by bans Source: ABS Foreign Trade Statistics (3) The primary responsibility for identifying export marketing opportunities for meat and livestock, including canned meat products, and for developing industry marketing strategies rests with the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC). I have written to the Chairman of the AMLC advising him of my concern and suggesting that the AMLC should investigate alternate market prospects. The AMLC is about to commence operations under its first approved corporate plan with the emphasis on the marketing of meat and meat products in Australia and overseas. I have also drawn the attention of the AMLC to the trade facilitation activities of the Department of Trade, who have offered full support for marketing initiatives. Export Market Development Grants Scheme Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Trad-, upon notice, ori 7 May 1985: (I) The Papua New Guinea Government has announced the imposition of bans on the import of certain canned meat products as part of an agreement reached with James Barnes Pty Ltd for that company to establish a meat cannery in Madang. The bans on canned meat products have not yet been applied, but are planned to come into effect from the start-up date of the cannery, scheduled for June 1986, as follows - from June 1986 for 8 years, to apply to corned mutton and corned beef (Question No. 865) - from December 1986 for 7.5 years, to apply to noncorned beef, non-corned mutton, meat with vegetables, meat with cereals. Prior to implementation of the import bans, import quotas will. be imposed on individual importers based on performance by the importers during the 1983 year. Quotas will be phased in, commencing as soon as administrative arrangements can be finalised and reducing by 25-50 per cent depending on product for the 6 month period immediately before the ban takes effect on the respective product.

(2) What was the value of each grant and to whom was it paid? Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The first year that the statistics sought by the honourable member were kept by the Export Development Grants Board was for the 1982-83 Grant Year on EMDG claims determined during FY 1983-84. These statistics are shown in the latest (9th) Annual Report of the Export Development Grants Board for the year 1983-84. (Question No. 866) That report shows that there were total EMD grants determined for all industry categories of $83.95 million for the 1982-83 Grant Year, and the value of grants to primary industry were recorded asUnprocessed primary products-agricultural and pastoral (6.4 of total grants determined) Processed primary products-agricultural and pastoral (15.3 of total grants determined) Other processed primary products (1.1 of total grants determined) . . . .. Total (approximately 22.8 per cent of total grants determined) It should be noted that the total grants determined of $83.95m for Grant Year 1982-83, shown in the 9th Annual Report covered 3325 claims, which were only a little more than half of the total 6535 claims registered for 1982-83 for assessment. Moreover some EMDG claimants export mixed eligible goods and services and in these cases it is not possible to differentiate between what proportion of the grant determined was attributable to primary products exports. (2) The appendices to the EDGB Annual Report include details of the amount of grant paid to each individual claimant. There is, however, no classification or break-up which allows determination of whether the claimant fell into the primary industry category. Australian Bicentennial Roads Development Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 7 May 1985: (1) What are the (a) location of works, (b) successful tenderers, (c) project cost and (d) completion or projected completion dates for each contract let under the Australian Bicentennial Roads Development program. (2) Has the tender and contract system worked to the satisfaction of the Minister; if not, what are the deficiences of this system. (3) What action has been taken to assess the cost/ benefits to the tender and contract system in road construction compared with the day labour system. (4) If no effort has been made to compile such a valuation, why has the Government failed to do so. EmptyHere able member's question is as follows: (I) Under the current administrative procedures the States are not required to supply the Federal Government with the detailed contract information sought. The States are required to provide statistics on tenders received and contracts awarded for road works to private contractors, State Government Authorities and Local Government Authorities by road category and contract value on a yearly basis. This information is available in the ABRD Annual Report (ref. Appendix 7, 1983/84 Annual Report). (2) The Government acknowledges the merit of the general principle of calling tenders for road construction work. The major deficiences which existed in the system at the time the Hawke Government came to office resulted from the legislative requirements developed by the previous Government. All Federally funded national road construction works and all arterial road construction works funded under the ABRD Program were required to be put to tender, with no be waived in circumstances where. calling of tenders was either impractical or not cost effective. These deficiencies have been substantially overcome by $5.37m amendments to the Roads Grants Act and Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Act which $12.84m provide for the requirement to call tenders to be waived in circumstances where a State satisfied the Federal Minister $O.92m that $19.13m - there is an emergency requirement for works to be undertaken - the works are so minor that invitation of tenders would involve undue additional cost - it would not be practical to prepare adequate tender specifications - or competitive tenders would be unlikely to be received. (3) and (4) The effective use of public funds requires the States and Local Government to maintain viable day labour forces to ensure that they can undertake works which are urgent or for which suitable contractors either do not tender or do not submit competitive bids. The Government therefore sees the tender and contract and day labour force arrangements as complementary rather than mutually exclusive. In these circumstances the Government considers that no useful purpose would be Program served by undertaking a formal comparative assessment of (Question No. 869) the costs/benefits of tender and contract system as against the day labour system. Commonwealth Vehicles: Department of Trade (Question No. 902) Mr Cadman asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 7 May 1985: (I) With respect to the garaging of Commonwealth vehicles at officers' places ofresidence, is any officer permitted to use the allotted vehicle on other than work days, that is, at times when the officer is not on duty. (2) In the case of a vehicle garaged in the Australian Capital Territory, may the officer use the vehicle for recreation purposes outside the Territory. (3) Has the Minister's Department or any statutory authority reporting to the Minister issued guidelines for the use of these vehicles; if so, what are the terms of the guidelines. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Permission has not been given to any officer to use an allotted vehicle except in the course of duty. (2) Allotted vehicles may not be used for recreational purposes. (3) Officers having allotted vehicles have been issued with the Department of Local Government and Administrative Services booklet 'Rules for the Use of Official Motor Transport and Procedures of the Central Transport Authority' and instructed to utilise vehicles in conformity with those rules. Commonwealth Vehicles: Department of Defence (Question No. 905) provision for the requirement to Mr Cadman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 7 May 1985: (I) With respect to the garaging of Commonwealth vehicles at officers' places of residence, is any officer permitted to use the allotted vehicle on other than work days, that is, at times when the officer is not on duty. (2) In the case of a vehicle garaged in the A.C.T., may the officer use the vehicle for recreation purposes outside the Territory. (3) Has the Minister's Department or any statutory authority reporting to the Minister issued guidelines for the use of these vehicles; if so, what are the terms of the guidelines.",71
86,Mr BEAZLEY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. (2) No. (3) The Department follows the rules issued by the Department of Local Government and Administrative Services, i.e. 'Rules for the Use of Official Motor Transport and Procedures of the Central Transport Authority' (CTA). Instructions are currently in preparation to complement the rules. The Secretary of the Department has issued guidelines for the use of official vehicles by senior officers in the following terms: (i) Nominated senior officers may garage official CT A self-drive vehicles at their residences (except when on leave or otherwise absent from Canberra) and should note the requirements that such vehicles are to be securely parked behind the property line and not left in the street and are not to be driven by other than a properly authorised person. (ii) Nominated officers may use official vehicles to travel between their residences and places of business. (iii) Having regard to the fact that personal or family commitments may overlap if senior officers are to discharge their official responsibilities effectively, nominated officers, may on working days, for example, use official vehicles for purposes such as the following:. (a) for lunch-time shopping and for attendance at medical and dental appointments; (b) to transport children to and from schools and for similar purposes; and also to (c) transport all classes of persons whose carriage would be able to withstand the test of being in the overall interest of the Commonwealth. (iv) It would also be appropriate for nominated officers to use the and their spouses to and from official functions and functions attended because of the official positions they hold.

However the following general information in re(Question No_ 989) lation to the valuation of assets may be of some assistance. (a) generally, in accordance with the emphasis on pensioner self-assessment, the pensioners' estimates of the value of their assets (other than real estate) were accepted. Those cases where the pensioners' estimates of real estate values (other than the home) were required to be checked were referred to the professional valuers of the Valuations Branch of the Australian Taxation Office; (b) the valuations were based on information provided by the pensioner on the Statement of Assets form recent sales information for the area information provided by statutory authorities local knowledge of the area external inspections; (c) prior to the initial implementation of the assets test valuers were directed not to enter any property for the purpose of valuation. Valuers may now (Question No. 996) carry out on-site inspections only where the prior written permission of the pensioner has been obtained. Under no circumstances will valuers enter pensioners' homes. larger than 2 hectares, America's Cup Defence (Question No. 1000) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 8 May 1985: (1) What amount has the Government committed or already spent in connection with the America's Cup defence. . (2) How is this money being raised and on what is it being spent. (3) What are the roles of (a) the America's Cup Secretariat, (b) the inter-government Committee on the America's Cup Defence and (c) any other Government body associated with the America's Cup defence. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Commonwealth has committed $30m over the 1984-85 and next two financial years for community infrastructure and service projects which will not only maximise the benefits and minimise the detrimental effects of the staging of the America's Cup on the local community but also provide facilities of long term An amount of $6m is expected to be spent on these projects in 1984-85. (2) The Commonwealth's assistance is being made available by way of the Annual Appropriation Acts. Funds for disbursement in 1984-85 have been appropriated under Division 866-02, Appropriation Act (No.2) 1984-85. Projects for which funds have been made available include: commissioning a number of urgent studies on the likely impact of the Cup defence such as the expect-d visitor influx on local infrastructure and services; providing adequate accommodation, and in particular increasing the stock of public housing, to ensure that those in need w;ll not be forced to seek accommodation elsewhere at a time of high housing demand in and around Fremantle; improvements in transport and pedestrian facilities; the protection and enhancement of the National Estate; and development of appropriate community facilities and services. The Commonwealth's continuing concern will be directed towards the severe and unequal demands which the Cup defence might place on community facilities and services. (3) (a) The America's Cup secretariat, styled the America's Cup Support Group, provides a focus and point of contact for Commonwealth involvement in America's Cup matters. In addition to the development of an appropriate financial assistance program, the Support Group seeks to ensure that, on America's Cup matters, effective consultation is maintained between Commonwealth and State departments and authorities, local government and community groups. (b) The Intergovernmental Committee on America's Cup Matters seeks to ensure the fu llest co-operation and co-ordination between Commonwealth, State and local government. The Committee reflects the legitimate concern of all three levels of government for the consequences which will arise from the staging of an event of national and international significance. The direct involvement of the Fremantle City Council recognises the particular concerns it will have in dealing with a wide range of activities and developments in this regard. (c) A wide range of Commonwealth agencies-for example those responsible for customs, immigration, aviation, communications-have in the discharge of their ongoing responsibilities, become involved in America's Cup matters. The Commonwealth is committed to ensuring that this involvement is appropriate and effective.

Queensland Mines Ltd: Payout (Question No. 1111) Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, upon notice, on 15 May 1985: (I) What is the breakdown of the first payment of (Question No. 1042) $32m to Queensland Mines to ensure the ban on uranium exports to France remains intact. (2) Has the 20 per cent devaluation of the Australian dollar affected the payout; if so, what is the current total estimated payout to Queensland Mines. (3) How many shipments does the $32m cover. Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for .Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: ( I) and (3) The $32m is to cover the purchase of five one hundred short ton shipments of uranium from $ Queensland Mines Ltd.

Electromagnetic Rail Gun Mr Staples asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 26 February, 1985: (I) What are the expected applications of the electromagnetic rail gun research now in train in Australia. (2) What countries will (a) have access and (b) be denied access to results of this research. (3) Has the Government joined United States allegations of a Soviet breach of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty or any treaty on strategic or mass destruction weapons; if so, on what evidence. (4) Has the Government told the USA of its attitude to the US Strategic Defence Initiative (SOl) as a qualitative escalation of space weapons and the relevance of international disarmament and arms control obligations, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations of the superpowers, if so, in what terms. (5) Has the Government supported President Mitterrand's claims (a) that militarisation of space should be stopped by treaty and (b) that SOl is over-arming. (6) Has Australia supported the Vatican's call for a convention on the uses of space as a global heritage similar to the Law of the Sea Convention; if not, why not. (7) Can he say whether US Defence Secretary, Mr Weinberger, described MutuaUy Assured Destruction (MAD) as a disproven strategic dogma to be discarded in favour of SOl; if so, does this remove a key basis for Australia's tolerance of the Central Intelligence Agency's control of the joint defence facility at Pine Gap.",79
107,Mr HAYDEN ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Australia's involvement in research in electromagnetic rail gun technology arose in the late 1970s out of and interest in the possible applications of rail gun technologies for use by the Australian Defence Forces in nonnuclear tactical weapons, such as anti-tank weapons for the Army; and subsequently for their potential for the defence of ships against surface skimming missiles. No other applications are envisaged by Australia. (2) All information generated by Australian rail gun research has been unclassified and is available through the normal scientific channels used to convey such information. As such it is freely available to all countries. (3) No. Australia has examined the United States allegations and will continue to do so. Such conclusions as Australia may reach from time to time will be expressed independently. (4) Australia's attitude to SOl has not been expressed in those terms. Australia is concerned over the possible implications of SOl and the comparable Soviet research program for arms control and for the maintenance of a strategic balance between the superpowers. This view has been expressed publicly and privately on many occasions. During his February visit to Washington the Prime Minister said explicitly that Australia does not endorse the United States Strategic Defence Initiative. Similar Australian concerns have' also been registered with the Soviet Union which is believed to be undertaking its own research into technologies for use in a possible system of ballistic missile defence. The Government has also made known to the nuclear weapons States, particularly the superpowers, on a number of occasions, its concern that they should do everything in their power to adher y to their (Question No. 81) international disarmament and arms control obligations, including those under the ABM Treaty, and where relevant those acquired under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. (5) (a) President Mitterrand's view that there should be international agreements to prevent an Arms Race in Outer Space coincides with the-views expressed by Australia on many occasions. (b) As indicated above, Australia has expressed - on­ cern that both United States and Soviet research programs should not lead to deployments of new weapons that would negate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The remarks attributed to President Mitterand would seem to be in the same sense. (6) I am not aware that the Vatican has called explicitly for a convention on the uses of space as a global heritage similar to the Law of the Sea Convention. It is the case however that the Vatican has called for an international treaty to prevent a spiral of competitive deployment of weapons in space in order to ensure the continual availability to all nations of the benefits of space exploration and exploitation, and to preserve the contribution to international security and national security made by existing satellite systems and those which might augment them. The Government fully supports the sentiments and objectives of the Vatican's call, which was outlined most recently in the conclusions of a study week on the impact of space exploration on mankind held by the Pontifical Academy of Science from 1-5 October 1984; but the Government is not convinced that it will prove practical for these worthwhile objectives to be achieved through a single multilateral instrument. Both bilateral and multilateral agreements will almost certainly be necessary, as was recognised by the Vatican when it stated, in the context of its treaty call, that 'the necessity for an eventual ternational multilateral agreement should not delay an urgently needed bilateral agreement to this end between the two leading space powers'. The Government places great importance on the prevention of an arms race in outer space and Australian Ministers have called repeatedly for negotiations towards agreement on outer space arms control. As the Prime Minister stated on 6 November 1984 we see the militarisation of outer space as a development fraught with great risk and uncert<tinty. The Government is working hard in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva for the prevention of an arms race in outer space and welcomes the recent decision by the Conference to establish an Ad Hoc Committee to examine outer space arms control issues. It is also working actively to promote the peaceful uses of outer space in the United Nations Committee in New York established for that purpose. I would note further that the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies, which Australia ratified on 10 October 1967, already provides that outer space, including the moon and subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means (Article II). The Treaty also and use of outer space 'shall be the province of all mankind' (Article I). The Treaty provides that the use of space shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, economic or scientific development. (7) I am not aware Of the United States Defense Secretary, . Mr Weinberger, having used the precise words attributed to him in the question. However, the Secretary and other United States officials from President Reagan down have said on many occasions that their motivation in pursuing SOl is to explore the possibility that defensive weapons may, over the next few decades, make it possible to replace deterrence based on the threat of mutually assured destruction with a preferable basis for security. The Australian Government does not doubt the sincerity of this motivation. Australian policy also aims at replacing deterrence based on the threat of mutual destruction with a preferable basis for security but has not endorsed SOl as the means to this end. The Australian Government believes that the maintenance of a stable deterrence is an essential precondition for progress towards disarmament, in particular for deep cuts in the high stockpiles of nuclear weapons, and does not believe it would be possible to abandon deterrence before a preferable basis for security is in place. Its position in relation to the Australia-United States Joint Facilities remains as previously stated, notably by the Prime Minister to Parliament on 6 June 1984. Canberra and District Racing and Sporting . Broadcasters Limited (Question No. 121) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 28 February 1985; (1) Is the involvement of II government statutory authority in public broadcasting contrary to the spirit of the 1978 'Guidelines for the Planning of Public Broadcasting in Phase I'. (2) Can he say whether the broadcasting service inproposed by Canberra and District Racing and Sporting Broadcasters Limited will encourage gambling among young people, in view of the imposition by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal that this company must provide all necessary assistance for the production and presentation of programs by junior sporting organisations. (3) Is FM intended to be an appropriate medium for the spoken word for racing calls and sports commentaries.",80
108,Mr DUFFY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal discussed this issue at length in its published Report into the Grant of a Category S Public Broadcasting Station Licence to service the Canberra Statistical District, para 11.29 to 11.63. In essence the Tribunal concluded that the extent of the involvement of the ACT Gaming and Liquor Authority in the applicant group, Canberra and District Racing and Sporting Broadcasters 'does not warrant the disqualification of CDRSB from holding a licence'. other celestial bodies, is not (2) No. There would seem to be no basis for this interpretation of the Tribunal's decision. provides that the exploration (3) FM is suitable for providing a range of different radio services, whether in spoken or mixed forin. It is a fact that FM has come to be associated with music in Australia because of the excellent quality of stereo transirrespective of their degree of missions. It should however be noted that the particular propagation characteristics of FM mean that a service can be tailored to serve the intended area, unlike AM, which is subject to the 'skywave' effect. For this reason FM frequencies can be allocated in a number of different places without causing unacceptable interference. The public broadcasting sector has been developed largely on FM, with only five of the existing 53 stations broadcasting onAM. Department of Communications: Film and Video",81
109,Mr CONNOLLY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 21 March 1985: (I) What arrangements does the Minister's Department make for the production of films and videos for both internal and external use.

(5) How many officers are employed in this area within the Minister's Department and what are their salaries.",82

(2) No. (3) One (a) HACBSS: The Missing Link. (b) production cost: $64,375. (4) At present, no film/video production equipment is held by my Department. (5) The Department does not employ any officers directly in the production of films/videos. Those that are produced with the assistance of Film Australia form part of the overall duties of the Information and Public Relations Section. Department of Communications: Union",82
111,Mr RUDDOCK ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 26 March 1985: (I) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a memorandum, dated I June 1984, to all permanent heads, heads of statutory authorities and staff organisations from the Secretary of the Public Service Board, concerning encouragement of union membership. (2) Was the memorandum brought to the attention of all staff in the Minister's Department and all statutory authorities reporting to the Minister; if so, how and on What dates. (3) What additional action has been taken within the Minister's Department and statutory authorities reporting to the Minister to avoid delays in constructive action being taken to encourage union membership and on what dates; if no additional action has been taken, what are the reasons for such a decision.",82
112,Mr DUFFY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based in part on advice received from the statutory authorities within the Communications portfolio, is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The Department of Communications-A DepartProduction mental Staff Circular was sent to all staff on 20 June 1984 outlining the Public Service memorandum and giving de(Question No. 277) tails of workplace delegates for each union in Central Office. The memorandum was also copied to all state offices with all managers requested to ensure workplace delegates were identified for all staff. Australian Telecommunications Commission-The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations referred the Public Service Board's Circular to Telecom on 20 June 1984 indicating that Telecom may care to use the circular as a guide in determining appropriate action to be taken in respect of union membership. Australian Postal Commission-The Public Service Board memorandum of 1 June 1984 was received by Australia Post shortly after its issue. A further copy of the memorandum was provided by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations on 20 June 1984. Australian Broadcasting Corporation-See (3) below. Special Broadcasting Service-The substance of the PSB Memorandum, together with the listing of all relevant Unions, their addresses, telephone numbers and contact officers, was brought to the attention of all staff via the medium of an Office Circular distributed on 27 June, 1984. Australian Broadcasting Tribunal-Yes. A detailed 'Staff Bulletin' was issued to all staff on 27 July 1984. The Overseas Telecommunications Commission and AUSSAT Pty Ltd Ltd have no record of having received the memorandum from the Public Service Board. The Department has now forwarded a copy of the memorandum to OTC and AUSSA T and asked that it be brought to the attention of all staff. (3) The Department of Communications-Workplace delegates are invited to present sessions on union membership on all induction courses run for new staff joining the Department. Membership As the Australian Public Service Association (APSA) (Question No. 436) had no workplace delegate in the Central Office of the Department, an arrangement was made for a representative of the APSA ACT Branch Office to visit the Department to provide information on the Association. The meeting took place on 22 June 1984. As a result an APSA workplace delegate was appointed and joined the Staff Consultative Committee. Australian Telecommunications CommissionTelecom has a long standing policy of encouraging staff to join and participate in union activities. This encouragement ranges from induction of new staff when they are informed of Telecom's encouragement of union membership, to access by union officials to training courses to promote and pUblicise union activities. Telecom is also developing procedures which will assist workplace representatives to identify persons who are eligible to be members of a staff organisation. Telecom understands that the Public Service Board is developing further advice on positive action to be taken to encourage union membership, and has promised to provide Telecom with a copy of that advice. On receipt, Telecom will examine the Board's advice and, where appropriate, initiate additional encouragement programs and provide the necessary advice to staff.' . Australian Postal Commission-Australia Post has always supported the existence of unionism within the enterprise and encourages its staff to take a responsible and active part in their union activities. For example, new staff are provided with relevant information on available Staff Organisations and their representatives, the facility of payroll deduction of union dues is available, and staff can apply for paid leave to attend Trade Union Training Authority (TUTA) courses. Australia Post is currently considering whether further action may be taken to encourage/facilitate union membership. It will consider also any initiative resulting from the current discussions between the Public Service Board and the ACTU on the guidelines detailing minimum measures to be taken to encourage employees to join the appropriate union. Australian Broadcasting Corporation-Employees have the option of becoming members of the following unions, depending on their eligibility: (a) The Musicians' Union of Australia-All members of ABC Orchestras are members of this union. (b) Australian Journalists' Association-For employees in the News, Public Affairs (Radio) and (Television) and Rural Departments. (c) ABC Staff Union and ABC Senior Officers' Association-Optional for staff covered by Determination 4 of 1948 and Determination II of 1959 respectively. No specific action has been taken to encourage union membership following receipt of the memorandum dated I June, 1984. However, significant opportunities exist, and are utilised, for the ABC Staff Association to seek members. Encouragement occurs: (a) by deduction of union dues from salary; (b) the Staff Union is invited to send a representative to address induction courses; (c) new recruits are given application forms for the Staff Union membership; (d) accommodation is provided for Staff Union Branch offices. In the end, of course, ABC staff are free to - ake their own personal choice about union membership. Company Directories (Australia) Pty Ltd E. H. O'Brien Volt Information Sciences Inc. (Intending to trade as 'Australian Directory Services') Special Broadcasting Service-By way of additional action on industrial democracy, the SBS has since established a position of Industrial Officer, and Consultative Committees between Management and Unions have been set up in the various elements of the organisation. Australian Broadcasting Tribunal-Staff have been advised of the name and location of workplace Delegates. Overseas Telecommunications Commission-Specific initiatives to en<;:ourage union membership have been agreed with unions covering Commission staff. Further initiatives are being considered and will also be the subject of discussion with the unions. Telecom Australia: Yellow Pages (Question No. 489) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: (I) Which companies presently hold the Telecom Australia Yellow Pages and other directory contracts and for what period have the contracts been held. (2) Who are the beneficial owners of these companies and what is the percentage of Australian ownership. (3) Which companies responded to advertisements in 1983 and registered interest for the right to tender for the new series of contracts. (4) Which companies were subsequently invited to tender. (5) What were the criteria used by Telecom to determine which companies would be invited to tender. (6) Was Australian ownership one of these criteria; if so, which of the tenderers are Australian-owned. (7) What is the present situation concerning the contracts.",82
113,Mr DUFFY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission, is as follows: (I) It is assumed this question relates to the sole right to sell advertisements for inclusion in Telecom's Yellow Pages and other business directories. The details requested are as follows: Contract period for books Territory Directory Published from All States except N.S.W. Yellow Pages 1.7.81 to 30.6.86 Community Phone Books commencing 1982 to 30.6.86 All States Australian Business 1.7.84 to 30.6.86 Communications Directories (ABCD) N.S.W. Yellow Pages 1.7.81 to 30.6.91 All States except N.S.W. Yellow Pages 1.7.86 to 30.6.91 Community Phone Books 1.7.86 to 30.6.91 ABCD 1.7.86 to 30.6.91 (2) Directories (Aust) Pty Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of GTE· Directories Corporation incorporated in the United States of America. E. H. O'Brien Pty Ltd has a 51 per cent Australian ownership. The remaining shareholding is owned by Teledirect, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Canada Enterprises incorporated in Canada. Australian Directory Services is a partnership whose beneficial owners are Volt Information Sciences and South Western Bell Publications, both incorporated in the USA. (3) and (4) Telecom would not wish to supply company names as requested. Over the years, the 'public tender' system of purchasing goods and/or services has been a secure and highly ethical arrangement and very successful. This success· is due, in the main, to Telecom treating each and every tender submitted on a strictly 'Commercial-in-Confidence' basis. Provision of the company names requested would represent a departure from this well established policy of confidentiality. (5) (a) Possession of adequate financial resources to fund the contracted undertaking. (b) Proven ability to undertake and successfully manage a selJing task of the magnitude and complexity involved. (c) A reputable company, the engagement of which would not compromise Telecom's market position. (d) Security of the commercially valuable information which is issued in conjunction with the invitation to tender. (6) Whilst Australian ownership was not included specifically in the selection criteria, Telecom seeks, as a general principle in all of its contractual activities, to maximise Australian involvement but not to the exclusion of other considerations. The tendering process for Yellow Pages and other business directory contracts has followed the approach usually taken by Telecom of seeking offers on the world market. To date, the only viable offers for these contracts have been received from companies which have varying degrees of overseas ownership. (7) See reply to (I). Contracts have now been issued as follows: E. H. O'Brien for New South Wales; Volt Information Sciences Inc (Intending to trade as Australian Directory Services) for all States except New South Wales. Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Science Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: (I) How many books have been reviewed and people interviewed, on any of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation television or radio science programs which are (a) against and (b) in favour of nuclear power or armaments. (2) Is it a fact that there have been no reviews or interviews in favour of nuclear power or armaments up to 27 March 1985; if this is not so, what reviews and interviews have taken place.",83
114,Mr DUFFY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"Based on information supplied by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the answer to the honourable member's question is provided below. In the past, I have expressed my reluctance to request the ABC to provide information on questions which, like this one, generate the need for considerable time and cost in compiling the information. In this case, the ABC has provided that information which could be col· lected within reasonable limits: . The ABC does not categorise its programs into 'pro' or 'anti' uranium but prefprs to leave this subjective judgment to its viewers and listeners. Programs are not made with the intention of being either for or against any issue. During 1983-84, the following books on the subject of nuclear power or disarmament were reviewed on the ABC radio program, Science Bookshop: I Remember Hiroshima by Stephen Kelen; interview with the author. The Arms Race and Arms Control by Franac Jackaby; interview by Wendy Barnaby. Defence Without the Bomb by Michael Randle of the Department of Peace Studies; United Kingdom; interview with the author. There are no book review programs on ABC Television. Australian Broadcasting Corporation Management in Tasmania (Question No. 493) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: (I) Is it a fact that the Australian BroadcastiJ-g Corporation management in Tasmania has sought an assurance from the Tasmanian· Attorney-General that any ABC employee claiming employment benefits because of a homosexual liaison or preference, will not be prosecuted; if so, has a reply been received and what was the Attorney-General's response. (2) Have similar requests been made by the ABC in Queensland and Western Australia.",84
115,Mr DUFFY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has advised me that the ABC management in Tasmania sought advice from the Tasmanian Attorney-General on Programs extending staff entitlements and benefits to homosexual (Question No. 492) staff. However, the Attorney-General declined to give advice stating that his advice is reserved for the Tasmanian Government. (2) No. TX20 Telex Machines (Question No. 494) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Communi"" cations, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: (1) What has happened to the availability ahd installation of model TX20 telex machines from Telecom, ordered in October 1983. (2) How many of these machines (a) were ordered, at what advance payment to Telecom and; (b) were delivered and when. (3) What is the present position of people who ordered TX20 machines and have no\ received them.",84
116,Mr DUFFY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The ansWer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission, is as follows: (I) All orders by customers in October 1983 for TX20 telex machines have been satisfied. (2) Considerable resources would be required to provide this information on an Australia wide basis and, in light of the reply to (I) above, could not be justified. However, Telecom would be pleased to provide the information for any particular orders the honourable member may have in mind. (3) See reply to (I). Union of Soyiet Socialist Republics: Tampering Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: (I) Has his attention' been of United Soviet Socialist Republic officials, contrary to the Universal Postal Convention, tampering with relief parcels from Australia for the families of imprisoned Ukranian dissidents. (2) What protests have been made about this alleged interference with the mail.",85
117,Mr DUFFY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Postal Commission, is as follows: (I) Yes. Allegations'have been made by the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations concerning the denial of relief parcels from Australian citizens to individuals in the Ukraine. (2) None. I am not aware of any evidence of USSR officials tampering with mail sent to the USSR. Any claims that the contents of articles sent through the post are not received by addressees are examined on a case by case basis. Telecom: Mobile Phones Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Communicat,ions, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: EmptyHere Managing Director, that Telecom will provide a single national cellular network mean that no private cellular mobile phone companies will be allowed to compete with Telecom; if so, (a) did Telecom consult with him or the Government on this matter and (b) why should mobile phones be treated differently to paging systems; if not, what competition will be allowed. MrDuffy-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: EmptyHere Telecom.will be the sole provider of the network infrastructure for cellular mobile telephone services in Australia. (a) Telecom has consulted with me si-ce early 1984 on the matter and I have accepted the foregoing position as falling within ,Telecom's role for providing public telecommunications services. (b) Telecom's policy will allow for private companies to compete in the sale, installation and maintenance of cellular mobile telephone units, resulting in a strong element of competition in this area and customer choice on a range of equipment. In addition, a level of local manufacture will be required for both the proposed high capacity cellular mobile telephone systems and the mobile telephone units sold in Australia, thus ensuring that additional employment opportunities will accompany this new and developing technology. Telecom: Stereo Teleyision Programs (Question No. 512) with Mail Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: (Question No. 499) Are there any outstanding applications by television companies with Telecom for bearer capacity for the transmission of stereo television programs; if so, (a) who made the applications and (b) when were they made. drawn to the alleged practice",85
118,Mr DUFFY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission, is as follows: No. Telecom is, however, working with the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to evaluate stereo sound transmission techniques. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Question No. 516) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: How will the Australian Broadcasting Corporation implement the recent decision to provide travel and other financial incentives to the homosexual 'spouse' of an ABC employee in Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland, where male homosexual activity is a crime.",85
119,Mr DUFFY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Aus(Question No. 501) tralian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows: The extension of staff benefits and entitlements to eligible ABC staff will occur on a case by case. basis, with each case being treated and determined on its merits. All relevant considerations, including the laws of each State and Territory, will be taken into account in determining the grant of extension of entitlements. Extending entitlements is, in any event, not automatic. Telecom: Business Communications Systems (Question No. 517) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: (I) Is Telecom now selling, or about to sell, business communications systems, including Local Area Networks, which go beyond Telecom's earlier involvement with PABXs. (2) How many people and at what salaries (a) have been employed to 27 March 1985 and (b) will be employed to sell these systems.",85
120,Mr DUFFY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission, is as follows: (I) Since its inception Telecom has been in the business communications systems market through its various products such as PABXs, teleprinters, small business systems, premium telephones and, more recently, Viatel and ComputerPhone. Telecom has no immediate plans to include Local Area Networks in its product range. (2) Having regard to the wide range of products and services handled by Telecom's sales staff on an Australia wide basis, it is not practicable Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 16 April 1985: (I) Was there any involvement between the Australian Broadcasting Corporation television program the National and the person who attempted to drop dye on the US Buchanan in Sydney Harbour (a) before and (b) after the event; if so, what was the involvement. (2) Is it a function of the ABC to create news. (3) Who accepts responsibility for the behaviour of the National news management.",86

The offer was declined by the ABC National. (2) No. (3) The Controller of Television News and Public Affairs has immediate responsibility for news management for ABC National. He is accountable to the Director of Television and the Board of the Corporation. Legal Costs: Ex Gratia Payments Mr N. A. Brown asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 17 April 1985: What ex gratia payments have been made since 5 March 1983 in respect of legal costs to, or for, (a) Ministers, (b) judges and (c) other public officials.",86
122,Mr HURFORD ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The Minister for Finance has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The term 'ex gratia' is ments authorised under section 34A of the Audit Act 1901. No payments pursuant to that section have been made since 5 March 1983 in respect of legal costs to or for Ministers or judges. In respect of legal costs to or for the public officials during the period in question, approvals were given in two cases. A payment was approved in July 1983 to reimburse an employee of the then Capital Territory Health Com. mission his legal expenses in respect of litigation with the Commission; the costs reimbursed under that authorisation amounted to '46,229,03. A payment of $380.20 was approved in May 1984 in respect of a fine ($350) and the court costs ($30.20) of a Commonwealth officer who was prosecuted under State law (relating to fire bans) in respect of certain actions he took in the course of his Commonwealth duties. These payments were made under act of grace arrangements in that they fell outside the normal policy, exto supply this information. pressed in Section 21 of the Finance Directions, whereby departments, in consultation with the Australian GovernNational inent Solicitor, may meet the cost of the legal defence of (Question No. 640) officials in litigation against them arising out of their Commonwealth duties. Numbers of Teaching Staff (Question No. 7i4) Mr Rocher asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 17 April 1985: Is the Minister able to say how many teachers were employed in each State and Territory in each of the years 1982 to 1984. Mr Dawkins-The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The numbers of teachers employed in each State and Territory in 1982 and 1983 are shown in the table below. Data for 1984 is not yet available.

Food Aid: Recent Devaluation of the Australian Dollar (Question No. 724) taken to mean act of grace payMr Andrew asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 April: In what way and by what amount has the recent devaluation of the Australian dollar increased the cost of Australian (a) wheat (b) barley (c) dried fruit and (d) canned fruit provided as aid for use.in the Horn of Africa.",86
123,Mr HAYDEN ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Of the commodities mentioned by Mr Andrew only wheat, including wheat flour, has been sent as aid to the Horn of Africa. The Australian Wheat Board is the only supplier of wheat to the Australian aid program. It quotes prices to the Australian Development Assistance Bureau in US. dollars. The prices quoted reflect movements in international wheat markets. It is estimated that the devaluation of the Australian dollar has added some $256,000 to the cost of the 50,850 MTN of wheat shipped as aid to the Horn of Africa this financial year. This is net ations caused by market movements. Wheat flour shipments were not similarly affected by devaluation as. they are provided through public tenders called by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau and contractual arrangements fire based on Australian dollar prices. Australian Broadcasting Corporation: FM Radio Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 18 April 1985: When will the Shepparton and Goulburn Valley area, Victoria, receive an acceptable quality ABC-FM radio reception.",87
124,Mr DUFFY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio and television networks are very extensive, currently operating through more than 400 transmitting sites across Australia. The Department of Communications and the ABC are actively working to extend these networks to bring additional programs to viewers and listeners in rural areas. However, the planning, construction and ongoing operation of these significant networks requires the application of considerable resources. Timetables and priorities must be established, and it is inevitable that there will be in the establishment of new facilities in some areas. Extension of the ABC's FM-stereo service to the Goulburn Valley region is included in my Department's long term planning program but, with regret, I must advise that new ABC-FM facilities are unlikely to be available before at least 1990. Pendle Hill Post Office Mr Cadman asked the Minister for Communicarions, upon notice, on 18 April 1985: Is it' a fact that the Commonwealth recently paid $142,000 for an additional Post Office atPendle Hill, New South Wales; if so, why is Australia Post continuing to pay rent at $100 per week for the current facilities until June 1985.",87
125,Mr DUFFY ,BY NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Postal Commission, is as follows: On 14 December 1984, Australia Post paid $142,000 for a property at Pend Ie Hill. Alterations are being made to the building on this property to enable it to accommodate postal operations. It is expected that these alterations will be completed by the end of July 1985. Until such time as the new premises are ready Jor occupation, the Pendle Hill Post Office will continue to operate from its current location. Rent for the facility is around $75 per week.

SPEC's role is to promote and co-ordinate the development policies of the South Pacific Island Governments in a number of key sectors. Major current activities and programs are as follows: SPEC's trade activities cover trade promotion, the tification and development of export-oriented industries and the negotiation of export opportunities. Following a study of trade relations and industrial development in the South Pacific, SPEC co-ordinated and assisted island countries in the negotiation of the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement (SPARTECA), a major step in the expansion of export markets and impetus to the development of island export-based industry. To promote the flow of island products to Australian markets, the South Pacific Trade Commission was established in May 1979 in Sydney under SPEC auspices, with the financial backing of the Australian Government. An in-depth investigation into the prospects for closer economic co-operation among Island members of SPEC has been completed and market surveys beyond the region have also been undertaken, notably in Japan and the United States. A United Nations Development Program-funded project for trade promotion, advisory services and training is located at SPEC. Recent research, with outside assistance, has included a South Pacific industrial-survey, a study on the harmonisation of industrial incentives, an investigation of bulk purchasing possibilities and a study of regional crop insurance. SPEC has been instrumental in setting up arrangements such as the Regional Taro Agreement and the Regional Long-Term Sugar Agreement. Regional transport is an important part of SPEC's activities. The assignment to SPEC in 1972 of the tasks of studying the financial and operational structure of a regional shipping line reflected the priority which island leaders attached to the concept, and to the linkage between trade and transport in the South Pacific region.

The documents establishing the Line were finalised in 1977. NA SPEC is also involved in other shipping matters includidening wage rates and working conditions for island seamen and uniform maritime standards for the region. Following a decision by the Rotorua Forum meeting in 1976, a Regional Civil Aviation Council and an Advisory Committee were established. NA Telecommunications has been another major field of SPEC activity, following the decision of the 1973 Forum that SPEC should act as the co-ordinating agency for telecommunications work being undertaken in the South Pacific by the United Nations and other agencies. Technical support has been provided to SPEC by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). NA Energy, including alternative energy sources, has become a top priority of SPEC member Governments. Following a study on appropriate regional institutional arrangements for energy matters, the Forum decided in 1981 that SPEC shou Id assume the role of overall regional energy co-ordinator. A SPEC energy unit was established in 1982 to carry out this responsibility. AID Aid co-ordination and in particular the development and implementation of regional aid projects funded by the EEC under the Lome Convention are another activity for which SPEC is responsible. Since 1981 SPEC has also acted as the Secretariat to the Africa-Caribbean-Pacific TRANSPORT Group Council which meets annually. NA In 1981 Forum Leaders decided that a Pacific Regional Advisory Service (PRAS) should be established under the auspices of SPEC. PRAS has two main functions-to maintain a systematic register of skilled personnel existing within Pacific Island countries which would be available to meet requests from governments in the region, and to facilitate transfers of such personnel. SPEC administers the SPEC Fellowship Scheme funded by the Governments of Australia and New Zealand and the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation (CFTC). The fellowship scheme provides inservice training in island member countries for two candidates per country per year. SPEC manages a Regional Disaster Relief Fund which provides monetary assistance to countries in the region suffering from the effects of natural ved in disaster preparedness co-ordination. Special attention is given by SPEC to the problems of smaller island countries. SPEC participates in the South Pacific Regional Environment Program (SPREP) which is a co-operative effort between SPEC and SPC along with UN agencies working in the region. The program is aimed at coOTHER ordinating and assisting Pacific island countries with the proper management of their environment and resources. SPEC is continuing to develop areas in its work program which will assist member countries. Investigations into the possibility of establishing a Pacific Islands Fund are being undertaken, regional priorities for development planning have been established and the positions of Regional Export Marketing Adviser and Regional Handicrafts Adviser have been created with outside disasters and is involassistance. 5.

128,Mr DUFFY ,ADVISORY SERVICE,"The answer to the honourable pendency member's question, based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission, is as tish/French Condominium Overseas Territory or France follows: (I) Yes. The equipment records the numbers dialled, the length of the call and the date and time at which the Zealand Trust Territory) call was made. It does not record the destination of the call but this can be deduced from the number dialled. (2) and (3) Yes. Section 7 (2) (a) of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 which allows for the use of the equipment for the operation and maintenance of the telephone network and the identifying or tracing of any person involved in contravening the Telecommunications Act 1975 or any regulation or by-law in force under that Act, for example, in the case of harassing, menacing and fictitious calls. (4) Yes. (5) Generally, yes. In the case of billing complaints, perience has shown that advance knowledge of its use can result in subscribers reducing their normal ·calling patterns. However, use of the equipment in some circumstances is requested by subscribers. Telecom has a responsibility to its customers to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the teleph;:me network and in a number of instances use of the equipment is the only means of demonstrating this accuracy in order to resolve satisfactorily a billing complaint. (6) Because of the extensive use made of the equipment such information is not maintained. (7) Separate costs are not maintained. (8) Where there is a need to discuss the details to assist in resolving a billing complaint or a complaint concerning offensive calls. (9) Records are destroyed after varying period of time depending upon the nature of the original inquiry.

134,Mr HAYDEN ,NATIONAL SPORTS CENTRE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) Although there may be no formal requirement to display portraits of Her Majesty the Queen, it is the policy of the Government that this should be done as far as practicable, and most Australian missions have a portrait on display, either in the public area of the office or in the Head of Mission's own office or residence.

(I) and (2) In the same period covered by the honourable member's question, the Commission was involved in 77 cases (instituted by it or against it) where costs were ordered in its favour, or no order made as to costs. In many of these cases fines, penalties or injunctions were ordered or collected. Trade Practices Commission (Question No. lSI) Mr N. A. Brown asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 20 March 1985: (I) What order for costs was made in the recent litigation in the Federal Court of Australia between the Trade Practices Commission and a number of transport companies including TNT, Brambles and Youngs Transport Ltd. (2) What sum is the Trade Practices Commission (a) to pay and (b) estimated to pay, to the defendants in that litigation. (3) What sum (a) has been incurred and (b) is estimated to have been incurred, by the Trade Practices Commission in respect of its own costs in the litigation.",105
136,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,NATIONAL SPORTS CENTRE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (I) On I March 1985, Mr Justice Franki ordered that the Commission pay 85 per cent of the defendant's costs, other than those of Youngs Transport Ltd. The Court found that all the defendants (with the exception of Youngs which is in liquidation and thus was not represented at the hearing) were involved at least in most of the various unsuccessful objections which occupied a considerable amount of the Court's time in relation to one lengthy issue. Accordingly the Court considered the Commission's claim for abatement of costs was justified in part. The Commission was ordered to pay the full costs of Youngs Transport Ltd. However, since that company took no active part in the hearing, those costs will be proon the substanportionately quite small. (2) (a) and (b). It is not possible to answer the question at this time. No bills have as yet been received by the TPC from the defendants. (3) (a) and (b). I am informed by the Trade Practices of Commission that expenditure incurred in respect of this litigation is $987,144. This relates to legal expenses and witnesses fees. No further expenses are expected to be in- . curred other than those in relation to the taxing of bills. The Commission's solicitor is the Australian Government Solicitor. Human Rights Commission Mr N. A. Brown asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 29 March 1985: What was the cost of the Deputy Chairman of the Human Rights Commission attending the United Nations International Seminar on the Experience of Different Countries in the Implementing of International Standards . ori Human Rights in June 1982.",106
137,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,NATIONAL SPORTS CENTRE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: $5,412. Inter-Governmental Committee Mr N. A. Brown asked the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 20 March 1985: (I) H0w many matters has he referred to the InterGovernmental Committee established under the National Crime Authority Act pursuant to sub-secion 13 (I) of the Act and when were they referred. (2) How many notices have been given by a Minister of the Crown of a State pursuant to sub-section 14 (I) of the Act and when was each notice given.",107
138,Mr YOUNG ,NATIONAL SPORTS CENTRE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Inter-Governmental Committee has been consulted on four Commonwealth references; two on 19 October 1984, and two on 12 December 1984. (2) As at 23 May 1985, none. Human Rights: Union of Soviet Socialist Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 1985: Will he bring up to date the information given in answer to question No. 1158 (Hansard, 2 May 1984, page 1701).",107
139,Mr HAYDEN ,NATIONAL SPORTS CENTRE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Australian Embassy officials have not been able to attend trials of dissidents during the period. With regard to point (f) of this part of the question: according to mation available to the Embassy, no foreign representatives were allowed to attend any trials of dissidents during the period. In November 1984 the Embassy attempted unsuccessfully to attend the trial of Herman Lialkovski. While Mr Lialkovski is not a dissident in the commonly accepted sense of the term, he is an Australian citizen whose wish to rejoin his family in Australia is being denied by the Soviet authorities, who treat him details are: (a) Herman Lialkovski. (b) Lvov. (c) 28 November 1984. (d) (i) Under S.196 of the Ukrainian SSR Criminal Code-failing to acknowledge his Soviet citizen(Question No. 182) ship and failing to accept an internal Soviet passport; (ii) Sentenced to one year of community labour. (e) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs challenged Australian 'interest in the trial of a Soviet citizen' and advised that the 'court is open to Soviet citizens only'. (f) None. (2) No representations on behalf of Orlov and Shcharansky have been made since Mr Jacobi's question of 5 March 1984. (3) and (4) In the twelve months to 31 December 1984, twelve persons, all in the family reunion category, were permitted to migrate to Australia. (Question No. 183) (5) There is nothing to add to previous replies to this part of the question. Mr Yuri Shukhevych (Question No. 196) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 1985: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 1357 (Hansard, 10 May 1984, pages 2291-92) can he say whether a reply has been received from Mr Yuri Shukhevych in relation to his possible immigration to Australia. (2) What further action has the Australian Embassy in Moscow taken on this case. (3) What action has the Embassy taken in relation to Oksana Meshko.",107
140,Mr HAYDEN ,NATIONAL SPORTS CENTRE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Republics (I) No communication has been received from Mr Yuri (Question No. 195) Shukhevych regarding his possible migration to Australia. (2) and (3) The Australian Embassy in Moscow regularly makes representations to the Soviet authorities on behalf of Soviet citizens who have been sponsored for migration by relatives in Australia, but who are unable to obtain permission to leave the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. When the Embassy made inquiries about Mr Shukhevych in May 1984, it was informed that cases for emigration would only be considered where applications had been made by the individuals concerned to the competent local authorities. It would seem, therefore, that infor- there is nothing more that the Embassy can do on behalf of Mr Shukhevych or Mrs Meshko until they actually apply to migrate to Australia.

142,Mr COHEN ,NATIONAL SPORTS CENTRE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) to (3) No employees of the Department receive a language availability performance allowance. Mr Blunt asked the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 20 March 1985: (I) Did the Australian Federal Police prevent British businessman, Ronald Charles Fry, from flying out of Australia from Brisbane Airport on 25 January 1985, while Queensland fraud squad detectives were investigating his connection with a million dollar deal involving north Queensland farmers; if not, why not. (2) If Australian Federal Police were aware that Mr Fry was under investigation, why was there no exchange of information with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.",108
143,Mr YOUNG ,NATIONAL SPORTS CENTRE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. I am advised that while the Australian Federal Police were aware that Queensland Police fraud squad detectives were investigating Mr Fry's connection with an alleged fraud committed on Queensland farmers, they had, no basis or power to prevent Mr Fry leaving the country, nor were they requested to do so. The mere fact that a person is under investigation is not sufficient grounds to physically prevent that person from leaving the country. (2) I am further advised that there was no reason for the Australian Federal Police to exchange information with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in this particular case. The Department of Immigration ana Ethnic Affairs did not advise the Australian Federal Police of any contemplated action.

(3) Does he consider that these actions would be an appropriate first step towards developing (a) an interdisciplinary planning process for the mUltiple use of the river and (b) in the long term a much broader input to the River Murray Commission. (4) Does he see these actions as a means of avoiding the many constitutional problems and interminable delays associated with trying to establish a proper national Ronald Charles Fry Murray-Darling planning body or an expanded River (Question No. 226) Murray Commission.

161,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,RGH RGH RGH RGH RGH RGH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The principal legislation at the Commonwealth level dealing generally with unfair business practices is the Trade Practices Act 1974. Division I, Part V of that Act contains a general prohibition on misleading or deceptive conduct and specific prohibitions on particular examples of unfair conduct. Section 53A states that a corporation shall not, in connection with in land, make a false or misleading statement concerning the nature of the interest in the land, the price payable, the location or characteristics of the land, the use to which the land may be put or the existence or availability of facilities associated with the land. Section 59 (2) provides that where a corporation invites persons to participate in a business activity requiring the investment of moneys and the performance of work by the persons involved, the corporation shall not make, with respect to the profitability or risk or any other material aspect of the business activity, a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular. The latter section a person buys a business on seller as to the profitability of the busiriess, which subsequently proves false. In addition, section 52 generally prohibits, on a civil basis, merce, engaging in conduct that is deceptive or misleading or likely to mislead or deceive. There is no general Commonwealth legislation, which applies throughout Australia, dealing with landlords and tenants, or with commercial leasing practices. This area is seen as one for the State and Territory Governments to control, given the constitutional limitations on the Commonwealth's power. (2) The Trade Practices Act 1974 applies throughout Australia, although it is generally limited in its application to the conduct of corporations. The reason for this is that the legislative basis for the (s. 51 (xx)) of the Constitution. However, by virtue of section 6 of the Act, it also applies to the conduct of individ'uals in the Austral1an Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. This extended application has its constitutional basis in the Territories' power (s. 122) of the Constitution. (Question No. 426) I understand that the ACT Landlords and Tenants Ordinance applies only to domestic leases. I also understand that there are proposals for an ACT commercial leases ordinance which would provide some assistance to commercial tenants, but these proposals are only at a preliminary stage. (3) and (4) I understand such practices as these may be engaged in by landlords. There is presently no Commonwealth legislation dealing with these specific practices. To the extent that they may be unconscionable in particular circumstances, it is pertinent to note the Green Paper entitled 'The Trade Practices Act-Proposals for Change' issued in February 1984, wherein the Government proposed to introduce a section in the Trade Practices Act prohibiting unconscionable conduct in relation to a contract or proposed contract. Such a section, if enacted, may have application to the practices mentioned in (3), but the Government has yet to make a final decision about the proposal.

In accordance with the practices of successive governments, I have no intention of providing information on the specific advice offered by ASTEC on Cabinet Submissions. Subscriber Computer Record Printers: Mr Lloyd asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: Is it a fact that as commented upon by the Special Prosecutor, Mr Redlich, as reported in the Age of 7 April 1984, police have little trouble collecting material gathered by machines similar to subscriber computer record printers (SCRP) used in hotels, motels and businesses which have helped lead to.lu.ycessful prosecutions; if so, by what authority are the in't'ei'ceptions made.",147
164,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,PAYMENTS TO COMMUNITY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as'follows: The relevant paragraph in the Age article is not, in fact, attributed to Mr Redlich. or, indeed, to anyone else. It seems to be an assertion by the journalist who wrote the article, and I am in no position to comment on its accuracy. It should be borne in mind, however, that the Telecommunications (Interception) Act does not regulate interceptions made with the knowledge of the persoh making the communications. In this regard, attention is drawn to the following paragraph in the Review by Mr F. Vincent QC., of Allegations against Telecom'9.25 The parallel use of the SCRF machine between that device and the commonly used hotel/motel metering machines. I am satisfied however that such a comparison is not appropriate since in the hotel/motel situation there is either actual permission given by telephone users for the use of such monitoring devices, or at'least an anticipation and understanding that way as to compute telephone charges with equipment suitable for that purpose. Under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, it is the lack of knowledge which renders such interception unlawful.' Digital Radio Concentrator System Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 27 March 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the concern of people who live on isolated station properties in the NT, Queensland, WA and SA that they will not be included in the Digital Radio Concentrator System (DRCS) telephone system which is a key element in Telecom's plan to provide telephone access to all Australians by 1990. (2) Will those who live beyond the 40-50 kilometre zone on each side of the microwave bearer between Kunnunara and Katherine in the Kimberley and Victoria River areas, be connected to some form of modern telephone system by 1990; if so, when and what type of system is proposed. ' Mr DUFFY - The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission, is as follows: (1) Telecom's Rural and Remote Areas Programme (RRAP) is aimed at extending the terrestrial telecomInterceptions munications network into sparsely settled areas of (Question No. 474) Australia and to make available, between now and 1990, an automatic telephone service to every Australian who requires one. Whilst DRCS is a key element in this programme, service provision by other terrestrial means will also be utilised. (2) Yes. It is expected that automatic telephone service will be provided using DRCS, Multiple and Single Circuit Radio systems, Digital Radio systems and conventional exchanges. Final plans are dependent upon the availability of funds, manpower resources, equipment deliveries and the development of a suitable network support infrastructure. International Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (Question No. 528) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 28 March 1985: (I) Does the International Convention on the PhysicalProtection of Nuclear Material represent the vehicle by which one practical method of contributing towards the prevention of nuclear. weapons' proliferation may be achieved?

(5) How many countries have signed and ratified this Convention? calls will be monitored in such a (6) Is the COllvention now in force?",148
165,Mr HAYDEN ,PAYMENTS TO COMMUNITY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) One of the objectives of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, as expressed in the preamble, is 'to avert the potential dangers posed by (Question No. 513) the unlawful taking and use of nuclear material'. As recognised, for example, in Australia's bilateral nuclear . safeguards agreements and those of other suppliers, the physical protection of nuclear material is an important complementary control to international safeguards in seeking to ensure that nuclear material for peaceful purposes remains within the peaceful nuclear fuel cycle. The Convention, in that it seeks to protect nuclear material from theft and misuse, contributes towards the prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation. (2) The main obligation of parties to the Convention is to establish and maintain certain standards for the physical protection of nuclear material against theft during international transport. Parties are also called on to co-' operate in recovering any nuclear material which may be stolen and in dealing with offences involving such material. The Convention defines certain serious offences involving nuclear material which parties are to make punishable and for which offenders will be subject to extradition or prosecution. (3) Australia signed the Convention on 22 February 1984. Implementation of the Convention will have implications for both State and Federal law. There will, therefore, need to be further discussions proceeding to ratification. (4) The Convention was adopted at a meeting of Government representatives in Vienna on 26 October , 1979 following negotiations under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency beginning in 1976. (5) Thirty-nine countries and one organisation have signed and twelve countries have so far ratified the Convention. (6) No. In accordance with Article XIX of the Convention it will enter into force on the thirtieth day following the date of deposit of the twenty-first instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval. Nuclear Non-Proliferation Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 28 March 1985: (I) Will Australia be making submissions to the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons regarding means of reducing the dangers of the horizontal spread of nuclear weapons; if so, has his Department turned its attention to the dangers of nuclear devices falling into the hands rorist grou ps. (2) What safeguards can be effected to prevent Governments from passing such devices to extra-national political groups which, in seeking to achieve their own objectives; may also be serving the political, military ligious objectives of the nati@nal government.",148
166,Mr HAYDEN ,PAYMENTS TO COMMUNITY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Australia will be working actively before and at the third Review Conference of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to be held in Geneva in September 1985, to reduce further the dangers of horizontal proliferation. One particular means which Australia will be pursuing is the acceptance pursuant to Article 111.2 of the treaty of fullscope safeguards as a condition of nuclear supply to non-nuclear weapon states not parties to the NPT. With regard to the second part of the question, preventing nuclear devices from falling into the hands of terrorist groups has always been one of the factors in the determination of appropriate safeguards and physical protection measures. (See Part (2) below). I have interpreted nuclear devices as meaning nuclear explosive devices. (2) With respect to nuclear explosive devices, the three nuclear weapon states parties to the NPT have an international legally-binding obligation under Article I of the treaty not to transfer such devices or control over them to any recipient whatsoever. The two nuclear weapon states which are not parties to the NPT have a polity which reflects that approach. The non-nuclear weapon states parties to the NPT have accepted in Article II of the treaty an international legally-binding obligation not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. Moreover, reading Articles I and II together with the preamble and the object and purposes of the treaty, the non-nuclear weapon states parties to the NPT with the States before also are enjoined from engaging in the sort of activity from which the nuclear weapon states are prohibited by Article I. Parties to the Treaty of Tlatelolco which have brought that treaty into force accept an international legallybinding obligation to use nuclear material and facilities under their jurisdictioh exclusively for peaceful purposes. In more specific terms, they also accept obligations to prescribe the deployment, testing, use or manufacture of nuclear weapons in their territories and to themselves refrain from the manufacture or possession of any nuclear weapon. Non-nuclear weapon states which are parties to the NPT and states which are parties to the Treaty of Tlatelolco which have brought that Treaty into force also accept international safeguards to verify their non-proliferation commitments. Safeguards are applied (Question No. 529) through an international legally-binding agreement with the IAEA. Compliance with the obligations in the agreements are monitored and overseen by the IAEA and its Board of Governors. Safeguards verify the non-diversion of safeguarded nuclear material for peaceful purposes. Under the operation of safeguards, as applied 'pursuant to obligations in the NPT and the Treaty of Tlatelo\Co, the international transfer of nuclear material to non-nuclear of ter- weapon states is recorded. Many suppliers, such as Australia, also have bilateral requirements including that of prior consent over te-transfers. In Australia's case, an eligible destination for end-use of Australian origin nuclear material is a country· with which Australia has a bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement in force. or re- Safeguarded nuclear material, therefore, could not be passed to extra-national groups without its detection and, in many cases, the prior consent of the supplier. In the latter instance, where suppliers have undertaken international non-proliferation commitments, such transfers would be in breach of those commitments. Certain other countries, not in any of the above categories of states, have not entered into any comparable international legal obligations concerning non-proliferation and mayor may not require IAEA safeguards on their nuclear exports. In a small number of such non nuclear weapon states which have unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, the passing of nuclear material from such facilities to extra-national political groups is theoretically possible, although unlikely for national security reasons. This possibility, nevertheless, underlines the importance of universal adherence to the NPT or, at a minimum, universal acceptance of fullscope safeguards under the IAEA-a current Australian objective as outlined in Part (I) above. With respect to the possible illicit manufacture of nuclear explosive devices, the major nuclear suppliers and consumers have accepted international legal obligationssuch as are in Australia's bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements-to apply physical protection in accordance with standards recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency. These physical protection obligations are the principal means of preventing nuclear items falling into the hands of terrorist groups. The first NPT Review Conference in 1975 recommended the negotiation of an international convention of the physical protection of nuclear material. Negotiations on such a convention were completed in 1979. The convention has so far attracted forty signatures and twelve ratifications, nine short of the number required to bring it into force. Upon its entry into force, the convention will supplement rangements. Australia sigried the convention on 22 February 1985 and is actively considering the steps required for its ratification. Australian Atomic Energy Commission: Health Mr Tickner asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, upon notice, on 28 March 1985: (I) Has a third report on the survey of the health of employees in the research establishment of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) conducted by Professor Ferguson between 1974 and 1978, been completed; if so, will the report be published. (2) Since the publication of the Second Report, has there been an ongoing survey of the health of the AAEC employees; if so, what have been the results of these surveys. (3) Does the AAEC monitor the health of its former employees as well as its current staff; if so, for what period Spondylosis/bone injuries of time after the completion of their employment with the AAEC is this done.

Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) No. there has been no suggestion by Australian Atomic Energy commission (AAEC) , management or staff organisations that a third report is needed. (2) No. (3) The AAEC, on the recommendation of its joint management/staff occupational safety and health policy committee, has established a committee to study and regularly review cases of chronic disease including those of long latency.

In the leukaemia case there had been previous employment in private industry and a higher exposure to radiation there than in AAEC employment. The Commissioner for Employe\lS'Compensation however placed the onus on the Commonwealth to prove that exposure at the AAEC had not led to-ancer. The lung cancer case involved a heavy smoker who had worked in an area where contaminated clothing is laun- , dered but where there was no exposure to direct radiation. The worker involved had inhaled starch dust in the laundry and this was considered significant by the site Medical Officer. (Regarding radiation hazard all laundry workers at Lucas Heights are monitored regularly so that exposure does not exceed 50 per cent of allowable occupational dose). (9) None.

182,Mr SCHOLES ,PAYMENTS TO COMMUNITY,"-'-The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsDisability pensions, including the General Rate and Special Rate, and family allowances are excluded from consideration as income for the payment of service pensions. Disability pension was exempted in part, for service pension assessment in 1973 and this exemption was extended progressively until it became totally exempt in 1982. Family allowances have been specifically exempted as income for service pension since 1947. The present Government has maintained these exemptions.

183,Mr WILLIS ,PAYMENTS TO COMMUNITY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Postcode 2478 2479 2480 (a)-(c) Labour force estimates, which include data on participation rates, were not regularly available prior to (Question No. 722) 1966. Various attempts have been made to estimate participation rates for earlier periods using relevant ,Census data, however, the concepts of participation used and the methods of data collection mean they are not strictly comparable with the labour force survey estimates since 1966. Nevertheless, while estimated participation rates are not available for the years requested, an indication of partici' pation rate movements over the period can be gained from Census based estimates by Dr M. Keating: issued giving a .list of those 1947-56.0 per cent. 1954-57.3 per cent. 1961-57.4 percent. (Source: M. Keating, 'The Australian Workforce: 19\O-1l to 1960-61',ANUCanberra, 1973.)

This offence also has a maximum statutory penalty of $5,000 or imprisonment for five years, or both'. Australian Trade with Spain and Portugal (Question No. 790) Mr Andrew asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 18 April 1985: (I) Is it a fact that his Department does not believe that the accession to the European Community of Spain and Portugal will pose immediate problems for Australian exporters. (2) If there will be no immediate problems, are any long term problems expected; if so, for which Australian exporting industries. . (3) Is he able to say what the per capita income is in (a) Spain and (b) Portugal (i) nationally and (ii) of farmers. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . (I) In late March 1985, the European Community, Spain and Portugal virtually concluded negotiations on the terms for accession to the European Community of Spain and Portugal. Accession Treaties are expected to be signed in June and then be ratified by national parliaments, to enable entry on I January 1986. Australian trade with the Iberian states in 1983-84 amounted to $A 118.9m worth of exports and $A114.2m worth of imports. Australia's main exports were raw materials consisting of coal ($A52m), wool and hides ($A25m) and iron ore ($A 7.5m). Exports of food items have not been relatively large and have fluctuated in terms of quantity and type of product during recent years. there have been calls to substanThe transitional accession periods range from seven to ten years for agricultural products and up to seven years for manufactured products. During these periods tariffs and other border measures will be adjusted and EC farm policies will be phased in. Consequently, it is difficult to assess the trade effects of enlargement but one would not expect there to be immediate problems for the bulk of Australian exports. (2) It is not possible to determine at this stage specific long term problems that may arise for Australian exporters. Spain will also accede to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) which imposes quantitative controls on steel production in the Member States. Depending on the treatment of Spanish steel production' by the ECSC, Australia's exports of coal and iron ore could be affected. It is not anticipated that exports of wool and hides would be affected. The gradual adoption of lower EC tariffs on manufactured goods could provide increased export opportunities in Spain for Australian manufactured products. It could be expected however that production of Spanish fruit could be encouraged by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which could have implications for Australian exports to the EC and to third markets. (3) In 1983, per capita GOP was $A4,591 in Spain and $A2,268 in Portugal. Data on farm incomes is not available. However, a report by the Commission of the European Communities in 1979 indicated that farm income in Spain in 1978 was 'only 47 per cent of average farm incomes per head in the Community'.

(2) How many pensions are paid which total less $52 per annum. (3) What is the cost of paying these pensions fortnight.",162
187,Mr SCHOLES ,EFFECT OF ASSETS TEST ON SERVICE PENSIONERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) For the pension pay day of 25 April this year there were 14,915 people in receipt of pensions or allowances of $25 or less a year. (2) At the same date 32,215 people were receiving a pension which in total was less than $52 per annum. This figure includes people receiving pensions of less than $25 per annum mentioned in part (1).

Productivity Increases and Employment Mr Burr asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 7 May 1985: Should productivity increases in Gross Domestic Product be used to create new and permanent jobs for the unemployed; if so, will the Government argue against the Australian Council of Trade Unions to prevent productivity increases being passed on to wage and salary earners to the detriment of the unemployed.",168
203,Mr WILLIS ,EFFECT OF ASSETS TEST ON SERVICE PENSIONERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government has always acknowledged-as do the Wage-fixing Principles-that there would come a time when it was appropriate for Australians in jobs to share in economic recovery through the distribution of productivity gains. However, our first concern is to ensure preservation of the strong employment growth with moderate inflation that has been achieved over the last two years. Any productivity based improvement in wages or conditions of employment must be of an appropriate size, and timing, as to be consistent with these objectives. The Accord acknowledges that distribution of productivity gains to wage and salary earners is an important element of a viable prices and incomes policy. However it also recognises the primary aim of restoring full employment. The Accord provides a framework in which discussions can take place to solve any difficulties involved in meeting both of these goals. Under the Government's Prices and Incomes Policy, which is based on the Accord, there has been a dramatic turnaround in the economy. Real gross non-farm product has risen by 9.5 per cent since the trough in the June quarter 1983 and over 300,000 jobs have been created since the Summit in April 1983. The unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10.4 per cent to 8.5 per cent and inflation has been halved, to around 5.5 per cent, even when the effects of Medicare are excluded. During this period of rapid economic growth award wages have shown very moderate increases and both the profit share and real unit labour costs are not back near their levels of the late 1960s and early 1970s. However, in the context of the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar, the Government has indicated that any sustained depreciation requires a lesser real wage than would otherwise have applied. One way of achieving this is via a delaying of any productivity case. The Government has yet to take a final decision 01\ how best to handle the price effects of devaluation. It has indicated that the questions of the size, timing and phasing of any productivity increase should be deferred until the scope of the depreciation and the extent of its effect on the - conomy become apparent. The best policy for sustaining growth, and thus helping the unemployed, is to maintain the Accord and the Prices and Incomes Policy. The question of how any productivity case will be handled will be discussed within the framework of the Accord to ensure the best possible result for the country as a whole.

(3) When is it anticipated that the Government will make an announcement on this matter.",170
209,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,EFFECT OF ASSETS TEST ON SERVICE PENSIONERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) On 21 May 1985 the Special Minister of State made a statement to the House of Representatives concerning the Government's response to recommendations contained in the Final Report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. In relation to the Commission's recommendation for the establishment of a Taxation Investigation Tribunal and a Special Taxation Investigator (crime), the Government considered the creation of such bodies as being unnecessary as they would duplicate the work of existing agencies such as the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Federal Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the National Crime Authority. In recommending these new bodies, the Commission expressed concern regarding insignificant penalties for non-compliance to a request for information pursuant to section 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITA Act) and the use of the defence of 'self-incrimination' where such a request was made. It should be noted that these matters were addressed in the Taxation Laws Amendment Act 1984 (TLA Act) passed prior to the receipt of the Commission's final report. That Act significantly increased the maximum penalty for a failure to comply with a request made pursuant to section 264 of the IT A Act and also provided a tiered penalty structure including a liability to imprisonment for second and subsequent breaches of section 264. The TLA Act also made it clear that 'selfincrimination' is not a defence to a charge of failing to comply with a legal requirement under a taxation law. (2) Normal inter-Departmental consultations were undertaken to advance the Government's consideration of the above recommendations. (3) On 21 May 1985. the Special Minister of State announced in the House of Representatives the Government's response to the above recommendations.

He made it clear that any such access would be subject to acceptance by the States of both strict controls and the costs of interception operations. There will need to be close consultation between the Commonwealth and those States seeking access to telephone interception powers in the development of detailed proposals. The system of controls, which would need to involve State as well as Commonwealth legislation, would include judicial warrants, audits of interception operations by a State Ombudsman (or like independent State authority) and reports to the State Attorney-General who, in turn, would report periodically to the Commonwealth Attorney-General on reasons for, and results of, interceptions.

All valuations, including in respect of farmers and other people whose properties have a curtilage of larger than two hectares, were treated in the same manner. (a) In accordance with the emphasis on pensioner selfassessment, wherever possible the pensioners' estimates of the value of their assets were accepted. Some checking was required for certain items, for example, the value of shares was checked against current share listings in the financial press. In cases where pensioners owned real estate (other than the home) and the total value of their assets would have led to reduction in pension; or where the total value was within $20,000 of the allowable limit; or where the departmental officer WaS not satisfied with the pensioner's estimate, the real estate values were checked by officers of the Valuations Branch of the Australian Taxation Office. (b) The valuations were based on: (i) Information provided by the pensioner on the Statement of Assets form; (ii) recent sales information for the area; (iii) information provided by statutory authorities; (iv) local knowledge of the area; and (v) where possible, external inspections.

Information Campaigns Mr Blu.nt asked the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, upon notice, on 9 May 1985: (1) Which Government agencies were responsible for (a) providing advice on and (b) co-ordinating the information campaigns dealing with the (i) assets test and (ii) changes to the Electoral Act. (2) What was the cost of each of these campaigns. (3) What advertising agencies were involved in connection with these campaigns and (a) what were their roles and (b) what amount was each paid. (4) What amount was spent specifically on advertising and where was this spent. Mr John Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) Therewere two information campaigns dealing with the assets test-one conducted by the Department of Veterans' Affairs in June/July 1984 and one by the Department of Social Security from October 1984 to April 1985. In both campaigns assistance was given by the Information Co-ordination Branch. (I) (a) and (b) There have been three information campaigns covering changes to the Electoral Act-one in November 1983 on new voting requirements for British subjects; one in October 1984 on changes to electoral boundaries, and one in November/December 1984 on new voting procedures for the 1984 Federal election. In all three campaigns the Australian Electoral Commission was the responsible Government agency and was assisted by the Information Co-ordination Branch. In the November 1983 campaign on new voting requirements for British subjects advertising assistance was provided by the Australian Government Advertising Service. In the two later campaigns the advertising assistance was provided by the Information Co-ordination Branch which, from I March 1984, incorporated the Australian Government Advertising Service. (2) The costs to the responsible department or authority were: Assets testDepartment of Social Security, $104,966. Department of Veterans' Affairs, $30,800. New voting requirements for British subjects, $305,012. Changes to electoral boundaries, $133,834. New voting procedures for 1984 Federal election, $1,530,000. (3) (a) and (b) Assets Test-Department of Social Security. Press and radio advertising were used. The press advertising was arranged through the master agency for cetera. placing non-campaign press advertising, Gordon and Gotch, at a cost of $7,496.00. The radio advertising was arranged through the master agency for radio, television and cinema, Monahan Dayman Adams, at a cost of $280.00. Assets Test-Department of Veterans' Affairs. Press advertising was used. It was arranged and placed before the revised advertising system came into operation on I October 1984. The agency that handled the placement (Question No. 999) of the advertising was Neville Jeffress. It is not possible to calculate the amount paid to the agency for the specific campaign under the old system. Changes to the Electoral Act-Monahan Dayman Adams (N.S.W.) Pty Ltd provided creative agency services for the three campaigns on changes to the Electoral Act and received $21,045 in fees. Several advertising agencies were involved in providing placing/charging services for the three campaigns. Prior to I October 1984 these services for campaign advertising for press were provided by Doyle Dane Bernbach and for radio, television and cinema by The Weston Company. Since 1 October 1984, USP Needham has provided the placing/charging services for press and Monahan Dayman Adams (N.S.W.) for radio, television and cinema. In regard to the November 1983 campaign on new voting requirements for British subjects it is not possible to calculate under the old system the amount paid for placing/charging services for the campaign. The other two campaigns-changes to electoral boundaries and new voting procedures for the 1984 Federal electionoccurred after the revised system came into force on 1 October 1989. The new system does not provide precise figures for placing/charging services for these two specific campaigns. However, it is possible to estimate that USP Needham received about $36,700 and Monahan Dayman Adams (N.S.W.) about $18,600. (4) Assets Test. A total of $135,766 was spent on assets test advertising. The advertising was scheduled in major metropolitan and provincial markets in press and radio. Changes to the Electoral Act.

Queensland Drought: Farmers (Question No. 1016) Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 9 May 1985. ( 1) Is it a fact that (a) already. in Queensland 7 Shires and 200 individual properties have been declared drought stricken by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries; (b) unless extraordinary falls of rain are received in May and June 1985 there is little likelihood of a normal winter cereal crop in Queensland and vast areas of New South Wales; (c) livestock prices at sales in Queensland have fallen by 20 cents a kilogram since January 1985. (2) If so, will he assure Australian farmers and pastoralists that the Government will assist them when the States have reached their thresholds which were greatly increased by the Government in the 1984-85 Budget. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The most recent information received by my Department is that nine shires in Queensland have been fully or partially drought declared. It is understood that individual properties are also declared but the number is not readily available. (b) The deteriorating rainfall situation in New South Wales and Queensland could affect the planting of winter cereal crops. I am advised that rain is required in some areas of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland to allow planting of the wheat crop to get underway. (Question No. 1015) (c) There has been a marginal fall in cattle prices at sales in Queensland in the last 4 months. I am advised that the index of cattle prices prepared by the Queensland Livestock and Meat Authority has fallen from 13.4 at the beginning of January 1985 to 128.2 at the beginning of May 1985. (2) The question of assistance for primary producers in drought declared areas is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the States. Under the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements (NDRA), the Commonwealth automatically assists States with expenditure on natural disaster relief measures once this expenditure reaches an annual base level. Assistance is available in respect of approved 'core' and 'special measures'. Expenditure incurred by a State on agreed eligible core measures is automatically eligible for financial assistance under the arrangements. A State may also request the Commonwealth's agreement to special measures it may wish to implement because of particular needs arising from a disaster: Changes to the NDRA which came into effect in 1984-85 were the first since 1978-79 and were made largely to take account of the effects of inflation over the period. They were designed to result in a more equitable sharing of costs between the Commonwealth and States and Northern Territory (N.T.). Because of inflation, the shares for the Commonwealth and each.of the States and N.T. resulting from the application of the 1978-79 formula were around 60: 40 respectively in 1983-84. Base levels of expenditure by the States before the Commonwealth contribution under the revised NORA are now set by reference to the size of State and N.T. Budgets. The base level is now set at 0.24 per cent of State Budget Sector Receipts (SBSR) two year earlier, which is the latest period for which relevant data is available. This will reflect that States' capacity will ensure that the base levels are not eroded. Further changes to the cost sharing for Commonwealth and States and N.T. above the 0.24 per cent SBSR base level will apply from I July 1985. Detailed discussions on NORA have been undertaken between Commonwealth and State and Northern Territory officials. The Government is also examining the feasibility of providing drought concessional loans through a separate funding mechanism. However, this examination has not yet reached finality.

234,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,EFFECT OF ASSETS TEST ON SERVICE PENSIONERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (Question No. 1029) (I), (2) and (5) Following the establishment of the Companies and Securities Law Review Comittee (CSLRC) in January 1984, the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities asked it to inquire into, and review, the use of the corporate form. This reference required the CSLRC to have particular regard to a number of matters, including: (i) issues relating to proprietary companieswhether the existing classification of proprietary companies is appropriate and, if so, whether there should be any criteria for the incorporation of proprietary companies in Australia; the suitability of the provisions of the Companies Act 1981 in relation to the regulation of proprietary companies; the obligations of proprietary companies to make public disclosure, particularly in the light of their limited liability; and the desirability of abolishing the distinction between exempt and non-exempt proprietary companies; and (ii) the various forms of company organization and incorporation of business that should be made available to intending entrepreneurs. During the second half of 1984 the CSLRC released for public comment a discussion paper in which it proposed that there should be new legislative provisions for the formation of 'incorporated partnership companies'. The proposed features of such companies include: (i) limited liability for members; (ii) absence of any legal duty to have accounts audited or to lodge accounts on a public register; (iii) abolition of distinction between proprietors and directors; (iv) regulation of internal relations by rules appropriate to partnerships; and __ (v) minimisation of other administrative requirements. The CSLRC is currently preparing a report to the Ministerial Council about forms of legal organisation for small business enterprises in the light of submissions received on its discussion paper. Consideration of the CSLRC's report is expected to be given a high by the Ministerial Council. (3) On 8 May 1985, amendments to the companies legislation designed to facilitate 'short-form' of annual return were introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament. With the introduction of this new form of annual return, exempt proprietary companies that do not have their accounts audited will only have to disclose selected items of financial information in their annual returns instead of having to attach their full accounts as at present. (4) The number of staff employed on 'registration-type' functions in each State Corporate Affairs Office is a matter within the responsibility of the Attorney-General in that State. However, in 1983 a review of staff employed in the A.C.T. and State Corporate Affairs Office showed that about 47 per cent of staff were engaged on 'registration-type' functions: the precise nature of the functions undertaken by these staff varied from State to State and, in a number of instances, included matters outside the scope of the co-operative companies and securities scheme (for example associations, business names and co-operative socieities).

(3) and (4) I refer the honourable member to the answer which I gave on 23 August 1983 to his previous question on this suggestion (Hansard, pages 127-128). If any initiative such as that proposed seemed likely to gain support frorn the parties directly involved, including the Lebanese Government, it would deserve serious consideration. Australia is not a party principal to efforts to promote a solution to the problems of Lebanon. It approaches the question, however, in a spirit of concern and goodwill, and with a willingness to contribute to the greatest extent possible towards the objective of securing peace and reconciliation. To this end Australia, through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York and Ambassador to Lebanon, has maintained an active interest in the search for a solution to the tragic events in Lebanon. Earlier this month our Permanent Representative in New York held discussions with his Lebanese counterpart as well as with a senior member of the United Nations Secretariat, to explore the scope for action in the Security Council. At the same time the Ambassador in Lebanon called on the Secretary-General of the Lebanese Foreign Ministry. These discussions indicated that the Lebanese Government would not favour action in the Security Council until Israeli forces had completed their withdrawal from Lebanese territory. It was expected that the Security Council might then consider the situation. Australia would support such consideration and would participate actively in it. Lebanon There is considerable concern in the United Nations (Question No. 1084) about the continued violence in Lebanon and the tragic loss of life. On 22 May the Secretary-General issued a statement expressing his deep concern and appealed to the Lebanese Government and to all concerned to make every possible effort to put an end to violence and to recognise the vital necessity for a determined move towards conciliation. Our Permanent Representative in New York is shortly to call on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to discuss the scope for action in the Security Council and/or by the Secretary-General to promote the cause of peace in that country.

(b) USSR-Estimated Outlays on Defence It should be stressed that estimates of defence expenditure for the Soviet Union are surrounded by considerable uncertainty, particularly in the most recent years. All authorities, both academic and governmental, which have sought to make estimates readily acknowledge that there are difficulties in attempting to compare figures for the USA and the Soviet Union, in view of Soviet secrecy and the substantial differences between the economic and military systems of the two countries. No single, definite figure for Soviet defence expenditure is available. The published soviet Defence Budget-about 17 billion roubles for each of the years between 1978 and 1983 (and for many years before that)-is believed to exclude a number of elements such as military research and Category Billion 1970' Roubles (CIA) Billion 1970' Roubles (Lee) Billion current' Roubles (Lee) Billion current l Roubles (UK) Billion current' Roubles (USSR) $US Billion '81' constant (CIA) $US Billion '85"" constant (DOD) $US billion '70' constant (Lee) Change from previous' (-Figures not available).

(2) Has he appointed an outside consultant, Cramb Corporate Services, to conduct a review of the operations of this Office; if so, why. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Following the entry into force of the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement with New Zealand on I January 1983 the Office of New Zealand Relations within my Department has undertaken an extensive range of activities as part of a marketing support program for New Zealand. The program has been designed to assist the business community to understand the implications of the Agreement and particularly to take advantage of the expanded trade opportunities.

The firm has been engaged by my Department to review and report on the effectiveness of the marketing support program for New Zealand to assist the Office with planning future activities. New Zealand Lamb and Mutton Products (Question No. 1113) Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 15 May 1985: (I) What quantities of lamb and mutton products have been imported from New Zealand in each year since 1981-82. (2) What were the monthly shipments.

Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Trade monitors the impact of the Trade Agreement through the examination of trade statistics, through representations from industry interests and through contact with the business community. Trade statistics are analysed on a monthly basis with special attention being given to Australian industries which are known to be sensitive and to items which are affected by the Iiberalisation provisions of the Agreement. A Monitoring Report which includes a summary of trade developments is produced and distributed on a quarterly basis by the Department. The Department also has extensive contact with individual companies and industry organisations through its Regional Offices, Ministerial and other correspondence and participation in meetings with businessmen's groups and industries. When such contact reveals specific problems, follow up action is undertaken as appropriate. There is also an interdepartmental Liaison Monitoring Committee chaired by the Department of Primary Industry which monitors imports of certain sensitive horticultural products. The Government does not monitor the effects of the Trade Agreement on New Zealand industries and companies. It would seem more appropriate for the New Zealand Government to engage in such activity. Trade Agreement with New Zealand Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 15 May 1985: Has he been advised that it is the intention of the New Zealand Government to become self-sufficient in steel and steel products; if so, will he advise the New Zealand Government that, under the Closer Economic Relations Agreement, Australia must be able to compete against local industries in New Zealand on a fair and just basis. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The previous government, which negotiated the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, was aware of plans approved in 1981 by the previous New Zealand Government for expanding New Zealand steel production. While New Zealand's steel capacity will be more than sufficient to meet that country's needs for many products there will still be certain products which they will not be producing. Under the Trade Agreement trade Iiberalisation in respect of certain steel and steel products was temporarily deferred to enable the two governments to agree to Iiberalisation arrangements in the context of a harmonious development of the steel industry in each country. The present Government has ensured that the New Zealand Government is aware of the importance which Australia places on the development of equitable arrangements on steel under the Trade Agreement. This concern has been conveyed by the Prime Minister to Mr Lange, and by me to appropriate New Zealand Ministers. The present New Zealand Government has been reviewing the steel expansion program. However, it is expected that negotiations will resume in the near future to finalise Iiberalisation arrangements in accordance with the Agreem'lnt's requirements that trans-Tasman trade in steel and steel products will become free of tariffs and quantitative import restrictions in both directions. Fisher Electorate: Assets Test (Question No. 1137) Mr Slipper asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 15 May 1985: With respect to farmers in the electoral division of Fisher who have had their pensions cancelled or reduced (a) who made the valuations of their assets, (b) on what were the valuations based, (c) were the farms inspected or was any other method used to confirm the valuations, (d) what net income could be expected from the farms in 1984-85 as a percentage of the valuations and (e) what was the deemed current market rental value of each of the properties.",184
250,Mr HOLDING ,SHEEPMEAT IMPORTS INTO AUSTRALIA FROM NEW ZEALAND,"The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) In accordance with the emphasis on pensioner selfassessment, wherever possible the pensioners' estimates of the value of their assets were accepted. Some checking was required for certain items, for example, the value of shares was checked against current share listings in the financial Press. In cases where pensiuners owned real estate (other than the home) and the total value of their (Question No. 1115) assets would have led to reduction in pension; or where the total value was within $20,000 of the allowable limit; or where the departmental officer was not satisfied with the pensioner's estimate, the real estate values were checked by officers of the Valuations Branch of the Australian Taxation Office. (b) The valuations were based on: (i) information provided by the pensioner on the Statement of Assets form; (ii) recent sales information for the area; (iii) information provided by statutory authorities; (iv) local knowledge of the area; and (v) where possible, external inspections. (c) Where possible, external inspections of properties were carried out but, owing to the restrictions of time, most cases were checked against information available in the Valuations Branch Offices, e.g. statutory valuations, recent sales information for the area etc. (d) This information is not available-estimated net income of the properties was not calculated as part of the assets test processing. (e) This information is not available-current market rental value of properties was not calculated as part of the assets test processing.

(9) If the ATCI has incurred debts since I July 1984, is he prepared to meet these debts.",191
262,Mr HOLDING ,SHEEPMEAT IMPORTS INTO AUSTRALIA FROM NEW ZEALAND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I. A total of $ 1.0 12m has been provided through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) to ATCI since late in 1978, as follows: 1978/79, $100,000; 1979/80, $140,000; 1980/81, $142,000; 1981/82, $166,000; 1982/83, $250,000; (includes one-off $72,000 equipment grant); 1983/84, $214,000 (124,000 was actually released on 31 July (Question No. 1211) 1984, i.e. in 1984/85 financial year). From late in 1982, the ATCI had been funded under the so-called 'Wilson agreement'. This was agreed by the then Minister, the honourable member for Sturt, in September 1982 and offered core or administrative funding for the ATCI for the next three years. This provided salaries for staff and other management/administrative costs allowing the ATCI to organise and offer its courses without the need to charge general administrative costs against its clients. At the time the agreement was made, it was intended to allow the ATCI to work towards its stated objectives of achieving financial independence from DAA. The ATCI was originally funded to provide Comare parmunity Management Training (CMT) in Northern Territory Aboriginal communities, 2, Yes, A release due in November 1982 was not made until December 1982 because ATCI did not formally accept the 'Wilson agreement' until 30 November (although the offer was formally made on 28 September). Funding for the last two quarters of 1983/84 was not released until 31 July 1984. The delay was related to the events leading to my decision to change the funding arrangements. (Question 1214) 3. No. It is understood that the ATCI has been in receipt of significant sums from other sources additional to moneys provided through DAA. 4. The ATCI claims to provide non-formal education/training in a workshop mode. From information which the ATCI has provided, however, it has become clear that not all the workshops it claims to have conducted have been of a training nature. Some of its listed workshops included meetings to discuss particular issues, for which the ATCI was engaged to organise and provide support, for example, conferences/workshops to discuss multi-cultural education and Aboriginal independent schools, (a) Given the qualifications mentioned above, the ATCI claims to have conducted the workshops as follows: 1978, 1 workshop, 8 days duration 1979,26 workshop, 113 days duration; 1980, 18 workshop, 103 days duration; 1981,18 workshop, 115 days duration; 1982,7 workshop, 52 days duration; 1983, 11 workshop, 51 days duration. This is a total of 81 workshops over 442 days, from 1978 to 1983. (b) Based on DAA funding alone the average cost per workshop is $12,497 but, as indicated in my response to question No.3, the ATCI has received funding from other sources. (c) It is not possible, on the information provided by the ATCI, to provide details of the number of course participants. Earlier this year Jhe ATCI stated that over 2,500 people had participated in its workshops. In December 1982, however, Ms Valadian, a Director of the ATCI, told the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs that 'we would have had close to 3,000 people that we have worked with over the last four years'. (d) No. The ATCI has advised that not all courses have been for Aboriginals. 5. The ATCI claims that its style of non-formal education cannot be assessed against normal education criteria and has never provided details of the outcomes of its courses. At a meeting in February 1985, I specifically asked if the ATCI reported back to communities and, if so, could I have copies of the documents. The information has not been provided. 6. The paucity and inconsistency of information provided by the A TCI has always made a valid assessment difficult and an analysis of the evaluations therefore vides results more of the nature of 'not proved' one way or the other. For example, the 1981 review of the CMT program included comments by some course participants who expressed their wish that the courses should be conducted in their own communities (rather than at the Institute in Sydney) and that there should be more follow-up work to assist the course participants utilise the knowledge they had gained in their communities. 7. In considering the funding of the ATCI, or any other Aboriginal organisations, the Department, in making its recommendations to me, assesses all claims against other competing demands and the availability of funds. 8. Yes. (a) Many reasons were involved, some of which have been alluded to in answers to preceding questions. When I became Minister in March 1983 I met Ms Valadian and Ms MCNamara in Canberra and visited the Institute six months later in September 1983. On both occasions there were no courses being conducted by the ATC!. This concerned me greatly as the ATCI had been receiving regular funding releases for the entire year and Ms Valadian and Ms MCNamara were funded by my Department on a full time basis to conduct training information the ATCI subsequently provided about its courses during the year did not completely allay my concern. (b) I asked the A TCI to submit proposals for specific course funding which would be considered in the normal way against competing priorities and the availability of funds. (c) The Chairman of the ATCI, Professor Philp, accepted my proposals in a conversation on 6 June 1984 and said that the ATCI would 'do some sums'. My senior private Secretary confirmed that conversation in a letter to Professor Philp on 19 June 1984. (d) The ATCI has since failed to provide proposals with sufficient detail to allow assessment or decision. On 24 May 1984 Ms Valadian provided brief one and two line descriptions of a number of proposals but this was totally inadequate for me to make a decision to fund. Some further information was provided by the ATCI on 12 April 1985, almost eleven months later, but I have again had to ask the ATCI for more details, e.g. number of participants in proposed courses, location of courses, details of costing. This is despite the fact that these requirements were made clear in my letter of 14 February 1985. I wrote again to Ms Valadian on 18 April 1985 and reiterated my funding offer for specific courses. 9. No. Wannon Electorate: Assets Test (Question No. 1216) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 23 May 1985: Further to the answer by the Minister for Social Security to question No. 458 (Hansard, 17 April 1985, page 1341) relating to the assets test (a) how do people in the electoral division of Wannon find out what the procedures are for appeals and (b) how many appeals have been lodged from pensioners in the Division to 23 May 1985 and how many of those were by people living on fanus.",191
263,Mr HOLDING ,SHEEPMEAT IMPORTS INTO AUSTRALIA FROM NEW ZEALAND,"The Minister for Veterans' pro- Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) In all publicity and advices for the assets test produced by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, contact numbers are provided for any enquiries regarding the conditions of payment and the rights of pensioners. The Department has provided a telephone service for country clients (for the cost of a local call) and suburban clients which is staffed during working hours to help service pensioners with their queries. People in the electoral division of Wannon who have been affected by the assets 'test have been provided with advice of their assessment and with the appropriate numbers to telephone if they wish to discuss any matter, including appeal procedures. (b) There are no data available regarding the number of appeals lodged within anyone electoral division; nor is there information on the number of appeals from farmers by Electoral Divisions.

264,Mr HOLDING ,SHEEPMEAT IMPORTS INTO AUSTRALIA FROM NEW ZEALAND,"The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) In accordance with the emphasis on pensioner selfassessment, wherever possible the pensioners' estimates of the value of their assets were accepted. Some checking was required for certain items, for example the value of shares was checked against current share listings in the financial Press. In cases where pensioners owned real estate (other than the home) and the total value of their assets would have led to reduction in pension; or where the total value was within $20,000 of the allowable limit; or where the departmental officer was not satisfied with the pensioner's estimate, the real estate values were checked by officers of the Valuations Branch of the Australian Taxation Office. (b) The valuations were based on: (i) information provided by the pensioner on the Statement of Assets form; (ii) recent sales information for the area; (iii) information provided by statutory authorities; (iv) local knowledge of the area; and (v) where possible, external inspections. (c) Where possible, external inspections of properties were carried out but, owing to the restrictions of time, most cases were checked against information available in the Valuations Branch Offices, for example, statutory valuations, recent sales information for the area etc. (d) This information is not available-estimated net income of the properties was not calculated as part of the assets test processing. (e) This information is not available-current market rental value of properties was not calculated as part of the assets test processing.
