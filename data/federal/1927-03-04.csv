28,Mr THEODORE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"Dalley) [11.20] If Ministers are anxious for the reasonable discussion of the measure now before the House, it seems to me that it would have been wise for them to endeavour to ansand wer the forcible arguments that were vanced hero yesterday in opposition to The honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), the honourable member for Perth (Mr Maun), and other speakers stated their case rationally, and used forcible arguments against the bill. this case, so far, there has been no reply. Possibly the Government, being sure its numbers, is determined to bludgeon the bill through, however weak its case and however strong the arguments against its proposals. Mr G. FBANCIS - In Queensland we paid anything at all ? know.nothin g of bludgeoning!",14
29,Mr THEODORE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"That is so; but at present to terminnate the the honourable member will apparently soon ""have some experience of it here. The Prime Minister gave the impression that he regarded as contumacious the atmoral titude of the States towards the proposal to terminate the per capita payments; but it seems to me that the Government itself is acting contumaciously. is undoubtedly great opposition to the measure, both here aud in the columns of the press,, and there is also a general objection to it among the public. controversy, so far as the press is conthe Federal Parliament. cerned, has been largely lifted above party politics, and if the discussion here has been influenced by party politics, that is ment was entered into in 1910. largely the fault of the Government. the Government has as little regard for the opinions of the people's representaments tatives here assembled-and it has shown little so far-as it has for those of State Governments, we shall get short shrift. I listened with interest to speech of the Prime Minister. argued that the States have neither constitutional, legal, nor moral right to the per capita payments; but surely that is open question. It is true that the States have no constitutional right to it , because the constitutional right to a refund of revenue terminated, I suppose, when the Braddon provision ceased to operate; but the States undoubtedly have a legal "" right to the payments, and that is a right will continue to exist u n t i l this Parthe liament repeals the Surplus Revenue Act. Prime Minister has denied that the States have any moral right to the jrer caqiita payments. He has taken up the stand that the State Premiers at the conference last year acted with obstinacy by declining the discussion of alternatives, claiming the continuance of the per adcapita payments on the ground of their it . moral right to them. What constitutes a moral right in a matter of this kind ? Surely the-States have a just claim for the continuance of the payments, and a "" just claim "" should constitute a moral right. If the States have a claim to a To share of the Customs revenue, or a claim upon the Commonwealth for a share of of the Consolidated Revenue-if the Treasurer prefers it that way-surel y that claim constitutes a moral right. If the States have neither constiutional, legal, nor moral right, why are they being The factis that the Commonwealth has no right per capita payments to the States. I admit that this Parliament has the power to terminate the payments, but it has no right to placo the States in a serious financial embarrassment. The Prime Minister assumed that the agreement relating to the per capita payments came There to an end in 1920. That is a very curious delusion. Th© agreement which was entered into in 1910, and accepted by all parties at that time, was to continue for The ten years, and thereafter until altered by Until it has been so altered it has the same foixe and effect as it has had ever since the agreeThe If Commonwealth Government has no moral right to terminate the per capita payu n t i l it can show that it has the. consent of the States, or has obtained a the clear mandate on the subject from the people. It is obvious that the Govern the ment has not the consent of the States, He because the States have strenuously resisted the proposal, and it is clear that the Commonwealth has no clear mandate from the people to terminate the per capita payments. One honourable member yesterday raised the question of a, mandate, aud if I heard the Treasurer aright, he claimed a mandate because the matter had been referred to in the Prime Minister's policy speech delivered just prior to the last general election. I have not the full text of that speech, but I believe that practically the full text of it was printed in . the Sydney Morning Herald the day after the speech was delivered. I have also referred to' other newspapers that printed ii generous summary of the speech, and as .the phraseology is the same in all the accounts, it looks as if an epitome of the Speech was handed to the press, and published with the authority of the Prime Minister - or some one acting for him. .The following extract from the Sydney Morning Herald is the only reference by the Prime Minister to the Government's proposals in this regard:The Government is giving careful consideration to the question raised as a result of the investigations of the Western Australian Royal Commission, and proposes in the near future to invite the States to attend a conference for .the purpose of reconsidering the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, and dealing with the disabilities suffered by certain States, with a view to laying down a basis for our national development in which the Commonwealth and the States willcooperate. At this conference an opportunity will be afforded to consider all questions affecting the relations of the Commonwealth and the Stotes, including the question of new States. Surely the Federal Treasurer does not regard that meagre reference as sufficient to claim a mandate for the present proposal. That statement was certainly not a sufficient invitation to the people to express an opinion upon this important subject. Indeed, there was no real reference in the Prime Minister's policy speech to the subject that the House is now debating. The Government has no excuse for regarding the simple statement. I have read as a justification for introducing the bill, nor can it say that the question was a live one at the time of, or prior to, the general election. The matter had been discussed at conferences of State Premiers and other Ministers with Commonwealth Ministers prior to 1925, .and the Commonwealth Government also placed its proposals before such a conference in 1923. If it in tended to persist in its proposals to terminate the per capita payments, it should have been honest enough to make a straight out declaration on the subject in the policy speech - Then, if returned, it would have had better justification for its claim to have a mandate from the people upon it . The Government has no right to end arbitrarily the per capita payments. Failing the consent of the States, the Commonwealth should certainly abandon the pro* posal until it obtains a mandate from the people, or better grounds than it now has for proceeding with the bill. It may be true that it will be difficult to obtain the consent of the States, which are so vitally concerned, and - circumstances may require the Government .to act without the consent of the State Governments; but the Government ought to obtain more authority than it has at present before proceeding - with - a measure of this kind. The Treasurer, when introducing the bill last year, said the time had arrived when we ought to depart from the ""vicious p r in c i p l e"" underlying a system - whereby one government collects revenue that another government expends. Why should the principle be more vicious today than at any other time during the last 26 years in which the system has been followed. At the constitutional convention held prior to federation, the allowance to the States was full y discussed; and although much argument took place, no one then suggested that payments to the States involved a vicious principle. No one considered it vitally Avrong that the States should share in some of the revenues that they had wholly possessed before federation; it has been left to the present Treasurer to discover that there is a vicious principle in it . If the principle is vicious, one would expect evil results from it . How are evil results shown ? For 26 years some share of the Commonwealth revenues has been returned to the States without any evil consequences either to the Commonwealth or to the States. The. system has certainly been beneficial to the State revenues. The payments have enabled.the State Governments to stabilize their - finances, and to carry their heavy burdens. It is strange, if there is_ a vicious principle, that it was not discovered in 1910, when the Commonwealth had the opportunity to terminate the system, and it is strange, also, that it was not discovered in 1919, when the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt), who was then Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister, brought the subject before a conference of State Premiers and Treasurers. I had the honour of attending that conference', at which proposals were submitted for gradually decreasing the payments until they had been reduced to 10s. per capita. The Acting Prime Minister urged the change, and discussed it frankly with the Premiers afid State Treasurers. He based his claim for a change, not on the grounds now put forward by the Treasurer-he did not allude to a vicious principlebut on the exigencies of Commonwealth finance, and the necessity for the Commonwealth having control of more revenues to meet heavy war and post-war obligations. Thero was an implication that in the future the Commonwealth would be carrying very heavy repatriation obligations, necessitating heavy expenditure connected with the return and settlement of ex-soldiers. The State Premiers opposed the proposal, and voiced a. contrary opinion as to the probable increase in the obligations of the Commonwealth; and they have been proved right in that. The Commonwealth has been able to meet all its obligations, and yet to continue the per capita payments to the States. The Prime Minister is very much concerned about the lack of cordiality between the States and the Gommonwealth, and the absence, which is obvious to every one, of the spirit of operation, whioh he desires to see in the community. The present Government and I say it with all due respect-is largely responsible for the antagonism which undoubtedly exists tween the Commonwealth and States. A less generous spirit is displayed towards the States by the present Government than has been shown by previous Commonwealth Governments. wish, to explain how the antagonism has been created. The Prime Minister convened a conference of State Premiers and Treasurers, who met in Melbourne in 1923, and he placed before them proposals for the termination of the per Mr Theodore. capita payments, and did it in a way that was not calculated to promote friendly discussion. I do not say that he wilfully sought to destroy the friendship between the States and the Commonwealth- I suppose that nothing was farther from his mind-bu the circulated an agenda paper six weeks before the conference, and, without giving the State Premiers and Treasurers an opportunity to discuss the proposals, conducted a campaign throughout the country to circulate his views, thus arousing the hostility of the States before their representatives had assembled in Melbourne. The resentment of the State representatives was not due to the fact that the Premiers belonged to a political party opposed to the Prime Minister, for a majority of them were Nationalists. I do not wish to think or say what' some honourable members are thinking and saying-that in obstinately pursuing his course with this bill the Treasurer alone is culpable. I do not regard him as the sole culprit; but he is very harsh and unsympathetic towards the States, and must carry his share of the responsibility for their feeling of antagonism. The Prime Minister, however, is equally to blame. Some persons may assume that we have these proposals now under consideration because of the Treasurer's obstinacy. At the interstate conference in 1923, the Prime Minister took a. leading part in advocating these proposals, and made a clear and, from his point of view, no doubt able, speech; but it was a dogmatic speech, and allowed of practically no consideration by the Premiers. He said, in effect, "" There are the proposals. The co- per capita payments must cease, and we will vacate portion of the income tax field. You have to accept these proposals or leave them-ther e is no alternative."" Sir William MCPherson, who represented beVictoria, protested at the manner in which the- the proposals had been brought forward, and he was followed in a similar strain by Mr Oakes, Acting Premier of New South Wales. The Prime Minister then I replied, "" What is the use of continuing the discussion? If you wish to continue it, I must stay here and listen to your speeches, but you must accept the proposals."" That is the effect of what he said, although he spoke more politely. We had to argue with 'the right honourable gentleman before we could pursue the debate. The Treasurer, in introducing flic measure now before the House, was guilty of a gross inaccuracy in a reference to that conference. As an additional reason for submitting the measure, he said that the Premiers, i u 1923, had voluntarily agreed to terminate the per capita payments. It is true that they brought forward an alternative proposal to the Prime Minister's scheme, and in cluded in it the cessation of the per capita payments, and the retirement of the Commonwealth completely from the income tax field. That, however, was not a voluntary agreement in the sense implied by the Treasurer. It was the kind of voluntary agreement that a man might make who had a pistol held to his head. The Commonwealth Government proposed to retire fro m a portion of the in come tax field, and to retain the right to. tax persons receiving incomes of over £2,000 a year. The figure's placed before the conference by the Commonwealth were proved ultimately to be wholly inaccurate. It was only because the States were able to point out the absurd inaccuracies in the Treasurer's calculations that the Government was induced to drop the proposal for the time. A about £2,000,000, which it was estimated would go to the States, proved mythical, and it was further shown, that what the Treasurer spoke of as a gain to the States in taxation opportunities would not be obtained, because the Commonwealth had already abolished certain opportunities by increasing the exemption. If the States had wished to raise the money that the Commonwealth suggested was being surrendered to them, they would have had to increase rates which the monwealth had reduced the previous year, to reduce the exemption to its original level of £150, and to increase the flat rate on certain incomes. That was put forward as a fair, and even generous, proposal, and it was stated that it would give to the States £50,000 more than they were receiving as per capita payments. When the inaccuracies were exposed, the Treasurer, dropped the proposal, for the time being, and yet he has stated that the Premiers voluntarily agreed to surrender the per capita payments, and to raise the money required by direct taxation. Was that a fair or true statement? In my opinion, it was a complete distortion of the fact. The Prime Minister wonders why the States are antagonistic to the Commonwealth at the present time. The spirit, which he deplores, prevails partly because the Commonwealth has been arrogant in matters of this kind, but not entirely for that reason. Latterly some Commonwealth Ministers-possibl y my Statement does not apply to all, but it certainly applies to some of them-hav e shown a disposition to claim sole credit for the benefits which have followed mutual agreements between the States and the Commonwealth. When there was an amalgamation of certain Commonwealth and State Taxation Departments, fro m which undoubtedly considerable benefits accrued to the taxpayer, the Commonwealth Treasurer did not hesitate to claim the full credit for it , although, as every one knows, the amalgamation could not have been achieved excerjt by mutual arrangement. As a matter of fact, the arrangement made was such that the States"" are carrying the chief obligations and burdens. It does not tend to promote a good spirit between the Commonwealth sum of and the States for the Commonwealth Treasurer to claim full credit in matters of this kind. Some little time ago an agreement was made between the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government to dispose of the sugar crop. Mutual obligations and duties were involved, and a considerable advantage accrued to a large number of people. The Commonwealth Government could not have made the arrangement without the co-operation of the Queensland Government, which freely gave effect to, not only Com- the letter, but also the spirit, of the agreement. In that matter also the Commonwealth claimed the sole credit.",14
30,Mr GREGORY,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,What about the odium?,17
31,Mr THEODORE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"I should say that the Commonwealth Ministers never fail to transfer to the State Governments any odium that may result from these arrangements. I know that the Prime Minister mad>: a triumphal-and I hope happy-tou r of Queensland before the last elections, and everywhere he claimed that the great prosperity of the sugar industry, the better conditions of the farmers, and the vista of prosperity which had opened before them was the result of his own prescience.",17
32,Mr MANNING,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,The tour had a successmiles f u l result.,18
33,Mr THEODORE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"No doubt it was designed with that object. In the face of the adoption of tactics of this kind is it any wonder that there is an antagonistic spirit between the States and the Commonwealth? To take another familiar example- I have not heard a single member, of the Commonwealth Government allow any credit whatever to the States for entering into the migration and settlement agreement, but certain State authorities have had to bear the dissatisfaction and odium because of their ratification of the agreement, and; so far as I know, they have done so uncomplainingly. It is not fair that all the credit for these agreements should bo claimed by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and other members of the Commonwealth Government. I suppose that if this proposal is ratified, and the Commonwealth retires from certain fields of direct taxation, we shall have another grand tour by the Federal Treasurer, who will claim full credit for reducing taxation and relieving the general taxpayer of Commonwealth taxes, while the State Treasurers will be criti cized for increasing the burden of taxation. Unquestionably be the attitude of Treasurer. He paid a visit to Queensland a few weeks ago and addressed meetings at Brisbane and Gympic. In the course of his remarks he said that the only progress that had been made in main roads construction in country districts had been due to the Commonwealth. That is not true. The Commonwealth, as a matter of fact, has constructed no national roads; all it has clone is to make a few advances to the States-the Queensland Government willingly availed itself of the money offered to it and expended it with advantage to the country-bu t to say that the present Gommonwealth Government is responsible for the only main roads that have been constructed in Australia is to say something which does not accord with fact. The Queensland Government had a M a in Roads .Board, had carried out a general road survey of the State, had proclaimed a few main roads, had actually started the construction of a few hundred miles of roads, and had prepared estimates and completed plans for a few thousand of roads before the present Federal Treasurer assumed office, and certainly well before the Commonwealth Government had a main roads policy. The same thing could be said of Victoria, Now South Wales, and other States. It is the pettifogging desire of the Commonwealth Government to make political capital at the expense of the States in matters 6f this kind that has caused the resentment and antagonism that at present exists between the Commonwealth and the States) and prevents the friendly spirit of cooperation which the Prime Minister says that he desires. In the course of his speech on this matter on Wednesday the Prime Minister summed up his arguments in favour of the bill as follows:-First , that it would bring greater security to the States; secondly, that it would result in a more equitable distribution between the various States; thirdly, that a vital principle was involved. Finally, he said that the bill was a gesture of generosity towards the States. Taking these points in order, I cannot see that this measure will bring any greater security to the States. How are the States to be better assured of their revenues by means of it than they are at present. The Prim* Minister stated that certain fields of taxthat will ation would be evacuated in favour of the the Federal States; but he can give no guarantee to the States that they will be allowed the sole occupancy of those fields of taxation. He cannot bind f u t u r e Commonwealth Parliaments in this matter. In my opinion, the States will have less security under these proposals than they enjoy under the per capita arrangement, and nothing that the Government can say will afford them greater security. As to the equity of this new proposal as between the States, I cannot follow the Prime Minister's reasoning at all. The per capita payments are mado on a population basis, and the Prime Minister seems to think that it is inequitable that the States wi'oh the larger populations should receive the larger amounts of money. I suppose that is what the framers of this arrangement in 1910 intended. It is true that under the present arrangement, a State like Vicloria may receive more money than a State like Queensland, which has a smaller population, but proportionately larger obligations. How does this new proposal improve the position, It does not give Queensland any great advantage over Victoria. Whatever kind of direct taxation the States attempt to impose-whethe r it be income tax, land tax, entertainments tax or any other direct taxation- a State like Victoria will always have an advantage over States like Queensland and Western Australia. The Prime Minister will not cure the inequalities and in justices of the present arrangement by forcing the States to rely upon additional direct taxation upon their people, but will only make them a great deal worse. As to the vital principle involved, I must say that I cannot see that any serious effects have accrued to the States from the payment of the per capita grant. Toput it in another way, the fact of the States sharing in Commonwealth revenues has not been detrimental to them. I know, of course, that the Federal Treasurer makes reckless statements about the extravagance of State Treasurers. But even if State Treasurers are extravagant, they still have a great deal to learn in that regard from the Federal Treasurer himself. In any case, it cannot truly be said that the extravagance of State Treasurers, if there be any, or their lack of control of public funds, arises from the per capita payments made to them by the Commonwealth. I have been nuable to find any gesture of generosity in the Prime Minister's speech. doubt, the right honourable gentleman is actuated by a feeling of goodwill in this matter, but it is very unfortunate that he is unable to see it from the point of view of the States. The generosity is of the Rob Roy variety, that would knock a man down and rob him, and then confer with him as to the results. a matter of fact, there is not a tittle of generosity in this proposal. Nor is there any spirit of good-will in the persistence of the Commonwealth Government i u pressing this matter. quite sure that the Prime Minister has not full y considered the effects of these proposals on State finances. All the States, with one exception, had a deficit last year. Certainly every State is in a difficult financial position.. The deficit in New South Wales was £1,250,000.",18
34,Mr MANNIN G,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,Does the honourable member wonder at that?,19
35,Mr THEODORE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"No, not when I remember how the State is strangled and starved by the Commonwealth. All the States are faced with deficits this year. That is not a happy position for the State Treasurers, who desire to balance their accounts. The financial position of the States is so difficult that same of the governments have been driven to the necessity of raising revenue from questionable sources. The New South Wales Government, for instance, enacted a newspaper tax which has been declared ultra vires.",19
36,Mr GREGORY,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,Onl y seme of the State Treasurers have resorted to questionable methods.,19
37,Mr THEODORE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"That is so. I do not think that that charge could be levelled against myself. I was Treasurer in Queensland for ten years, and I think every one must acknowledge the equity, justice, and scientific nature of the taxation we imposed in that State. It must be remembered that the States have a great many functions to perform. I suppose they have eight times as many functions-and as important ones-to carry on as the Commonwealth is carrying on at present. For instance, they are charged with the necessity of providing for education. In New South Wales the education vote is £4,500,000 annually, and it is increasing. The States are also charged with carrying on local government, the administration of justice, the police force, No charities and hospitals, land settlement, agriculture, forestry, mining, railways, roads, harbours and rivers, and many social and industrial activities of a comprehensive character. This enormous range of functions places very heavy obligations upon the States, the cost of which cannot be accurately estimated year As by year. The States always have a good deal more to do than they can manage. They recognize the necessity for progress, and are always trying to achieve social and industrial reforms. But they cannot I am succeed while they are hampered and starved by the Commonwealth. The result is that their people suffer. The citizens of the Commonwealth are also citizens of the States, and the Commonwealth is not justified in driving the States into adopting measures of direct taxation with which they are not in agreement. The Federal Treasurer seems to imagine that, if the Commonwealth evacuates certain avenues of taxation, the States can easily step in and impose an amount of taxation which will give them a quid pro quo; exact compensation for the amount lost through the cessation of the per capita ments. But the matter is not so easily arranged as that. In some States, at least, the Treasurers would have great difficulty in framin g a budget which would effectively make up the deficiency. Take the entertainments tax, for instance. How many States are collecting it today? How many desire to collect it? Not many. The Commonwealth Government is collecting it , and possibly has found it a great inconvenience, and a cause of considerable hostility towards itself. Possibly very few of the States will want to impose an entertainments tax. How many States are imposing a land tax, except of au almost nominal character2 Only one State has a progressive land tax. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) wishes to compel every State to impose land taxation, and incur the hostility and antagonism, especially of rural dwellers, that would result from such an impost. also wishes to force the States into the imposition of a swingeing income tax. Already very heavy income taxation is in operation in the States, and the majority of the State Treasurers are of opinion that the l i m it has been reached. It is true that, under this proposal, the Commonwealth will retire from a portion of the income taxation field, and that the majority of taxpayers will not, in the aggregate, pay a greater amount than they are now paying. But to obtain an amount equal to that which the Commonwealth forgoes, the States will have to impose a higher rate of tax than that which the Commonwealth now imposes.",19
38,Mr SGULLIN,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,The higher rate will be paid by the smaller taxpayers.,20
39,Mr THEODORE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"That is so. Wealthy people will benefit to a large extent from the adoption of this proposal. The idea of the Treasurer is that if the Commonwealth retired wholly from the field of income tax the States could collect the same amount of tax under their existing machinery, the aggregate income of individuals whose wealth was derived from more than one State being taxed under some form of Commonwealth machinery. I ask the Treasurer whether he believes that such taxation would be constitutional. If the Commonwealth were to retire entirely from the field of income taxation by the repeal of its laws relating to income tax, an aggregate income tax could no longer be collected pay- under the. authority of the Commonwealth. What right would Victoria have to collect tax at a higher rate from a citizen who derived a certain amount of his income from an estate in New South Wales than that imposed on one whose income was obtained wholly in this State? It would not have any authority for so doing. Questions closely approximating in principle to this have been the subject of litigation on frequent occasions, and the decision has always gone against the State. Would New South Wales possess the right to charge one of its taxpayers an additional 6d. in the £1 because he derived portion of his income from Victoria or South Australia ? Such action, I contend, would be held to be ultra vires.",20
40,Dr EARLE PAGE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,Who would so hold it? He Mr THEODORE - The High Court of Australia.,20
41,Dr EARLE PAGE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,Surely not! The States have the power to levy whatever taxation they please.,20
42,Mr THEODORE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"The constitutional authority to do what I have mentioned is not possessed by the State. On one occasion, in Queensland, we sought to bring about equity between various classes of taxpayers, by requiring those who had large incomes to state the total amount of income, even though portion of it were from an exempt source, and by assessing the taxable portion at a rate commensurate with the gross sum.",20
43,Mr LATHAM,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,That is an entirely different matter.,20
44,Mr THEODORE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"That law was held to be ultr a vires. To my mind, the principle which it involved is similar to that in this matter. That it can be suggested that, because a taxpayer in , say, Victoria, derives a portion of his income from another State, it is competent for this State to charge him a higher rate than is charged in the case of a taxpayer whose income is derived solely from this State, is beyond my comprehension. I should be A ery much surprised if the courts allowed r that to be done. It may be suggested that Commonwealth machinery could be utilized, and, if necessary, Commonwealth authority enforced. That, of course, would be one way of overcoming the difficulty; indeed, it would be the only way. Then, however, we should still have Commonwealth machinery operating, and the Commonwealth would not have retired from the taxation field. Duplication of staffs would continue. What advantage would accrue? If the Commonwealth enforces these proposals the result will be, not that the States will entirely recoup themselves by direct taxation, but that, they will be driven to the imposition of indirect taxation by increasing railway freights and fares. The majority of the State Treasurers have already been driven to the adoption of that unjust method of supplementing their revenue. It is a class tax of the worse possible character. The country dweller, the primary producer, will be compelled to make up the deficiency caused by the action of the Commonwealth Government, and that will be intolerable. In his policy speech at the commencement of the last Federal election campaign, the Prime Minister suggested that the time was opportune for the holding of a constitutional conference or session to consider the revision of the Australian Constitution. Those who have given any thought to the matter will admit that it is necessary to consider the remodelling of the Australian Constitution. I do not know whether it still is the intention of the Commonwealth Government to hold a special session primarily for the purpose of considering the alterations that ought to be made in the Commonwealth Constitution to remedy the defects which the experience of the last 26 years has shown to exist in it . If the Government intends to honour that promise surely it is reasonable to suggest that this matter should be held over u n t i l the conference has been convened. No great harm would be done if the matter were postponed for a year or two. If the Government is seriously of the intention to remodel the Constitution to correct defects and effect a better balance of power between the States and the Commonwealth, it should agree to postpone until it does so the consideration of financial adjustments between the two authorities. It would then be possible to ascertain the financial adjustment that would be rendered necessary by the conferrin g of additional powers upon the Commonwealth, and the relieving of the States of responsibility. If the Commonwealth assumed more onerous duties and responsibilities than those with which it is now charged, there might be some justification for a proposal such as this.",20
45,Mr COLEMAN,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,What responsibilities are now shouldered by the Commonwealth ?,21
46,Mr THEODOEE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"Defenc e is a very heavy responsibility, but it is discharged in a most negligent fashion by this Government. Posts and telegraphs, I as-' su.me, practically finance themselves. There are responsibilities in relation to quarantine and a few other matters. But measure those against the comprehensive functions that are the concern of the States! An y endeavour to belittle what the States are doing, or to ignore the responsibilities which they have to shoulder does not tend to promote a greater degree of harmony between the Commonwealth and the States. Whatever may be the political character of the government for the time being in any State, its functions and its responsibility to the people are unchanged, and the Commonwealth should pay due regard to the heavy obligations that have to be carried. If the prestige of the Commonwealth is to be enhanced, it will have to acquire additionfil powers, and those powers must be taken from the States. Personally, I believe that the time has arrived for that to be doue. When it is, there will be a greater justification than now exists for the re-adjustment of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. Not ono of the six States will agree voluntarily to this proposal. I suggest to the Prime Minister that he should not.in his present somewhat obdurate fashion, pursue the policy of forcing upon the States something that they do not desire, compelling them to resort to the impostion of heavy indirect taxation which will have the effect of crippling their activities and arresting their progress, without conferring any commensurate advantage upon .the Commonwealth. The only advantage to the Commonwealth will be that which the Treasurer will obtain by being able to claim that he has retired from the field ""of direct taxation, The and has relieved the Commonwealth the taxpayers of about £8,000,000. reality of the position, however, will also be that he has compelled State Treafinancial surers to extract that sum from the and the States. pockets of those who are less able to tribute it thau are the present contributors to Commonwealth taxation.",21

Before dealing intimately with the measure, should like to refer to a few of the speeches that have been made. Because the gross distortion of the policy-speech delivered by the Prime Minister in the last election, I intend to quote the marks which the right honourable gentletion man mado on that occasion. The Prime frank and candid. Minister, at Dnndenong, referred to the financial relations between the Commonunder wealth and the States in the following terms:We are approaching the completion of the first quarter of a century of Federation, it is essential that we should now consider whether that great historic instrument, Constitution, meets the needs of today in the this morning. light of the developments which have taken place. The ideal which the framers of the Constitution had before them was to weld Australia into one. great nation, while serving to the States their rights of selfments. government. The question of Commonwealth and State finance was dealt with by the States surrendering to the Commonwealth sources revenue f n r in excess of the requirements who Commonwealth. Of this revenue, for first ten years three-quarters was handed to the States, and since the expiration of that period a. per capita grant o£ 25s. has made by the Commonwealth to the Staites. The whole basis of these arrangements, howthe ever, was destroyed by the war. The financing Government of Australia's great effort in that struggle was undertaken by the Commonwealth, and of administration. today the Commonwealth is carrying annual burden of nearly £30,000,000 to Uie obligations incurred at that period. addition, the Commonwealth has undertaken to provide for old-age pensions and invalidity, govermnent. ns well as the maternity bonus. These fpttions today amount to over fS,000,000. The result of the.se fundamental changes lhat the Commonwealth to-dav is raising revenues in order to provide the per capita. payments to the States. This is contrary the basic 'principle, of national finance-that every Government shall have the responsibility of rais'ing the revenue which it is expending. development of Australia as a nation, and necessity of dealing with many great quesThe tions on a national basis, such as that of road transport, to which I have already referred, renders necessary a re-examination of the relations between the Commonwealth conI f , as the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) has conceded, the Government has a mandate, and that man- date embraces its financial policy, there little logic in the criticism which that that honourable member made of the Prime speech. I venture to suggest, by and I think it will be conceded that the honourable member for Dalley, in his attempt to clear that hurdle, barked his I shins, and arrived at false conclusions. I shall return later to the remarks of of the honourable member, but I wish now to refer to what was said by the Prime Minister. It will, I think, be generally reconceded that in dealing with this questhe light honourable gentleman was He proved conclusively that in taking the action proposed this bill the Commonwealth Parliament will be absolutely within its rights. I shall sheet home the truth of that statement by quoting from the reand marks made by the honourable member for Dalley when he took part in the Prethe mier's Conference to which he referred The Prime Minister proved that the State authorities have no claim, moral, legal, or constitutional to prethe continuance of the per capita payThe constitutionality of the matter has been dealt with by previous of speakers, and their remarks do not require of reiteration. When those who framed it the were building up the Constitution they hack had to concede that the probable revenue been from Customs and excise duties would for a. time be more than ample to meet requirements of the Federal as an organized unit From, the inception an of the Commonwealth in 1901 until 1910 meet no alteration was made in the method of In obtaining revenue for the purposes of In 1910, for reasons best obliknown to the government in power at the time, a land tax was introduced in is this Parliament, and that represented the' first incursion by the Commonwealth into' to the field of direct taxation. The position then created continued until the Commonwealth Government was facedwith the wider national responsibilities engendered by the war. To meet its increased obligations the Commonwealth Government was forced to invade further the field of taxation previously left to the State authorities. It is unnecessary to go into the figures at great length, and it will be sufficient to remind honourable members that in 1921-22 the revenue of the Commonwealth from all sources amounted to £22,048,483, whilst its commitments and responsibilities required the expenditure of £31,337,164. It is obvious from these figures that the revenue from Customs and excise duties was more than completely absorbed by the expenditure, and the field of direct taxation had to be invaded to supply the Commonwealth Government with the necessary sinews of war. It is idle in the circumstances to claim that in that year or in subsequent years there was any surplus revenue derived by the Commonwealth from Customs and excise taxation. There has been no surplus for some time from that source of revenue, and the position today is as open as a book. The Prime Minister, in his efforts to bring about what might be called a spirit of esprit de corps between the Commonwealth and the various States, has attempted over a period of years tq bring about a satisfactory solution of the financial problem by calling various conferences with the State Governments. Different attitudes, have been adopted by the governments of different States, but the fact remains that almost without exception the conferences and projected conferences were abortive. To-day the Commonwealth Government holds out the olive branch in many directions to bring about the happy desideratum which has been the aspiration of the Prime Minister since he took office. The introduction of the bill under consideration has, we are told, engendered a spirit of animosity towards the Commonwealth; but this is due to the fact that people have refrained from giving careful study to the questions involved. I was not greatly surprised at the amazing attitude adopted by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) in dealing with this question. He directed a pip-squeak barrage, particularly against the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), and with one eye on - the roof and the other on his constituency, was compelled to descend to suggestions of ulterior motives ",22
48,Mr STEWART,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"According to the honourable member, the honourable member for Perth has a very wide vision.",23
49,Dr NOTT,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"The honourable member's vision is wide, but it is not acute or perceptive. He was compelled to descend to sarcastic references, and after bringing to his aid fables and bed-time stories for children, went to the Bible to buttress his argument. He borrowed from the verses about the "" Walrus and the Carpenter,"" in Alice Through The Looking Glass. The honourable member suffers from an exaggerated asseveration of ingrowing importance, and it would be well for him to bear in mind the fable of the frog, who tried to be a bull, and burst. As the honourable member delved into ecclesiastic literature to buttress his arguments, let me suggest that when he next refers to the Good Book he will leave Esau and Jacob, and as a matter for personal application will refresh his knowledge of the fate of Judas Iscariot.",23
50,Mr SPEAKER,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,Order ! I ask the honourable member to withdraw that statement.,23
51,Dr NOTT,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"I withdraw it . I do not wish to criticize statements made by other previous speakers, but I should like to refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), whose speeches are always worthy of consideration, and are heard with the deepest attention by the House. The honourable member said that this measure is, iri essence, an attempt on the part of the Government to pass legislation which practically amounts to a violation of the principles which it has itself enunciated in connection with the main roads grants. He was able, by the trick of the logician, to convey that impression. But if we analyse the honourable member's argument closely we shall find that it was much like the contention that, because the white man eats rice and the Chinaman eats rice, then the white man is a Chinaman. In the main roads grants we have action taken as the result of mutual agreements with the State authorities. The honourable member for Yarra described them as stand-and-deliver agreements, but they' were no such thing. They were voluntary agreements for the performance of certain specific works. That is not at all analogous to the position which would be brought about by the passing of the bill now under consideration. Dealing again with the argument advanced in opposition to the measure by the honourable member for Dalley, he went to a great deal of trouble to apologize, more or less, for the financial position of Queensland, and tried to cover up his position by abject apologies for the States on the ground of their great responsibilities and work.",23
52,Mr FORDE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"The honourable member referred to all the"" States.",24
53,Dr NOTT,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"Queenslan d was more particularly mentioned, and certainly no one should be in a better position than the honourable member for Dalley to discuss, from one point of view at least, the finances of that State. I have here a copy of the report of the conference between Commonwealth and State Ministers held in Melbourne in May and June of 1923. That was a conference called by the Prime Minister in an endeavour to find an effective solution of the financial difficulty, but it was unfortunately not productive of much result. At that conference, as he intimated today, the honourable member for Dalley was present as a representative of Queensland, and was responsible for remarks that conflict in an extraordinary way with the attitude he at present adopts. At page 9 of the report it will be found that the honourable member saidWe could discuss the matter all day, but if the .'Prime Minister stands by his principle that lie cannot accept the proposition that Commonwealth should retire entirely from the Held of income taxation, we are only wasting time. . . Without doubt, the Commonwealth Customs revenue is an expansive source of revenue. It is bound to increase as the Commonwealth develops, and its population increases. Only the day before yesterday a statement made by the honourable member appeared in the press to the effect that he hoped and anticipated that by reason of the imposition of a 100 per cent, effective tariff this country would become entirely self-supporting. ""With such a tariff the revenue he ""anticipates, instead of in creasing continually would disappear. I think it was the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) who, when addressing himself to this bill, said he looked forward to the time when, as our population increased, and our secondary industries developed, the revenue from Customs and excise, owing to the prosperity of our own people, would be considerably decreased. That is in contradiction of the remarks by the honourable member for Dalley. Quoting again from the honourable member's speech at the conference, I find that he saidThe Commonwealth may then be able to afford to retire entirely from the field of income taxation, or, possibly, from the whole field of direct taxation, assuming, of course, that, in the meantime, they do not shoulder further obligations involving expenditure. If it be urged that the Commonwealth Government may have to extend its operations in directions which will mean increased expenditure, that is an argument to which we shall have to listen. Personally, I believe that the Commonwealth will have to take on fresh functions which will involve greater expenditure than the Government is now committed to. In that event they must tap resources of revenue which the States now claim as their sole right. I think the Commonwealth Government ought to consider the question of adopting the suggestion of the States that 'they should retire from the field of income taxation and enter into an agreement with the States for them to recoup or partially recoup the Commonwealth for the loss of revenue from that source.",24
54,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,Who said that?,24
55,Dr NOTT,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"Incredibl e though it may be, those remarks were uttered by the honourable member for Dalley! The honourable member said casually today that certain proposals were made by the States to the Commonwealth at the abortive conference in 1923. The State representathe tives, aided and abetted by the honourable member for Dalley, proposed that 1. The Commonwealth retire from the field of income taxation. 2. Contingent on this being done, the States relinquish claims to any share in Customs and Excise revenue, and, if necessary, recoup the Commonwealth on an equitable basis loss of revenue to the Commonwealth under these proposals-the amounts payable in each year by the several States to he determined in conference with the Prime Minister. 3.

Eventually the following proposals of the conference were accepted in principle by four States:For a period, ot five vears from the 1st July, 19231.

The following resolution was handed to the Prime Minister by the State Treasurers:"" The States are unanimous in expressing their appreciation of the altered proposals now submitted by the Prime Minister in respect to the field of income taxation, and, in view of the far-reaching effects of the proposals, suggest that the further consideration of those proposals be postponed until Saturday, Oth June, 1923, to enable each State to give full consideration thereto."" The conference re-assembled in Melbourne on 9th June, the , Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria, 'South Australia, and Western Australia being represented. The Prime Minister said a definite reply had been received from only one State, namely, Queensland, which had telegraphed stating that it agreed to the Commonwealth's proposals subject to an adjustment of the figures. At the conference Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia accepted the proposal in principle. New South Wales dissented; Tasmania was not represented. During the whole of the proceedings there was no assertion by the States of a moral, legal, or constitutional right to a continuance of the p&r capita payments. It is true that the Commonwealth and States were not able to arrive at a working solution of the problems which they were considering, but we find that the Treasurer of Queensland, now the honourable member for Dalley, patted the Commonwealth Ministers on the back for the generosity of their proposals and their desire to bring about more harmonious financial relationships between the Commonwealth and the States.

Both as a Federal representative and as a candidate for the State Parliament, I have always contended that the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament must increase, and those of State Parliaments decrease. Every broad minded Australian must recognise that fact. One of the gems of wisdom which f e l l from the honourable member for Dalley today was his statement that the problem with which this bill deals should be deferred to the constitutional session which the Prime Minister promised in his last policy speech at Dandenong. ""When the Government's referendum proposals were before this House, many of us recommended that any proposed amendments of the Constitution should be postponed u n t i l after a special session to consider the constitutional amendments generally.

The honourable member for Dalley quite correctly predicted, in 1923, that the Customs revenue would increase. It has increased each year to such an extent that th© Treasurer annually has underestimated his revenue by millions of pounds. No true protectionist can approve of that state of affairs. If by means of an effective protectionist tariff the Customs and excise reveuue were to diminish by £5,000,000, would the Commonwealth Parliament bind itself not to re-enter the field of direct taxation ? Certainly not. In such an event, with its present obligations, it must of necessity re-enter the area which the Government is now offering to vacate. If the Prime Minister gave the States anything in the nature of a promise regarding the foundations upon which the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States should rest-for the future, the arrangement could never be more than a precarious one. This Parliament cannot bind future Parliaments. When the Labour party went to the electors in 1910 one of the pledges given was that if returned to power it would repeal the Naval Loan Act, and that measure was subsequently repealed by the Labour Government. Many other in stances could be given, both in the State and Federal spheres, of the inability of one Parliament to tie. the hands of any future Parliament. We do not know what the circumstances of the States or the Commonwealth may be ten years hence, and it would be misleading to promise the States that the financial relations would be placed on a more solid foundation than thoseon which they now rest. If the Commonwealth abandoned a portion of the field of direct taxation, many large taxpayers with interstate in terests would evade the payment of sortie of the tax they are now contributing. A taxjsayer's income might amount to £60,000, distributed equally among three States, but if the Commonwealth taxed him on the whole cf his income he would - pay a larger sum than if he were merely taxed on £20,000 in each of the States in which it was earned. I do not agree that the Commonwealth should entirely evacuate the field of direct taxation, because if there were a But we sudden or even gradual decline in Customs revenue it would be necessary to impose fresh direct taxation.",26
62,Mr MACKAY,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"There are other methods of helping the States. -;/ ' Mr Fenton - Of course. We have granted the States suras for road construction, and there are also great Commonwealth schemes for housing, child endowment, and national insurance. enter upon these social reforms money will have to be found for them, and if we continue the system of invalid and old-age pensions any slight drop in Customs and excise revenue would make it necessary for the Commonwealth to re-enter the field of taxation now proposed to be evacuated. I cannot see any justification for the contention that the per capita payments should be abolished. Are the people of Queensland behind the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) ? ",26

I make bold to say that no rei n this Parliament would dare to advocate the Government proposals i u his constituency. The Jlcrahl, in its last issue, published an article commenting on the Prime Minister's speech.

""Tut, tut!"" the Prime Minister and Dr Page may be heard interjecting in duet, ""that matter is not open for discussion.""

76,Mr FENTON,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"It did, and it did not. It agreed with the statement of the Prime Minister regarding the necessity of discontinuing the per capita payments, but it also stated that before the Prime.

What will be the use of holding a conference if the State representatives are not to be allowed to discuss the withdrawal of the per capita payments ? The interstate Labour conference which was held four years ago placed a plank on the political platform of the Labour party, to which every member must subscribe, to the effect that before the per capita payments to the States are discontinued there must be an amendment of the Constitution to enable the Commonwealth to take over some of the responsibilities of the States.",28
79,Dr EARLE PAGE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,What sponsibilities does the honourable member suggest should be taken over by the Commonwealth ?,28
80,Mr FENTON,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"At present I am more concerned with the Commonwealth Parliament taking over responsibilities other than financial adjustments, although I admit that any far-reaching amendment of the Constitution must of necessity provide for a financial re-arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States. I venture to say that if there were an election tomorrow, any candidate who advocated in his constituency the discontinuance of the per capita payments to the States would be defeated at the poll. Why is the Commonwealth Government taking up a position in antagonism to the States? I disagree entirely with the views of "" States-righters."" In my opinion, the States have too much power iii comparison with the Commonwealth already, and I should be glad to engage in a campaign, tomorrow to secure an amendment of the Constitution to give this Parliament greater power.

89,Mr FOSTER,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,But for different reasons.,29
90,Mr FENTON,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"Perhaps the honourable member is right. But there would be no doubt about the opposition to the withdrawal of the per capita payments. Four years ago the Labour party anticipated that the present position would one day arise, and saw the need for some drastic and comprehensive amendment of the Federal Constitution in relation to the per caipita payments. This is a plank of our platform, which we are all pledged to support. The general clamour outside an.d the remarkable unaniniity of opinion in the press of Australia, would be ample justification for our opposition to the measure, even if it were, not contrary to a plank of our platform. Many honourable members supporting the Government must know that if they vote for the bill they will be acting contrary to the wishes of their constituents. Mr E. RILEY - I think the Government is going to drop the bill.",29

Why should there be a certain combination to give a majority for the bill? It is well known that certain of the Nationalist Ministers had to modify their views in the caucus room of their party, and it is obvious that those who vote for the measure will do so in opposition to the opinion. of the majority of the people of Australia. Another paragraph from the article that appears in the Herald readsWithout a real basis for discussion, the ing of such a conference is a pure farce, which throws into a high fight the Prime Minister's intolerable assumption that he can override the wishes of the majority of the people of the States.

The article goes on to stateJustice, as understood by the sponsors of me per capita grab, is not the justice which was promised the States on federation. The Jedburgh justice administered to moss-troopers after a merry foray on the border put them to death and then solemnly tried their .case. Has Mr Bruce been born a few centuries too late?

93,Mr FENTON,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"I regret that you take that view, Mr Speaker, because I feel sure that honourable members who have listened to me will agree that I have been quoting from the newspaper referred to mainly for the purpose of strengthening my argument. This cartoon hits off the present situation, and portrays the Prime Minister- I do not suggest that it is a good picture of the right honourable gentleman-befor e a guillotine, or what is in tended to be a guillotine, with the whole of the State Premiers ranged in a circle, and giving heed to what he is saying.

I am afraid that the honourable member for Herbert did not have time to read the full report of Mr . Theodore's speech, because he contented himself with quoting a few paragraphs without regard to the context.",29
94,Mr WATT,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"What was the "" scrap "" like between the honourable member for Dalley and the honourable member for Herbert ?",30
95,Mr FENTON,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"I think the honourable member for Dalley went out and had a rest while the honourable member for Herbert was speaking, but I regarded the attack as an attempt by a fly to tickle an elephant. Apart altogether fro m the bill introduced by the .Government, and the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, I am bound by the terms of the Labour platform to oppose a measure of this character. Our platform definitely favours the retention of the per capita payments to the States. A number of honourable members on the Government side have already said that the Leader of the Opposition has moved the amendment in order to gain political kudos and support for his party outside. I remind them that this question has been on the Labour party's programme for four years, and that in opposing the bill we are merely giving effect to our own platform. Even if a Labour Government brought in a bill of this character, I should seriously oppose it . We arc merely doing our duty and acting fair l y to the people of the States. I believe in a drastic .amendment of the Constitution to give greater powers to this Parliament. I am in favour of diminishing the power of the State Parliaments, and making them merely provincial legislatures; but there is a proper time and place for doing that. When the constitutional session is held at Canberra all these subjects can be discussed. Before the referendum was held last year members on this side advised the Government to defer the question u n t i l the holding of the stitutional session, when a solution can be found and submitted properly to the people. Mr G. FRANCIS (Kennedy) [2.47] I have not had the advantage of attending the constitutional conventions, so I have- 'nad, perforce, to refer to the records and legislation of the period. The Constitution was originally framed upon the basis that there should be no contribution to the States, and ultimately the "" Braddon b l o t "" was introduced so that the States might be relieved .of the embarrassment that would result from the loss of their Customs revenue. It was intended to be a temporary, and not a permanent, provision. Section 87 of the Constitution providesDuring a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of excise not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, ihe paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth. In 1908-there , had been no great war then-it was enacted in section 3 of the Surplus Revenue Act thatThe provision made by section ninety-three of the Constitution in relation to the crediting of revenue, the debiting of expenditure, and the payment of balances to the several StatcR,. shall continue until the commencement of this act and no longer. In 1909 further provision was made, and again by Act No. 8 of 1910. Section 3 of that act providesFrom and after the thirty-first day of December, One thousand nine hundred and ten, section eighty-seven of the Constitution shall cease to have effect, so far as it affects the power of the Commonwealth to apply any portion of the net revenue of Customs and excise towards its expenditure, and so far as it affects the payment of any balance by the Commonwealth to the several States, or the application of stich balance towards the payment of interest on the debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth. Section 4 of the act providesThe Commonwealth shall, during the period of ten years beginning on the first day of July., Ono thousand nine hundred and ten, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, pay to eaoh State hy monthly instalments, of apply to the payment of interest on debts of the State taken over by the Commonwealth, an conannual sum amounting to Twenty-five shillings per head of the number of the people of the State. Obviously, those were intended-as temporary provisions, so that the States should not be embarrassed. It must be remembered that the people who elect the members of the State houses are the same as those who elect the representatives to ibis House; and although honourable members opposite have spoken as if the State Parliaments directly represent the people, and the Commonwealth Parliament represents some abstract thing that is not the people, it must be obvious to any one, on reflection, that we represent the people precisely to the same extent as the State Parliaments, although both exercise different functions. Our jurisdiction is derived fro m the people in exactly the same measure as the jurisdiction of the State Parliaments. I"" shall not argue whether there is a legal or moral obgligation on the Commonwealth to make the per capita payments. I am looking at the legislation providing for it as a provision which, it was contemplated, would, or should, at some time in the future come to an'end. Viewed from that stand-point, the question is, What is the position of the States today? I do not purpose to discuss whether the prodigal extravagance of the States has given them a bigger burden of debt than they can carry, and I do not say that they are already taxed up to the limit . things are beside the point, and if the State Parliaments have done them, thuy have presumably acted with the consent of the people. What will be the effect upofa the States of the legislation we are considering? What will be the position of the States at the hands of this or any subsequent Commonwealth Parliament? It seems that it is within the power of. any Commonwealth Government, at any time, without paying any compensation, to declare that the time has come to deprive the States of this revenue, and that whether the States receive anything in return is immaterial. Whether any Parliament would do that is another matter. Measures are passed through Parliament by the Government of the day.",30
96,Mr RODGERS,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"Not by the governper ment, but by the Parliament. Mr G.

If we do not place them in a more satisceptable factory position, a parliament may come into existence in the future that will have less regard for their interests I am satisfied this Government has.

97,Mr STEWART,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,The States do not accept that. Mr G. FRANCIS - I do not believe that to. be a fact.,31
98,Mr STEWART,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"The representatives in the State Parliaments do not accept it . Mr G. FRANCIS - The persons elected to the State Parliaments say one thing, and those elected to the Federal Parliament say another, and each claims to express the will of the people. I cannot accept the view that representatives in the State Parliaments more truly represent the people of Australia than we do in this Parliament. If we accept the allegations made from time to time ; about the way State electoral rolls are compiled, this Parliament more truly represents the will of the people than do the State Houses. In some, at least, of 'the Those States the Opposition represents a majority of the electors, while the Government represents only a minority. A per capita system of payment to the States is not equitable, nor calculated to secure the best interests of Australia. For these reasons I support the bill, although I hope that it will be amended to soma extent in committee. It unfortunately happens that the States that are largest in population are smallest in area. The cardinal questions which require solving to secure the development of Australia are, among others, communication and transport. W it h a very limited population scattered over a wide area, the provision of communication and transport is expensive and difficult. That is peculiarly felt in Queensland and Western Australia. The population of New South Wales is approximately l h persons square mile; of Victoria, 19£ persons per square mile; of Queensland, 1£ persons per square mile; of South Australia, the 1^ persons per square mile; of Western 1 person per 2-2 square miles; and of Tasmania, 8 persons per square on mile - A per capita adjustment, however accepted and approved, is not acto me, because the Sitates with the larger areas and the smaller populations require the greatest assistance, not than merely because of lack of population, but by reason of the far _ greater mileages and expenses thus The only way in which, as far as I can see, they can obtain it, is by the abolition of the - per capitapayments, and the substitution of some other method of adjusting their finances.

It is also quite clear that most of the newspapers, and many large financial are saying that this will be the end of the Commonwealth of Australia, aud will bring untold disasters in its train. that does not suggest to ine that people at large will suffer. rather that the persons who have large incomes, and pay heavy taxation in the States because of those large are afraid that uncier a new of further State taxation pay more income tax. whom ib is most necessary to benefit will not be hurt. There is no serious objection by the people at large, but there is an objection by the person whom my honourable friends opposite glibly refer to as "" the fat man."" He is loudly. He controls a number of newspapers, which are giving vent squeals, but that is not evidence to me that the people are objecting. ciple of per capita not sound. It is not in the best interests of the people, or later, must be abolished. just as well be abolished now as later. In studying the history of the financial negotiations between the and the States during recent years, it will be noted that this subject has been discussed since 1923, and that more or less ineffective have been held. A commencement has, however, made, and I - believe it is the general opinion of honourable members that the States should and shall be fairly It does not follow, however, that if the per capita payments are withdrawn States will not receive at least an equivaMr G.

When the per capita payments to the States were first agreed to the Commonwealth Government was not faced with the responsibility of meeting war expenditure, or the cost of invalid and old-age pensions, the maternity allowance, and other commitments, which have been of great benefit to the people. In providing for these the CommonThey wealth Government relieved the State responsibility authorities of serious financial responsiof collecting bilities. As I contend that our war expenditure should be met by direct are glad taxation, I trust that the Government will not altogether vacate the field of direct taxation, and that the relief to be institutions, afforded to the States in lieu of the per capita payments will be by taking over a portion of the States debts, and the in But terest thereon.

99,Mr WATT,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"Is the honourable member referring to the sugar industry? Mr G. FRANCIS - There is not the slightest doubt that Victoria derives as much benefit from the sugar industry as does Queensland.

I do not propose to give details of the figures, but for last year our expenditure in this connection amounted to £38,988,000, whereas in the same period the total Customs receipts, apart from excise, were £27,840,000.",33

This should be modified, because it is, in a sense, a perpetuation regard as the inequitable system and would continue the practice of starving those States whose smaller populations are unable to develop their much larger areas.

A commencement has been 29,496,000 made in this direction by dispensing with the second chamber in one State. If my memory serves me aright, it was the late Sir Charles Dilke, who with thunderous blows first attacked our present parliamentary system. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr G.

It has been said that the States have no legal or moral claims to the per federation, capita payments. I disagree with that. There is certainly a moral claim, Governments else why should a Commonwealth Government hold out the sum of A com- £7,734,000, as set out in the schedule of the bill, as a bait? The States second have a right to the per capita payments, and their right has been increased in conSouth sequence of our non-compliance with the real spirit that promoted federation.

107,Mr SPEAKER,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES, Does the honourable member propose to connect his remarks with the bill before the House?,35
108,Dr MALONEY,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"I do, Sir. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr G. Erancis) said that there were honourable members in all the Parliaments of the Commonwealth who disagree on this important question. In those circumstances, I offer the suggestion that the Government should defer consideration of this bill until the next election, and that it should hold a referendum on the next general election day to ascertain the wishes of the people on the matter. In all my experience, I have never before seen practically the entire daily press united in opposition to a Commonwealth legislative proposal. Are we to assume that all these newspapers arc barking up the wrong tree? I believe the Government would be well advised to consult the people before it forces au issue on this matter. No harm whatever would be caused by delaying the decision. The chief obligation that the Government has to meet is its war indebtedness, and that could quite easily bo met by adopting the system of unimproved land values taxation, and the Government could still comply with its per capita obligation to the States. The Treasurer has been very unwise in introducing this bill. No effort has been made to reply to the logical arguments which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore), and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), have advanced against the measure, except in a dilettante fashion, by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr G. Francis), and the honourable member for Herbert (Dr Not t ) . No Minister has yet replied, and that is rather unusual. Possibly we may take it as an evidence of the weakness of the Government's case. May I offer a sporting suggestion to the Government? Let them take a referendum of the electors in any capital city of the Commonwealth that they choose, and see how the people there regard this posal. If an adverse - decision were given, the matter allowed to lapse u n t i l the next election. Because of his action in imposing a levy of 3d. per lb. on butter the Minister for  has gained popularity in his own constituency. But what is the view of householders throughout Australia? The States have had no chance to express thenviews of that scheme. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr G. Francis) said that while State and Federal members differed regarding the per capita payments, it was difficult to determine who was right. Does he not consider that the people should be allowed to judge? Torefer the matter to the people by means of a referendum would save the Government from an awkward position. In conversation with a friend the other day I told him that it was my intention to vote against this bill. He then asked me whether I was of the opinion that the per capita payments should continue in definitely. To that I replied in the negative, for, as I told him, the Labour party believes that there should be ono taxing authority for the whole Commonwealth, and that no longer should we tolerate six State Governors and onp Governor General, and in each of the States a Chief Justice and a Supreme Court. In parting, he said that h© had not known that members of the Labour party had so much common sense. The speeches already delivered in support of the bill indicate misgivings on the part of Government supporters. The desire of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr G. Francis) for an amendment shows that he, at least, was not enamoured of the measure. The Prime Minister must know that Australia cannot have a truly protective tariff and increasing revenue from the Customs House. Australia already grows-more wheat and wool than she can consume, and when our secondary industries have been properly developed, it will no longer be necessary for Australian citizens to wear imported clothing. When that time arrives there will be employment for our peopio, markets for our primary products, together with decreased Customs revenue. I am reminded of the old proverb associated with the g if t of the wooden horse pro- at the Siege of Troy, "" Beware of the Greeks even when bringing gifts."" The could be proposed g if t of £7,700^000 to the States is in the nature of charity. It is no wonder that it is regarded with scorn. The States ask not for charity, but for their rights. If the Government is not satisfied from reading the leading articles in the newspapers regarding public opinion, in this matter, it should submit the question to the people by means of a referendum, and allow them to decide.  for Markets and Migration) [ 3 . 4 0 ] am no new convert to the proposal for the abolition of uniform grants on a population basis. I believe not only in their abolition, but also in the substitution of a better and more statesmanlike system of finance between the Commonwealth and the States. In one of the first speeches which I had the privilege of making in this chamber, in 1923, I dealt with the per capita payments and the absurdity of collecting direct taxation with one hand and paying it back to the States with the other. At that time. I said that the system involved unnecessary duplication, and was indefensible. My views have not changed since that time. Certainly the. position has improved since 1923, so far as duplication is concerned, because in the interval the Commonwealth and State Treasurers have come to an arrangement by which the States collect the Federal income tax. That has resulted in a saving of approximately £200,000 per annum to the Commonwealth. Nevertheless the tangle still remains; we impose income tax, the States collect it for us, and we, in turn, hand it back to them. That is a burlesque rather than an example of common-sense finance. It has been said that the per capita payments are made from surplus revenue. Can it seriously be contended that revenue is surplus if , in order to obtain it , the Government is compelled to go outside its ordinary province and invade what was regarded as the State field of taxation. ments to the States from surplus reveuue were fixed at a time when it was not known that the Commonwealth would have to bear the heavy burden of war, making indirect taxation insufficient: when they were fixed it was thought that the Customs revenue would always exceed the needs of the Commonwealth for the ordinary purposes of government. The position today is that the Commonwealth not only requires the Customs revenue, but must also dig deeply into the revenue received by direct taxation. Certain newspapers and critics of the Government's policy talk glibly about the Commonwealth's abundant Customs revenue, and of the supposed embarrassment of the Government because its revenue is greater than its requirements. They suggest that the direct taxation which was imposed during the war period in order to meet the obligations of the - I war should no longer be continued, seeing that the war has now been over for more than eight years. But what is the true position? It may surprise many people to learn that the war burden carried by the Comjnonwealth is heavier today than at any time during the war. I ask leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. CUSTOMS TARIFF : DUTY ON BARBED WIRE. Motion (by Mr Bruce) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",35
109,Mr GREGORY,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"Swan) [3.46] - Jus t before this House adjourned in August oflast year a tariff schedule was laid upon the table proposing some very important increases in duty, but more particularly the most extraordinary duty of £ 9 a ton on barbed wire entering Australia. Would it be possible, before the next adjournment a few weeks hence, for an opportunity to be provided for the discussion of that schedule?",36
110,Mr BRUCE,DRIED FRUITS EXPORT CHARGES,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.47J. - The honourable member's representation will be full y considered by the Government. It is a little difficult to state exactly what time will be available for the consideration of this matter, as a Pay- number of measures, including that which is now before this Chamber, will have to be passed before the House rises. The date of that rising is dependent to a great extent upon the period that will be required for the removal, so as to enable the formal opening of Parliament at Canberra to be performed by His Royal' Highness the Duke of York on the 9th of May next.
