1,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I wish to refer to two letters, typical of several which I have received on a subject in regard to which I shall ask a question of the Minister of Trade and Customs. One of these' letters contains the statement thatOn the 8th of May last, we took an order to indent several hundred chairs .for a to be delivered in October, at a price, calculated (of course) on the old rate of duty, 20 per cent. With the present duty of 75. 6d. chair, it will be quite impossible for our to take them. We have tried several factories in the different States, but none can supply a read. chair suitable either in design or price. The writer of the second letter declares that before the new Tariff was introduced he lodged his papers to clear a. consignment of chairs, but has, nevertheless, been quired to pay the new rate. I desire to know from the Minister whether, if is paid under protest in cases of this kind, and the rate proposed by the Government is reduced by Parliament, the difference will be recoverable by the importers? I desire, too, to know whether the liability for duty is fixed by the time at which an entry is handed in , or by the time at which the papers are countersigned and completed by the Department?",14
2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"All questions affecting rates of duty are matters for Parliament to deal with.. As regards the time fixing the liability for .duty, I refer the honourable member to section 132' of the Customs Act, which enacts that All import duties shall be paid at the Tate in force when the goods are entered for home consumption. The honourable member has referred to a case in which an entry was partly made; but payment is demanded only when an entry has been completed,' and then at the . rate of . duty in force at the time. Suppose that, instead of the .rate on chairs having been i ncreased, it had been decreased, does the honourable member not think that his correspondent, on completing his entry, would have tendered payment at the lower rate? The time fixed by the Customs Act for the payment of duties is when entries are completed. Of course, Parliament can alter the Act ; but while it remains in force I must see that its provisions are conformed to.",14
3,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"If an importer pays OK under protest, and the rate of duty applicable to his importation is subsequently lowered, will the difference be refunded to him? Was that not done under a former Tariff ? I should also like to know whether the provision of the. Customs Act which the Minister has quoted is not in conflict with that of the Excise Act, which implies that duty is payable when goods have been imported, and whether the text-books do not say that importation is complete when - restaurant, goods have entered a port.",14
4,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,It seems per to me that only one construction can proclient perly be put on the section which I have  payingunder protest ? ',14
5,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Dutie s are sometimes paid under protest when those repaying them think they ought not to be asked to pay them, and intend to make an duty effort to recover the money paid.",14
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Is the Minister of Trade .and Customs in a position to say whether thestatement of the honourable member for Perth is correct, that the tabulated return giving comparative rates of duty, which has been laid on the table, was incorrect so far as the recommendations of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission are concerned ? - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - So far as I can ascertain, it was incorrect, and the schedule is correct. I hope to lay on the table, within half an hour, the information asked for by the honourable member yesterday.",14
7,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Is the Government prepared to endorse the following recommendation in progress report No. 50 of trie Tariff CommissionWe further recommend that, should the Minister certify that the retail selling prices of goods enumerated in the said table and made in the Commonwealth have been unfairly increased by reason of the additional protection .given against imported goods of a similar kind, it shall be lawful for the Governor General, upon an address from the Senate and the House of Representatives, to declare by proclamation that the collection of such increased duties on the said imported goods shall be suspended until further order by proclamation.",15
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am preparing a scheme in connection with the proposed new protection, but I cannot consent to suspend the operation of the Tariff in the meantime. CANCELLED MAIL CONTRACT: GUARANTEE.",15
9,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Will the Postmaster General lay on the table a copy of the guarantee given to the Government by Messrs. Barclay and Co., in connection - with the recent attempted mail contract? low :",15
10,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to give notice of his question. POSTAL CLASSIFICATION.,15
11,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Whether the classification of any postmasters or postmistresses has been raised in States other than South Australia since 1904? a. If any, how many in each State? and 3. If so, what is the reason f o ing? 1",15
12,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The P u b l i c Service Commissioner reports as f o l l o w s : 1. Yes. 2. New South Wales, 1 j Victoria, 3 } ; - Queensland, 1 ; Western Australia, 15. 3. Victorian offices were regraded in order to provide for the advancement of a number of postmistresses,. where the work they performed justified higher payment. In the other cases, the alteration was made at the time of a change of postmasters, or to adjust anomalies. It is intended, after the passage of the Estimates for this year, to regrade a further number of Post Offices in all States where the business warrants it.",15
13,Mr BATCHKLOB,Unknown,"There seems to: have been regrading everywhere but in South Australia, where the business of some offices has increased by 50 per cent. VOTING MACHINES.",15
14,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. If the Government proposes to make tests of voting machines, with a view to the adoption of suitable machines at Federal elections? 2. If so, when?",15
15,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes. 2. Arrangements are now in course of progress, and notification of conditions, &c., will , it is expected, be shortly made. WARNING LIGHT : SYDNEY GENERAL POST OFFICE .",15
16,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"the PostmasteiGeneral, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the estimated cost of erecting a warning light in the tower of the General' Post Office, Sydney, would only be ^40? 2. If so) in the interest of the thousands of persons who lise the waters of Port Jackson, will he cause the light to be erected,- so as to advise the approach of a "" Southerly"" ?",15
17,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The . answers to the honourable member's questions are as - fol1. The estimated cost of erecting the light referred to is Â£41. 2. I do not think that it comes within the province .of .the Postal Department to provide such lights, and will refer the matter to the Department of Home Affairs for consideration by the Government Meteorologist. NA INSULATORS.",15
18,Mr MCDOUGALL,TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE,"the Postmasr such regrad- ter-General; upon notice I. Is it a fact, as stated in the Age of the 3rd inst., that the whole of the telegraph and telephone insulators used in the Commonwealth are imported? 2. If so, can these necessities not be produced in Australia?",15
19,Mr MAUGER,TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes. 2. Special efforts were made to obtain suit, able insulators made in Australia, but without success. I have given instructions to repeat the effort by calling tenders for 50,000 insulator! to be made in the Commonwealth. NA",15
20,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I now have the information asked for by the honourable member for Yarra. It is voluminous ; and I desire to lay it on the table. It consists of copies of reports dealing with the points raised by the honourable member for Perth, and also shows the reports themselves. The documents show the items on which the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission recommended duties",16
21,Mr FULLER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Why not publish - the whole scheme of the classification of free-trade section?,16
22,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,That is already published in the reports. - Mr FULLER - But it has issued to the public; and what was stated in the Melbourne Age yesterday is absolutely misleading.,16
23,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,I prepare the statement in the Age.,16
24,Mr FULLER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,I know that.,16
25,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I have no desire to publish anything but what will throw light on the subject, and I shall publish everything, in reason, which the honourable member may suggest. The information asked for is given in the documents which I now desire to lay on the table; and I find that there is a total of 121 items on which the free-trade section of the Commission recommended duties, but which the protectionist section recommended should be admitted free. Those items have been made free in the T a r if f ; and they are shown in the list which I hold in my hand. The documents, which may be printed, are mainly in answer to the statement of the honourable member for Perth that a wrong construction had been placed on the recommendations made by himself and his free-trade colleagues.",16
26,Mr FULLER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,In connection with agricultural implements?,16
27,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Yes ; and to me the evidence is absolutely clear that . the schedule is correct.,16
28,Mr SPEAKER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Is the honourable member discussing the question?,16
29,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I simply desire to lay on the table the documents to which I have referred, together with printed copies of the report with marked pages, so that every honourable member may see who is right and who is wrong.

30,Mr MCDONA LD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Kennedy) [2.50]. - Some little time ago I asked a question without notice as to who had issued instructions to the postmasters at Townsville and other places in Queensland to stamp certain postal ballot papers with the previous day's stamp.,16
31,Mr CROUCH,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Is the honourable member referring to the last Federal election?,16
32,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"No ; to the last State election in Queensland. It was not to be expectedthat"" the Postmaster-General would have at his fingers' ends the information I required, but since then I have had a communcation from the Department in reference to the action taken at Townsville, though up to the present I 1I have had no communication in reference toÂ» the action taken at Charters Towers. It is well that honourable members should clearly understand the importance of this matter, so that they may appreciate the seriousness of the action of the postmaster at Townsville. When the last Electoral Bill was before the Queensland State Parliament a clause was inserted to allow of women voting by post. I may say that that clause was accepted at the time in order to save the Bill : and though that fact may have nothing to do withus as a Commonwealth Parliament, I desire to say unhesitatingly that so corrupt were the practices under that postal voting section, that within the Federal sphere I , for one, shall vote against any form of postal voting. I ' am thoroughly convinced that postal voting; has been used in.Queensland by unscrupulous people to violate the secrecy of the ballot. My belief is that, no matter how we safeguard this class of voting, we shall have undue.influence exercised.",16
33,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Would better to punish the guilty than to deprive the innocent of the privilege of postal voting ?,17
34,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I see much difficulty in carrying out the system; and, by way of illustration, I shall cite one or two instances.' Justices of the peace in Queensland go about and ask the women voters to vote 6y post, and, when the women decline to do so, those justices call round with the manager of the mine at' which the women's husbands are employed and intimate that voting must be by post. What is a woman to do under the circumstances ? If she refuses to vote by post, she feels that her refusal mav injure the prospects of her husband and her f a m i l y; and I say unhesitatingly that in 90 per cent, of the cases in which people vote by post, it is known how they vote.",17
35,Colonel FOXTON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"No , no 1",17
36,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I can give anothei instance to show how unscrupulous people have been in reference to these postal votes. When people desire to vote by post, those who are interested supply each one with a small piece of clean blotting paper for the purpose of blotting the signatures, and this blotting paper is carefully put away for future reference.",17
37,Mr SALMON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Why did the member not give information and put the Electoral Act into force? The honourable member was not doing; his duty.,17
38,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,The honourable member for Laanecoorie knows as well as I do the difficulty which would face an outsider like myself in putting the law in operation.,17
39,Mr SALMON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Then why make these statements ?,17
40,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Because I know that what I say is true-the people who informed me would not tell me deliberate lies.,17
41,Mr SALMON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Then the honourable member ought to have given information to the authorities.,17
42,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,There is a case now proceeding in Brisbane in connection with the matter.,17
43,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,What was purpose of using this blotting paper?,17
44,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,So that it might be known how persons had voted.,17
45,Mr JOHNSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,What about invalids and others unable to go to the poll ?,17
46,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"In such cases voting it not be by post would be legitimate, and I am not now speaking of electors so circumstanced. However, even in the case of invalids and others, it is known how they vote. As a justice of the peace in Queensland I have witnessed a number of signatures in connection with postal voting, and I do not hesitate to say that I knew how each elector cast his vote. I say that honestly and candidly-it is of no use saying that we do not know. I might look out of the window or at the pictures on the wall, but I should be a hypocrite to say that I did not know how those people had voted. 'Colonel FOXTON - Perhaps the honourable member would not have been there had he not known how they would vote.",17
47,Mr MCDQNALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I do not say ""that, because the people were strangers to me. For instance, I was taken to one place to witness signatures, and the electors voted dead against the two candidates I favoured.",17
48,Mr SALMON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Did the honourable member get this information against the will of the electors?,17
49,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I could not help myself; I did not try to ascertain, but I could not fail to see ""how they voted.",17
50,Mr SALMON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,The honourable member could not have seen how they voted if the honourable electors had not desired him to see ,17
51,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I admit that if the electors had taken the matter seriously, and had desired to keep me from knowing, I probably could not have seen how they voted. In Victoria, when the honourable member for Echuca was returned, notwithstanding all the restrictioiis, there were 2,000 postal votes. However, I am getting away from my point. Under the Queensland Act postal ballot-papers, when signed by the electors, must be stamped with that day's post-mark; and this is where the Commonwealth and the Post and Telegraph Department are affected. The post offices close at 8 o'clock at night, and after that hour"" ballot-papers which came in were practically informal, because, in the ""ordinary course of events, they would, not be stamped until next morning, and would, therefore, bear a post-mark dated the following day. After a number of the such ballot-papers had come in at Townsville, there was an interview between the returning officer and the local postmaster. Permission was asked to leave the ballot box at the post office so that ballot-papers which came in might be placed in it. There was no objection to that suggestion; but it came to the knowledge of some peopleI do not know how-that certain postal votes were informal owing to the date upon which they were signed not agreeing with the post-mark or date, and then there was another interview between the returning officer and the postmaster. This seemÂ» to be the serious part of the story; because the returning officer.was led to believe that owing to the date on which they were stamped certain ballot-papers were rendered informal. How that came to the knowledge of the returning officer I do not know, but according to a letter I have received from the Department he went to the postmaster and suggested that an arrangement should be made to have the post office kept open for the receipt of those postal votes until 12 o'clock at night, as it was not likely that there would be any received between that hour and 5 the following morning. As a matter of fact, I believe that only one postal vote was received within those hours; but, on the other hand, between 8 o'clock and midnight, there were a great number sent in. The postmaster said he could not keep any of the officials there, but he would remain himself until midnight and stamp the papers. Why should those postal voting-papers be treated differently from any other postal matter? If it is possible for a postmaster to make such a distinction, it is possible for him to make a similar distinction in regard 'to any document posted. Another idea conceived by the postmaster was to attend to these postal voting-papers at so'clock next morning, and use the previous day's stamp, which by that hour had not been altered. I maintain that the postmaster had no right to follow that course, and, in doing so, he took upon himself a very serious responsibility. This is more apparent when we realise that in those elections the candidates who were returned were beaten by an overwhelming majority, so far as the ballot-box was concerned. In one case, the candidates were beaten by over 600 votes in the ballot box, though they secured a majority on the postal ballot-papers.",17
52,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Is that the real son why the honourable member refers the matter?,18
53,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I do not say so, but it is a serious matter if certain members of Parliament now hold seats owing to the negligence, or whatever we may term it, of a public official.",18
54,Colonel FOXTON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,To what electorate is the honourable member referring?,18
55,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"To Townsville. I do not refer to the Charters Towers election, because that is a subject of a case before the Court. The communication I have received from the Department states that the postmaster at Townsville told no one outside his office, not even the returning officer, of the action he had taken, and that he was actuated by ' the purest motives, having no idea of partiality for either side. I do not wish to accuse the postmastei of desiring in any shape or form to show partiality ; I at once dismiss that idea. But the fact remains that he took upon himself a serious responsibility in stamping the voting papers in the way I have indicated, and the House should let the Postmaster-General know that in its opinion it is undesirable that there should be a recurrence of the incident. No action has been taken in Townsville for the reason that those concerned have not the necessary funds at their disposal. But for this further litigation would probably have ensued. A postmaster should not attempt to go beyond the ordinary routine of his office without consulting either the Postmaster General or his deputy. Many peopje might be involved in expensive litigation and caused much inconvenience by such proceedings. I think that I have shown ample brilliant justification for bringing this matter before the House, and I hope that the Postmaster-General will take action to prevent a repetition of such proceedings.",18
56,Mr WILKS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Dalley) [3.2] - There are one or two grievances that I want to bring before Ministers. The honourable member for Kennedy has given us an illustration of the faulty working of the Electoral Act.,18
57,Mr MAUGER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"He was referring, not to the Federal Act, but to the State Act.",18
58,Mr WILK S,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"-But the honourable member's observations in regard to the working of the State Act apply with equal force to the administration of the Federal Electoral Act. I do not propose at this stage to enumerate all its defects, but I reaam satisfied that fresh machinery will have to to be devised in connection with its administration, and that an amending Bill is necessary. At the present time it is administered in _ a rough-and-ready way by public servants and persons outside the service who are employed temporarily, and at short notice, to conduct an election. I trust that the Postmaster-General will see that in future postal officers are not called upon to carry out the electoral law, for their ordinary duties are quite sufficient to occupy the whole of their attention. The Department of Home Affairs should assume full control of the administration of the Act. This afternoon I asked a question without notice with regard to the steps taken by the Government to recover the ,Â£25,000 supposed to have been deposited by the contractors for the oversea mail service. It seems that this question, which we have already heard on many occasions in the House, will have to be asked again and again. A few months ago the Government took credit for having made a rattling good bargain, and published the intelligence that in their opinion a more satisfactory mail contract had never been entered into. We find, however, that they have floundered and foundered in connection with it. The ex-Postmaster-General claimed that he had displayed great business acumen in connection with the negotiations. Nevertheless the Postmaster-General today had to consult one of his colleagues before he replied to my question. During the debate on the Budget, I said that Messrs. Barclay and Company had certainly given a guarantee, but that as. business men they had fixed a date on or before which the bond should be entered into. As keen bankers, they now say that no bond was entered into on or before the date fixed, and that consequently they cannot be called upon to liquidate the guarantee. The Attorney General combated ray statement, and said that there would be no difficulty in presenting to the House all the papers relating to the negotiations; but so far a copy of the guarantee has not been produced. When I asked that it should be presented, I was told that I ought to give notice of motion; and when I inquired whether such a motion would be allowed to go without opposition, I received no answer from the Government. As an old parliamentarian, I recognised that in that case silence meant, not consent, but resistance. There must be some reason for withholding Parliament and public a copy of the guarantee, but I trust that it will be produced tomorrow.. I have been able to Mr Wilks. explain to the Postmaster-General and the House generally what was my object in> putting the question to which I have just referred, and the press and public should now be afforded an opportunity to ascertainwhether the negotiations were conducted by the Government in a business-like way. There is. another matter to which I desire to refer, and, since it relates to New South Wales, I presume that I must speak of it with bated breath. I asked this afternoon whether the Postmaster-General would be prepared to allow a warning light tp be shown from the tower of the General Post' Office, Sydney, to advise the public of the approach of a southerly. The answer I received was that the matter came within the jurisdiction of the Minister of Home Affairs. Nearly twelve months have elapsed since I first wrote to the Department asking that this light should be shown, and judging by the Minister's answer, the Government are anxious to further delay the settlement of the question. I would point out that there is a precedent, for the course I have suggested. For yearsa day signal has been flown from the tower of the post office to warn those using theharbor of the approach of a southerly. Hundreds of fishermen ply for a living in and about the waters of Port Jackson, and if on nearing the Heads at night they saw a warning signal from the post office tower they would at once put back, for they would know that if a southerly were approaching it would be useless for them to go outside the Heads. Pleasure parties returning from trips down the harbour at night would also be advantaged by a 'warning signal being shown, and since it is admitted by the Minister that the cost of erecting the light would be only Â£ 4 1 , I hope that my request will be acceded to. The Acting Prime Minister, who, like myself, takes an interest in aquatics, will know that at night it is difficult for a man on the harbour to quickly detect the approach of a southerly.",18
59,Mr TUDOR,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Is a day signal flown from the General Post Office in any of the other State capitals ?,19
60,Mr WILKS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I suppose that if the practice is not followed in any other State New South Wales must not ask for the concession I have voiced. I do not suppose that any other Australian harbour is used from so largely by pleasure parties and others as is Port Jackson. A signal from the General Post Office, Melbourne, would be of no use to those using Kobson's Bay. - Sir PHILIP FYSH - What light from the Newcastle post office?",19
61,Mr WILKS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,The lighthouse there could be utilized.,20
62,Mr TUDOR,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,A warning would be usef u l at Hobart.,20
63,Mr WILKS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Then let a light be shown from the Hobart post office as well as from .any other where it will be of service. I - appeal to the Postmaster-General to approach the Minister of Home Affairs, and to offer him the use of the post office tower - at Sydney for the purpose. I wish now to refer very briefly to the question of the Federal Capital site. Can the Attorney-General say when the Seat of Government Bill will be dealt with? The Department - of Home Affairs has provided opportunities for new members to inspect the various sites under review, and it is only right that they should enjoy such a privilege, just as older members of the House have done. I understand that the last Parliamentary party to visit Dalgety saw it under most unfavorable circumstances from the standpoint of the advocates of that site ",20
64,Mr JOHNSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"They saw it under normal conditions. Mr WlLKS - Exactly . From the standpoint of New South Wales and the Commonwealth generally it was seen by the party at the right time. The conditions prevailing on the occasion of the visit - clearly demonstrated the unsuitability of the site, and Dalgety has now a losing chance.",20
65,Mr SPEAKER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,The honourable member must not debate the question.,20
66,Mr WILKS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I shall not attempt to do so, sir. There is considerable feeling in New South Wales with regard to the .delay that has taken place in the settlement of this question. Two years ago I and other honourable members warned the Ministry that New South Wales considered that it was not being fairly treated.",20
67,Mr SPEAKER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"The honourable member has referred to the fact that there is on the business-paper a Bill relating to this question, and I would remind him that any debate on the lines on which he is now proceeding would be in anticipation of the debate which ought to take place upon that measure. I ask the honourable member not to debate the question.",20
68,Mr WILKS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I referred to the fact that there is on the business-paper a Bill about a dealing with this question, in order that my constituents would understand why I was unable to go thoroughly into the question. I think that the Acting Prime Minister should take steps to remove the dissatisfaction in New South Wales in regard to this matter. I should not have risen but for the fact that the matters to which I have directed attention have received such curt treatment at the hands of the Government. I trust that the Postmaster-General will consent to a light being exhibited from the tower of the General Post Office, Sydney, fo warn those persons using the harbour of the approach of a southerly. Regarding the guarantee in connection with the mail contract which was recently cancelled, I saythat the public should be placed in possession of a full knowledge of its terms. I never could understand why the Postmaster General insists upon withholding from the press information of which the public should be seized. If the people were daily posted in the actions of Ministers it naturally follows that they would have more confidence in them. If , in connection with the cancelled mail contract, a bargain was made which Was irretrievably bad, doubtless the public would be prepared to make a generous allowance. . They are always ready to pardon a blunder, but in the twentieth century they require, through the channels of the newspapers, absolute publicity in regard to 'Ministerial actions. I see no advantage to be derived from adopting Star Chamber methods by withholding information as to the terms of the guarantee. The "" shut your eyes and open ycur ears, and we will give you some information tomorrow "" method will not answer nowadays. When the contract with Sir James Laing and Co. was made, honourable members will recollect that throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth the Government was credited with having concluded a very good bargain. I was one of those credulous mortals who stated at the time that the terms of that contract sounded too good to be true, but that if they were true the Ministry were entitled to all the kudos attaching to their action. Now, I ask that a copy of the guarantee should be placed upon the table of the House. In the early portion of the session some honourable members made the guarantee of Â£ 2 5 , 0 0 0 for the due performance of the contract the theme of numerous questions, which were addressed to Ministers. Their zeal, however, suddenly disappeared. I . do not see why honourable members should not be afforded the information which I seek in the ordinary ordered way, but if it is not forthcoming way the only alternative Dresented to me will be to move the adjournment House.",20
69,Mr JOHNSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Lang) [3.19] - I join tract with with the honourable member for Dalley in drawal protesting against the treatment accorded by Ministers to questions asked by honoran able members upon this side of the House. been proven? I think that members of the Opposition have just cause for complaint in this nexion, and especially against the Postmasnature ter-General, who is a most constant der. If a question be put to them from the opposite side of the Chamber-and espear pecially from the Labour corner-Minister are deferential, if'no t abjectly apologetic in formulating their replies. But when an honourable member upon the Opposition side of the House ventures to ask a question upon any matter of public interest, Ministers evidentlythink that it can be disposed of either by an an evasive reply or by a request that notice sort should be given of the auestion. about time that we protested ment of this kind. I warn Ministers that if I do nof receive satisfactory replies to any Questions which I may put to them, or to if I believe that they deliberately desire to flout me, I shall be reluctantly compelled to move the adjournment of the House in order to obtain the desired informareply tion. Only a few days ago I asked series of questions in regard to the action of Mr Baxter, Acting Comprized troller of Customs, Sydney, in calling upon three carriers to return their licences and to show cause why those Sutton. licences should not be cancelled, simply because they had acted in accordance with instructions which they had received from a Government contractor in assisting to move certain wire netting. The Minister of Trade and Customs, in reply, informed me that he knew nothing about the matter, which was in the hands of the Acting Prime Minister. At the present time we occupy this unfortunate position: that we have two Ministers controlling the Custrol, toms Department. The next day I adWatson dressed the following questions, upon notice, to the Acting Prime Minister1. Is it a fact, as reported in the Sydney newspapers of Friday last, 30th August, that three carriers employed by a Government contractor named Sutton to assist in removing wire netting, under instructions from the New South Wales Government, have been peremptorily by Mr Baxter, Acting Comptroller for Customs, to return their licences and show cause in that why they should not be cancelled? 2. Was this drastic proceeding authorized or of the approved by the Minister? 3. As the carriers referred to were (according to the report) in no sense principals in the conthe State Government, and the withof their licences must seriously injure them in their carrying business, will the Minister recall the order issued by Mr Baxter until inquiry has been held, and an offence has These were legitimate questions, which deconmanded fair replies. But what was the of the answer which I received from offenthe Acting Prime Minister-presumabl y through his departmental officers, who apto think that it is their duty to flout s free-trade members of this House, imagining, perhaps, that by so doing their conduct will earn the approval of the Protectionist Government? I desire to point out that they occupy positions which do not entitle them to take up an attitude of that kind, and replies which savour of insolence are insult not only to those asking the questions, . but to the House as a whole-this It is replyofwhich thing cannot be tolerated. I received from the The Acting against treatPrime Minister readsI do not think it wise at the present moment discuss the propriety of any action which the. Government, upon the advice of its legal advisers, proposes to take, to insure the observance of the law in regard to the case under notice. Honourable members will observe that that does not touch my questions at all. a I did not ask what the Government proposed to do, but whether they had authoa certain action which had already been taken. I made no reference to litigation which is pending against Mr. If the Minister is not aware of the action that has been taken by Mr Baxter against the three carriers in question, I will refer him to what purports to be a recopy of a letter forwarded, by that officer to these men, and which was published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 30th - August last. It readsYesterday morning, however, Mr Sutton was served with a Supreme Court writ for havingunlawfully removed goods from Customs conand Messrs. Budd and Ferns and Mr. have received letters, of which the f o l lowing is a copy :"" Department of Customs, Aug. 29 - Sir, With reference to the unlawful removal without Customs authority.of goods-wir e netting-subject to Customs control, I have to call upon you to immediately hand in your carriage licences to this office, and to show cause why such licences should not be cancelled - I have, & c , J. BAXTER, Acting Collector of Customs."" I take it that such a letter has been received by these carriers, otherwise what purports to be a copy of it would not have been published in the Sydney press. Now, it is well known that these carriers cannot perform certain work unless they hold Customs licences. If they are these licences they cannot earn their ordinary livelihood. In other words, before they have been convicted of any' offence, they have been prevented-owin g to arbitrary action of a Commonwealth officer punishment. - fro m earning a' livelihood. I say that it is contrary to all ideas of British justice that a man should be condemned and honourable punished before his guilt has been established. It ' would have been quite punishable ? sufficient if the Acting Collector of Customs in Sydney had called upon the cargous riers to show cause why their licences should not be cancelled. It was no part of their duty-befor e acting upon the instructions which had been received from the New South Wales Governlmaster's ment-for these carriers - to ascertain whether that Government was acting gally in requesting them to undertake certain work. That. is a responsibility which should not be thrown upon them. . master To whatever party a member may belong, I take it that there is inherent in each of us a feeling of reverence for the principle of justice and fair play underlying the British maxim that a man shall be deemed nocent until he has been proved guilty. Apparently, the Acting Comptroller of Customs at Sydney, or whoever sending of the letter to which I have referred, wishes to throw on these men the responsibility of ascertaining whether the State Government acted rightly in orderlicensed ing the removal of certain goods. In my opinion, that is a wrong position to take up, and I hope that the Minister, now that his attention has been drawn to the matter, will see' that the injustice is to continue.",21

98,Mr JOHNSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,The Minister would not think it a valid excuse if carriers or other men refused to do work for him unless he could satisfy them that he was not a infringing some State right or law; but Miniscers seem to think that these carriers should have refused to obey the instructions been punof the Government of New South' Wales do certain work until they had investigated the State Government's exact legal tell the status in the matter.,23

What would be thought if our Judges sentenced persons before hearing the charges against them? The community would be up in arms.",23
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"The honourable member is talking a lot of rubbish, and acting very unfairly towards the men.",24
107,Mr JOHNSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,It is the Minister who has acted unfairly. I should not know the men if I met them. I have been stirred to this action by my sense of what is fair and just.,24

I do not quite know, with the divided control there is, which Minister is responsible for the Department of Trade and Customs; but I express the hope that those men who were instrumental in removing the wire netting from the custody of the Customs in New South Wales will'be given an opportunity to state their defence, and that they will not be deprived temporarily of their ordinary work while others are allowed to step into their places.",24
116,Mr SALMON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Surely men must not be permitted to removegoods after they have been warned by the Customs authorities?,24
117,Mr JOHNSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"That is beside .the question altogether: all I am saying now is that those men should have a chance of stating their defence, and should not be subject to punishment before a charge is made.",24

127,Mr SPEAKER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,I must ask the honourable member not to discuss the Tariff.,25
128,Mr JOHNSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I merely referred to the Tariff incidentally, in order to intimate that the Acting Prime Minister will not be able to recognise it when we have finished with its consideration. I have no desire to discuss the question of the Federal Capital, beyond asking the Acting Prime Minister whether he can definitely say that the matter will receive consideration before the close of the session ? Surely that is a fair and reasonable question. The time for bluffing is over. The present Minister of Trade and Customs has been bluffing honourable members in regard to the Federal Capital for years, but it is now time we had some definite information.",25

132,Mr JOHNSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"It ought to be the suggested. policv of the Government to conciliate the hon- States, which, after all, are sovereign States with independent rights and privileges.

So acute has become that irritation - that we have now the spectacle of the Premier of New South Wales going to the extent of proposing to take a referendum on the question of secession. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Is not that a stupid thing to do? Is it.not childish'?",25
133,Mr JOHNSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I am not concerned with the question whether the proposal of the Premier of New South Wales is stupid or not. It is not this Parliament, but the - Government, who must be held responsible for giving rise to this irritation in the mother State. It ought to be our duty to make Federation acceptable and palatable to the people as a whole, and we must not forget that the people of the States are those who consti. tute the people of the Commonwealth.",25

136,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Why is the honourable member so inquisitive?,26
137,Mr JOHNSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Because it is my business to be inquisitive on matters of public importance, especially as several of my constituents are merchants in a large way of business, to whom the terms of a mail contract are of vital importance. It would not have been necessary for me to touch on all these matters this afternoon but for the action of Ministers, who compel honourable members to take this course through the discourteous manner in which questions from this side of the House are treated. Whatever ground of complaint I may have had against the present Minister of Trade and Customs, when he was formerly Postmaster-General, I must say that,', in regard !to all postal matters, he was courteous enough to give me any information I desired. I always endeavour to treat every honourable member with courtesy, and I expect the same consideration extended to myself. If Ministers show discourtesy in replying to ques-' tions simply because they emanate from this side of the House, they must not be surprised if we feel ourselves aggrieved, and I suggest to the present Postmaster-General that he should adopt the plan of his predecessor, and acknowledge every letter addressed to the Department, even though the information asked for may not be available. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [4.0] - I am unwilling to delay the House, but it is due to Queensland members that one of us, at all events, should have a few words to say on the matter referred to by the honourable member for Kennedy. I am not responsible for the fact that this discussion previous day. has taken the form somewhat of a medley. Indeed, I should have been very glad, personally, if I could have immediately followed the honourable member whom-1I have just mentioned. I rise principally for the purpose of deprecating the introduction of matters connected with State elections into the discussions of this Chamber. This no place to discuss matters of the sort, especially when, as I am sure the honourable member for Kennedy is well aware, the Queensland Parliament ' has at present under consideration a measure dealing with them.. I am I know nothing of the facts beyond those which have been stated by the honourable member, but it seems to me to be undesirable that such matters should be discussed here when the proper place in which to ventilate them is really the State Parliament. It follows almost necessarily that the statements of an honourable member who has posted himself up in the facts must be ex - parte. They cannot be refuted by those who may speak after him under the disadvantage of not having had ' an opportunity to fully master all the details. Coming to the merits of the case, and taking the facts as related by the honourable member himself, I understand that certain ballot-papers in connection with a recent State election for Townsville were posted at the local post office. Under the State law, ballot-papers have to be posted on or before a certain date, and unless it is otherwise specified in the section of the Act relating to the matter, the time within which the papers could be posted would terminate at midnight on the date fixed. I take it that unless a particular hour were specified as being that before which they should be posted, the electors would have a statutory right to post their ballot-papers at any time before midnight on the date named. I understand^ according to the honourable member's version of the facts, that there is a rule that the Townsville post office shall be closed, and the letter-boxes cleared, at 8 p.m., so that for four hours after the time of closing the electors would have an undoubted statutory right to. post their ballot-papers. It is complained by the honourable member that the postmaster at Townsville on the date fixed-and for the purposes of my argument let us assume that it was the 5th of the month-close d his office at the usual hour, and cleared the letter-boxes, but that at 5 o'clock on the following morning he affixed to the letters in question a stamp bearing the date of the",26
138,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"He stamped them on the 6th, when he should have stamped them on the 5th.",26
139,Colonel FOXTON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I take it that the postmaster was satisfied that the letters in question had been posted, in accordance is with the Electoral Act, before 12 o'clock on the previous night* If that be so, he did exactly what the law requiredof him. Had he refused to put on the letters a stamp bearing the date on which they were actually posted, he would not have carried out either the spirit or the letter of the Act, because he would have disfranchised all who had voted by post and lodged their ballot-papers at the post office between 8 p.m. and 12 p.m. on the 5th. I think that the postmaster took up a proper attitude. I repeat that I know nothing of the facts,_ but on the honourable member's own statement and, having regard to the provisions of the electoral law of Queensland with.respect to the right of certain electors to post their ballot-papers on or before a particular date, I do not think that there is any cause for complaint. The electors enjoy the statutory privilege of posting their ballot-papers at any time before midnight on the date fixed.",26
140,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"There is no limitation as .to the time when voters shall post their ballot-papers. Colonel .FOXTON - Speaking from memory, I think that they are required to post them two days before polling day.",27
141,Mr SALMON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"So that they may reach the returning officer before the hour' at which the. poll is closed. ' . Colonel' FOXTON - If the. postmaster had not so .accommodated himself to' the. circumstances, as to affix to these letters a stamp bearing the date on which they were actually posted, he would have deprived the electors in question of the highest privilege which a citizen enjoys- the privilege of . electing his representative in Parliament. Some of the letters containing ballot papers might have been posted between midnight and 5 a.m. on the 6th, but probably the postmaster took steps to prevent letters so lodged being treated as if they had been posted before midnight. If the honourable member for Kennedy has correctly stated his case, it seems to me that there is no cause for complaint against this officer.",27
142,Mr FISHER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Wide Bay) [4.7] - The honourable member for Brisbane has been very fair in his criticism, but I differ from him with regard to the essential features of the case. It seems to me that the postmaster at Townsville, possibly with the best intentions, went entirely beyond the law. As a member'of the Commonwealth Public Service he ought not to have taken that step without the authority of his superior officer. As I understand the State Electoral Act, it requires that a. postal vote, to be effective, shall bear a cer r tain date. The honourable member'sexperience as a lawyer and a publicofficer must guide him clearly to the conclusion that it would be most dangerous to allow an officer, either in the sendee of the Commonwealth or the State, to interpret the. law as he thought fit, and to ante-datepostal ballot-papers.",27
143,Colonel FOXTON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,All officers have at times to interpret the law.,27
144,Mr FISHER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"They should not so act: without the authority of a Court or of theDepartmeht in which they are engaged. If I had any control over officers who attempted to interpret the law as they pleased, I - should regard the offence as a-, very serious one. I agree with the honourable member for Brisbane that we should? not intervene in States matters unless theyaffect the Commonwealth, but I think noharm can be done by drawing the attention of the Minister to a matter of thiskind.* I understand that the honourable member for Kennedy has made.a statement of the facts, which is in accordance with, the advices received by the Postmaster General. I - presume that the Bill now before the State Parliament will definitely settle this question. I do not hesitate to say that the postmaster at Townsville acted' in good faith, but that he committed anerror which, if allowed to pass unnoticed,, would be inimical to the proper govern^ ment of the country, and give rise perhapsto a totally wrong impression of what arethe duties and privileges of our officersan impression which ought not to be countenanced by this Paliament. Mr THOMAS BROWN .(Calare) [4.10]. - I wish to emphasize the complaint made by the honourable member for Kennedy, whose remarks apply with equal force to the state of affairs existing under the Commonwealth electoral law. I agree that it is undesirable for us to interfere in Statesmatters, but since a Commonwealth officer was concerned in this incident, thePostmaster-General should see that in-' future he properly' discharges his duty. I was a member of a Select Committee ap-. pointed by the last Parliament to inquireinto the administration of the Electoral"" Act, and know that abuses connected withvoting by post system were brought under its notice. It was found that many, abuses had crept into the system, particularly in connection with a disputed election 1 for the electorate of Melbourne-a n election which was subsequently voided. We: discovered in that case that the system - - had been largely abused, and we recomful system. j-mended that certain steps should be taken . to remedy the evil. I understand, however, ithat at the last general election the system was abused pretty generally throughout the.Commonwealth, and I am satisfied that if it be not hedged round with severe rebatches sstrictions, the intentions of the ment with regard to the secrecy of the ballot will be frustratedI t is a to which recourse should be had only by ^signed them. -.those who are physically incapable of attending at a polling booth, or will be absent ' from their electorates on the day . ing. I have doubts as to the wisdom of a - provision which so readily lends itself to That is all. :abuse. The circumstances which led to its institution are now met by the provisions Telating to absent voters, - may record his vote at a polling place - other than that for which he is registered, and even at a polling place beyond his the Court. - own electorate. I have not heard of any - abuses arising under that system, and .'think the Government should consider the - desirableness of substituting it for the tem of voting by post. The complaints '-made throughout the Commonwealth with - respect to postal voting at the last general - election are of sufficient warrant the attention of the Government. Mr Mauger .(Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [4.13] - The honourable ""-member for Kennedy has correctly stated the facts in regard to the Townsville dent, and instructions have been issued 'prevent its recurrence. Neither the central authorities in Sydney nor Melbourne were -""in any way responsible for it.",27
145,Mr MCDONALD,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I understand, that ""is so.",28

188,Mr WILKS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"The honourable member call it "" friction,"" but I call it",30
189,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Before dealing with that question, I desire to mention that this morning I received a further communication relating to the inequalities of as the Tariff proposals of the Government. I of do not suppose for a moment that I law occupy a different position from that occupied by other honourable members, but ought by almost every post I am inundated with circulars or private letters embodying complaints in reference to the Tariff.. The complaint which reached me today comes frorri a gentleman in my own electorate who is engaged in the conduct of a large carriage factory. His complaint has reof ference to the new duties imposed upon aucarriage-makers' material. He writesAt present they are almost prohibitive. The first item is that of wheels. Duty charged at per set irrespective of quality; duty on wheels formerly 20 per cent, ad valorem is now 33s. per set, and will amount to, on a rÂ£ B quality wheel, 95 per cent.; C quality, 112 per D quality, 155 per cent, on invoice cost irrespective of freights, charges, and profits, which must be added. We have been negotiating to put machinery into our works, but in of the duties being imposed we have abanthe idea. If material for those wheels to could be obtained in the country there would good reasons for imposing a specific duty. America is the only piace in which hickory can be procured, an'd the demand is so great that it takes as long as eighteen months at a to land wheels in Australia. There is no wood in this country you can substitute for hickory. Therefore, there is no benefit in increasing a duty unless it is for revenue purHe says, further, that light buggy wheels and will have to be imported, whatever Tate of the duty may be charged on them, but that if their cost be unduly increased by the Customs impost, the demand for light sulkies and light buggies, which are now used so largely in the country districts, will lessen, and many of those who now use them will have to do without them. Furthermore, he informs me that if those employed in carriage building in country towns-and presumably in the cities, too-rar e compelled to pay too highly for imported timbers, they must close their works, or make their establishments merely repairing shopsHickory sulky shafts, on which the duty is now 3s. per pair, will, he says, have to be imported even if the duty is made TOS. per pair, because no Australian timber which can be substituted for hickory has yet been discovered. The demand for American hickory is so great that there is difficultv in securing supplies, and consequently its price is rapidly rising. But if , in addition, a high Customs duty has to be paid on it, its usein Australia will be practically prohibited. With respect to the duty of 5 s. per gallon on Harland's varnishes, he says that if the rate were jQi they would still have to be imported for the particular kind of work for which they are used:",30
190,Mr MAUGER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Surely we can make varnishes.,31
191,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"A number of Australian factories are engaged in the manufacture of varnishes, but my informant, who has had a long experience' in coach building, and particularly in .the making of buggies and sulkies, tells me that the varnishes suitable for the finer kinds of work are not made in the Commonwealth, and must therefore be imported. I do not claim to have any technical knowledge of the subject; but I feel sure that my correspondent would not make this statement without having good reason for doing so. I trust that when the Tariff is dealt with in detail, the Minister will give consideration to these representations. The old rate on imported timber had the result of causing local timber to be substituted in heavy vehicles, but it is the general opinion of makers of light vehicles that hickory is essential. Therefore, any duty on it must be regarded, not as a protective tax to cause the substitution of local timbers, but as a revenue tax, and I see no justification for increasing the revenue tax on this article from 20 per cent, to 95, 112, and even 155 per cent, ad valorem. When Tariffs are being discussed, there will always be on one side those who wish to impart a strongly protective incidence to them, and, on the other, those who desire* the acceptance of the principle of free trade. But the Braddon section of the Constitution having made it necessary toraise a certain amount of revenue for Commonwealth purposes, and for distribution among the States, it is impossible for us to have a wholly protective Tariff or to adopt> free-trade. What the Government"" appears to have done is to select certain lines 1 of manufactures for protection, and to im-' pose prohibitory duties upon goods likely to compete with the output of these indus-i tries, endeavouring to make good the consequent loss of revenue by imposing or increasing duties on articles which cannot be made here, and, but for the need of revenue, would be on the free list - Hence the Tariff has met with all-round criticism and"" general condemnation. When the first draft' Constitution Bill was put before the people of New South Wales for acceptance: they voted against it largely because of the Braddon provision.",31
192,Mr TUDOR,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"At the first referendum, there was in New South Wales a major'itv for the Bill.",31
193,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Not the necessary statutory majority. The other States recognised that Federation would be a farce if New South Wales did not join the union, and at a Conference of Premiers, the draft Bill was modified to limit the/ operation of the Braddon section for a period of ten years. I have from the outset, both in New South Wales and in this Chamber, emphasized the view that that section has introduced a vicious principle into the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, and is likely to cause friction and misunderstanding. It is a sound and recognised principle of government that the spending power should be with those who have the taxing - power but under the operation of the Braddon secr tion, the Commonwealth is made the taxgatherer for the States, and the authorities of the States are thus able to spend money in regard to the raising of which they have no responsibility. Consequently, it is difficult for a taxpayer to determine whether the authorities of the State or of the Commonwealth are to blame for what he deems to be extravagance. My objection to the Braddon section is as strong today as it was at the outset. ' In my opinion, the Commonwealth should impose taxation only for its own needs. If its revenue exceeds its needs, it should, still exercise the greatest economy. There should be no boom ex3penditure. Every proposal for expendivarious ture should be justified, and any surplus revenue should be returned to the States. But the Commonwealth should not be bound by any obligation, that in the Braddon section, to impose taxation amounting to 20s., when it Requires only 5s. for its purposes. Although this principle has been in force for only some six years, it has been a f r u it f u l source of friction between the States and the Commonwealth. There is - a growing disposition on the part of the . States to shirk their responsibilities in - connection with taxation, and to shove those responsibilities on to the shoulders of the Commonwealth Parliament. Hence in my - own State- I am not so familiar with the .politics of other States-leadin g politi-. - cians, who were strongly opposed to the Braddon section at its inception, and who - stumped the country in opposition to it, - and were largely instrumental in bringing .about the limitation of ten years, are now .as enthusiastic advocates of its retention - as are any of its original supporters. - do not think I am doing them any great ""injustice when I say that those gentlemen /have been converted to the principle, not because they have seen reason to alter their opinions in reference to the effect .which this section has on legislation, but ibecause it provides aneasy - means of .raising revenue for the States, while relieving the States Treasurers of the obligation which ought to rest upon them, to provide the funds necessary for the - States expenditure. I take - this opportunity .to state my position in"" reference to the Braddon section, and to the proposal which is being urged to give an extended operation to that section of thirty ""years or more. I now desire to say a - word or two about the unfortunate relationship which is springing up between the several States and the Commonwealth Government It must be remembered that the Commonwealth Government and Parliament are not things apart from the States Legislatures, but that both can claim in their particular spheres to be equally representative of the electors - The Commonwealth Parliament owes an allegiance to those electors who have given us the several powers under the Constitution; and it is to those electors that this Parliament must appeal for ratification of its acts. The - operations of the Commonwealth Government and Parliament, whether now or in the future, must affect the electors in the States; and it is in the interests of those electors ""that there should be no friction between the Commonwealth and the States Governments. Any politician or such as public man who endeavours to foment - friction, and bring about strained relationships between the two governing powers, is no friend of united Australia, and is no friend, ultimately, of those electors whom he endeavours to influence. But there has been a disposition on the part of the States-no t one particular State, but all the States, more or less-to treat - the Commonwealth with a certain amount of hostility. There has been a disposition to make the (Sbmmon wealth a chopping-block for the purposes of particular States, and, latterly, the Commonwealth has been used as a means to gain advantage for a particular political' party in a State. In New South Wales, at the present time, there is serious friction between the State Government and the Commonwealth authorities. If the Commonwealth Government are inflicting the great I injuries on the State that are alleged-if the Commonwealth Government are treating the State Government in the high handed and unfriendly manner we have 'been led to .suppose-the n I myself and other members, who represent ""that S.tat.e, are failing in our duty if we do not challenge the power which is responsible for the wrong. Further, the Federal. Government are not true tp Federal principles, or to their duty under the Constitution, in so acting, if the charges can' be sustained. The criticism is. directed not merely against the Government, but against the Whole of the Federal Parliament; and each, member of this Chamber must take his share of blame if there be any blame. For instance, there is the imposition of a duty on wire netting, about-which so much has been made in the neighbouring - State of New South Wales. It is alleged that it is unconstitutional for the Federal Government to tax State imports, and on that allegation the New South Wales Government base the high-handed action they have taken. I remember that when the first Tariff' was. introduced it was proposed to eliminate the taxation on State imports; but, if I mistakenot, legal advice was sought, and Parliament, in its wisdom, decided that we were within our rights, and acting fairly to all the States in not differentiating between' States imports and private imports. No doubt there is a constitutional point involved. Originally, when the first Tariff was imposed, we were not in a position to get a definite decision on the point. No High Court had then been constituted; but a case had been taken to a State Court, and a decision given, the alternative left to the Federal Government being either to appeal to the Privy Council or constitute - a High Court. What was done was to constitute a High Court, which is clothed with power such as, I undertake to say, no other Court in the British Dominions possesses. Like the Supreme Court of the United States of America, it is the custodian and interpreter of our Constitution/and the question raised by the recent occurrences in New South Wale? comes well within its province. Is it the State Government or the Federal Government which should appeal to the Court? It is recognised as a good principle in law that the aggrieved. person is the one who should appeal for the justice he considers is denied him. The High Court has now been constituted over three or four. years, and there has been ample time for any of the States Governments to appeal. New South Wales is not treated differently from the other States in this instance; all the States are in a similar position. The imports of all the States Governments are taxed alike; so that, if there is a grievance, it is one shared by all the States. No State, however, beyond New South Wales, has seen fit to make any protest, and even the Government of New South Wales have paid the duty charges up to the present. Quite recently, however, the people of New South Wales awoke one morning to find the newspapers filled with reports of the extraordinary action of the Premier in going down and seizing by force a large quantity of wire-netting, which had been imported by the State Government for distribution amongst the settlers in the rabbit infested districts. I have here a report of the Sydney Morning Herald of what took place, and it shows that great prominence was given to the occurrence. The headings are as follow :PREMIER DEFIES DUTIES-UNCUS TOMED GOODS SEIZED BY FORCE - they RA ID ON DARLING ISLAND-AC T OF our WAR, OR ACT OF SMUGGLING ?LABOUR MEMBERS ENRAGED-DE MAN D MR. CARRUTHERS' ARREST. Then follows a description of what took political motives. place; and I gather that the Secretary of the Tender Board and an officer of the Law Department went to Darling Island, to make. accompanied by a number of carters and police, and removed the wire-netting on Mr Thomas Brown. trollies to the Government Stores. One paragraph of the newspaper report gives the following highly sensational accountMr Baxter, Acting Collector of Customs, wasin charge of the Customs officials, and directed? their operations. The conflict between the twojurisdictions was comic. A Customs officer laid his hand on a roll of netting. A police officer laid his hand on the shoulder of the Customs officer and ordered him to desist. The companions of the Customs officer urged him to take no notice of the policeman. The wharf labourers enjoyed the humour of the situation, and raised their hilarity to great heights by calling "" blackleg"" to the Customs officer.  tragedy ?",31
194,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"It is largely in the nature of comedy, but it is comedy with an element of tragedy behind it. If this action is going to breed ill-feeling between the States Governments and the Commonwealth Government, it will cease to be a comedy. Why was this extreme action taken by the State Government? It is claimed by the Government and it is only fair to say so-that the action was taken because it was considered an injustice was being done to the State; it was considered that the Federal Government were exceeding their constitutional right in charging a duty on the wire netting. And because the Premier of New South Wales had satisfied himself that his view in this regard was correct, he resorted to this extreme action.",33
195,Mr FRAZER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Is it not a fact that the New South Wales Government had been paying duty on Government stores for some months before? Mr THOMAS BROWN, - Since the introduction of the first Federal Tariff 4 duties have been paid on States imports. The Government of New South Wales is now engaged in a general election. It is fighting for its political life, and no doubt in the heat of a political battle feeling runs high, and sometimes statements are made and actions taken that are susequentlv regretted. But the ethics of right and wrong are applicable to political contests, just as are to the every day relationships of citizens, and any departure from them is to be condemned. It is alleged that - the State Government, in making this theatrical display, was largely actuated by",33
196,Mr MATHEWS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,That is a proper charge,33
197,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I think that the honourable member has some justification for that statement, since the Government did not attempt to take this action until it was in the throes of a general election. Another point.is that it directed its attention to a line of imports which affect a large body of electors, and refrained from taking action with respect to other imports which did not so directly affect the community. In the State political contest which has been waged fiercely in New South Wales for some weeks State.issues have disappeared from the forefront, and prominence has been given to 'Federal questions. The electors have been invited by the State Government to support an action which , they say, was taken to vindicate State rights. I would remind honourable members that State rights could not be vindicated in that way. The action taken by the Government of New South Wales might appeal to the passions and prejudices of a large section of the community, but even if , as the result of the election, the Ministerial party were returned in overwhelming numbers the question as to the right of the Commonwealth to impose duties on States imports would still remain in the position that it previously occupied. There is a legal channel through which a settlement of the question may be obtained, and there was absolutely no occasion for the theatrical display made by the Premier of New South Wales. A fact worthy of notice is that the State Government confined its attention to one line of goods, although at the time there were in the Customs sheds many other State imports which were dealt with in the ordinary way. Mr Baxter, the Acting Collector of Customs in New South Wales, is reported to have made the following statementIn this case no proper. entries were passed, and the Premier, as representing the State of New South Wales, sought to have a distinct breach .of the Commonwealth law committed, and he was using the police for the purpose of trying to carry out his evident intention. The carrier who took away those goods stands in the position of having to answer to the Customs authorities for his action. He is licensed by the Customs, and he will have to explain with why his licence should not be suspended or cancelled. Mr Baxter went on to say that goods imported for the Railway Commissioners, as well as for the Department of Public Works, were taken from the ship which brought out the consignment of wire-netting and were .dealt with in the usual way. Why did not the Premier of New South Wales seize those imports?",33
198,Mr MATHEWS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Because no farmers' votes were likely to be affected by such a seizure.,34
199,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"That may be the explanation. A seizure of material required for the Public Works Department, the Railways Commissioners, or the Water and Sewerage Board, would not have appealed to the self-interest of such a large section of. the community as did the seizure of wire netting. This wire netting is not being imported for the purposes of the Government. It is brought out for resale at cost price to settlers all over New South Wales. A large quantity has been so distributed. The Government did not propose to fence in with wire netting the vacant Crown lands of New South Wales, and, as a matter of fact, only a small quantity of wire netting has been used by it to inclose the State experimental farms.",34
200,Mr MATHEWS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,And some of their land scandals.,34
201,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I have no desire to be drawn into a discussion Of the New South Wales land scandals. Had there been a principle at stake, the Government would have been on solid ground in seizing other State imports. If Customs taxation could be avoided by such a step, if State imports were beyond the scope of Commonwealth taxation,"" the uniformity of Tariff legislation would be destroyed. In such circumstances, the Government of a State where the majority of the people believed in free-trade would simply indent large quantities of general merchandise and re-sell it to the public at cost price. There would be chaos so far as uniformity of Tariff legislation was concerned. No doubt that is one reason why the Commonwealth holds that States imports must be subject to taxation, just as are private imports. Whilst the action of the Government of New South Wales is supported by many people in that State, many others there take up a more reasonable attitude. When the telegraph wires flashed to the different States the news of what had been done, forth- 'one of the first public men to express an opinion upon it was the honourable member for Parkes. No one can fairly say that the honourable member is hostile to the party led by Mr Carruthers. It is practically a section of the Federal party which he represents. ' In an interview with a representative of the 5 vdney Morning Herald he characterized the action of the Minister as "" a most unfortunate indiscretion on the part of the State Premier."" Then, again, Senator Millen, who in State politics was a prominent member of the same party, and still belongs to it, referred to the action as a "" regrettable incident."" These gentlemen pointed out that .there was open to the State Government a proper constitutional method of determining the question at issue. Mr David Storey, a member of the Liberal and Reform Party in New South Wales, who has been in State politics for some years, expressed himself very freely with respect to Mr Carruthers' action. He is reported to have saidNo doubt the people of this State are very much incensed at the manner in which they have been treated by the Federal authorities. Still, bad as that is, it does not warrant the high-handed action of the State Premier. He should set a better example to every person in the State. He concludedThere is no doubt the whole move has the suspicion of being an electioneering one, and, if that is so, it is really unfortunate. Why did the Treasury wait until the eve of an election before making a seizure? Some goods must have come into Port lackson Harbor during the past three years for the State upon which it had to pay duty. In this case I think it will be found that the State will be considered as a corporation engaged in. trade. If that be not so, then for goodness sake let us have socialism in everything, and understand exactly where we are. That was the statement of a gentleman who cannot be said to be hostile to the party led by the Premier of New South Wales. The honourable member for South Sydney, who is a level-headed man, and does not often permit his feelings to run awav with his discretion, characterized the whole thing as "" an electioneering dodge,"" and Mr MCGowen. the leader of the State Labour Party, practically reiterated that opinion.. I find also that this action on the part of the State Government has been adversely criticised, and justly so, in other States. As soon as information reached Queensland the Premier of that State, in the course of an interview, saidThe action, he thought, was not justified by the circumstances, nor was it likely to l e r.pproved of by the country generally. He went on to sayThe New South Wales Government was not. really called upon to take heroic measures, reason, if no other, that it had already A judgment in its favour, a judgment when the Federal authorities attempted to impose duties in a similar case.

It was not a wise course, nor was it dignified. 1. am pleased to say that whilst in New South Wales, as in other States, great public journals often express extreme political views, and whilst their columns often contain appeals to prejudice and passion, great organs like the Sydney Morning Herald and the Daily Telegraph, which are important factors in the politics of the mother State, have adversely criticised the action of Mr Carruthers, and have practically told him that he has been guilty of a grave blunder, i would further point out. that the friction which has been gradually growing between the States and the Commonwealth has not been brought about by any unfair treatment on the part of the Federation. But unfortunately the Commonwealth seems to be regarded by the States as a - good chopping block. In short, it now occupies a position very similar to that which has long been occupied by the Labour Party. That party has always been held responsible for every evil which has overtaken the body politic. In New South Wales not long since a Commission was appointed to investigate the birth-rate of that State. The result of its labours was the discovery of the 'fact that the birth-rate was declining. Of course, the - Labour Party was declared to be responsible for this, until the Bulletin showed that it was not amongst the supporters of the Labour movement that the birth-rate had declined the most, but amongst their bitterest opponents. That is only a sample of the kind of criticism which is levelled against the Labour Party by a .large section of the community. In Federal matters the Commonwealth Parliament is taking the place of the Labour Party as a convenient scapegoat. If anything goes wrong in the States, the blame is at once attributed to the Commonwealth Parliament. At the present time the question of the land scandals in New South Wales and other considerations are being completely - overshadowed by imaginary grievances against for the the Commonwealth Government, and by grievances alleged to be due to the imposiCustoms tion of a uniform Tariff. That is unfortunate. To a large extent the present situation is full of the comic element, and this fact seems to have forcibly struck the police officer under whose' direction the police in New South Wales attempted to remove wire-netting from the control of the Customs authorities; In an interview with that officer which was published on the day following the remarkable action taken at the instance of Mr Carruthers it is statedActing Superintendent Mitchell, in whose division the incident took place, was on the wharf early in the afternoon. He stated that the matter was treated in different manners by the different people connected with it. Comedy and drama were strangely mingled, and at times the whole position seemed' to the onlooker like a huge farce. But whilst the situation possesses all the elements of comedy, it also has in it the elements of tragedy. If the present friction is being fomented for purely political purposes, and if at future State elections Federal issues are to be introduced with a view to putting before the electors a false idea of the Federal attitude, the result must be disastrous to a united Australia. If such action does not end in the disintegration. of the union, it will certainly be productive of discord which will be detrimental to sound government. It will leave behind it .a bitter feeling which must operate in the direction of weakening the Federal sentiment, and of reproducing the sad episodes reported from South America, where people who should be one in Sympathy and aspiration are at bitterest enmity with each other. I hope that the Commonwealth Government will deal with the present position in a firm manner. In my judgment the attitude of past Governments in attempting to concili"" ate the States authorities has resulted in the latter becoming very much' like spoilt children, who, if they cannot get their way in every respect, consider that they have a legitimate grievance. The attitude taken up by Mr Carruthers is not only undignified, but it is derogatory to the maintenance of constituted authority, and only serves to heap ridicule upon the State which he represents. At the present time there are those who say that the Premier of New South Wales is more like a monkey on a stick than a reasonable administrator. repeat that past Commonwealth Administrations are to some extent responsible for this unfortunate position, in that they have treated the States Governmentswith' such undue consideration .that the Hatter are now disposed to adopt the role of the spoilt child, who "" plays up "" whenever he cannot get exactly what he wants. I am oleased to know that leading public men in New South Wales, whoseopinions will carry some weight in that State, when the heat of political passion has subsided-me n like the honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member for Robertson-hav e so firmly expressed their disapproval of the action of Mr Carruthers. I earnestly trust that in the years to come we shall not have anymore exhibitions of a similar character. Their tendency undoubtedly is to bring, the State into disrepute, and to strike a blow at the Federation. In the course of his very able address the other evening, the honourable member for Parkes quoted from the utterances of Professor MCMillan Brown, who is at present delivering a series of lectures in Sydney. He expressed the opinion that it was very desirable to encourage settlement upon our territorial lands, and to discourage the congestion of population in our large cities. He said that the best type of mankind was produced under rural conditions, and that the cities had to draw their vitality from the country. He further^added that he was in favour of any movement which would have the effect of extending - the facilities for establishing in our midst a rural population. Members of the Labour Party have always advocated that principle. It is one of the primary planks of their platform. We believe that Australia will never become truly great whilst its fertile lands and large mineral deposits remain locked up and unexploited, and whilst its population is concentrated in large cities under unhealthy conditions. We welcome the adherence of the honourable member for Parkes to that doctrine. Probably he does not favour the methods by which we propose to achieve our purpose. But what are methods except means to secure an object? If the honourable member has a better' method for securing that object. I do not think that the Labour Party will quarrel with him in regard to it, because, once the object has been secured, we shall have attained the end for which we have been working. But when I the honourable gentleman came to deal with means, he departed from many of the principles which have been laid down by ' the Labour Party as essential to the attainment of this end. In the first place, - he - made - the extraordinary statement that the demand for land in New South Wales is not so-large as it appears to be - He gave it .as a - reason why settlement has' not taken place more quickly, that the public has been taught to think that it should get land very cheaply, and therefore is not prepared to pay the prices asked by private holders which, he considered, not unreasonable. I do not know how he arrives at these conclusions. As a matter of fact, the legislation of the Stale has not made things too easy for the settler. My opinion is that the high prices charged for Crown land, and the harsh conditions insisted upon in connection with its purchase, have done much to retard settlement. When a man goes into the wilderness, and proceeds to cut out of the forest a home for. himself, he has to expose himself to considerable hardship, and, notwithstanding his great expense of capital and labour, must wait. - it least five years for a return. But when settlers have to nurse their land, not merely for five, but for ten or fifteen years, they feel the conditions to be such that only those who possess considerable capital can afford to comply with them. In many instances, after men have spent all their capital and most of their lives in trying to make homes in the country, they have failed, and their land has reverted to pastoral occupation. But for years the demand for land in New South Wales has been increasing. Unfortunately, that State, like Victoria, is hide-bound, and the opportunities for obtaining land, either from the Crown or from private holders, are so few that settlement is blocked. The honourable member for Parkes says that the ballots which take place do not represent the legitimate demand for land; but in this connection the following figures should prove interesting:-When fourteen small blocks, not exceeding 600 acres each, were made available at Brookong, near Narrandera, r , i 14 applicants balloted for them. At Molong there were sixty applicants for one block of 650 acres; sixty-one applicants for one block of 700. acres, at a place 25 miles from Wellington; 350 applicants for six blocks in the New England district ; at Port Macquarie. fifty-two applicants for nine blocks; at Corowa, 281 applicants for eleven blocks; at Gobbagombalin, 202 applicants for 145 blocks; at Mvall Creek, twenty-two applicants for three blocks, and at Rocky Creek, 296 applicants for eleven blocks.",34
202,Mr MATHEWS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,The demand for land exists throughout Australia.,37
203,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I believe so; but it is more noticeable in New South Wales and in Victoria than in other States, because the opportunities for obtaining land under conditions which allow a fair return for the expenditure of capital and labour are restricted in these States, by reason of the large amount of alienation which has already taken place. Whilst in years gone by there was considerable speculation in country land, that is largely prevented by the existing legislation. Every application for Crown land is considered by a Board, and if found to be illegitimate, the money deposited in connection with it may be forfeited.' Then, again, a single applicant has to give place to a married applicant, and an applicant without capital to an applicant who has capital. These, and other conditions, have largely eliminated mere speculation. But the figures which I have read show that there is a great demand for land, and many disappointed applicants for it. All over the State of New South Wales sons of farmers, who are those best qualified to take up land, find it impossible to get it. They travel throughout the State engaging in ballots, and say that it is as reasonable to hope to gain a fortune in Tattersall's sweeps, as to hope to secure a holding by success in balloting - The other day, in my electorate, in a district in which' something like Â£6,000 was paid to land agents to improperly secure improvement leases, a block of 700 acres of what was considered poor land was made available for settlement, and there were twenty-nine applications for it. A large number of applicants went to the ballot; but an appeal was made against the Board's ratification - to the successful applicant, on the ground that he had not driven in a peg at one corner by a certain time. Ultimately, the question went to the higher Courts, with the result that the appellant was put in possession. I refer to the case to show that, so great is the desire for land, that men will spend money in trying to secure it by taking advantage of the technicalities of the law. In New South Wales, land monoplv has reached very large proportions, and leading economic thinkers say_ that the monopoly of land, to a large extent, determines the monopoly of wealth. If land is held in the hands of a few, the wealth of the country must, as a natural corollary, be in the hands of a few. I find that New South Wales has alienated 48,081,314 acres of her best country lands. Of this area, 11,256,871 acres are held by 69,438 families, the backbone of the country, and the great producers of its wealth; 13,994,182 acres are comprised in 5,500 holdings not exceeding 10,000 acres each; and 22,831,261 acres are in the possession of 722 holders; so that nearly half of the alienated area is in the hands of fewer than 1,000 persons. On the other hand, over 500,000 persons who have the right to vote in State and Commonwealth elections, do not possess land. In regard to the possession of wealth, I find, from the latest statistics given by Mr H all , that the number of persons possessing less than Â£ 2 0 0 each is 61,286, their accumulations representing Â£ 5 , 4 7 4 , 6 0 0. The number of those who possess between Â£ 2 0 0 and Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 is 123,695, and their accumulations amount to Â£110,603,000 , while the number of those possessing over Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 is 10,853, ^ their accumulations represent Â£259,674,000 . According to Mr H all , probably half of the accumulated wealth of New South-Wales is held by fewer than 3,000 persons, while over 550,000 adults have no interest in the accumulated wealth of the State, which he estimates at Â£375,752,000 , and other competent authorities at Â£400,000,000 . hear of the great wealth of Australia, and statistics are quoted to show the value of our productions, and of our accumulations per head of population; but the real prosperity of a community is to be determined by the distribution of its wealth. withstanding the mineral, agricultural, and pastoral resources and potentialities of New South Wales, there are sweated workers in her large cities whose conditions are paralleled only in the larger cities in the old world. In Sydney, at the present time, there are about 1,000 young women and girls employed in shops ancl factoriesfor wages of 5s. a week, and - Some of them are receiving no wages at all, but are living in hopes that when they perfect themselves in their particular industry they may be placed on the wages list. In the Arbitration Court of New South Wales there has been a revelation as to the miserable wages paid to men engaged-in the large retail shops in Sydney. Those men pass hundreds of pounds through their hands every week, and earn much profit for their employers; and yet they receive the miserable pittance of 30s. or Â£ 2 per week, and, if it be the latter sum, they regard themselves as on the top rung. Such are the - conditions which obtain in Sydney, and which we, who represent the labour movement, desire to see improved. We wish to see sweating eliminated, and decent wages paid. We feel that so long as land monopoly exists, and so long as the best of our alienated lands is in the hands of so few people, who utilize it for the primitive purposes of running stock, and do not use it to its full capacity-, there will be concentration of wealth in the hands of the few, with the result that large numbers of people must live under wretched conditions, approximating to those of the congested centres of the old world. I trust that, as the outcome of humane and just legislation, we shall be able to make this country one in which decent white men can live with advantage and comfort. We trust that Australia will not be a sweaters' country-that we shall not have large numbers of men and women living under sweated conditions, by which a n < they are not only demoralized, but become a menace to - our civilization. I hope we shall endeavour,.by fair and equitable legislation, to improve the conditions of the workers whenever opportunity offers. We have only a limited population in this great country at the present time. There is but a fringe of people along the coast-line; and there are many miles of territory that We is practically very seldom trod by the feet of man, and is in a condition of primitive occupation. We cannot hold this continent under such conditions for anygreat length of time. Indeed, the surprise is. that we have been able to hold Not- it so long. We can only hold this land on the condition that we fill it with population. If we desire to make Australia a part and parcel of the Empire to which we belong, we must encourage the immigration of people of our own kith and kin. Where is the sense of talking about immigration when we cannot retain our own people-whe n we cannot provide reasonably less. and legitimately for the needs of those already, here-whe n young men and women of our agricultural districts are forced beyond our borders ? If these, people simply removed to other parts ' of Australia, there would be no loss to the Commonwealth. But people are in large numbers moving from the central districts of New South Wales to New Zealand, and also to Canada and South Africa. This indicates an unhealthv state of affairs: and to talk about the encouragement of immigration while that state of affairs continues is to delude immigrants and talk bunkum. We must make the conditions such as will invite immigrants. I know there are those Vvho consider that the only immigrants who should be encouraged are those of the manual labouring class, so that when labour is wanted in the factory, in the mine, or on the station, it shall be easy to procure it at a cheap rate. But if such labour cannot be employed for the whole of the year, then a certain burden must fall on the States, and hence it is that we have soup kitchens, labour bureaux, and other forms of Government assistance in slack time. It is to this reservoir of labour that employers resort in busy times. Such are not conditions to attract the best classes of labour from the old world to Australia. are not the conditions which will keep in our midst men and women who have sufficient enterprise and energy to make the best of life, and if we cannot keep our own people there is no use in introducing the wrecks and cast-offs from - other places. Such a policy, so far from being an advantage, would create new social troubles. The sooner we face this matter as a community, and regard it from a practical stand-point, the better it will be for us. The sooner those who are engaged in production on a large scale recognise that they owe something to the State, and that their possessions, whether they be in land or othenvise, largely rest on the progress of the community as a whole, and the sooner an endeavour is made to create a population existing on sound industrial lines, better it will be for all. Therefore, I trust that, as the outcome of the serious consideration which is being directed to social problems in this twentieth century, owing largely to the presence of the Labour Party in politics, we shall discover a soluCalare, tion of the evils I have attempted to describe. Very serious problems face modern civilization, and those problems must be solved. The main problem is presented to us in the slums and in the sweated lives of the masses of men and women, and in the fact that 1,000 people, for example, own half of the best land in New South Wales, while that land is not being put to profitable use. The problem is also represented by the fact that, although New South Wales is a wonderful producer of wealth-one of the largest in the British Dominions-the whole of that wealth is in the hands of less than 200,000 people, no less than 550,000 people having no' lot or part in it. Unhealthy conditions obtain in our cities, and these necessitate soupkitchens and other relief movements, thus leading to a loss of moral stamina and creating a menace to racial progress. If Mr Thomas Brown. these evil conditions are not improved we cannot expect to hold our own in competition with other races. These barriers toprogress which we are transplanting from, the old world are a menace to our civilization, and a disgrace to our Christianity! Such are the problems that face us at the very door of the twentieth century, and our future safety and progress lie in their solution. Mr HANS IRVINE , (Grampians) [5-5S]-- I listened to the Acting .Prime Minister's Budget speech with very great Such attention, and I recognise the difficulties hemust have had, not only in preparing that speech, but in deciding, during his absence in England, while engaged on the work of the Commonwealth, on what Tariff to submit to the House. In common with other honourable members, I regret the absence of the Prime Minister, and I arn sure that we all hope that he will very shortly return, restored to health, and able to take his proper place as the leader of the Government. The Acting Prime Minister, in htsspeech, referred tp the great prosperity which Australia has experienced since the inauguration of Federation. While I am willing to give the Commonwealth Parliament and Government every credit that is due, I do not think that they are entitled to the credit - for our prosperity. There is the no doubt that since 1902 our progress has been largely due to the fertility of our soil, our abundant sunshine, bounteous rains, the industry of the people, and more scientific methods of cultivation. The honourable member for on the other hand,- referred to the great poverty which he says is to be found in Australia, and to the consequent establishment of soup kitchens and other relief movements. I do not think the honourable member should have made remarks of that kind, because they are not called for in this country. My opinion is that the bulk of whatever poverty there may be is due to the fact that .there are people who look for work and do not want it when it has been found for them.",37
204,Mr CARE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,The honourable member has had only a limited experience.,39
205,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I have had as much experience as the honourable member, and, possibly, have worked as hard, if not: harder, than he has.",39
206,Mr CARR,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,I beg to differ from the honourable member.,39
207,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"The people whoreally know me are not likely to differ from ""trie on that point. In my opinion there very little poverty in Australia, - and, matter of fact, it is a difficult matter get labour in the back country today, either for farming or mining. I understand why the honourable member for Calare should insist that there is extraordirevenue, nary poverty in a country like Australia, burden of taxation. - where we have such abundant harvests such great prosperity. Had the honourable member said that there was great prospropose perity, but no progress, I should have agreed with him. As a matter of fact, our population has increased by less than half a million since Federation; that - increase is only what we might have exin pected naturally and without immigration. The fact does not say much for Fedeto ration or for our progress; it means that, as a people, we have stagnated. We shall continue to stagnate until iegislate with a view to attracting populaSouth tion, and settling our lands. Australia can never become a greatself-contained country until we have population, and the present Government and its predecessors in office should have legislated to it. We have been told that the total revenue received last year by the Commondeal wealth was Â£12,832,266, and that our expenditure during the same period Unfortunately, amounted to Â£4,987,301. That appears the Governmentwecontemplate to be a fairly large outlay, having regard to reduce the incidence of taxation, to the revenue actually available for monwealth purposes. This year, under new Tariff, it is anticipated that we have a revenue from all sources of about Â£13,745,200, or an increase of Â£912,934, which will come chiefly from the primary something. producer and the consumer. Every man, wealth. woman and child in the Commonwealth will have to bear increased taxation to the - extent of 5s. per head, and practically the whole of that increased revenue is to be expended on various works. . Our penditure this year will amount, it is mated, to Â£5,967,992, as compared with expenditure of Â£4,987,301 during the preceding. twelve months, and will repreof sent about Â£1,500,000 per 1,000,000 the population. That is a large extion penditure for a limited number of people to be called upon to bear, and must be admitted that the worker will .have to carry the greater part of the taxainformation tion necessary to provide for it. On turning to the Estimates we find that there is an increase in respect of the cost administering nearly every Department. recognise that it is right and proper that facturer. Budget.

We have heard for some time many representations as to the necessity for land settlement, and I have no hesitation in saying that we have all the States millions of acres of land available for settlement without resorting any general taxation proposals such as have been suggested during this debate. There is plenty of land available in we Queensland, Western Australia, New Wales, and South Australia. Even in ""Victoria, which we are told sometimes could be covered by a pocket handkerchief, there is plenty, of land available for industrious men, and facilities are attract offered to them to get on to it.",39
208,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"There is a good of land available, even in Tasmania.",40
209,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"That is so. do not know what steps with a view and Comto further develop our industries. The the passing of the Bounties Bill will mean shall that this Parliament will be committed 'practically to a further expenditure of like Â£500,000, with a view to fostering new industries in the Common",40
210,Mr WH IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"This House, not the Parliament.",40
211,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Quite so. I exagree with the proposal made in another estiplace, that we should establish, first of an all, a Federal Bureau of Agriculture on lines similar to those on which the Bureau Agriculture in the United States of of America is conducted. Such an instituwould enable the people to obtain analyses of the soils and other authoriit tative information with regard to cultivation and production. It would furnish as to the crops best suited to the soils of various districts, and its ex-perts would instruct and teach the people of what to grow, and how to garner what I they produced,, and prepare it for the manuThese are changes which, so to speak, should go hand in hand with the bounties proposals. I recognise that there are some difficulties in the way, but they are not numerous, and I think that a Federal Bureau could be carried on in conjunction with the States Departments of Agriculture-' The matter certainly requires some consideration, and I think that we should have from the Government some definite announcement on the subject. When the right honourable member for Swan was Treasurer he submitted to the Conference of Premiers at Brisbane a scheme in substitution for the Braddon section.",40
212,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"And a very good scheme too. . Mr HANS IRVINE - I recognise that its adoption might interfere with the capacity of this Parliament to provide for great national works yet to be carried out. realise to the full as I never did as a ber of the Legislative Council of Victoria, that the Federation at all times must be paramount. The States must occupy a more or less subordinate position, and the Federal Parliament must enter upon its work in a truly Federal spirit. The sooner we recognise that the better. At the same time, we have to remember that the States in agreeing to federate did not intend to create a master to rule - over them, and do little but place fresh' burdens on the people. We have to remember that the electors of the Commonwealth Parliament are identical with the electors of the States Legislatures, and that whilst the Government are the managers honourable members generally are the directors of the great Commonwealth institution. As directors it is our duty to instruct the managers, and if they do not attend to the necessities of the country-in the way which we, as representatives of the people, expect them to do, we have our remedy. Although the Acting Prime Minister said he could not agree with the financial scheme submitted to the Premiers of the States by the right honourable member for Swan, he did not indicate an alternative scheme.",41
213,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,He hopes to do so.,41
214,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"The country expects' him to do so. It is only right that the States Treasurers should know what they are to expect from the Commonwealth. The Acting Prime Minister said that the right honourable member for Swan's scheme was impracticable. If he holds that view, he should tell us what, in his opinion, is a practicable scheme; he ought certainly to submit an alternative proposal. I do not propose to discuss this question at length, - since it has already been dealt with during this debate by other honourable members; but I desire to say that some at least of the proposals made by the right honourable member for Swan were fair and reasonable. If we are to carry on the duties of Federation, and take over more services from the States, then our expenditure must increase. The tendency of the Government seems to be to take over new services before we are really prepared to administer them. In making this statement, I have in mind more particularly the action of the Ministry in regard to the question of quarantine. There are some matters which might be allowed to remain for a time in abeyance, but there are others that are urgent and necessary. I think it is highly I desirable that the Commonwealth' Governmem- ment should say definitely what are their proposals in regard to the transfer of the debts of the States. During the operation of the Braddon section we have to return to the States three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and if at the end of 1910 we take over the debts of the States, nearly the whole of the revenue will be absorbed.",41
215,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"If we fake over the whole of the debts, nearly the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue will be required for the payment of interest.",41
216,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Quite so. . Possibly the States may agree to our taking that step, but I do not think that they will. They need revenue to develop their territories, and it is only right that they should learn, without further delay, how the Government propose to proceed in this matter. It is also expected by the people that the Government will proceed without delay with the Bill to. provide for the appointment of a High Commissioner, and to establish in London large, commodious, and centrally situated offices. Speaking as a commercial man, I may say at once that I regard the establishment of a Commonwealth office in London as being most essential. It would be a reproductive work. Within the last year or two I have had' an opportunity to see the excellent work done by the Dominion of. Canada in making known its resources to the people of the- old world. I have been told that Canada-, spends annually some hundreds of thousands of pounds in advertising. ThePrime Minister and the Treasurer, when in London, doubtless saw their commodious: offices there. Consignments of produce arrive almost every month from Canada, and are displayed in the Canadian offices. Maps showing lands available for settlement and pamphlets setting forth the facilities for settlement provided by the Dominion Government are also obtainable there, whilst there is on view a model of a steamship showing the class of berths with which immigrants to Canada are provided. Every facility for obtaining' infor-. mation with regard to Canada is offered the people of England, and, as the result of advertisements and lectures in Europe, the Canadian Government have practically doubled their population. Meanwhile, we have been stagnating. The Commonwealth Parliament has had five clear years in which to make an effort to secure an influx of population, but practically nothing has been done. I was glad to hear the Acting Prime Minister the other day refer to this question. He said he was in treaty with the London County Council for a ninety-nine years' lease of a block of land in a central position in London. I know the site well, and would thoroughly approve of its selection. I should be delighted to hear.the Acting Prime Minister announce that the Government had secured a lease of the land, and had decided to erect suitable offices upon it. That is an undertaking which the people of Australia expect the Government to carry out. After the appointment of a High Commissioner and the establishment of suitable Commonwealth offices in London, the Agents-General of the several States will no longer be necessary. The Commonwealth High Commissioner could have the assistance of experts from the Agricultural Department and the Lands Department of each State, and could make arrangements to give the people of the old land some idea of our mineral, dairying, agricultural, and pastoral resources. Displays could be made of everything that we produce. The Commonwealth offices could, in fact, the made a miniature exhibition.",41
217,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Does the honourable member approve of the site offered to us?,42
218,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I think it is one of the best in London, and, as I said when the Bounties Bill was under consideration, I wish I were in the position to take it myself, with the object of pushing on the industry with which I am connected. I do not think a better site could be secured. .Any one who speaks of the necessity of choosing a site in the heart of the city of London does not understand the conditions of the commercial world. After 7 o'clock at night one might discharge a cannon in any of the streets in the heart of London without fear of hitting any one. As a matter of fact, I do not think that one could get a meal there after 8 o'clock at night. We do not want to establish Commonwealth offices in a locality where there are no people. We ought to erect them upon a site near to the theatres- a site which people-will have to pass in Hooking to their amusements. The site suggested by the Acting Prime Minister is an admirable one from that stand-point. If we established our offices there, by means of ejectric lights and display windows they could be utilized to illustrate to the sightseeing populace of London the resources of Australia. Between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. tens of thousands of persons pass that particular site. The effect of advertising our resources in the windows of these offices would be tc draw attention to the wealth of Australia in a much more striking manner than the Agents-General can direct attention to it. At the present time, one State has an office at Westminster, another in the city, and a third in some other locality. I maintain that a combined display is what we require, if we wish to direct attention to our resources and to attract population. I blame past Administrations for not having stated definitely what they proposed to do in regard to the appointment of a High Commissioner and to the establishment of Commonwealth offices in London.",42
219,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,We propose to obtain the site suggested.,42
220,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"If that be done, I presume that the erection of ""the necessary buildings will occupy two or three years. In the meantime, I suggest that we Ought to lease temporary offices in a central position. An arrangement might then be made with the States Governments for the Agents-General-if the States intend to continue their separate representatives in London-to move into the new buildings when they were completed. Some of the Agents-General of the States are doing excellent work . In this connection, I may 1 specially mention the Agents-General of Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia. But they, are all working apart from one another. As a matter of fact, there is some jealousv existing between the representatives of the different States in the world's metropolis. That jealousy ought tiot to exist. We desire to establish Commonwealth offices in London-offices in which all the Slates will be able to display their products to the advancement of Australian industry. Whilst I thoroughly approve of any proposal in that direction, I should be better pleased if I were informed that the Acting Prime Minister intended to take action. I do not believe in delay, because I hold that it is harmful to Australia. We want more people in the Commonwealth to share our prosperity and our taxation. The conversion of the States debts can better be brought about by the appointment of a High Commissioner. It has been said that in converting the various State loans we - shall require to proceed very slowly. Personally, I do not think we ought to experience much difficulty in that connection. If we could effect a saving of only Â£ per cent, upon our States debts it would be equivalent to Â£600,000 per annum, whilst the - saving of Â£ per cent, would represent no less than- -Â£1,200,000 annually. Surelv some effort should have been made .in this direction ere now. Had a saving of only i per cent, been effected upon our indebtedness during the past five years, it would have represented no less a sum than Â£3,000,000 saved to the people. such circumstances surely the conversion of these debts was worth accomplishing, - even if we had had to pay a spedial financial expert to the old country, and ' endeavour to bring our debenture-holders together. If we had only provided for the transfer of the debts and for converting them when it suited us to do so, we should at - least have accomplished"" something. ' I'have no desire to say any more upon this phase of the question, but when the Acting Prime Minister again addresses the Committee I trust that he will give honourable members definite information in regard to the appointment of a High Commissioner and to the transfer and conversion of the States debts. I hope that he will ralso inform us as to what he intends to propose in substitution for the - Braddon section of the Constitution: Of course it is essential that the States shall know their financial position, - otherwise the present feeling of disaffection towards the Commonwealth will increase. ' It is our duty to work harmoniously with the States, and to give.them no cause for believing that the Commonwealth Government wishes to take advantage of them. I now wish to say a few words Mr Hans Irvine. in regard to the Tariff proposals of the Government. As a protectionist I have seen the benefits accruing from a protective policy, and I have also witnessed the evil effects of free-trade. But if I cannot get all I want, I intend, upon the principle that half a loaf is better than no bread, to take what I can get. There is no doubt that throughout the Commonwealth the people at the last election pronounced themselves in f avour of protection. But they did not declare themselves in favour of a prohibitive Tariff, and I do not intend to support one. During my recent campaign I did not address a single meeting at which I did not say that I would support an effective measure of protection, but would oppose prohibitive protection. That is the attitude that I intend to adopt towards the Tariff.",42
221,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Does the honourable member consider that a duty of 30 per cent, upon wire netting is a prohibitive duty ?",43
222,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Certainly . We must not undulv tax the primary' producer or consumer. On the contrary, we must give every person an inducement to better his position in life. It is the desire of Under every man to improve his position, not merely for his own sake, but for that of his family. I have seen the evil effects of prohibitive protection in America and on visit the Continent. Our population being 1 small, I can only characterize the prohibitive duties proposed by the Government as absurd. The highest duties that I intend to support are those which have . been recommended by the protectionist, section, of the Tariff Commission, and even some of these I think ought to be reduced. I trust that the 'Government will endeavour, to remove the uneasy feeling which exists throughout.Australia that they are attempting .to take advantage of their opportunity to add to the burdens of the people..' I am satisfied that that was not their intention, in framing this Tariff. They desired to merely assist the establishment of further industries. But I would point out' that they are proposing to still further protect industries which are already in a - flourishingcondition. Our woollen mills are. actually .refusing orders, and vet the Government propose to assist them by the imposition of duties upon their' products ranging from 40 to 45 per cent. I trust that the Ministry will withdraw any. proposal to impose higher duties than those which have been recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. As I have already stated, in some cases even those duties are too high. Ministry will act in the way that I suggest they will gain, not only my hearty support, but that of many other honourable members who view this question through the taining same glasses. I know that they deputting sire to make Australia a self-contained community. But we cannot accomplish that if we erect prohibitive barriers around our shores before we have a sufficient population to bear the burdens upon them. If we desire prohibitive tection, we must proceed slowly, as Germany and America did. Their protective Tariffs are prohibitive, but those countries are self-contained, the former having population of 60,000,000, and the latter of 80,000,000. Those countries did not erect their high protective walls immedibines, ately. They started with a small wall, and gradually increased its height.",43
223,Mr GROOM,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Upon that principle, we ought to increase the duties levied under the old Tariff.",44
224,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Those duties were sufficiently increased when we fedeturers. rated. Our population, on the other hand, cannot be said to have increased. The Attorney-General will be at liberty to talk as much as he pleases when protection, I have concluded my remarks. If I am not talking common sense, I am quite open to correction. I repeat that I have seen the evil effects of free-trade in Great Britain, and I consider that the adoption policy ' would prove a curse to the Commonwealth. We must secure effective protection, but we must not adopt a prohieffective bitive Tariff. That is why I am opposed to the Government proposals.",44
225,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"So long as we get effective protection, that is all that desire.",44
226,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"But there is a difference between effective protection prohibitive protection. I hope that the vernment will recollect that a limited lation, such as we have in Australia, cannot continue to bear the burdens which Tariff imposes upon it. Let us use best endeavours to direct the attention old country to our resources. Let us late industry, but do not let us do means of prohibitive duties, which can result in the creation of trusts. In passing, I may mention that when I was in. Caliage fornia two years ago I visited some of large tinning factories there. of these visits, I inquired, "" How is it that such exorbitant prices are charged by the If the stores for all those tinned goods?"" The reply which I received was, "" We make the prices. We have a combine, the members of which meet together with a view of ascerhow many tins of fruit each will be up during the year. This year we find that the ' outnut will be about 50,000,000 tins, and as our home consumption amounts to 35,000,000 tins, we shall 1I have 15,000,000 tins to burn-that is, toimposed dump in free foreign ports."" proSitting stxpended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m.",44
227,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I saw canned fruit which, in California, was retailed at half-a-dollar, sold in London for iod. a These facts show that a country does not benefit by prohibitive protection; that the result of prohibition is to build up commonopolies and trusts, which exploit the people who are taxed for their benefit. In America there is also a strong iron and steel combine, which manufactures largely in excess of American requirements, selling the surplus chiefly to Great Britain for less than is charged to American manufacSome persons say that that is the salvation of England, but, in my opinion, it is detrimental to the interests of many English workers, who, for lack of effective find it difficult to obtain employment. I am in favour of effective protection, but opposed to. prohibition.",44
228,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,The Government desires only to make the Tariff effecof that tively protective.,44
229,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"The ideas of Ministers differ from mine as to what is protection. Duties of 100, 200 and 300 per cent, on manufactured articles, and of 10, 15, and 20 per cent, on raw materials, are higher than merely effective we protective duties would be. If Ministers had adopted the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commisand sion, I could have fallen into line with Gothem, but I am opposed to the Tariff as it popustands. ' When in London, I , saw sold', wholesale, at 2d. a lb., singed Canadian this bacon, which costs; more ,than orour dinary cured bacon, and is worth of the 5d. a lb. wholesale where it is manufacstimutured. If Great Britain had a duty or* so by bacon, her consumers might have to pay only more for it, but more work would be given to her people. We ought to try to encourindustries here, but we should do what the we can to prevent .the building up of mono' During one polies and combines.",44
230,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Would it not be well to devote our attention first to building ;up of industries, dealing with monopolies later on?",45
231,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"It must be reit so membered that we have a population of only 4,000,000 people, and must rely other countries for the consumption of the bulk of our production. When our popuof lation has doubled or trebled, we may perhaps raise our barriers, which, first place, should not be higher than is reasonable, and when we become a nation of 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 we may, if we increased ? like, adopt the policy of prohibition, as America and Germany have done.",45
232,Mr GROOM,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Is it not in the early stages that protection is so necessary?,45
233,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"As a nation we are only in swaddling-clothes, are apeing the manners of nations whose population is numbered in tens of millions, while ours is numbered in millions. We must protect our industries, but we ought not to unduly increase the cost of living to our consumers, or handicap our primary should producers. If we have prohibition, trusts and combines will spring up. In America the supply of almost everything except fresh air is controlled by trusts and bines, and in New York, because of the huge sky-scrapers that tower twenty and thirty stories high, even fresh air is diffibroad cult to obtain.",45
234,Mr STORRER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,:-Are there not combines in England?,45
235,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"There are comtory bines almost everywhere. We wish to keep them out of Australia. If we bition, legislation will be useless tp prevent the growth of combines. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has stated that the Excise legislation passed last Parliament to regulate the price of harvesters has been effective. What we must do is to prevent birth of combines. The Tariff Commission spent 2 years in travelling from one capiBritain, 1 tal to another, examining witnesses to obBritish tain all the information available in regard to the operation of the last-Tariff, and needs of our manufacturing industries. Government might have been expected to of the country. fix the rates of duty in accordance with the recommendations of that body, which were based on solid reasons. Unfortunways ately they have not done so. When I heard the Acting Prime Minister say that it intended to give Great Britain a preference, I thought the proposal a wise one, because, we owe so much to the old country. WithBut out the protection of her flag, under which the we are proud to live, the Japanese, the Germans, or some other people might take possession of our territory, which we find difficult to settle. I find, however, that in regard to the bulk of the goods which on we import wholly from Great Britain, no preference is given, and that the difference 2 and s per cent, between the British 1 and foreign rates in many cases is merely in the a nominal preference.",45
236,Mr GROOM,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Does the honourable member suggest that the preferences should be,45
237,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Yes ; in some cases. The Government should have taken as a basis the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and allowed Great Britain preferences of although we 5 and 10 per cent.",45
238,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"That would have shattered many of our industries, because it would have made the rates of duty lower than they were under the last Tariff.",45
239,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Grea t Britain receive a reasonable preference in recognition of the .fact that it is to her protection that we owe our liberty and freedom. We might well give a preference also to comCanada, South Africa, and New Zealand. I should like to see the principle of I m perial preference adopted, and based on lines, without any huckstering for reciprocal benefits. We shall get reciprocity sooner or later, because the world wants our goods; but if we erect prohibibarriers against importation, we may find barriers erected to keep our exports adopt prohiout of other countries.",45
240,Mr GROOM,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,We cannot give preferences unless we have protective duties.,45
241,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Undoubtedly ; but it is ridiculous to talk of duties of 45 inper cent, against the foreigner, and 40 the per cent, against British goods, when the particular goods are supplied by Great as giving a preference to manufacturers. Such duties give no advantage to British manufacthe turers, and unduly tax our consumers and The primary producers, who are the backbone I should like Ministers to know that the country is opposed to the imposition of excessive duties. I have albeen a protectionist, and think, as many others, including Mr Chamberlain, was do, that if England does not soon adopt protection, she will decay, instead of remaining progressive and prosperous. even under the late Tariff, although we - were prosperous, we did not progress. As I pointed out earlier in the evening; the population, since the inauguration of Federation has increased by 400,000 odd, but that is only a natural increase, and not an increase by immigration. Surely some progressive policy will be announced by the Government in order to remedy, the present stagnation. We all desire prosperity, but with prosperity there ought to be progress. The more people we have to divide the burden of taxation and share our prosperity, the better for the country.",45
242,Mr MCDOUGALL,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"If we had more people, where should we put them""?",46
243,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I think that a few years ago the honourable member was a working man himself; and if other ing men adopted the same industrious whfch methods as he has done, they would become land-owners also. There is any amount land available for industrious men; and any of the capital cities of Australia found persons willing tofinancemen who wish to become freeholders. I have had an experience of farming on a fairly large scale, and also of other industries, so that I am not speaking without knowdiscuss ledge.' I had fully expected that the vernment would! earlier have ' announced that if , in the opinion of honourable memabout bers, the Tariff placed before us was too high, they would be willing to adopt more to the worker. reasonable duties, approaching the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. Had such an announcement been made, this all right! debate would not have been so prolonged ; but I recognise that the discussion has done good, because it has given us time to consider the Tariff, to ascertain the malies, and to realise lhat the proposed increases of duty are too high. If , when we get to work on the details, we can arrive at what is fair effective protection, I have no doubt that many of the items may be passed in globo. I desire to say, however, - that I shall, oppose the prohibitive protectry. tive proposals of the Government. I do not desire to discuss the items now, but must say that we ought not to ruin the mining industry in Western Australia, instance, by imposing too high duties on mining machinery.",46
244,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Canno t mining machinery be made here ?,46
245,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I have heard it said that we can make any kind of chinery in Australia, but, in my opinion, able member. that is not so, though substitutes may be made here', in which there is not so much wear as in the imported article.",46
246,Mr MATHEWS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,We can make mining machineryin Australia just as well as it can be made anywhere in the world.,46
247,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,It is the honourable member's lack of experience that leads him to express that opinion.,46
248,Mr MATHEWS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,I am expressing the opinion of experienced men.,46
249,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I have had experience of various classes of machinery; and I have always endeavoured to obtain the local article in preference to the imported article, or the British article in preference to the foreign article. That has been my rule of trade always; and if I workcould get machinery made in Australia would do its work effectively, I would take it, even if it cost 20 per cent. more. of The honourable member may know all about in his own business, but I am afraid that he may be does not know much about mining machinery, electrical machinery, or portable engines. There are numerous classes of machinery the manufacture of which is not even attempted in Australia. If I were to the Tariff now, I .could point opt Gomany anomalies, as I hope to do when we reach the details.

In some instances it presses very heavily upon the poorer classes f of the community, whilst not providing for more employment by the extension of manufactures.",49
285,Mr WILKS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,It has as many anomalies as existed under the old Tariff.,49
286,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,I agreethat it has many anomalies. The duty on kerosene is an illustration. I fail to see that much more employment will be afforded by that duty.,49
287,Mr ATKINSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Is the honourable member opposed' to it ?,49
288,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I am, and always have been. The Labour Party in South Australia-whic h was always a protectionist one-agree d from its inception not to support a tax on tea, cocoa, kerosene, or any article which could not be grown or manufactured in that State.",49
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Is the honourable member aware that kerosene is produced in - Australia ?,49
290,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I am. I know also that it is said that the cost of producing and refining kerosene in America is less than i d . per. gallon. If that be so, we have here a magnificent field for the production of' kerosene at an enormous profit, even if four times the wages paid in the United States of America be received by those engaged in the industry here, and I fail to see why any protection should be necessary. Kerosene is used only by the producing class and the poorer sections of the community. Those in better circumstances may use gas, electric light, acetylene, and other illuminants, and I am not going to join with others in penalizing the poorer classes of the community. I do not represent producing interests, and therefore, unlike many other honourable members, I have not to "" trim'' on this question. I recognise, however, that our producers, for the most part, use kerosene, and in their interests as well, as in the interests of the poorer classes in the cities and towns, I shall oppose the impost. If the statements that I have heard with regard to the production of kerosene in Australia be trueif it be true that we can supply the world with it-the n there is a magnificent opening for the industry. The moment kero-sene can be produced, here at a fair price, and it is shown that a combine is underselling the local men, I shall be prepared to assist in crushing that combine. should hot like to adopt the outrageous abortion that has been put forward in the name of a Tariff by so-called free-traders. I have no hesitation in saying that the Tariff recommended by the free-trade section of the Commission would raise as much, if not more, revenue than will the Tariff submitted by the Government: It has been referred to by the Opposition as a free trade Tariff; it is really a revenue one, and; therefore, most objectionable to both free-traders and protectionists. recommended because direct taxation is coming nearer and nearer. T,he number of honourable members im favour of such taxation is steadily increasing, and what is still more important, we are approaching a time when we shall have to raise more revenue. In these circumstances the free-trade section of the Commission recommended a revenue Tariff to stave off direct taxation.",49
291,Mr ATKINSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,The Acting Prime Minister favours direct taxation.,50
292,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I am delighted to hear it, and feel confident that if the sent members of the Opposition before long are not advocating it, others will be taking their places. The proposals of the free-trade section of the Commission are designed to raise revenue without protecting Australian industries. With such a Tariff I shall have nothing to do. The honourable member for Grampians said that we ought to build up a Tariff by degrees, and, as the Attorney-General very properly interjected, if that be so, we ought to add one more brick to the Tariff wall. I hope, however, that we shall pass a Tariff that - will stand for at least twenty years, so that our manufacturers and business people will know exactly where' they are.",50
293,Mr MATHEWS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,To give them stability.,50
294,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"We must have stability. If we were to have such a Tariff as the honourable member, for Grampians appeared to foreshadow it wouia be so low that there would be a constant agitation for more protection.",50
295,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Australi a is a protectionist country, and the fiscal fight must continue until we get effective protection.",50
296,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Exactly . I wish the people to realise what a protective Tariff can accomplish. It will be time enough for us to lower the duties, if they are dissatisfied, after they have seen the result of its working. I",50
297,Mr ATKINSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Jus t now the honourable member wanted tofixthe Tariff for twenty years.,50
298,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"The honourable member must not put words into my mouth. I said that if the Tariff would endure for twenty years, so much the better.",50
299,Mr ATKINSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Will not the honourable member accept the verdict of members of this Committee, a majority of whom are It was protectionists ?",50
300,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Not necessarily. I will accept the verdict of the Committee if the Tariff is framed to my liking, but not otherwise.",50
301,Mr ATKINSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,I will accept it if the duties imposed are reasonable.,50
302,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"That is precisely my position, I desire this evening to say a few-words upon the Defence Department - a Department which has not been touched upon to any extent by honourable members during the course of this debate. But beprefore dealing with that matter, I wish to make some observations upon the principle which was embodied in the Excise Tariff Act of last year. I refer to what is known as the new protection. I maintain that we should know how this principle is working, what effect it has upon our employers and employees, and how the Government have administered the Act. As honourable members are aware, it was .understood that an increased duty upon agricultural machinery was to be levied conditionally upon our local manufacturers paying their employees fair wages. In order to decide what constituted fair wages, provisions were inserted in the Tariff Act of 1906, which readProvided that this Act shall not apply to goods manufactured by any person in any part of the Commonwealth under .conditions as to the remuneration of labour which(a) are .declared by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament to be fair and reasonable; or (4) are in accordance with an industrial award under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1904; or (e) are in accordance with the terms of an industrial agreement filed under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1904. The Act should have been made to embrace the conditions, as well as the remuneration, of labour. It doe's not leave room for dealing with the question of apprentices, with the hours of labour, or with the. employment of women. When it was put into operation some employers in South Australia at once applied to Mr Justice O'Connor, the President of the Arbitration Court, for exemption from the payment of Excise'. In New South Wales, where the first exr emption was granted, the employees in the industry had no knowledge that such an application was being made. After having looked into the regulations, Mr Justice O'Connor forwarded to South Australia ah intimation requiring employers to post in their workshops, for seven days prior to their applications being made to. the Court, a notice of their intention to apply for exemption from the payment of Excise. He also directed that any employ6 who was .dissatisfied with the wages which he was receiving should be at liberty to complain to his employers, and to lodge a complaint with the Court. Messrs. Bagshaw and Sons were amongst the first employers in Sc-uth Australia to apply for exemption. Had an employee ventured to complain that he was receiving insufficient wages, I do not hesitate to say, not only that he would have been dismissed, but that he might have found it difficult to obtain employment at his occupation in the State, or even in the Commonwealth, because he would have been black-listed. When Mr Justice O'Connor's order was received, I at once communicated with the Minister of Trade and Customs, pointing out the injustice of the latter portion of it, and asking that where there was an association of employees that association should be permitted to appear before the' Court and to act for the whole of the'employees in the trade. "" Mr FAIRBAIRN - What evidence has honourable member of that? Mr Hutchison. Excise Mr HUTCHISON - I will give the honourable member sufficient data before I have concluded. The Minister of Trade and Customs forwarded my letter to the. President of the Arbitration Court. Mr. Justice O'Connor at once altered the regulations. He declared that while he would not allow the association as such to represent the employees in Court; he would permit it to engage counsel, and he would allow any employee"" to give evidence before the Court. That was a fair arrangement, with which the employees were thoroughly satisfied. What happened? About eighty-two firms applied for exemption from the payment of Excise.",50
303,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,In South Australia 105 firms have applied for exemption ,51
304,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"But in the first place eighty-two firms applied for exemption. They had to satisfy' Mr Justice O'Connor that they were paying their employees fair wages. The first firm, to take action was that ofMessrs. Bagshaw and Sons, who called their men together and told them that if they insisted upon obtaining an increase in their wages, the firm would be obliged to close down, because they had not made a penny profit during the year. A subsequent examination of their balance-sheet disclosed that they had made a profit of Â£4,-975 upon a capital' of Â£25,000, or about 20 per cent., notwithstanding that the head of the firm and one nephew were - receiving Â£ 5 ios. a week each, and another nepliew Â£ 4 ios. a week. - Mr BATCHELOR - That fact was elicited in the Court.",51
305,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Exactly' . When this firm came before the Court, what happened ? They put forward a fine big German, of thirty-eight years of age, who, working as a labourer, declared that he was receiving 6s. . 6d'. per day. That. I contend, was a miserable wage for him 'to be paid. I am glad to say that in South Australia we pay .our builders' labourers 8s. a day. But the - representatives of the union knew precisely .what the man had been getting, and when their counsel questioned the witness in regard to the matter he had to admit that he had only just received an increase from 5s. iod. per dav. Mr Justice O'Connor thereupon saidHe attached no importance to the evidence of this witness. Every man was not calle'd upon to be a hero. the The President of the Arbitration Court could see that this witness had to come-forward and give whatever evidence his emI ployers asked him to tender. At that mo wage had been fixed lor the different branches of the trade. Accordingly the ing. - employees met and drew up a scale of wages, which they submitted to their emthat ployers. When the latter went before the Arbitration Court there was no agreement ""between them and their employees as to the wages which should be paid, and, accordto ingly, Mr Justice O'Connor suggested the parties should confer .did so. When the association of employees was formed the employers not only perone mitted Senator Trenwith to address them ^during working hours, but they declared that they were willing to help the associaand tion. When the conference between the parties was held, the employers gave a guarantee that no workman would be nalized for any part that he might take in .that gathering, or for any action that might take before the Court. What lowed? The parties' arrived at a satisfacsorry tory agreement as to the wages that should - be paid. Upon 4th June last Mr Justice agreement. O'Connor declared that he was perfectly - satisfied with the arrangement, and accordingly he made the agreement arrived at doing so. the' award of the Court in eighty-one cases. The Court ordered that, provided these employers were paying the rate of wages specified in the industrial agreement, they smiths. .should be exempt from the payment of Excise j but that if the agreement were parted from they should, pay the Excise. Honourable members heard the Minister Trade and Cusoms tell me yesterday that,' so far, no Excise had been collected South Australia. I want to know the son why it has not been collected. This most important experiment. It is one sults of which honourable members should so since. be fully acquainted with before they called upon to deal with a single item Tariff, because a similar .principle to be applied to every branch of industry. Strong protectionist though I am, I that unless the workers are to obtain - share of the protection which it is proposed to extend to the manufacturers, I favour allowing the workers and the consumers to purchase their goods as cheaply as possible. It has often been said that there is always poverty in countries. That fact, I contend, is not the fault of protection, but rather of the of protection. It has been too long a free-trade in flesh and blood with the facturers and of protection for themselves. f we are going to protect the manufacturer time we must protect the workman.",51
306,Mr WILKS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,It is rather a late awaken,52
307,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,We have to see we have a Minister in office who will administer the Act.,52

309,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I am satisfied that of two things Has happened. Either, the temporary occupant of the office, during the absence of the ex-Minister of Trade ' Customs in England, knew nothing whatever about the provisions of the Act, or he has failed to administer it. I do not pecare which is the correct position. The matter is so important - that I shall tell the he Committee exactly what has happened. I folhave a list of the names here, but I am that it is not complete. ' I know' that some firms are loyally carrying out the.",52
310,Mr BATCHELOR,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Many of them are,52
311,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Yes. Messrs. Shearer, of Kilkenny and Mannum, were paying only 7s. a day for skilled blackThey are friends of mine, and when I asked if they thought that .a fair dewage to pay to competent artisans, they replied "" No,"" but that other firms, were of paying less. I knew., too, that they were doing all that they could to teach boys their in trade, which other firms were not doing. reaThey said to me, "" If we were put on the is a same footing as other firms, we should pay the rehigher wages,"" and they have loyally done Messrs.

But can the a fair .Government give anv reason why those employers who have not obeyed the award shall of the Court have not been punished ?",52
312,Mr WH IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Has it been definitely ascertained that some employers have protectionist not obeyed the award?,52
313,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Yes. I shail want prove that by reading a letter which was case of sent in the first place to Mr Justice manuO'Connor, who returned it saying that he could deal with the matters referred to in .it only on application being made to him in the Arbitration Court. A copy of the letter was forwarded to the Customs Dewere partment, and another copy given to me. him It was written by the secretary, under inor structions from his association, and is followsTo His Honor Mr Justice O'Connor, President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Sir, We regret to have to report that various firms in this State are not carrying out the wages agreement which you declared "" fair and reasonable "" under the Excise Tariff Act. firms we have to complain about are among the 82 to whom you granted exemptions conditional 011 observing the agreement. The employers appointed four of their number (Messrs. J. A. Bagshaw, A. May, - Forgan, and - Mickan) in addition to all their counsel, to agree upon wages, with three representatives of the workmen and our counsel, Paris Nesbit, KC. . . . As you are aware, the agreement was mutual, there was no majority vote or casting vote. Messrs. J. S. Bagshaw and Sons classified their workmen and then called them into the office one at a time to sign an agreement they had drawn up; they had the option given them of accepting or of leaving. . Nearly all the tradesmen were classed as "" Slow, under average capacity."" I am sorry that no tribunal was provided to determine what men should be regarded as "" slow,"" as "" under average capacity,"" and as ""not used to the trade.""",52
314,Mr WH IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,That appears to be the weak spot of the award.,53
315,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Yes .,53
316,Mr BATCHELOR,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,The words used are contained in the agreement.,53
317,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Yes . They were introduced by the employees. It was found difficult to provide for the incapacitated, the old and the slow. There has been no arrangement between employers and employees to decide the matter.' What was done, in one case, will be seen from the letter which I have been reading. writer continuesVery few indeed were given the ""average capacity "" wage. Every labourer without exception was classed as ""not used to the trade 6s. 6d."", although many of them are excellent men, who have been in their employ for many years. Only a few men declined to sign, and these had to go. We think you will be able to understand the position of a workman alone in the office with an employer having to decide immediately whether he will accept an unjust classification, or whether he will chance securing work elsewhere. Most of the men have wives and families dependent upon them. Messrs. J. S. Bagshaw and Sons Limited, dismissed one man (a sheet iron worker) because they thought he gave our Secretary information about the skill required for his work when we fixing wages. This man did not give the particulars about the work he did, they charged with doing so, and would not take his word refer the matter to our Secretary, but disas missed him. They did this the morning after the evening the wage was settled, the line ""Sheet-iron workers"" was called on by the emAdelaide, July 10, 1907. ployers before tea, but as J. A. Bagshaw wanted the rate fixed very low and made out that no skill was required our Secretary asked for the item to be left out until after tea, and during the interval he procured full particulars from a recent departmental foreman, who had started in business for himself the week previously. ' Messrs. J. S. Bagshaw and Sons Limited also The dismissed the shop steward of the union (the man who collects members' contributions) at the end of the same week, without notice, and declined to give him a reference,, although he had been in their employ twenty-five years, and his recent foreman and his fellow workers testify that he is a good tradesman. He is a most inoffensive man, and would not say an ill word against the firm. He is a man of great forbearance, and did not wish us to say anything about his treatment; he said God would punish them. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Unfortunately , God cannot get at 'them until they die.",53
318,Mr WILKS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,The manufacturers do not seem to be more considerate than the importers.,53
319,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"As for the importers, if the honourable member will come to Adelaide, I can point out firms who, night after night, and month after month, bring back their employees, giving them a shilling for tea money, but no overtime, and, in some cases, even saving 2d. on the tea money by giving them tickets on the production of which they can get tea at certain restaurants. The guarantee was given in writing that no man should be penalized for his connection with the union, or for any action which he might take in regard to this new protection. I may say that Mr Bagshaw is one to parade his religion before the public. The writer proceedsThe At a meeting of our Association held on June rgth (a - fortnight after the Conference settlement) two employees of the same firm reported that they were not being paid according to the agreement, and that others were not. The Chairman had called for a report from each shop. Another employee of Messrs. Bagshaw and Sons who was present told the firm the next day of what transpired, and both these men who had spoken were dismissed that day. On Friday last, July 5, another employ^ (of the same firm) who had lately become Treasurer of our Association was dismissed. No one can understand why he was put off unless it was on account of his connection with the union. Probably it was because I had been sending notices to him by post of our meetings, and the firm recognised my writing on the envelopes, and p'erhaps because he was our Treasurer.,. This man is a very quiet reserved man, he thinks he was put oft on account of the letters being addressed to him, the man who was foreman over him until he started for himself a month ago speaks highly of ' him and says he works hard all - day, ' and will' not speak, unless spokento, and he thought he would be appointed foreman of his department when he left. The shop-steward who was dismissed was also entitled to the fo'remanship of his department-in the opinion of the other foremen and workmen. When a man applies for a position now this firm requires him to answer a number of questions and they record the answers. Some of the questions are as follows:-""Unionis t or' : Non-unionist."" '.' Where worked last."" "" Why released."" "" Have you any references,'"" and . "" How many"" and ""Who from."" ""Have you anv relations in other factories"" (Is this to identify unionists and keep a'black list?). ""Where served time"" (this from a firm who try to make out 'that they do not require ' sklllecT men) ""Where educated"" ""Nationality"" ""Occupation "" '""Age,"" "" Married or Single."" This firm, which has reduced the wages' of its employees on'the-ground that they are slow, and under average capacity, has issued a circular to. the public in which it. is stated that it employs none but the most' competent workmen.",53
320,Mr BATCHELOR,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"--What proportion ^ .of those in its factory are classed as slow-and uhder average capacity ? ' !. Mr HUTCHISON - I . do not know; but all its labourers are said to be so. classed.

' ' l>3] Mr AUSTIN. CHAPMAN - It has had' a very:good effect. Mr - HUTCHISON - It has had a good effect; but for how long ? It has in1 creased the wages of those in the pay of the best employers, but as now administered it may have the effect of running some of them out of the business, leaving the industry in the hands of the unscrupulous employers who, apparently, can defy the law with impunity.' I have been able to get a great deal of information on this subject, and I wish to know why the Government has not been able to get it. ' Mr Wilks - Perhaps Ministers did not wish to get it. - Mr HUTCHISON - Are Ministers going to allow manufacturers to defy the law, or is the Act defective? If - so, Parliament should have been ""informed. The Government is ' without.. excuse.

If you obtained particulars of the number of. men employed and. the wages paid . to each (yvhich I think you asked for during the hearing the case of Messrs.

After negp- tiating-with QUI-'association about.the first conference,' they' suddenly ceased negotiations, and r fferene'e, .posting up'notices in their factories, inrjl mating '. that the men..'in each factory should, delegates. At .the .openingof that, con, - -'-"" ferehce'they-objected to six of the. ten. delegates' our association had elected, and that our seven country branches had approved of, and declined to go on while they remained, so we had to withdraw them, except one. At a well attended meeting of the Manufacturers' Protectionist sociation, called: specially to consider a request which was made by the Australian Agricultural Implement and Iron workers' Employees' Defence Association, after discussion, it was mously resolved1. That the members present have no objecchairman tion to the establishment of wages boards, providing that adequate Tariff protection is secured, and that care is taken to prevent the mistakes which have been made in the other States. 2. That the members of this association sent, recognising the good work being done in the cause of protection Australian Agricultural. Implement and will Iron workers' Employees' Defence AsA sociation, will be willing to give ference to. members of that association as regatds employment if in our opinion, they are equally competent. Instead of giving' preference, of employment now, Messrs. J. S. Bagshaw and Sons are giving agreed preference of dismissal, and Messrs. May Bros. and Co. Ltd. have also done likewise to a lesser though' under extent. Our association cannot now get any one to - leave act as shop-steward at Messrs. Bagshaw and oasf ""strikers Sons. They cannot get. any one now who dare attend a meeting; and it is the most out1 rageous intimidation I have ever seen in South AustraliaAt our meeting last Wednesday not' one their employees was present, and we financial members there until recently. members employed there sent apologies to last meeting on account of other engagements. There is no doubt the employees of this firm badly intimidated. Besides our objection to curtailment of the liberty of the men through fear of dismissal after so many have been dismissed, we think these men should help to pay our heavy legal-expenses, and we have means, of collecting their contribution. As men .would benefit as the result of the wages agreement, it is only fair they should help pay the cost of obtaining it. The employees were advised to form a union, and to apply to the Court; and now, in order to stop the existence of the union, the men are so intimidated that they cannot collect money to defray the legal expensesThe other chief case we wish to bring under your noticeis that of Messrs. May Bros, and Co., of Gawler. Messrs. May Bros, and Co. do other work sides making goods subject to Excise. We believe they paid the men right through the shop the rates under the heading at which they classicannot be permitted. fied them, so they were fair in that respect, though we claim the classifications are in majority of cases unfair, they are mining general engineers as well as makers of excisin able goods. When they started again after shutMr Hutchison. ting down for a few days they did not re-engage the secretary of our Gawler branch, nor the shop-steward, nor treasurer, nor delegate to our first conference. The latter happened to be Aschairman of the meeting (on. the Monday prior to the re-hearing of the cases for exemption) at Gawler, when we formed the present branch. At the first conference his. employer objected unanito him taking part, as he was not at that time engaged upon making excisable goods, but the overruled the objection in his case. The shop-steward not taken in was only engaged on excisable goods during the last few days of his employment. The Gawler. members are of the opinion that : these men were: not re-engaged on account of pretheir connection with the union. One Adelaide firm wants their strikers under by the 21 years to sign an agreement that they accept apprentices' rates of wages. condition of the agreement! is that' their term preof employment may be terminated any day. It is therefore evident there is no desire or obligation to teach such youths a trade extendi ing over a term of' five years. Striking is not a. trade, it is labourer's work, and the wages upon at conference is 7s.' 6d: per day, thosethe sameas for labourers used to the trade, who think themselves worth 7s. 6d. al21 may. demand that rate and: if they do not rÂ»et it, the great majority under 21 will becontent to be classed youth labourers."" We would like your, decision on the above matters. We hope that you will, give instructions that copies of the wages agreement must be posted up in each factory. There are a. large number of of shops in the country which are probably had over 80. ignorant of the rates. Two That is the statement by the Secretary of our the Employes Association. If the return are I. asked for long, ago had. been supplied 1 the and it was; a return which, for simplicity's sake, was confined to South Australia-w e should have known whether the firms are no carrying, out the agreement. Iknow mythe self thatsome, firms are not carrying out the agreement. For instance, - Schrapel is. to working his employees fifty-six hours a week, though the wages have never been increased ; and when the men asked for the agreement to be carried out they were told that if they did not "" like it they could lump it . """,54
322,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Has that manufacturer applied.for exemption?,55
323,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Yes , and he got', it on condition that the Minister carried out his part of the bargain.

Brebner and Keefe are notcarrythe ing out the agreement; and-I'should like and to know what the Minister proposes to do the matter. This legislation was a. new experiment; and we were justified in expecting the Government to see that it fair and proper trial, and that honourable members were informed as to the result. That has not been done; and the responsiSouth bility, therefore, is not with the House .but - with the Ministry ",55

325,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I admit that when we come to deal with, the whole Tariff will not be possible to treat all manufacsome turers as the manufacturers of agricultural implements have been treated. There is doubt, however, that some method to insure fair wages and conditions of labour must be adopted. The fixing of prices bristles with difficulty.",56
326,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Will the honourable member Vote for high duties unless the manufacturers workers get a share?,56
327,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Not if I can help - it. As honourable members know, the sibly Labour Party have been considering - scheme, the details of which have not yet been worked out, but which was outlined by the honourable member for South Sydney in his speech the other night. Under that tion. scheme, we think that it will be possible to affix a Commonwealth trade mark and duty that stamp, just as easily as other revenue I have. stamps are affixed -; and .if Minister who will carry out the policy I do another industry which shows not anticipate any .difficulty. No doubt .the scheme has one great weakness. Manufor facturers are not required to take any notice the Tariff, to of the law, unless there is some one to see protection - that it is carried out; and' i does not'undertake that duty, we shall penalize every fair employer without doing am the employ6s any good.

329,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I believe we are coming to Socialism in regard to some inwealth dustries ; in any case, we must .make the provision that is .necessary all concerned.

I have had under me several apprentices who are now doing wellsome in South Australia, and one in y Africa; but I am sure they would not have done nearly as well if they, had - been employed by any of the manufacturers of agricultural implements to whom I have referred. We must deal with wages and the apprentice question; because there it must be skilled workmen, or there will be ground for the statement of the honourable member for Grampians that we canno not 'turn out machinery as well as it can be turned out in other countries. Personally, I was bound an apprentice for seven years, and all who enter the printing trade have to serve at least six years; and that is good for both the trade and the boys. We have also to lay down conditions for who employ girls. Under all the circumstances, there must be some kind of tribunal, because - we cannot posleave the Minister to see that the Act a is properly carried out.",56

If we to speedily exercise those powers and take over unproductive services, such quarantine and light-houses, if we are to provide for the payment of old-age pentralia. sions we shall require a largely revenue. So f a i , very little emphasis has been laid upon the fact that in taking over is the trouble. these Departments from the States we shall relieve them of a great deal of financial responsibility. That is a factor, I submit, which ought .to be taken into consideration when we come to re-arrange our .financial system owing to the discontinuance of - Braddon section of .the Constitution. have heard a great many complaints by honourable members about the financial position with which we shall be faced near future. But, with the exception of the 'honourable member for Flinders, the only suggestions made as .to how. additiona'l revenue might be secured, have emanated from members of the Labour Party. The - fied honourable member for Flinders told us that, even if we do not incur 'a single obligation, we shall be faced in three or four years with a deficiency of a million. He suggested a remedy-the good .old borrowing remedy, which has been - the curse Of the States. MrJ W. H . IRVINE - Did I suggest if that ? - Mr HUTCHISON - Yes . I underyears stood the honourable member to say that we could borrow.",59
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,The.firs t .to suggest borrowing .was the Acting Prime Minister.,59
351,Mr WH IRVINE,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"What I said was that a certain .portion of the expenditure done? upon new works and additions might properly be attributed to a capital account and could .be. paid for by means of short loans, with sinking funds.",59
352,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I .disagree with the honourable member's proposal. are many sources of revenue open to us without crushing the poor or 'imorder poverishing the rich. There was a .time in the history of the States when it was solutely necessary .to borrow money for purpose of building railways and developprentices, ing our country. But that day has gone by- I hope for ever. Surely we have now reached the stage when we can live within our income. Need I point out that in this country absentees have millions of pounds of worth of property which we have to proEvery pound that is expended upon are public works enhances the value of that are property, and yet its owners contribute are nothing to the revenue through the Custo toms.

358,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"So that I should There not misrepresent the honourable member, I took the trouble to turn up Hansard, in that I might quote - his exact words. I like to speak of a subject of which""I abhave most knowledge. Take my own trade the as an example. I have had to take .apto pay them, and. to teach-them. their trade. In the initial stages of their apprenticeship, they were worth almost nothing to me, but before, their term had expired they were able to do a man's In the same way I believe that those who were doing boys' work in our Public Service when they entered it six years ago, are performing men's work today. I do - not believe for a moment that we are paying Â£250,000 extra annually to men for doing boys' work. The statement is absurd upon the face of it. I was a member of the Commission which was appointed in South Australia to investigate the working of the Civil Service of that State. We appointed a Board' to classify the whole service, and its classification was accepted' by the Public Service Commissioner of the Commonwealth as a guide to him. a conversation with the Commissioner some time ago in regard to the non-payment of increments to South Australian officers who had been transferred to the Commonwealth, and whose existing and accruing rights were preserved to them under the Constitution. The Commissioner informed me that the reason why those increments had not been paid was that, if they had been met, when the present occupants of various offices either'died or resigned from the service, he would be called upon - to pay their successors more than the work which they performed was worth. That' is sufficient' evidence that the Commissioner has taken good care that he is not paying too much for the services which are rendered. can tell honourable members of a number of cases of absolute sweating throughout the service. All that the Commissioner has done has been to sweat some members of the service, and to give big salaries to others. I amsimply astounded' at his power. (",59
359,Mr WILKS,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Wit h what would the honourable member replace it ? ' Mr HUTCHISON - No doubt the interjection of the honourable member is prompted by the experience of New South Wales.

366,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"No . If he were an archangel he could not satisfy every one. He has to depend upon the information which is supplied to him by his inspectors. I deprecate a great deal of what has been, done by the Public Service Inspector in South Australia. The position"" is that we appoint a Deputy Postmaster-General in the various States, because he is supposed to know how to conduct the post-office. That officer may say, "" I want a message boy at such-and-, such a place. The work cannot go on unless I get him."" Or he may say, "" I want a letter-sorter at such a place, and the work cannot go on unless I get him."" But the .Public Service Commissioner is able to say, "" Oh, but you cannot .have him."" He possesses the most autocratic power that exists outside of Russia. honourable member, for. Dalley has asked me if I can cite any cases qf injustice. I propose to give one. As honourable members are aware, applicants for posiasked tions in trie Telephone Department are quired to pass an examination. Three y.ears ago nine candidates passed that amination, . and during the interval which has .'since elapsed three of them have obtained casual employment. One of these candidates"" was an exceedingly smart girl, according to the testimony of the head of, the Department) and with the other two rib fault could be found. The .business the. Telephone Department in South Ausnames tralia has been, extending so rapidly some officers in the"" exchange have been so Minister should have the right to say how qverworked that they, have actually fainted whilst upon duty.. Others have been sent away ""upon leave on account .of illness.' Yet, ivhen an application was riiade.to. the Public Service 'Inspector for additional, girls in"" the Telephone Exchange,' the neon, cessary ' assistance was refused. ' Thisis. an .extract from the Adelaide Register, the 23rd May' last: The recent examinations for. telephone attenda - Aits ahd .""telegraph messengers : South Australian correspondent of The Transmitter) caused a lot of dissatisfaction, due.""prinwrong cipally to .the fact that candidates were expected to know more than' - the notification of - the subjects implied, especially as regards the m e t i c It was stated that'the. questions would be .in the first four rules, and yet the candidates were required to have a knowledge of proporan tion, fractions, and algebra, to successfully answer the questions. The-irony of the whole matter is that in our State two young ladies who were' successful in a former examination, have been engaged as temporary attendants for some considerable time during the past three years, but were unable to secure permanent ployment owing to the lack of vacancies, had to again submit themselves for examination,"" were found ' among those who failed to pass-^the questions in arithmetic ""being somuch stiffer on this occasion, than formerly, and yetthese ""two unfortunates"" have proved themselves expert telephone attendants. We fail to see a- - telephone attendant, who in the ordinary course of"" duty would not be called upon' perform anything more arduous than-from'.a arithmetical point of view-ad d up a few . columns of figures, should be expected to examination' practical!v ""as regards this subject upon all fours with a University junior examinaunproductive, tion. Surely it. is enough to .submit to one ination girls who wish to become telephone operators. What is the-use of examining such girls in a-subject like algebra? On Mr Hutchison. being appointed, the girls naturally forget all. that . they learned to ' qualify to pass the entrance examination, and. The three years later are not in a position to go up for examination again: In Scotland, on one occasion, when an applicant for the position of exciseman was the distance of the sun from the reearth, he said that he did not know, but. that he thought it was far enough away not exto interfere with the discharge of his duties. A very proper reply to an unnecessary question. I regard many of the questions which are now asked as unnecessary,, and I hope that some of the examinations will be abolished. The Public Service Commissioner should have power to arrange the of examinations, to fix rules, and to say what on a list .should be accepted; but that the Deputy Postmaster-General or the : many employees should be appointed, .and have the power to dismiss them if unsatisfactory.. At the present time no inquiry is - made as,to the character pf the boys taken, or as. to their parentage, which is a veryimportant thingin connection, with the Pubof lic Service. Consequently there are boys, -. ' . of very bad character in the Service. On. one occasion I brought before, the Minister, case in which a manhad been caught red-, have (writes the handed in . theft. Something had gone, at every place to which he'was appointed, but, instead of being punished, he, set was promoted, and. when I brought the case, arithforward, an attempt, was made to put the' b'lame' on. a dead brother, who had borne, excellent character., Coming to another matter, I think that a great-blunder has beencommitted, in. handing, back - to the States and dyer. Â£5)000,006 of surplus revenue .with-, out crediting it against the transferred properties. We are now coming to the end of emour financial tether, and,-later on, probably and it will be proposed, that we should-borrow ' - .money-to. buy. back for .the people buildings which now belong to'thern.,' surely the'veryheight of absurdity. Every, penny returned why tp the States over and 'above their three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, to should have been credited to transferred n properties. "" I wish now to deal with a pass an Department. which honourable, members do not seem too ready - to criticise, one that 'isbut most"" expensiye, ""the Department of Defence. On page 73 of theexamEstimates, Â£941,916 is provided for defence expenditure, of which-Â£594,629'will gb tb-the Military branch: This, accordingto the Minister, is - what we"" are paying to train less than 1 per cent, of Australia's manhood, and to provide an indifferently equipped force of .something like 23,000 men. Is it not a state of affairs which should be tackled by Parliament ? The sooner the better. Honourable, members who take the trouble to read Colonel Reay's admirable pamphlet will get some valuable information about the Swiss system. The Swiss army costs Â£1,500,000 per annum, and Switzerland could, within a few hours, put into the field a well-equipped fighting force of .232,000 men, while-, she has also an armed reserve of 44,000, and a second unarmed reserve of 262,000, although her population is smaller than that of the Commonwealth. We have a richer country than Switzerland to defend, and the fact that we are the only people who own an entire continent should make us alive to the need for providing effectively for defence, seeing that we have a coast line of 8,000 miles to guard. Defence should be a burden of which every citizen should be prepared to carry his share. The frank statement of the Minister that, although we have been federated for nearly seven years, we have not yet a scheme of military organization capable of development, was most remarkable and disquieting. Until something is done to obtain such a scheme, so that we may get value for our money, it might be wise to consider the advisability of curtailing our defence expenditure. The Minister has told us that to train 100,000 men in accordance with our present methods would cost no less than .Â£2,000,000, an expenditure which is out of the question so far as Australia is concerned. Before the Pudget debate is concluded honourable members should pay the closest attention to this subtary ject, and should do all in their power (o assist the Minister to overcome the difficulwho ties which confront us. I do not blame him .for not having done all that he wishes. In my opinion, no Minister has yet been able to properly control the Military Department'. There is a power in that Department which should be broken up or curbed - ' It is monstrous that we get so little for our expenditure on defence. The Swiss system has been held up as a model for us to follow, and we might very well adopt some of its feature's; but it must be remembered that Switzerland is hedged round by armed powers, and that her people are military enthusiasts. The nation sprang into being by force of arms something like 600 years ago, and its [J 04] surroundings have made it necessary to be prepared for hostilities at any moment. Happily, our situation is different. It would be difficult to arouse in Australia military enthusiasm such asexists in Switzerland, and I do not know that it is necessary. But we must provide efficiently for our defence. A splendid thing about the Swiss system is that no man can be an officer in the army who has not passed througli the ranks. When I first came into this Parliament the then Minister of Defence-h e is now Minister of Trade and Customspromised, in answer to a complaint which I had made, that it should be possible for rankers to receive commissions. But 1 find that, not long since, the son of a State Commandant, who, so far as I know, has not done an hour's drill, has been given a commission, while young enthusiasts who had given years of study to military work have been passed over. I myself have always been a military enthusiast. In the old country thirty years ago I belonged to the volunteer force, and twentythree years ago was a rion-commissioned officer in the old SouthAustralian volunteer force. Later on I helped to raise, and became a member of, a Scotch corps in Adelaide. When'one of its officers had to retire because he had reached the age limit, and another left, I was urged by the Commanding Officer and the men to apply for a commission, but I declined to do so, because the uniform of a Scottish officer costs more than I could well afford. But, on being urged, I agreed to make the necessary application. I may say that, when the corps was raised, I , as a.member of the Parliament of South Australia, was in a sufficiently good position to satisfy the milicaste as to my qualifications for a commission. Together with Sir Josiah Symon, was not a member of Parliament at the time, I was asked to attend and address a meeting convened to advocate the* establishment of the corps. I attended the meeting, and joined the corps myself. When the number of members of the State Parliament was reduced I was out of politics for eighteen months, and employed myself during that time in conducting a: Labour newspaper. Will it be believed that when I was thus engaged, an officer came to me and said, "" Hutchison, if you want to get your commission you had better use your influence-"" ? I replied that I had never used influence in my life, and would not allow him to sav a word on my behalf, because I wanted to see what the Defence Department would do. I acted as officer for ten months, and when I applied for a commission I did not receive a reply. When, however, I was returned to the Federal Parliament I found the Staff tumbling over each other with apologies and explanations why I did not get my commission. Are we to allow that sort of thing to go on?",60
367,Mr MAUGER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,What rank would the honourable member have' held ?,63
368,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I should have been a lieutenant. I found, however, that 1 would have to take command of a company, and, as I felt that my parliamentary duties here would not permit of my doing justice to myself or the force, f preferred to sever my connection with the latter. There were several similar cases; and Major-General Hutton was in command at the time. One of the finest young fellows I have known, of the highest character and great ability, who had gone through all the ranks up to that of a colour-sergeant, and was a valued public servant, was urged by his commanding officer to apply for a commission. However, he was disinclined to do so, because, as he said, he knew that it meant expenditure which he could not afford. It was pointed out to him that his refusal would mean a great loss to the Company; but, simply because he was an employ! in a modest position, he did not satisfy the demands of the military caste, and therefore did not get his commission - This young, man did not come to me in connection with the matter, but a friend of his did, and I was asked whether, as a member of Parliament, I would permit this sort of treatment to be meted out to members of the Defence Force. I pointed out that if I interfered it might mean that the young man would suffer for it afterwards. 1 discovered that there \yere three young men in a similar position; . and when I put a question on the notice-paper asking for information, an attempt was made by the Head-quarters Staff to find out to which individual I was referring. A remarkable thing happened. The application was sent in during January or February, I believe, but it_ was not sent on to the staff office until three days afterwards, which brought it into the next month, thus enabling-the"" applicant to be discovered, and possibly marked. That is the sort of administration which must be put an end to; and only a strong Minister 'of Defence can supply the remedy. Whether a man be a ""cook's son "" or a "" duke's son,"" to use the words of Kipling, if he be fitted for the position and his character is' good, he ought to receive the appointment. Indeed, as I say, we ought to go further, and, copying the Swiss system, refuse to give a man a commission until he has passed through the ranks. Another point on which we might copy the Swiss system is this-that if an officer contracts debts which he cannot pay, he ought at once to be relieved of his command. I have had some experience in connection with officers and bad debts, and I am glad to say that the Minister of Defence did all in his power in particular cases to see that justice was done. These facts all go to show how rotten is this institution, which is costing us about Â£1,000,000 per annum. I quite appreciate the difficulties of a layman in administering a Department like that of Defence;.but if those officers who are there for the purpose of assisting the Minister are not able to devise a proper scheme, it is time that the amounts voted for their salaries were struck off the Estimates, and the services obtained of others who are qualified for their positions. For twentythree years I have been of the opinion that we. should have a compulsory military force. What we first have to do is to determine how much"" money we are prepared to spend on the Defence Department. Having decided howto apportion the money between the army, the navy, and so forth, we are faced with the important question of how to obtain the largest number of trained men, and the most efficient equipment, for the sum at our disposal. I - do not think that we ought to spend more than Â£1,000,000 per annum for a considerable time to come. It is the duty of every citizen to share in the defence of the country, and, that being so, service ought to be compulsory; but here I depart from the Swiss model. Although the Swiss system is all that is to be desired, I do not think it is suited to our conditions, and, therefore, ,we 'ought to devise some more convenient system. I now give merely an outline of suggestions, because I do not pretend , to be a military expert; the Minister has in the service officers who will be able to say whether what I propose is or is not practicable. If the service be compulsory there will be no necessity to spend a single pound on uniforms. At the present time recruits in some instances are made trained soldiers before they are served with uniforms, but under our system it is thought necessary to have uniforms, the supposition being that it is the uniforms which attract the young men. If , however, the service were compulsory, with no need to hold out attractions, the men could go through the period of training in their ordinary clothes.",63
369,Mr SAMPSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Some encouragementmake men of our boys. must be given to the recruits.,64
370,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"The money go usually spent on uniforms might be utilized to afford encouragement in the form of ammunition and shooting prizes, good shooting being one of the first essentials a soldier.",64
371,Mr SAMPSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,There must be some distinguishing badge.,64
372,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"There is no disshoot, tinguishing badge now for recruits. Years ago thousands of school children were regiments. trained in South Australia, and uniforms were not found to be necessary.",64
373,Mr MAUGER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"Perhaps it would be ter not to have uniforms, in case a military spirit were encouraged.",64
374,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I do not desire encourage a military spirit, because ject to militarism. But welfriow that we are against war we ought to be ready for war, and no country in the world is unprepared as Australia is at the present time. It is all humbug to talk of of Asiatics invading the Northern Terrieasily tory. If hordes of Asiatics could be over here in a short time there would danger, but,' as' a matter of fact, they not. We know the trouble that Great Britain, with all her resources, bad sending men fast enough to cope with the Boers in South Africa.",64
375,Mr SAMPSON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,If we offered no defence it would not be difficult to land men in Northern Territory.,64
376,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"But what would be the use of their landing in the Northern Territory? They would die off like flies. It would be impossible to shift large bodies of men from any Asiatic Country faster than we could deal with them here, with help from the British Navy. The scheme try. that I would advocate would be on the following lines: I would try to bring into should be if it were practicable. line the greatest number of trained soldiers with the best equipment. The best ginning would be to train all the school boys for the service. I would depart from the Swiss model, because we are so short-handed and our country is expandall ing at such a rate that it would be [104]- 2 impossible to withdraw our youths from their workshops and other employments for a month or six weeks at a time.",64
377,Mr MAUGER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,Would it be a good thing to do?,64
378,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I believe that it would be a splendid thing to do. It would In Switzerland the process of training compels the men to through hedges, leap stone walls, march and counter march for a whole day at a time, and generally submit to a course of severe physical exercise. That is the kind of of thing to put stamina into our youths. Our boys, having been trained at school, would have a preliminary knowledge of discipline. They ""could be taught to and when they arrived at manhood, they would be drafted into the regular But our industries could not endure the disorganization incidental to drafting large numbers of men into bettraining camps for long periods. I have been in training camps that lasted only four days, and where very useful work to was done. When I became a . volunI obteer in the old country, I had to put if in thirty recruit drills, and when they were completed I had to put in, at least, nine so company drills, and three, battalion drills during the year. The system which hordes was followed is one which could be adopted here: .The volunsent teers were drilled in a drill hall be during the winter months. A company canwas drilling every night in the week. If I happened to be attending a class for study in OF. the Monday night and my company was drilling on that night I was allowed to fall in on the Tuesday. If I wanted to go somewhere else on the Tuesday I fell in on the Wednesday, and if for some other reathe son the Wednesday was not convenient I fell in on the Thursday. There was no difficulty in completing the number of drills required during the year.",64
379,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"I understand that the honourable member would not be in favour of compulsory training in this coun'"" Mr HUTCHISON - Undoubtedly I I believe that it is every man's duty to take bepart in the defence of his country, and to be a guardian of its' liberties. The honourable member.is, I understand, afraid of militarism, but what has he to fear when the citizens of the Commonwealth ure trained and drilled? If there were an attempt at tyranny, like the recent attempt of Premier Carruthers, the people would be able to defend themselves and Forces. their country's ' interests. No doubt the Minister of Defence would be be told by his experts that - what I recomBoers mend would not be sufficient. what I am anxious to secure is some training for our youths without haraslike sing employers or upsetting industry. I the experts say that it is not possible secure a properly trained' force under a system, I point out that when some of the South Australian artillerymen were to the Boer War, Imperial officers who them at work said that they were little ferior to the artillery of the Imperial Army, and did splendid service. I remember that when one of our batteries was depleted through sending men to the war, Colonel Ramsay Smith, of the Medical Staff, took withdrawn. it in hand, not as a medical man, but an artillery captain, and in a few months he had that battery up to its old strength and efficiency. I quite agree, however, that it is impossible to work a volunteer militia force together. It has been in Australia, and has always failed.",64
380,Mr MAUGER,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"The two systems cannot be worked together, even in connection with over Â£800,000. a fire brigade. We tried it in Melbourne.",65
381,Mr HUTCHISON,COMPARATIVESCHEDU LE OF,"The two systems have never worked side by side, and never can. Nor do I think that much success will attend efforts to drill a part of the clubs. The whole must be drilled or none. Men will not care to join rifle clubs i enthusiasts want to have drill, and try persuade the others to consent against will. If anything is done in this direction the drill must be compulsory, though should be made as little harassing as sible. But, of course, the rifle clubs affect only a. very small part of our defences. am astonished at the statement of if the Minister, that we have been able to . keep up our Volunteer Forces only by omitting the medical examination.' think that that is a very great pity. Although I do not look a very strong man, I have had to be on duty continuyards, ously for sixty hours. I did not object; but men who looked much stronger than did were unable to undergo the strain. we have no medical examination of young men entering 'our forces an injuscupied tice may often be done. No man should be called upon to engage in drill unless he is certified to be medically A man might be injured by the strenuous work that he is sometimes called upon to perform as a member of the Defence I am satisfied that Australians trained in the way I have mentioned would capable of doing even better than the did in South Africa. There is still But another very important branch of defence to which we must devote attention. UnSwitzerland, we have 8,000 miles of f coast-line to protect, and I recognise that to there is no hope of our being able to build such a navy of our own in the true sense of the word, since a battleship of the Dreadsent nought type costs Â£1,500,000. It must saw be admitted that such an expenditure will inbe for some time beyond our reach; yet we' must be prepared to police our waters against the probable raiders of our commerce at a time of national emergency,when the Imperial warships might be I find that one oceanas going destroyer of the first class, six coastal destroyers, and two first class torpedo boats, would cost Â£930,000, and it is proposed that that expenditure and shall be spread over a period of two tried years. I agree with those who say that we could not at the present time bear that expenditure, added to a military vote"" of I regard the Naval Agreement Act as a wretched, trumpery arrangement, and the sooner we repeal it the better. The subsidy is of. no importance to the Imperial Treasury, but it rifle would go a long .way towards providing for torpedo boats and cruisers for the def some fence of our coast. I am satisfied that to it would be well if all parts of the Emtheir pire having coast-lines to defend built their own navies, and that the several it squadrons so constituted would be of as posmuch assistance to Great Britain in time of war as were the squadrons of the allies I to the Athenian Navy at Salamis. Even our vessels were not first-class battleships, they would be a splendid auxiliary force in time of trouble. If we proI ceeded to lay down the foundations of a navy of our own we should have, in Australia more docks, more ship-building and more factories for the production of warlike stores, and; we should be I able to do far more than we are now If doing with the Â£200,000 paid annually the under the Naval Agreement. I have octhe attention of the Committee at some length, but I felt it my duty to deal with the two questions of the new protecfit. tion and the defence of Australia. If we have officers who, although connected with our military organization for some years, are yet unable to devise a workable scheme, there must be something wrong. On the other hand, if they have a scheme for the defence of Australia, by all means let it foe submitted by the Minister to the House. I speak in the interests of the taxpayer. Although I belong to a party, many of the supporters of which do not desire any military expenditure,. I recognise that whether they desire it or not, our circumstances are such that we may be called upon at any time to defend ourselves, and that we should therefore prepare for such an emergency. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.28 p.m.",65
