2,Mr MAELIN,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister state whether it is intended to give permanent official status lo the gentleman who at the moment is discharging, apparently with every satisfaction, the duties of Australian CommissionerGeneral in the United States of America?",9
3,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"What the status of this office shall :be in the future is at present engaging the attention of the Government. The term of appointment of the officer who is now in New York has really expired but, in recognition of the meritorious nature of his services, has been extended from time to time. It is now subject to further extension until a definite decision has been made. TARIF F BOARD REPORTS.

4,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to the two very indefinite statements of the general manager of the Bank of New South Wales, in response to the announcement of Sir Claude Reading, chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board, regarding the discontinuance of the issue of treasury-bills? Has the Bank of New South Wales indicated whether it intends to reduce its interest rate on deposits, the only ground for the raising of which was. the issue of treasury-bills by the Commonwealth Bank ?",9
5,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"I regret that I have nofurther and more specific information than is available to the honourable member himself. Mr. Curtin"" - In view of the position that has arisen in connection with interest rates, and its implication with respect to future loan raisings by Australian governments, in addition to the influence it will have upon the deficits of the States which next year will have 10 be covered by short-term accommodation, docs the honourable gentleman intend to ask the Loan Council to meet immediately to consider what steps should be taken to prevent a hardening of interest rates?",9
6,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"I fail to see what influence the Loan Council could exert on the present, situation. The matter is largely in the hands of the Commonwealth Bank which, not having thedefinite and positive means of control possessed by central banks in countries with more highly developed financial systems, has to rely to a considerable extent upon requests for the friendly co-operation of the trading banks. That friendly co-operation is readily given in most cases.",10
7,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"A m I to understand that the Commonwealth Government, as a government, and that the State governments, as State governments, have no influence or authority in the determination of interest rates in Australia, and that the Loan Council, an instrument which is now provided for in the Commonwealth Constitution, is also equally impotent to affect the rates of interest which shall be paid by the Australian governments for moneys which they raise for public purposes?",10
8,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"The policy of the Commonwealth Government, and the degree of confidence that it brings into the community, have a large effect on interest rates in Australia, as has been exemplified by the constant fall of interest rates during the life of the first Lyons Government, and also the second Lyons Government, until a year ago, when a very large increase of activity in the community and a consequently increased demand for money brought about a slight increase of interest rates. NATIONAL INSURANCE.",10
9,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"It is reported that Treasurer intimatedto certain; honornot able members, who were assembled in precincts of this building, that it intention of the Government to request an expert in Great Britain to visit Australia to report upon problems associated with national insurance. ""Will the honourable gentleman state whether that is a fact? If this gentleman is invited to visit Australia, will he report upon the reports of Sir Frederick Stewart and the two actuaries who have furnished information to the Treasury on the subject? Also, when he has made his report on those reports, will another expert be invited to make a report on his report?",10
10,Mr CASEY,Unknown,The Leader of the Opposition is pleased to be facetious.,10
11,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,Not at all; I am veryserious.,10
12,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"No more serious, I assure him, than are members of the Government on this subject. In serious reply, I would say that the Government has under consideration a proposal to invite a well-qualified individual from Great Britain to advise it generally in the matter of national insurance. The Government, however, has not yet fully considered the matter, and a decision upon it has not yet been arrived at; but, should such an expert be invito' 1 to Australia, all the work which has so far been done here will be made available to him in an effort to obtain the best possible solution of the problem.

34,Mr ROSEVEAR,COMMONWEALTH CLOTHING,"I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General whether it is a fact that a large number of youths are employed in the Postal Department as temporary messengers?

35,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COMMONWEALTH CLOTHING,"I shall make further inquiries into this matter to learn what has happened recently. While I was in charge of the department the matter engaged its attention, and steps were taken to restrict somewhat the entry of youths until those temporarily employed had been absorbed in permanent positions. I assure the House that every effort is being made to afford an opportunity to those who are in the Service to improve their position. The progeneral prosperity of the country, which is reflected in the increasing business of the Post Office, is enabling this to be done to a greater extent now than was possible some time ago.

Is it not also a fact that the Legislation Council of Norfolk Island unanimously recommended the withdrawal of the ordinance ? If that is so, why did not the Government accept the advice of that body in connection with the matter?",12
39,Mr CASEY,NORFOLK ISLAND,I shall obtain for the honourable member the information he seeks. EX-SOLDIERS' PENSIONS.,13
40,Mr MAHONEY,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Seeing that the British Government recognizes that an ex-soldier may suffer from blindness, even after 15 years, in consequence of gas attacks, will the Minister for Repatriation instruct the medical officers acting on behalf of the Repatriation Department to go very carefully into all requests for assistance by returned soldiers whose health has been affected by gas attack, before any application is rejected ?",13
41,Mr HUGHES,NORFOLK ISLAND,"I was not able to appreciate fully the object of the honourable member's question, but it is inevitable that the act shall fall short in some repects regarding the cover given to returned soldiers. I shall see what can be done in the matter. PARLIAMENT HOUSE ROOF.",13
42,Mr SPEAKER,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Hon. G. J. Bell) Yesterday the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) asked me the following questions':1. Has my attention been directed to numerous leaks in the roof of Parliament House discovered during the recent rains? 2. Will I give him the details of the expenditure from the fund provided by the Joint House Committee for roof maintenance and repairs to the House? 3. Is it a fact that portion of this fund was diverted to meet the cost of alterations to the Prime Minister's offices in the House? I was unable at the time to give the honourable member full information on the various points referred to in his questions, but I have since made inquiries, and am now able to furnish him with the following replies:1. During the recent heavy rains only one leak of any consequence was discovered in Parliament House. This was on the roof covering the press-rooms on the House of Representatives' side of the building. This is the only portion of the roof that has not heen completed under the scheme that has been carried out during the last few years As soon as the House adjourns for any length of time the work will be carried out. It cannot be done while the House is in session. 2. This expenditure is provided for on the estimates of the Department of the Interior, and that department is obtaining the information desired. 3. The cost of the alterations to the Prime Minister's offices was defrayed from a special grant. Consequently, the vote for the repairs to the roof and other maintenance and repairs to the House was not affected. PAPERS.

DIVISION 2 - TOBACC O AND MANUFACTURES THEREOF. Item 19By omitting the whole of sub-item (A ) and inserting in its stead the following subitem :"" (A ) Tobacco, unmanufactured, entered to be locally manufactured into tobacco other than fine cut tobacco suitable for the manufacture of cigarettesto be paid at the time of removal to the factory(1) Unstemmed-pe r lb., British, 3s.

44,Mr FORDE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Capricornia) [10.55] I desire the Government to amend this item by increasing the import duty on both unstemmed and stemmed or partly stemmed tobacco by 6d. per lb. in each of the three columns. The Standing Orders prevent private, members from moving for an increase of duties. The only method by which we can indicate our desire to the Government is to move that consideration of an item be postponed. I therefore move That the item be postponed. I do this "" as an indication to the Government that honourable members desire the duty to be increased by at least 6d. per lb., in order to give additional protection to the Australian tobacco-growers."" This would have the effect of making the duty on unstemmed tobacco 4s. per lb., and on stemmed or partly-stemmed tobacco, 4s. 6d. per lb., which would ensure that the work of stemming imported leaf would be done in the tobacco factories of Australia. The Australian tobacco industry is at present in a parlous condition. I think we would all agree that it is not right that we should import unmanufactured tobacco from America to any greater extent than is absolutely necessary. In the boom period our total imports of tobacco from America were valued at £3,000,000 per annum. In view of the fact that the United States of America imports from Australia goods to the value of only about £18,000,000 per annum, and that we were importing goods to the value of about £45,000,000 per annum from that country, there is justification for taking the step that I am suggesting. The Australian tobacco-growers have suffered severely in consequence of frequent alterations of the tariff by this Government. The import duty on tobacco was increased by the Scullin Government from 3s. to 5s. 2d. per lb., after very careful consideration had been given to the case submitted by a deputation of growers and others, on which I think all political parties then in the Parliament were represented. It was submitted to me, as Acting Minister for Trade and Customs at that time, that the Australian tobacco-growers were suffering in consequence of the heavy importations of tobacco into Australia. Much of this tobacco was grown by black labour under conditions which made competition by the Australian growers impracticable. It was in those circumstances that the import duty was increased, in December, 1930, to 5a. 2d. per lb. The result of that action was that the Australian industry received a valuable impetus. In the following year imports of tobacco leaf fell by 5,000,000 lb., from 20,000,000 lb. to 15,000,000 lb., the quantity of Australian leaf used in the manufacture of tobacco in this country trebled; the quantity of Australian-grown tobacco leaf manufactured in Australia increased from 1,000,000 lb. to 3,000,000 Ib., and the local product became very popular with smokers by reason of the difference in price between it and imported tobacco. The growers were in the happy position of being able to complete negotiations with three or four manufacturers for the sale of practically the whole of their crop. There was a time when only one buyer operated in Australia. The then managing director of the British-Australasia Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited, Mr Claude Beading-no w Sir Claude Beading, chairman of directors of the Commonwealth Bank-in giving evidence before the Tariff Board on one about occasion saidThe company realizes that it is practically the only buyer of Australian-grown tobacco leaf. It is easily the largest buyer of it today; but the tariff policy of the Scullin Government encouraged other local tobacco manufacturers to buy Australian leaf. Some of those companies have since gone out of existence. This multiplicity of manufacturers was appreciated by growers because it intensified competition among the buyers, resulting in increased prices to the Australian grower. Sir Claude Reading continuedI f we have to cater for the public taste, and as business people we propose to do so, there does not look to be very much prospect of increasing the consumption of the present quantity of Australian tobacco. Those remarks were made in respect of the position in 1924-25 when the quantity of Australian leaf used was 1,066,763 lb., being 5.9 per cent, of a total of 18,073,037 lb. In 1928-29 the percentage was lower still, namely, 5.1. It will be seen, therefore, that with inadequate protection there was little, if any, inducement for growers to launch out or incur any great expense either to increase the quantity or improve the quality of the leaf, and they could not look ahead for any period as the stability of the industry was not guaranteed. Requests made to the Government of the day for necessary protection were made in vain, but with the advent of the Scullin Government the whole picture changed. Adequate protection was given to the industry, with the result that the tobacco crop increased, amounting in one year to a record quantity of 12,000,000 lb., when the total importation of unmanufactured leaf was about 20,000,000 lb. As the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. Riordan) who represents one of the most promising tobacco districts in Australia will, no doubt, be able to verify, a large number of people were forced out of the industry because of the change of policy by the rjresent Government.",13
45,Mr BLAIN,NORFOLK ISLAND,And the growers lost a lot of money.,15
46,Mr FORDE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"That is so. Many had invested all their savings in the industry, and they purchased large quantities of galvanized iron, wire and wire netting. In fact, the meeting of their requirements caused a boom in the building trade in tobacco-growing districts. At that time there were no unemployed in Mareeba, which, in a couple of years, was transformed from a second-rate country town into a very thriving and prosperous centre. Because of the severe treatment meted out to tobacco-growers, first, by Sir Henry Gullett when he was Minister for Trade and Customs, and later by the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White)-althoug h the present Minister is an improvement on his predecessor-w e hope the Government will receive this amendment sympathetically. We have been told that all light leaf, or high quality leaf, can be sold, it is well known that high quality production to the extent of 90 per cent, cannot be obtained in either the tobacco industry or any other industry. Consequently hundreds of growers have been forced out of the industry. I do not claim for the Labour party sole credit for assisttobacco. ing this industry. The Scullin Government conferred on this matter with the honourable members then representing New England, Kennedy, Herbert and Indi and others who held official positions in the Australian Tobacco-growers Association. The present Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Earle Page), before he got into the Ministry, was very outspoken in his condemnation of this Government's treatment of the tobacco industry. If only for that reason, I am entitled to expect that the most sympathetic consideration will be given to the growers. On his arrival in Sydney from Canberra on the 29th February, 1932, Dr Earle Page saidThere was no suggestion of a combined move by the Country party to defeat the Lyons Government. It did seem strange, however, that the tobacco industry had been sacrificed in favour of a luxury import from America. A resolution to that effect was carried at a meeting of the party on Friday, and he would do his best to help the Australian industry. The honourable member and a number of his colleagues are now members of this composite Ministry. I recall that the  when a private member, once moved a tariff amendment to give a greater margin of preference to the Australian tobacco-grower; therefore I hope that he too will view with sympathy the very reasonable request that is now being made through my amendment. The number of registered tobacco producers dropped from 5,527 in 1932-33 to 3,565 in 1933-34, whilst in the same period the area under tobacco decreased from 26,272 acres to 16,304 acres, and the production from 9,700,000 to 4,300,000 lb. The quantities of stemmed leaf used in manufacture in 1933-34 were: Imported, 13,700,000 lb.; Australian, 3,300,000 lb. Thus the quantity of Australian leaf used shows little advance on the 1930-31 figures when 3.100,000 lb. was used. In 1933-34, out of 3,157,000 lb. of Australian stemmed leaf used in but manufacture, only 148,000 lb. was used in the manufacture of cigarettes. The total quantities of tobacco, cigarettes and cigars, respectively, made in Australia in 1933-34 were: 14,656,000 lb., 4,577.000 lb., and 259,000 lb., or a. total' of 19,492,000 lb. In addition, 52,000 lb. of 40.000 lb. of cigarettes, and 9.000 lb. of cigars, or a total of 101,000 lb., were imported in the manufactured state. Practically no Australian leaf is used in cigars. The quantity of imported leaf cleared from ibond in 1934-35 ""was 17,000,000 lb., or 2,000,000 lb. more than the quantity cleared in 1930-31, and the largest quantity cleared in any one year since then. The quantities of stemmed leaf used in manufacture in 1934-35 are not available, but the increased clearance of imported leaf would seem to indicate that a smaller quantity of stemmed Australian leaf is used. Any additional stimulus which can given to the growth of Australian leaf should be given without delay and I hope that representatives of tobacco-growers in this chamber will prove their symthe pathy for the industry by supporting substantial, the amendment.",15
47,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"New England) [11.7] - The amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Forde) is reasonable, and I hope the Minister will be able to report favourably on it to the Government. Definite action along the lines suggested will not only benefit the revenue by some £300,000 £400,000 a year but will also accomplish much good for the tobacco industry. I £2,S07,750, and excise £4,962,000. hope that because this proposal emanates from the Opposition, the Government w not view it in any party spirit. I have always protested against making the at tobacco-growing industry a party issue, and I cannot understand why the Governa ment should deal with it in that way. far as the tariff is concerned much more progress in the industry would have been achieved, and probably a better feeling would have been established among the various parties in this House, had industry been placed on the same footing as all other industries, primary and secondary. It seems extraordinary that severely. in this enormous tariff schedule, the tobacco industry alone is made a party issue. This is a fair conclusion to draw local because on numerous occasions in House the industry has not been considered on its merits, but some The supporters of the Government have, perhaps against their better ment, been compelled to support the Government merely in order to prevent an adverse vote. Under the Standing Orders private members have no power to move for an increase of import duties; that is a privilege reserved to the Government. Consequently we must throw ourselves upon its mercy and simply put forward arguments which we hope will win its approval. The case made out by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is sufficiently sound to justify a reconsideration of the import duties on tobacco. If the duties are increased, as the honourable member has suggested, the effect will be to give a slight increase be of the margin of protection to the Australian tobacco industry. In comparisoii with the record duty of 5s. 2d. per lb., which was in force about four years ago, suggested increase will not be very but it will very nearly bridge the gap between the excise duty of 4s. 6d. per lb., and the import duty of 3s. 6d. per lb., and, for this reason, I believe it will have immediately a very beneficial effect upon this languishing industry. The strongest argument for the reconsideration of these proposals is the amount of revenue involved. In 1934-1935 the total or net revenue from tobacco duties was £7,770,142, customs revenue yielding The effect of excise is to increase the price of ill the commodity to the consumer. Befort the last increase the excise on tobacco wa? the rate of 2s. 4d. per lb. It has been raised to 4s. 6d. per lb., and this means very heavy increase of the cost, not only So of Australian tobacco, but also of imported tobacco. Since the present ratf of excise was imposed, no cheap tobacco has been sold in Australia, and as the actual protective effect of that change the was an increase of the margin against Australian tobacco by 93 per cent., naturally the local product suffered most Consumption of Australian tobacco fell enormously, not so much because of the increased price of quality brands, but because this it was placed practically on the same price level as the imported brands. prejudice against Australian tobacco, which had been encouraged for a number judgof years, immediately began to operate. The result of the higher price, plus that prejudice, was that the salas of Australian tobacco decreased and many brands went off the market. I was glad to notice in the budget last year that the Government had, in a small measure, adopted the proposal of the Australian Tobacco-growers Association for a differential excise rate. Under the concession a manufacturer who put an Australian brand of tobacco on the market and certified to the customs authorities that it contained 100 per cent. Australian tobacco, was entitled to a reduction of the excise duty by 8d. per lb. making it 3s. lOd. instead of 4s. 6d. per lb. The concession was much appreciated by those engaged in the industry, but, unfortunately, it was too small. At that time about 50 per cent, of the Australian production of tobacco was being used in all-Australian brands. Those figures were given to me by the Customs Department, but I was not able to verify them. When I inquired as to where the department had obtained its figures, I was told that they had been supplied by the manufacturers. I do not suggest that the manufacturers gave unreliable information, but I admit that I was astonished when informed by the Customs Department about twelve months ago that 50 per cent. of the tobacco produced in Australia was marketed in all-Australian brands of pipe tobacco. Unfortunately, very little Australian tobacco is sold in the form of cigarettes, although it is entirely wrong to think that it is not suitable for cigarettes. I have in my possession samples of cigarettes made from Australian tobacco which compare favourably with the best imported brands. As I have said, I had to accept the figures supplied by the Customs Department because I had no opportunity o testf them. From a statement made by the Minister for Trade and Customs to a deputation in Melbourne- I have not seen a report of it, and, consequently, am speaking from hearsay-it would appear that he has information showing that now 60 per cent, of the Australian production of tobacco goes into all-Australian brands.",16
48,Mr MCEWEN,NORFOLK ISLAND,It is only 40 per cent.,17
49,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"If that be so, during the last twelve months the quanand tity of Australian tobacco used in allwere Australian brands has declined by 10 per cent., despite the excise concession of 8d. per lb. That proves that the concession was too small to be o.f value to the industry. In my opinion it is a sound principle that the Australian tobacco industry should stand on its own feet, if able to do so. The only way in which the local product can hold its own in competition with imported brands of tobacco is by being marketed as 100 per cent. Australian tobacco. I admit that there is something to be said for mixiug Australian tobacco with imported tobaccoes, but we shall not overcome the prejudice and the evil propaganda against Australian tobacco until we are prepared to put 100 per cent. Australian tobacco alongside the imported article and allow the smoking public to judge between them.",17
50,Mr MAHONEY,NORFOLK ISLAND,Why should Australian tobacco be mixed with imported leaf and sold as imported tobacco?,17
51,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The figures in relation to the actual quantities of 100 per cent. Australian tobacco sold are confusing; but if virtually one-half of our tobacco is manufactured in that form, a large proportion of the tobacco sold must be put on the market under false names. It would appear that the public is being led to believe that what is really Australian tobacco is imported leaf. A small manufacturer who operated in Queensland some years ago, told me that he bought tobacco in the district which I represent,-the principal tobacco-growing centre of Australia, which, however, has been given a bad name by the Minister for Trade and Customs",17
52,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,Not at all. I had a talk with the local growers.,17
53,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The Minister favourably impressed the growers and they regarded him as a friend; but they have since been disappointed that he has not done more for the industry. The manufacturer to whom I have referred informed me that he was buying tobacco grown in the Tamworth district, which the combine would not touch, and was manufacturing it in 100 per cent form selling it to retailers in Brisbane, who displaying it in their shop windows without any name attached to it, with the result that the public bought it in the belief that it was the best imported tobacco, and came back and asked for more. That is evidence that the manufacturers are using Australian tobacco and, by placing no name upon it, are letting the public think that it is imported tobacco. That is the only way in which [ can account for the large percentage of our tobacco said to go into 100 per cent, brands. At a later stage I propose to ask for an increased rate of excise on wholly Australian brands of tobacco, but whether or not the Minister will be favourable I cannot say. He will, however, be given an opportunity to decide the matter on its merits. I believe that he is more favourably disposed towards the Australian tobacco-growing industry than he was two or three years ago. The growers are beginning to have hopes of him, and to believe that before long the industry will be back where it was some years ago.",17
54,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,I am trying to improve it beyond what it was then.,18
55,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The growers appreciate the changed attitude of the Minister, resulting from his greater knowledge of the problems of the industry. I shall support the proposal to increase the import duty because I consider that it is fair. This is not a party issue, and I feel sure that all honourable members who wish to see the industry develop, will support the increase.",18
56,Mr BEASLEY,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Fro m what source does the honourable member think that the propaganda against the Australian tobacco growing industry emanates? Mr THOMPSON"" - In my opinion, it emanates mainly from a powerful combine, associated with which are a number of parasites who are well paid for speaking disparagingly of Australian tobacco.' I have never contended that Australian tobacco is a perfect product. The industry is still young, but with proper help it would soon pass the pioneering stages. It has had more knocks than has any other primary industry, and it would be astounding if it had been able to produce a perfect tobacco. Considering the problems confronting the growers in Australia-the prevalence of disease, and greater climatic difficulties than in any other tobacco-growing country -'the y have shown great heroism in persevering with the industry. But far above the discouragement resulting from natural causes has been that created by one of the world's most powerful combines which, under the protective policy of this country, has been given 90 per cent, of the Australian market. That combine has set itself up as the arbiter of the fate of the tobacco growing industry of Australia. In saying that, I say nothing new, because it has already been said in the report of the select committee on the tobacco industry appointed by this Parliament. I am pleased to know that, even in the cities, there is a growing belief that our primary industries should be given every possible encouragement. The tobacco growing industry is capable of employing between 20,000 and 30,000 rural workers. In the midst of the depression it was the only country industry which took men off the dole and gave them work, thereby enabling them to buy their own food and clothing. Yet, when the opportunity came to reward those who had put their money into the industry and provided employment at a critical time in the nation's history, they were practically wiped out of existence by an alteration of Government policy. The present Government has adopted a more sympathetic attitude towards the Australian tobacco growing industry than did its predecessor, which practically told the growers that the industry was not wanted. The Government would act wisely if it increased the excise duty by 6d. per lb., because the effect would be an increased consumption of Australian tobacco which is now declining, while imports are on the increase.",18
57,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,That is not so.,18
58,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"I have seen figures which show clearly that the importations of tobacco are increasing in comparison with the production of tobacco in Australia. If the Minister can produce other figures I shall be glad to see them. Had any other protected industry suffered the same fate as that which has overtaken the tobacco growing industry, we should have to admit that, in regard to it, the protective policy had failed. If , for instance, we found that the importations of pianos or of textile goods continued to increase, while the production of pianos and textiles in Australia decreased, we should have to admit that the industries were not sufficiently protected. That the tobacco-growing industry in this country has declined is proved by the fact that there are now 2,000 fewer growers than there were years ago. That shows clearly that a wrong policy has been pursued in connection with this industry. For the reasons which I have given, and not out of any hostility towards the Government, I propose to support the amendment submitted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.",18
59,Mr BLAIN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Northern Territory ) [11.30] - Bein g a native of New England and having as a youngster grown tobacco in that most important district, I speak with some knowledge of the industry. In my youth, the entire industry was killed; later it was revived, but I regret that progress has been most tardy, and that the industry itself is not receiving very favourable treatment. Tobacco-growing should be regarded as one of the enterprises capable of being successfully carried out in Australia under a variety of soil and climatic conditions. It can be grown in the tropical north, in southern Victoria, or in climates similar to those of Ireland and Belgium. But the southern States can produce a greater diversity of crops than can the tropical regions, which are subject to limitations of soil, climate and economic conditions. Fortunately, tobacco is one of the few crops that demand a light, semi-leached soil, and' a dry atmosphere during the latter party of the growing season, for its .most successful production. The north provides both these desirable conditions of soil and climate. If we are to take the development, of our tropics seriously we should allocate to the north the right to produce a set percentage of Australia's tobacco consumption. This committee, for reasons which I shall state, should regard tobacco-growing seriously and not as an industry that can be left, as the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) stated, in the hands of a combine which is striving to survive under conditions that this Parliament should not permit, if we are to develop the tropical regions. Towards the close of last session, I asked some pertinent questions in regard to the outcome of the yearly investigations conducted into tobacco-growing by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The time has now arrived when we should devote greater attention to the importance some of tobacco-growing, because this year the problems of blue mould and curing are expected to be solved. Many factors, particularly climate, govern the production of tobacco; the daily r a in f all in the growing season has a most important bearing upon the crop. Because of this, we have flue-curing. In view of the variations of climate fro m Darwin in the north to Tasmania in the south, I feel that greater freedom should be allowed the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in the conduct of its experiments, in order that the problem of curing may be solved on a climatic basis. The grower would be relieved of much of the flue-drying if climates suitable for the drying of tobacco were selected. Let me give an illustration of my point: Coming south from Darwin , we have a graduated rainfall, ranging from 60 inches to 20 inches. The tobacco plant requires a ten-weeks growing season before the leaves commence to ripen on the stalk; but if such considerations as the daily rainfal l and the daily moisture-content of the air during those weeks are not known, production cannot be successful. Cropping under such conditions is futil e and foolish, apart from the expensive business of curing. A working plan is required to prove that areas exist in our tropics where the dry atmosphere following monsoonal rains could be utilized to cure the leaf practically in the paddocks, provided that the leaves of choice varieties are plucked as they ripen, which is the practice in countries such as Greece - I am. confident that such regionsexist in the Northern Territory. An important, consideration to be remembered is that these regions do not possess the diversification of climate, and, therefore, the wide range of crops that are found in the southern regions, which have been so handsomely endowed by nature. The question of successful - tobacco-growing in the north therefore becomes one of national importance. If the cultivation of tobacco were allocated to the northern districts, we should lay a foundation for the development of the light lands in our tropics, and the sneering remarks directed against their non-productiveness would no longer be justified. Tobacco, if fostered, would be a staple crop of those parts. If Australia allocates to the northern regions the growing of tobacco, and adopts a sane policy of capitalizing the northern soil and climate by compelling southern growers to cease production of inferior cigarette leaf on unsuitable areas- a menace to northern development-the whole nation will benefit, and if the market is nursed the Australian product will before long be able to compete with the imported. For the present, however. I endorse the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Forde), that Australian tobacco should be given adequate protection against the foreign-grown; and, in granting this protection, because it spells economic occupancy of the north, I am prepared to go to even greater lengths than those suggested by the honourable member.",19
60,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Kennedy) [11.38] The Minister for Trade and Customs ("" Mr White) interjected that he did not desire Australian tobacco to return to the state it was in when the duty was 5s. 2d. per lb. Evidently the policy of the Minister is to get back to the years before 1929, when sufficient protection was not given to the industry. If that is his desire., his policy has been effective, as is shown by the decline of the production of tobacco leaf. In 1930 there were 6S1 growers; but, in 1932, as the result of adequate protection, the number had increased to 5,127, and in the following year to 5,600. Production in 1929 was 1,8S3,1'29 lb. Two years later it had increased to 10.160,192 l b . ; today it is back to 2,342,000 lb. Honourable members will realise, therefore, that the production of tobacco has gradually declined as the result of the policy of this Government in lowering the protection granted to the industry. The honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) stated that he was surprised 'that previous debates upon this subject should have been political, thereby restricting the freedom of action of honourable members. All matters discussed in this chamber are political. The honourable member for New England, when speaking upon the subject of tobacco in 1933, made the following charge against the present Minister in charge of negotiations for trade treaties (Sir Henry Gullett) :It is a. strange thing that the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry G-ullett) can never speak on the subject of the Australian tobacco industry without displaying a considerable amount of heat and venom. I am satisfied that his protests of friendliness towards the industry are not sincere, because home they arc belied by his own utterances, and he takes every opportunity of throwing mud at the majority of the growers. He did so again to-night. As I have said before, the tobacco combine has no better advocate in this Parliament than the .honourable member. I ask honourable members to consider the fate of the tobacco-grower and the treatment of this industry by the Government. A Department of Commerce employing a large staff has been created, and in this House there are a Minister for Commerce and an Assistant Minister for Commerce, presumably to safeguard the interests of the Australian producer and to assist in the finding of markets. Prior to 1932 the number of growers in the Cairns hinterland was negligible, but in the year 1932-33,1,616 men were occupied in the production of leaf. If it had not been for the protection granted to this industry they would have been on the dole. To-day there are less than 300 men growing tobacco in that district. To illustrate the hardshipsthat beset these growers I quote the following article published in the Cairns Post:The Cairns Post publishes for the information of all concerned the following facts and figures, which tell their own tremendous tala, thusCombined Growers Tobacco Manufacturers Company Limited, Brisbane. Manufacturers of high-class Australian tobaccoes. Toasted rough and coarse cut for pipe; toasted ready rubbed fine cut for cigarettes; superior quality twist, plug, bars and nail rod tobaccoes; blenders of imported tobaccoes. The grower, Mr Moses, sent his tobacco to this firm, and received the following reply:Dear Sir, Enclosed please find statement and cheque attached. This is the highest price tobacco will bring on the present state market. Yours faithfully, CO-UMNED GROWERS TOBACCO 'J'UKKKS COMPANY LIMITED .

Still the manufacturer had not the previous year. finished with him. Half of the net proceeds had to be paid to the manufacwas sold. turer, and freight and cartage absorbed £1 10s. of the remainder, so that the ultimate return to the grower was £3 13s. 2d. Is it any wonder that he and his family wondered who grew the 6 cwt. of tobacco?",20
61,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,To whom did he sell,21
62,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"He sold it to the Combined Growers Tobacco Manufacof turers Company, in Brisbane, which paid him 6s. per lb., the best price available. The greatest rake-off was excise, of which he paid £94 17s. 6d. on the consignment.",21
63,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The growers do not excise. It is paid by the manufacturers, who pass it on to the consumers.",21
64,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"I challenge the Minister to investigate this complaint order to see whether excise is being wrongfully collected, and - if so to take the necessary action.",21
65,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,I shall be glad to look into the matter.,21
66,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The statements which I have made now were published in the Cairns Post, and they have not been refuted or challenged. grower also paid £18 l is . 3d. for manuthe facturing costs. In the Mareeba area, growers have invested over £100,000 in the industry. Some years ago, the Government appointed a joint parliamentary committee to inquire into the tobacco industry in Australia, and that, your committee made certain recommendations ol the to the Government. When those recommendations were put into operation by MANUFAC - the Scullin Government, so great a fillip was given to the the industry that, in the Mareeba district alone, 1,600 persons Cwt. qr. lb. £ s. d. went in for tobacco production. In 1929 the total quantity of tobacco produced in Australia was .1.836,000 lb.; in 1930 5 3 10 the amount was 1,702,000 lb; in 1931 it was 1,000,000 lb., but in 1931-32, the 4 1 19 first year in which the Scullin duties . . 148 10 0 were in operation, the amount increased 10s. to 10,160,192 lb. After that came what for is known as the Gullett agreement at 9d. between the manufacturers and the growers, when an average price of 2s. 3d. the per lb. was paid, representing a drop £10 of 9d. per lb. below the price of However, at that price the whole of the crop The next year there was no guaranteed price, and the growers were left to the mercy of the combine, with the result that most of them were forced out of the industry. We are told, of course, that the decline of the industry is due to blue mould, but the fact remains that, even when the growers proit? duce good tobacco, they cannot find a market for it. When the Deputy Leader the Opposition was pleading for assistance for the tobacco-growers in 1933, the honourable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett) said that he was surprised to hear the honourable member asking for support for the New England growers, pay who were producing rubbish at the expense of the Mareeba growers. The policy seemed to be to play off the Mareeba growers against those of New in England, until the New England growers wore put out of the business; then, all of a sudden, it was discovered that there was blue mould in Mareeba, so that it was of no use trying to grow tobacco there either. There is undoubtedly some blue mould in Mareeba, and its presence is largely due to the policy of the Government, which made it unprofitable for the growers to harvest their crops, which This were left standing in the paddocks, with result that the plants became a prey to all kinds of diseases. However, blue mould, we are informed by scientists, will never be a serious menace in Queensland, because there the disease is out of its environment. It could never destroy whole crops as it does in Victoria. The growers have, year after year, been hoping for more adequate protection, and have looked to the Country party to help them to get it. On one occasion, the honourable member for Gippsland  Government did not accept Country party's proposition for reduced excise duties and increased import duties, he and his colleagues would take steps to translate their wishes into action. However, when I look at the division which was taken in Parliament on the item, I find that all members of the Country party, with the exception of the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) and the honourable member for Calare (Mr. Thorby), voted with the Government. That sort of trickery has gone on all the time. There is no sound reason why Australia, should not produce all the tobacco it requires, especially in these times of depression. The opponents of the Australian tobacco industry claim that the loss of revenue on imported tobacco would .represent too great a sacrifice, but when the excise duty was reduced by 2s. 3d. per lb. by the Scullin Government, the revenue for that year was greater than for the year before. I maintain that the Government is morally bound to compensate the growers who, on the promise that adequate protection would be given, invested their capital in the industry. If a private firm of land agents, for instance, deceived their clients in the same way as the Government has deceived the growers, the principals would be in danger of arrest for issuing false prospectuses. I was in Mareeba when the Prime Minister visited the district, and I heard him promise the growers that he would appoint a committee to investigate the industry. Subsequently, the committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Mr Townsend. In its report, the committee stated that blue mould was prevalent in the district, and that, in some instances, the attempt was beine; made to grow tobacco on unsuitable land. Mr E. J. HARRISON - Was not Mr. Howell a member of that committee?",21
67,Mr MOELXAJST,NORFOLK ISLAND,"He was. Mr. Howell had, for the previous five years, been investigating the tobacco industry as an employee of the Commonwealth Government, and had reported favourably upon it. Nevertheless, he signed the report, which stated, in effect, that tobacco could not be produced successfully, and I believe that he did so because he feared that, if he refused, he would the lose his job. No man connected with that report was more ashamed of it than was Mr Howell. So ashamed was he that when he returned to amongst the growers where he had made the investigation he eventually faded out of the job.",22
68,Mr BEASLEY,NORFOLK ISLAND,Ou t of the service?,22
69,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Yes , out of the service. After saying that tobacco could be grown at Mareeba, and then signing a report declaring the opposite, he resigned his position in the department where he had security of tenure and a good salary, and took up land at Mareeba for tobacco-growing.",22
70,Mr BEASLEY,NORFOLK ISLAND,"That sounds ""crook"" to me. Mr E. J. HARRISON - Is he still there ?",22
71,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,He was still there the last time. I was in the district. Mr E. J. HARBISON - Provin g that the present duties are right.,22
72,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,Provin g nothing whatever.,22
73,Mr BEASLEY,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Provin g that it is "" crook "". That is what is proved.",22
74,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"'Order ! Mr RIORDAJN"" - Mr Howell, as the departmental' expert, knew the value of cultivation of high-class leaf under irrigation and having sufficient capital and a thorough knowledge of tobacco cultivation, and the type of leaf required, he went into production; but he will tell you today that he cannot obtain a market even for his first-class tobacco. He is hanging on in the hope that something will be done for the tobacco-growers in Queensland. What has been done to the growers would not be tolerated by miners or any compact settlement. It is only because the growers are spread over a wide area that they cannot be brought together. The only time they were brought together was when the Prime Minister arrived at Mareeba following the passage of certain resolutions of protest. Just prior to his arrival, the following telegram was sent to the Prime Minister :Seven hundred growers i u Mareeba district empltaibioally protest against any reduction in tariff on imported leaf and removal of prohibition on manufactured tobacco, cigarettes and cigars, and request every effort be made to retain present duties and excise. Any interferenco will cripple the whole of the industry in its infancy by increasing the cost of low grade tobacco, aud (thereby reducing consumption. It is stated by those associated with industry here that alteration in the tariff will moan ruination in its infancy of the industry, which is supporting 3,000 persons and represents 'investment of £500,000 of capital. The tobacco industry in North Queensland, even at the depth of the depression, supported 3,000 persons and provided an avenue of employment for men in the back country. I am convinced that the whole of this country's tobacco requirements will be produced in those back areas. The growers there have no market for lower-grade tobacco and the quality of crops is dependent to a large extent on seasonal conditions. Those honourable members who give lip service to the tobacco-growers have an excellent opportunity today to show practical sympathy. ""We have no power to move for an increase of duties, but we ask that the item be postponed as an instruction to the Government to increase the duty on imported leaf. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) has already moved in that direction, and I hope that his amendment will meet with the support of all fair-minded honourable members. I speak today not with any desire to make political capital out of the industry-indee d out of more than 60,000 persons on the Kennedy electoral roll only ahout 1,600 are tobacco-growers - bu t because I have a great regard for these people who have invested their money in tobacco-growing. tobacco-growers are given protection until such time as they can be placed on a solid footing, the Government will lose no revenue. On the contrary, it will place people in employment, both directly and indirectly. Protection to the industry will help towards the lifting of the wages taxes because the number of unemployed Mr Riordan. persons will be materially reduced. To the family man who is unable to find other employment for his sons tobacco growing presents an opportunity to place them in work. Already thousands of the most thrifty men in the Commonwealth, men with small capital who had to find work for their children, have engaged in the industry. The Government is aware of the great possibilities presented by this industry, but that has not prevented it from penalizing it and bringing t« the brink of ruin men the engaged in it. By reducing the duties it has put these men into competition with countries such as America where leaf is grown by black labour, and to the great detriment of the Australian leaf hasfloodedthis country with the imported product.",22
75,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [12.6] - Althoug h I did not intend to speak on this subject, I feel that because of the statements made by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) some other aspects to the tobacco question should be presented to the committep. Accompanied by some other honourable members, I toured the tobacco fields of North Queensland some time ago with the object of trying to discover the conditions existing and the results to the industry of the alteration of the tobacco duties. We were amazed at the state of affairs existing there. It was entirely contrary to what the honourable member has depicted.",23
76,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The honourable member was there for two hours. Mr E. J. HARRIS ON - I was there for a sufficiently long period to obtain the necessary information. The conditions obtaining in Mareeba at that time were a sure indication of the effect that uncontrolled and unbalanced introduction If the of tariff legislation will have upon the general population. The action of the Scullin Government in increasing customs duty on tobacco leaf to 5s. 2d. per lb., brought into the industry a group of young men imbued with get-rich-quick ideas. They were prepared to relinquish good positions in cities and even give up valuable sugar lands in Queensland to go to Mareeba. Some of these paid the inflated price of £5 an acre for land, because the area which the Crown had made available at 2s. 6d. an acre ioi' tobacco-growing had already been fully taken np. These inexperienced young men considered that all they had to do was to walk around their land hands in pockets and see the money roll in. ""With the object of storing their leaf some of them erected concrete barns costing £300 each. The barns stand there today, monuments to the lack of experience of young men who knew so little about the job that they even had to engage other men to till their fields. There was a grading company at Mareeba and these young men, not having sufficient experience to do their own grading, paid 3d. per lb, to this company to do it for them. The statements which I am making now are borne out by the report of the Tobacco Inquiry Committee appointed by the Commonwealth Government in 1933. When the personnel of that committee was announced it was applauded by the growers in Mareeba. The rafters rang with their applause when they learned that Messrs. Townsend and Howell were to be on the committee. I challenge the honourable member for Kennedy to deny that.",23
77,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"I do deny it. They hooted. Mr E. J. HARRISON - The committee was asked to make a report into disease prevalent in the tobacco in North Queensland. In its conclusions and recommendations it statedThe distress of a large number of tobacco growers in North Queensland, at the present time, is largely due to the widespread occurrence this season of frog-eyo leaf spot (cercospora nicotianae), for which, apparently unfavorable growing conditions were responsible. It went on to criticize the industry. When during the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy I directed his attention to the fact that Mr Howell, - Enowing the local conditions, was a party t© that report, the honourable member immediately indulged in blackguarding him.",24
78,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"I did nothing of the sort. Mr E. J. HARRISON - At any rate, while the honourable member was speaking the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) interjected: "" That sounds ' crook' to me "". The charges levelled by the honourable member for Kennedy must have produced on honourable members the impression which the honourable member for West Sydney expressed in words. The honourable member is now declaring that he did not do so, but by insinuation and innuendo he produced on this committee the same effect as direct charges would have produced. He said that Mr Howell had signed the report against his good judgment and then, in shame, had faded out. He went on to tell us that Mr Howell was now engaged in growing tobacco at Mareeba. If a man knowing the conditions existing there takes up land in that district to produce tobacco and if he is still there it is obvious that he is satisfied with the existing rates of duty. [Quorum formed.] Some time after my visit I made inquiries from various gentlemen who had participated in the investigation. I went even further and corresponded with successful tobacco growers in the locality-unfortunately , I have not their letters with me-wh o understood the work and who were not included in those induced to take up land by the excessive duties imposed. The honourable member for Kennedy said that if an agent had attempted to do what the Government had done, he would have been brought before the court. The conditions existing in the tobacco-growing industry in Queensland were brought about, not by this Government, but by the Scullin Government, by its action in increasing the import duty to 5s. 2d. per lb., thereby influencing men, as I have already said, to take up land, not only at 2s. 6d. an acre, but in some instances at £5 an acre. In their ignorance, they thought that all they had to do was to do the necessary planting and they would become rich overnight. I commend the present Government for the attitude it has adopted in connection with this industry and for the effort it has made to place it upon a sound basis. At the time of which I am speaking, the duty was 5s. 2d. per lb. when Virginian leaf could be landed duty free at l i d . a lb. The type of leaf then being produced at Mareeba could not be regarded as of first-class quality. I agree with the honourable member for Kennedy that some growers in his electorate are producing excellent leaf, and that the prospects production on a satisfactory basis are favourable; but the growers need to be instructed in the proper method of proFor duction, and should not be content to produce quantity and not quality. a tobacco-grower:They cannot expect to effect sales of inferior leaf. The action of the GovernJuly 15thment in restoring the industry to an economic basis is worthy of commendation.",24
79,Mr COLLINS,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Hume) [12.17] - I support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Eorde), because I consider that a good case has been made out on behalf of the tobacco-growers. No doubt we shall hear further statements similar to those of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr E. J. Harrison) in opposition to the amendment. Mr E. J. HARRISON - I do not know anything of the conditions in the south; I spoke of what I saw at Mareeba.",25
80,Mr COLLINS,NORFOLK ISLAND,"There is a certain amount of substance in the arguments adduced by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan), in connection with the trials and tribulations of the growers at Mareeba, who are endeavouring to eke out an existence in producing tobacco. There are many instances in which growers, after devoting caref u l attention to the production of tobacco, have been able to sell only the higherquality leaf, and have had the balance of their product rejected as valueless. An effort should be made to assist growers to dispose of the rejected leaf. The honourable member for Kennedy gave particulars of the experiences of some growers in disposing of their product, and reasons why additional assistance should be afforded to them. If the duties were increased, as proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the additional burden would have to be borne by tobacco producers in the United States of America- a country disinclined to engage in reciprocal trade. Tobacco produced in the United States of America, largely by coloured labour, is exported to Australia, where it comes into competition with Australian tobacco, produced by men working under conditions superior to those in any other part of the world. The United States of of America is anxious to export to Australia everything it possibly can, and in return to take as little of our goods as possible. the information of the committee, I submit the following account, received by cwt. qr. lb.

84,Mr COLLINS,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Yes . As stated by the Minister, growers do not pay excise, but it is deducted from the proceeds of the sales made by the tobacco producers. It would be a gracious act on the part of the Government to reduce the excise by Is. per lb., and thus render some slight assistance to the growers, who have invested their capital, and taken all the risk in producing this commodity. The case I have quoted is not by any means unusual. I am willing to support those who have taken up the cudgels on behalf of the tobacco-growers in an endeavour to see if something cannot be done to assist in the disposal of rejected leaf. I have also received a letter in connection with the sale of rejected tobacco from which I quote the following:I consigned 47 bales of rejected leaf on behalf of three growers to that c o m p a n j ' to be m a n u f a c t u r e d . The statement of accounts made on 2 8 t h F e b r u a r y , 1935, shows that the leaf for w a r d e d has been m a n u f a c t u r e d , and the excise duty paid to the Customs Department.

92,Mr MAHONEY,NORFOLK ISLAND,"In the Derwent Valley, tobacco production is being undertaken, and, if the industry has an opportunity to develop, employment can be provided for a large number of persons. Every year thousands of youths and girls are leaving school, and if this industry is given sufficient encouragement, work can be provided for many who are now in need of it. In order to absorb many of our workless youths who, today, have of so little before them, the Government should give consideration to the formulation of a policy designed to bring about an increase of the production of Austobacco. The American tobacco combine, which, as is well known, is one of the most prolific profit-producers in world, has killed a growing Aushe tralian industry. I support the contenonly tion of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Collins) that we should not grant this combine opportunity to exploit the Australian market at the expense of growers and tobacco users of Ausfor tralia. One of its means to defeat the successful growing of tobacco in Australia is to buy first-grade Australian leaf, mix it with imported leaf and place the it on the Australian market as wholly imported tobacco. It is remarkable that it should have so many friends to speak on its behalf when it is well known that to the United States of America, from a which we buy so much, will not take any of our primary products to help bring about a more favourable balance of trade by between the two countries. The Government is reputed to be attempting to solve the unemployment problem. The tobacco industry offers wonderful opportunity for the employment of our youths. The argument is frequently advanced that no industry should be afforded such high protection as that provided for the tobacco industry. I am prepared to protect any industry in its infancy, and to continue that protection until it is in a position pete with the products of other countries in the borne market on a fair basis. Through the tariff policy of the Scullin Government tobacco-growing in Australia received a great impetus. Growers put large areas under cultivation and a new avenue of employment was opened.",26

97,Mr HUTCHINSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Indi ) [12.40] one Honourable members opposite are unfortunately once again indulging in their old game of tryin g to pull the tobaccogrower's ]eg. for that is exactly the effect The tobacco-growers so often been made the pawn in political squabbles that they are entirely sick and tired of it . In addition to pulling the grower's leg honourable memopposite are once again pumping the No attempt has been to j u s t if y the amendment moved by deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr . If the duty on tobacco had was been 4te. we would still have had an amendment for 4s. 6d. H a d it been 4s. 6d. members opposite would still not have been satisfied, and the same old o r story would have been repeated. Nobody can deny that the industry today is in a much better position than it was some years ago when, as the result of the high the duty imposed by the Scullin Government, there was an enormous rush of prospective growers, many of whom planted tobacco on unsuitable land in areas with unsuitCapital amounting to thousands of pounds was dissipated, and many .hundreds of growers were ruined. The responsibility for that state of affairs rested on the Scullin Government. A thorough investigation was carried out in connection with the tobacco-growgive ing industry, particularly in northern Queensland, and a most adverse report was presented to this Parliament. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. E. J. Harrison) said that when the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) announced at Mareeba that Mr Howell had been this appointed to investigate the industry, announcement was greeted with cheers, it the growers in that district having lute confidence in Mr Howell. Yet report of the investigation, so disapadopted. pointing to the growers, was a unanimous one, showing that Mr Howell's views coincided with those of his fellow investibut, gators. The committee reported that conditions operating in the tobacco-growtion. ing industry in northern Queensland growers' were not conducive to its successful establishment. Many growers who were endeavouring to work unsuitable areas have now abandoned their attempt, and the industry is now settling down on more stable basis. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) has mentioned the case a grower who, having sold his leaf to certain company, was charged excise the leaf. The honourable member number knows very well that the excise on tobacco is levied on the manufacturer who, in turn, recoups himself by chargunder ing it to the public. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) has try referred to that as a reprehensible pracoperating tice, I would go further and say that it is an unscrupulous practice for a buyer to offer the grower what seemed to be satisfactory price but which was found to include expenses such as excise. it is over 50 per cent. It is possible that the buyers only half teil the growers what they are going to get out of it. But even if the excise duty were 5s. or 6s. the same thing might happen. I regret that the honourable member for Kennedy has endeavoured the to give the committee the idea that growers are held responsible for the ment of the excise duty. Sibling suspended from 12.45 to 1.15 p.m. [Quorum formed.]",27
98,Mr HUTCHINSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The position is apparently something like this: A certain company approaches a tobacco-grower and says, "" We shall you 6s. or 7s. per lb. for your leaf, but you will have to pay iuJ expenses"". 'j.'he grower thinks that this is a good price, being at least double what other firms offer him, so he accepts it without inquiry as to the meaning of paying "" all expenses."" The action of company is most reprehensible, and the the Government should take such steps as can to stop the practice, or, at least, it absoshould circulate through the growing the areas information as to the tactics The British-Australasian Tobacco Company is regarded by some people as almost, an infamous combine, in my dealings with it, I have always received the utmost courtesy and attenTo the best of my knowledge the association in my electorate does not support the charges levelled against the company. I have heard it said by leading growers that, if this corporation is to be slandered every time the Governa ment is approached, they will have nothing to do with the attack. Generally speaking, the association in Victoria, is more or less satisfied with the treatment of received from the company. The indusa try is now in a healthier condition than on previously. It is true that a certain of growers have gone out of it, and it may be said that the industry is all the better for their leaving it, for they were carrying on their operations conditions that made success impossible. At the present time, the indushas the right men in it, and they are on suitable land. This statement is borne out by the improved quality of the Australian leaf. A few years ago a it was below 30 per cent., as compared with the highest-grade leaf, and today When I was in the United States of America last year, I interviewed officials at the Agricultural Department at Washington, and made investigations regarding conditions prevailing in the American tobacco industry. I found that the averpayage wage paid on the farms was somewhere between $1 and $1.50 a day, and I was told that it would be more correct to place the figure at $1.50, because the employee who received only $1.00 would get something in addition to his wages, such as free housing, or a certain quantity of provisions. It has been said in this chamber that the industry is carried on in that country with nigger labour, and that the wages paid are shockingly low. In Australian currency a dollar is worth about 5s., so the average wage would be roughly 7s. 6d. a day. Therefore, the rate of remuneration is not so low as honourable members may have beeu led to believe. At the time of my visit, the price paid for leaf ranged between 15 and 19 cents per lb., and it was alleged that at that price the producer could make ends meet, although, of course, he was not making a fortune. Obviously this Parliament is giving a reasonable amount of protection to the Australian industry. During the last couple of years when local crops have been severely affected by the ravages of blue mould, and enormous losses having been suffered in my electorate, I represented to the Government that an increase of the import duty would be of assistance to the industry. I have been held up as its enemy, but I think that I can claim, without boasting, some, credit for the slight, increase of duty that was made. I have always tried to give the industry sound leadership and not merely striven for political popularity. The investigation of blue mould and other diseases, for which the sum of £20,000 was allocated, has been of real value, and I am. confident that it will prove more beneficial to the industry in the long run than an increase of the Its duty or a reduction of the excise. If industry produces leaf of high quality, free from disease, its success is pracAustralian tically assured. Certain claims have been advanced. today in regard to the industry, but no attempt has beeu made to substantiate them. tening to the debate, one might imagine that the tobacco-growers were heading for extinction. The Australian usings of pipe tobacco have risen from 1,206,436 U>. in 1929-30, to 3,179,314 lb. in 1934-35. The percentage of Australian usings tobacco to the total consumption has gone up from 8.7 per cent, in 1929-30, to 26.2 per cent. That is a very substantial 3/r. Hutchinson. increase, and it has been progressive every year since 1929-30. I believe that more and more of the Australian leaf will be brought into consumption. In the last budget, the Government gave furtherassistance to the industry. It reduced, the excise by 8d. per lb. on tobacco and 6d. per lb. on cigarettes, when the leaf was wholly Australian. This, I believe,, will be of some value, but not so helpful as some people may imagine. We all know that tobaccoes are blended, and for this particular assistance to be of real, benefit we must produce within this country tobaccoes suitable for blending. A certain number of them are being grown, but the bulk of the leaf now smoked is a blend of imported and local leaf. In the United States of America, it is customary to blend a certain percentage of foreign tobacco with the leaf produced in that country. Cigarettes sold in the United States of America, particularly, almost invariably contain a percentage of Turkish tobacco. I found it impossible in that country to buy cigarettes containing tobacco that was not so blended. It may be possible to secure a satisfactory blend made entirely from Australian leaf, but the majority of it will be used with some imported leaf, and so the concession granted 1 is not as valuable as appears at first sight. It is satisfactory to know, however, that all usable Australian tobacco has been sold during the last few years, and, as I have said, thequality is improving. The percentage of Australian leaf used in manufacture is also on the increase, so there is no indication that the industry is in dire peril. difficulties today are mainly attributthe able to the prevalence of blue mould. If there is any difficulty about gettingleaf into consumption I can give growers an assurance that in the future the Government will aet in their interests. In this matter the GovernLisment will have my support. The position, of the growers will, I am quite sure, always receive sympathetic consideration.",28
99,Mr NOCK,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Riverina) [2.31] - Many honourable members have growers of in their electorates, and it seems to me that there is something in what has been said by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Hutchinson) that sometimes political action is taken to curry favour with certain sections of the producers who hope to get an advantage. This amendment is really placing some of us in a cleft stick. We have to decide whether we shall support the Government and do what we consider is the fair thing, or support the amendment, the purpose of which is to secure an additional advantage for & section of tobacco-growers in our electorates. I have no hesitation in stating definitely that I intend to support the Government because I consider that it is doing the fair thing. The history of the tariff in relation to tobacco-growing is well known. Some years age, when the Scullin Government enforced a tariff of 5s. 2d. a lb. on imported tobacco, large numbers of persons from all sections of the community, many without any rural experience, gave their attention to tobacco-growing in the belief that, with the extreme protection afforded, they would be able to get rich quickly. Later, because of the probable effects of increased Australian production upon the revenue, the Tariff Board was asked to Inquire into the industry which, it was feared, would be developed uneconomically There was also the fear that largely increased production would seriously interfere with Commonwealth revenue, sind render necessary the imposition of other forms of taxation in order to make good the loss sustained through reduced customs collections on imported tobacco. The decision of the Lyons Government to reduce the duty from 5s. 2d. to 3s. a lb. was resisted by Country party members on the ground that growers who had been induced to engage in the industry following the imposition of high duties by the Scullin Government, had entered into financial commitments which they would be unable to meet. Not a single crop had been harvested under the protection that was promised when it was planted. We declared that the sudden alteration of the tariff savoured of repudiation, and that more consideration should have been given, and we urged that the position could be met by the imposition of excise on a sliding scale for two or three years, thus giving growers a chance to recoup themselves, and gradually placing the industry on an economic basis. It was argued at that time the best Virginian leaf could be brought to Australia at l i d . per lb., and that a tariff of 3s. per lb. gave Australian growers a good margin; and members of the Country party who advocated moderation in tariff legislation in respect of secondary industries but fought for an extreme tariff in respect of the tobacco industry on the ground that it was not fair to reduce the duties so suddenly, had to meet the charge of being inconsistent.. I submit, however, that our attitude was quite consistent and that our plea for a sliding scale of excise duties had, as its objective, the protection of the growers from collapse and the gradual stabilization of the industry. We were not successful in our representations but the Government gave us an assurance that the matter would be reconsidered. I took the trouble, at that time, to interview a number of tobacco-growers in my electorate and also paid a visit io Mareeba. There I learned that if growers could get 2s. per lb. for their leaf they could carry on. Many were, however, receiving considerably more than 2s. and I gathered that they were quite satisfied. About that time blue mould made, its appearance, and also the frog leaf disease, owing to a wet summer, the result being that a considerable proportion of the crop was believed to be unsaleable. I obtained a number of samples of affected leaf in order to get expert advice from officials of the BritishAustralasian Tobacco Company, but later learned that the growers had been successful in disposing of almost the entire crop of second quality leaf, so that although their prices had suffered somewhat, their actual losses were much less than had been anticipated. Later, as honourable members will recall, there was a special inquiry into the condition of the industry, and a report was presented; the fact that Mr Howell, who was one of the investigators, has since engaged in the industry itself and is a grower at Mareeba, is an indication that, in his opinion at all events, the position of the tobacco-growers is by no meansso hopeless, with present protection, as some people would have us believe. Following representations by Country party members and after the Government had reconsidered the position, the import duty was increased by 6d. per lb. I pointed out to the Minister that, after allowing for the "" stem "" rebate, the protection on the 2 oz. tin was still insufficient to encourage Australian production. Since then, as the result of requests made by a deputation of growers, there has been a further reduction by Sd. per lb. of the excise duty on tobacco manufactured from purely Australian leaf. Tins means that with a tariff of 3s. 6d., growers now have the additional advantage of 6d. in the tariff against imported leaf, and Sd. in the excise, as well as a further concession in respect of tobacco intended for sale to the aborigines. We should also bear in mind that, whilst best Virginian leaf could have been bought for lOd. or Ud . per lb three years ago, it now costs about Is. 8d., or Is. 9d. per lb., so that growers now have a 2s. per lb. better opportunity to sell their leaf than they had three years ago. Growers in my electorate complained that they could not get a buyer to inspect their crop; but as it was comparatively small-representin g thirteen or fourteen bales-the tobacco company was naturally reluctant to incur the expense of sending a buyer from Melbourne or Sydney to the Murrumbidgee irrigation areas. Eventually, the company sent a man out, and I learned later that the growers were well satisfied with the way in which they were treated. Much of the trouble that has occurred in the industry is due to the quality of the leaf not coming up to the standard desired by Australian smokers. I therefore commend the Government for its decision to set aside £20.000 for tigation of the problems that beset the industry, and I feel sure that the work that is being done by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will he of immense advantage to growers. The experiments being carried out by the council are distinctly encouraging. Seedling sections that have been treated with benzol are producing strong and healthy plants, and I feel sure that, Mr Nock. in the not distant future, the council will have gone far to solve the problems that have caused so much loss and trouble. I was rather surprised to hear some honourable members assert that the amount collected in excise duty is paid by the growers. No excise is paid on the production of tobacco leaf; the duty is collected only on manufactured tobacco, and is paid by the manufacturers to the Customs Department. If there were no excise it would not add to the price of leaf, but would merely reduce the price to smokers. I have also heard it said that the growers have contributed the huge amount of £7,000,000 to the national revenue; but, as I have explained, the contribution is made not by the growers, but by the Australian smokers. The increase of the tariff by 6d. per lb. on imported tobacco and the excise concession of 8d. per lb. on Australian tobacco represented an adjustment which aided the industry to the extent of £900,000. According to  recently, there were in Australia, in 1933-34, 3,565 growers, so the loss of revenue through tariff and excise advantage was equivalent to £252 for each grower, and, on an about acreage basis, it was equivalent to £50 an acre. In 1932-33, again taking figures compiled by Mr Jones, there were in Australia 5,527 growers cultivating 26.272 acres; the production was 9,700,000 lb., and the loss of revenue, due to the concessions already mentioned, was £2,002,000. This worked out at £362 for each grower, and an average of nearly £80 an acre. I consider that the Government has now made amends for the definite hardship suffered by growers who were induced to engage in the industry by the inveshigh duties imposed by the Scullin Government. Practically any commodity can be produced at a price, but it is sometimes unwise, and I doubt whether any honourable member would approve of the imposition of 2s. a gallon on petrol for the sake of establishing the petrol industry in this country. If such an attractive proposal were made by the Government, numerous companies would be anxious to establish hydrogenation plants for the extraction of oil from coal, and petrol from shale, but the industry would on an uneconomic basis. ""We have to realise that loss of revenue resulting from such a policy must be made up by some other form of taxation. Australian tobacco-growers now have tariff protection of 3s. 6d. per lb., an additional advantage of Sd. by a reduction of the excise duty on all tobacco made solely fro m Australian leaf, as well as a further concession in respect of tobacco intended for the aborigines; and having regard to the fact that the cost of imported leaf is so much higher than it was three years ago, I consider that the Government is doing the fair thing by the industry and I will support it .",29
100,Mr MCEWEN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Echuca) [2.45] - This proposal concerns an industry which, I think, all honourable members will agree has great potentialities in regard to the provision of employment in Australiaprobably our first consideration today - and the establishment overseas of a more favourable trade balance than that which now exists. In a recent debate, honourable members opposite expressed very grave concern at what they regarded as the unsatisfactory position of the trade balance, and Government members gave every indication of a desire to make the preservation of a satisfactory trade balance one of their foremost considerations.",32
101,Mr HOLLOWAY,NORFOLK ISLAND,B y a proper method.,32
102,Mr MCEWEN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"That is so. I suggest that something in the nature of a check upon the imports of tobacco would be a correct course to ,pnrsue. The latest figures published by the trade bulletin show that during the last five years no less than £4,560.000 of Australian money was sent to the United States of America, a country that practically declines to trade with us, for the purchase of tobacco, a commodity which we have demonstrated we are quite capable of producing.",32
103,Mr HOLLOWAY,NORFOLK ISLAND,"-Importe d same people who manufacture our leaf, and charge exorbitant prices for the tobacco.",32
104,Mr MCEWEN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"That is an interesting comment. This tobacco was imported be from a country which places every conceivable obstacle against the importation of anything that Australia produces. It declines to take from us a single lamb, a pound of butter, or a case of f r u it , and places an exorbitant duty upon our wool. It is known by everybody who has a knowledge of affairs, that even the latest representations to the United States of America to take a larger quantity of our produce were rejected with a3 little consideration as had been given to previous representations. Perusing the figures in the trade bulletin, I find that during the last five years Australia imported from the United States of America, goods to rhe value of £45,401,000, and that the United States of America, reciprocated by taking from us goods to the value of only £15,S34,000. In short, during that period we have experienced with the United States of America an adverse trade balance of practically £30,000,000, and that during a time when Australia was passing through the most severe trade depression it had ever experienced. It is upon the basis established by a recognition of these facts that I wish to approach the consideration of this matter. In view of those facts, one is perfectly justified in claiming that consideration should be givpn to it by all members on a non-party basis. In approaching the consideration of the well-being of an Australian industry with such vast potentialities for the provision of employment and the correction of an adverse trade balance with the United States of America, it would be entirely wrong for any honourable member to be biased by party sentiment. I do not intend to consider the matter on any basis other than that governed by the merits of the proposal before the committee, and the needs of the industry. My view is that there is rather more scope to give the necessary degree of preference to this industry through the medium of a greater difference in the differential excise duty than has been adopted by the Government, and at a by the later stage I intend to join with other members of the Country party in a move in that direction. The policy of a differential excise duty, which has been adopted during the last year, should be further extended for the greater benefit of the industry. But while my thoughts turn to the extension of the differential principle, I have no hesitation in supporting the proposal of the Deputy  It has additional merit in my eyes by reason of the fact that any loss of revenue in which the Government would be involved by a reduction of the excise, would be offset; increased revenue would be provided and the Government would be enabled later to extend greater preference to the industry by a further reduction of the excise without any real net loss of revenue. I should say that the degree of preference which the industry is enjoying today, and which it may enjoy, and any feelings we may have in the matter, do not represent the greatest obstacle to the present-day success of the industry. From my experience and observations there is not much doubt that the greatest handicap to the success of the industry at the moment is the number of diseases which are adversely affecting the quantity and quality of tobacco leaf grown. I would add to that the adverse seasonal conditions experienced by tobacco-growers, within recent years. As the honourable member for Indi (Mr Hutchinson) has said, the Government has voted to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research a considerable sum for the conduct of scientific investigations into the disease problems of this industry. I am glad to note that those investigations have been crowned with a very considerable measure of success. To-day, the principal enemy of the tobacco-growers-blue mould-has, I think we can safely say, been mastered in the seedling stage. While nothing has been done to solve the problem of blue, mould in the paddock, I think we may conclude that, while the seedlings remain in the seed-beds, the benzol treatment will prove completely successful."" I have little doubt that further investigations by this excellent body, with the plete co-ordination of the growers, will result in a sufficient mastery being obtained over the diseases which constitute the problem of the industry. I believe that we are within measurable distance of that desirable state of affairs. But we still have to deal with a major disability, in that in Australia today Mr MoEicen. there is only one really effective buyer for the Australian leaf. To-day that disability is inherent in the industry, and until the growers and the Government, in co-operation, are able to take some steps to offset it, there is little hope of the industry being established on a really stable basis. Although it scarcely comes within the scope of this debate, I express the hope that at no late date there will be co-ordination between the Government and the growers in the establishment of a marketing organization which will enable the growers to offset that very grave disability. A good deal has been said about the merits and demerits of the very high protective policy applied to the tobacco industry by the Scullin Government, but whatever may be said on that score, it ought to be recognized that whether the duties were wise or unwise, they were applied by a government elected by the people. It is not right that a subsequent government should, in those circumstances, deal an economic death-blow to the people who were encouraged to enter the tobacco industry by the previous government. If a subsequent government, felt that the protective policy had been carried to too great an extreme-and I will - confess that that is my thoughtthere should be a gradual retreat, but the industry should be afforded adequate protection to maintain itself during the period of re-adjustment to the new circumstances. The tobacco-growing industry is in dire need of adequate protection today, and will remain so until such time as the disastrous disabilities due to pests, and the unsatisfactory situation with regard to marketing, have been overcome. We had some interesting information given to us today, first by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan), and next by the honourable member for Hume. (Mr Collins), respecting growers com- who had produced a substantial quantity of leaf and placed it in the hands of a certain Queensland selling organization for disposal. It was shown that in one instance the growers had received a trifling return for their product and in another had actually been furnished with debit accounts. The view was expressed by the Minister and by other honourable gentlemen that that particular organization was by no means a "" clean potato "". One of the great disadvantages of the tobacco industry of Australia is that there is only one really effective buyer - of tobacco leaf. The direct effect of this has been referred to by several speakers during this debate. The buyers for this particular organization visit the homesteads of the growers, buy part of the - crop, and leave the remainder behind, - although it is often quite as satisfactory in quality and otherwise as the leaf that has been purchased. I have had authentic cases of this description brought under my notice. Growers have told me that a certain quantity of tobacco produced on a property under the share-fanning system has been divided equally between the two parties and placed in different barns. When the buyer has visited the - district he has, in certain instances, pur-chased the leaf in one barn, but told the - owners of the identical leaf in the other barn that it was of a quality and description not suitable to the requirements of the buying organization, notwithstanding that it was exactly similar to the leaf which the buyer had purchased from the - other share-farmer. Such a state of affairs opens the door for unscrupulous operators to carry on a business that might easily turn out disadvantageously to the growers. I can imagine the servants of such an organization coming along to growers who have been unable to sell their product and saying to them: "" If you cannot, sell your tobacco leaf, let us manufacture it for you and dispose of it and we will divide the proceeds "". That, on the surface of it , appears to be an attractive proposition to the growers, but if the buyers adopt unscrupulous methods, and after getting hold of the leaf dispose of it really to itself under another name, or to some other company acting in conjunction with it , it is easy to see how the growers may be left lamenting. A state of affairs such as I have outlined would dovetail into the story that has been told to us today. and the whole difficulty can be traced back to the fact that only one effective buyer of tobacco leaf is operating at present with in the Commonwealth. It is for this reason that I strongly urge the Government to do something to enable the growers to for m an organization to overcome the disability. The need for some Government assistance for the industry is readily disclosed by the comparison of the registered number of tobacco-growers in Australia today with that of a few years ago. I have not been able, myself, to obtain the exact number of growers in Australia last year, but the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Nock) said that there were 3,000 odd, and I have no doubt that his figures would be accurate. The number of registered growers in Australia on the 1st October, 1933, was 6,329.",32
105,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The official figures are 5,600.",34
106,Mr MCEWEN,NORFOLK ISLAND,Will the Minister inform me whether the figure mentioned by the honourable member for Riverina is correct ?,34
107,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The latest departmental figures are 4,388.",34
108,Mr THOMPSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,Many men registered as tobacco-growers are not now growing tobacco.,34
109,Mr MCEWEN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"That is a point which must be considered. Many persons who grew tobacco some years ago have retained their names on the register in order that they may be entitled to dispose of unsold leaf still on their hands. I do not think that any honourable member will dispute that within the last two or three years thousands of persons have been forced to sever their association with this industry, with the result that they have lost' hundreds of thousands of pounds in the aggregate. A few weeks ago I visited the Ovens Valley, and inspected numerous tobacco plantations near Myrtlefor d and the adjacent small towns along the Valley. I was greatly struck with the growth of these towns since my last visit to the Ovens Valley six years ago. I was assured that this growth had been due entirely to the increase of tobacco-growing in consequence of the tariff stimulus given to the industry a few years ago. A very great deal of hardship has been experienced in these towns and also in the surrounding districts due to the relapse of the industry since the reversal of the tariff policy of the Government. I believe that if honourable members generally would look at the proposal now put forward as one calculated to assist the industry, crease employment in it, and also contribute to the correction of our adverse trade-balance with the United States of America, they would agree to it.",34
110,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,A non-geographical outlook on it would also be useful.,35
111,Mr MCEWEN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The honourable member for Riverina quoted certain figures which I wish to review. He said that the eoncessions in customs and excise reductions to the tobacco industry recently amounted to about £360 for each grower or £80 to the acre cultivated for tobacco. Those figures may be worked out to disclose that result, but I do not think the honourable member took sufficient care in explaining to those people, who will most likely read his speech, that these concessions were not, as he described them, gifts to the growers, equivalent to £360 a grower, or £S0 an acre. Reductions of excise and tariff duties may assist the industry, but that assistance is not reflected to the extent suggested by the honourable member. The actual beneficial result to the individual grower, or to the industry, is very small compared with the figures quoted. Later, I intend to support a proposal for a further reduction of excise duty on tobacco, and gest that the Government, in anticipation of that proposal, may be very glad to avail itself of the additional revenue involved in the amendment now before the committee.",35
112,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.6] - As it has been before the Parliament since November, 3933, and it is time finality was reached in regard to it, the Government cannot agree to the postponement of this item. Honourable members have had ample opportunity to know whether the tobacco duties are adequate or not. It was rather interesting to hear the last speaker (Mr MCEwen). He represents a country district in Victoria, and I suppose he joins in the chorus for lower duties for secondary industries, and supports the Tariff Board in its findings. I may inform him that the Tariff Board considered that an import duty of 3s. was adequate on tobacco leaf, but the Government fixed it at 3s. 6d. because, at that time, revenue was required to proinvide relief to primary producers and regard was had for the undoubted difficulties of tobacco-growers. Fully aware of the distress which they had suffered, the Government has aided every section of primary producers by means of bounties and home-consumption prices and in other ways, and so far as secondary industries are concerned, they have been helped whilst ensuring that they were not given that degree of protection which would permit them had to exploit the consumers. Their requests for higher duties are submitted to the Tariff Board, and the rates of duties recommended by the Tariff Board have been in most cases accepted by the Government. Despite all these facts, some honourable members make a special plea for the tobacco-growers. I point out that these growers have had the benefit of extra protection as the result of the recent reduction by Sd. per lb. of the excise duty on Australian leaf used purely in Australian manufacture. With this concession the minimum protection is now about 220 per cent. How many secondary industries enjoy protection to that degree. I cannot understand the attitude of the I sug- honourable member for Echuca. One expects the Opposition to ask for the highest possible duties that can be imposed, and honourable members opposite are consistent in that advocacy, but it is quite illogical and wrong for honourable members to be actuated solely by agricultural or geographical considerations and to become, in effect, agricultural or geographical protectionists. Australia has to be developed as a whole. We cannot properly develop it by encouraging one industry to the neglect of another. Industries must be developed as a whole, the primary and secondary industries moving ahead hand in hand. Only by diverse production shall we achieve the greatest measure of prosperity and progress. We have, therefore, to look at this matter in its true perspective. I repeat that the duty proposed on tobacco is higher than that recommended by the Tariff Board. Furthermore, excise has been reduced on all Australian leaf, with the object of encouraging sales, and a further reduction of Is. 4d. per lb. has been made on the darkest grades of tobacco, which are sold to aborigines. The Government has also taken steps to assist the sale of some of the darker grades that were left on the hands of the growers. Honourable members have delved into the history of the tobacco tariff. After all, history is the best philosophy, and we should have regard to it, recent or ancient. I suggest that honourable members recall the regime of prohibitive tariffs, in the time of the Scullin Government, which imposed a duty of as. 2d. per lb. in favour of Australian tobacco. ""What was the result of such a policy ? It should give those who believe that prohibitive duties constitute the shortest road to prosperity a shocking example of the reaction of such policy. The Scullin tobacco tariff reacted most harshly upon growers with very little capital. Whether or not the members of that Government were aware of the fact, its policy encouraged land speculators. instance, land in Victoria, not worth 30s. an acre, was sold for tobacco-growing at £30 an acre under grandiose prospectuses issued by various promoters.",35
113,Mr FORDE,NORFOLK ISLAND,A similar development is taking place today in respect of goldmining.,36
114,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"That may be true, but the position which I have described actually arose as the result of the tariff policy of the Scullin Government, in which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Trade and Customs. I emphasize that point. That policy encouraged land speculators, and many men resident in the cities, with a little capital, were enticed to pay a deposit on a piece of laud which they could not afford to buy, and which would never become their own. On such land Oiey commenced growing tobacco which, as honourable members are aware, is one of the most difficult crops to cultivate. There was a tremendous increase of tobacco-growers in all the States of the Commonwealth. Men tried to grow tobacco from Cape Tork to Tasmania, and from the Leeuwin to Port Jackson. In 1928-29 the total number of tobacco-growers in Australia was 668; when the Scullin Government introduced its prohibitive duties-whic h were to pave an easy road to wealth-this number had increased to 2,990 in 1931, and 5,127 in 1932.",36
115,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,"-Hear , hear !",36
116,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Ye t the honourable member has just told us the sad story of what happened to these growers when they found that they had bought land which speculators had sold them at rates which would never allow them to own it. The present Government had to clear up this hereditas damnosa. The Government has had to look after these poor fellows, and help the industry in a reasonable way. It did not U3e pied-piper methods, and invite them to "" follow the Government to prosperity"". It amazes me that an otherwise intelligent member of this committee- I refer to the honourable member for Echuca - wh o knows the rights and wrongs of these things, should have allowed his For sentiment to be played upon to such an extent as to cause him to suggest that we should get back to the conditions of 1931. If that were done, and the duty raised to 5s. 2d. per lb., we might expect another rush to the land to grow tobacco and make a fortune in a day.",36
117,Mr MCEWEN,NORFOLK ISLAND,I did not suggest that.,36
118,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Not only does the honourable member want higher import duties, but he also wants the excise duty to be lowered. Let us see whether or not the industry today is better off than it was. Many of the growers of tobacco who, we are told, were forced off the land, had either insufficient knowledge of tobacco-growing or insufficient capital, or were trying to grow tobacco on unsuitable land, or have since returned to their normal occupations. Recently I visited Shepparton, in the electorate of Echuca. I do not wish unduly to pay attention to that electorate, or to its representative; I refer to the honourable member only because his attitude, unlike that of the Labour Opposition, is not consistent in urging higher rates of duties. It is anomalous that he should support the amendment. At Shepparton I was the guest, of the Chamber of Commerce. The tobacco-growers attended the gathering in - force, and asked a number of quesideas tions, which I answered, although not .always to their satisfaction. In converin sation with those present, I found that, in the days of the tobacco boom, many local business men had engaged in The tobacco-growing. They had grasped opportunity to make fortunes by plantreturning ing an acre or two with tobacco; but, having found the experiment unprofitable, they returned to their shops and other businesses. They are typical of tobacco-growers, who, the Opposition says, have been forced off the land by the ruthless and thoughtless policy of this Government.",36
119,Mr HUTCHINSON,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Many of them are better off in other industries. Mr WHITE,-That is so. In these more prosperous times, they have returned to their former avocations, and are Year.

It will be seen that, despite the action for which the Government has been criticized, and the fewer growers, the using of Australian leaf last year constituted a record. The reason is that the men who were inveigled into tobacco-growing have now returned to their usual occupations, and that those who still remain understand the business of tobacco-growing and curing, and are able to sell their product.",37
120,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,Do the figures for show an improvement over those for 1931?,37
121,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Yes ; there has been a gradual improvement. During 1931 the purchases of leaf were particularly heavy, because the Government of the day arranged for the purchase of the whole crop, so that the improvement longer being led by the will-of-the-wisp placed before them by egregious politicians. In case it is still thought that, some way, the tobacco-growers have suffered unduly, I shall quote figures relating to the importations of tobacco. quantity of leaf imported varies from the time to time. Of late, largely due to prosperity-and in prosperous times a man feels that he can smoke more than in times of depression-the importations have been large. More and more the Australian tobacco is being used, because the Government has not imposed excessively high rates of duty on tobacco, but has helped Australian growers to produce tobacco of better quality. When considering this subject, we should remember that quality, rather than quantity, should be the aim.

Each year arrangements have been made with the manufacturing companies to purchase the usable crop, but, of course, there has been leaf unsold, some because it has not been usable, and the remainder because seller and buyer could not agree as to price.",37
122,Mr MCEWEN,NORFOLK ISLAND,Some has been held over for maturation.,37
123,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,Yes . The figures which I have given to the House have been obtained from the manufacturing 1935 companies which pay the excise duty.,37
124,Mr MCEWEN,NORFOLK ISLAND,Do the figures include the sales of recently grown leaf?,37
125,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"This year all the tobacco of good quality will be sold, as indeed, has been the case ever since the present Government came into office. The subject mentioned by the honorover able member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) Las loomed rather larger than is justified, because it has no bearing on the present duties. It had not been brought under my notice before, because the communications were purely departmental. I have since searched the files and find that it was brought under the notice of the department by Senator Crawford, who submitted correspondence from Headricks Proprietary Limited, Queensland, stating that leaf had been sent to the Combined Growers and Tobacco Manufacturers Company Limited, - and that only a triflin g sum had been received for a large quantity of tobacco. Excise, which, of course, the manufacturer, not the grower, pays to the Government, was included in the charges.",37
126,Mr EIOKDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,The grower did pay it?,38
127,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The tobacco company paid the bill and charged the account io the grower. I do not propose to endeavour to minimize the shadiness of the whole deal, because I consider that the company acted most reprehensively. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",38
128,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,It was for that reason that I expressed my pleasure that the honourable member for Kennedy had mentioned the matter.,38
129,Mr RIORDAN,NORFOLK ISLAND,Is it not necessary for the company to obtain registration from the customs department?,38
130,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Yes , and the department will consider whether or not it is advisable to continue the registration. The committee should know, however, that the tobacco was sent to the company to be sold on a basis to which the grower had agreed. A f t e r freight, excise and other charges had been deducted, the grower was to receive the balance. According to the report of Headricks Proprietary Limited, which investigated this transaction, the leaf had been rejected on more than one occasion by buyers in the country, and later, failed to find a buyer at a Brisbane auction sale. Therefore it was virtually rhe last hope of the grower to consign the leaf to this company, and the for m which I previously mentioned was signed in connection with its disposal; for instance, deductions were to be made for leaf that had been injured. When the reduction of excise was made by the Government, I stated in this House that the manufacturers would be expected to pass on the reduction to consumers. For that reason it was made 8d., so that - Jd. an ounce at least would go to the consumers, but some trouble has been exCairns, perienced with this company. I can assure honourable members that this matter will be investigated, but I have mentioned, in extenuation of the company's action, that the tobacco was evidently left-over stuff that had been refused by buyers and at auction. An honourable member today attacked the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited. I do not propose to defend it ; it also is a trading company and should be quite capable of defending itself. But in view of the fact that it has been eulogized by the growers themselves, it is evident that the company, although termed a repacious octopus, gives a better deal to the growers than do certain other enterprises which profess to purchase only Australian-grown tobacco. The protection of the Australian leaf ranges from 220 per cent, ad valorem upwards, and even while the Roosevelt plan _ prices operated in 1934-35, the protection was equivalent to 138 per cent. In addition, in an endeavour to assist the growers to overcome cultural difficulties, the Commonwealth Government has made available a sum of £20,000 per annum for a period of five years. This money is being devoted to research into disease problems affecting tobacco, to tests of smoking quality and to field investigation and demonstrational and experimental work. Honourable members will be gratified to learn that this grant has been availed of and that in experiments that are being carried out in conjunction with State authorities the benzol treatment of seedlings gives promise of success. All bright leaf of good quality is assured of a ready and remunerative market in Australia. This year it has been sold at prices up to 4s. per lb. I do not say that this rate can always be obtained, but good bright leaf can always be sold at profitable prices. Most important of all, the percentage of bright leaf grown is increasing. ""When the 'Government assumed office the production was less than 30 per cent., and that is why the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson), who is such a champion of the growers, had cause to make so many complaints in regard to unsold leaf. I think that he will admit that in the district to which he referred, there was unfortunately in earlier times, a preponderance of dark tobacco. But today, bright leaf, including inferior bright leaf, forms 50 per cent, of the total Australian crop. This, in itself, is a vindication of the Government's policy for stabilizing the industry; the growers themselves are also acquiring more experience in the production of the better quality leaf. The success of the industry lies in the direction of producing a leaf of good quality, and if growers desire the industry to prosper, they must recognize this fact. The Government sincerely believes that its case is a good one. Consumption of Australian leaf is now greater than at any previous time; importations of tobacco leaf are considerably lower than in former years; scientific research and investigation are proceeding apace; prices for reasonably good leaf are profitable; prices for manufactured tobacco to the consumer are reasonable; and employment in the industry is safeguarded and the national revenue is assured.",38
131,Mr WARD,NORFOLK ISLAND,What is the standard of wages in the industry?,39
132,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"That is a matter for determination by the State and Federal Governments. Doubtless the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Holloway) can supply the honourable member with information on that matter. I now propose to furnish honourable members with a definite statement of the policy of the Government, which I think, should appeal to them - As various speakers have said, this matter should be non-political. The Government reported:-desires to help the tobacco industry and every measure will be taken to ensure the sale of all good quality leaf. Despite criticisms that have been made, the fact remains that all usable leaf has been bought since the first Lyons Government came into office. At certain periods trouble has been caused by pests, but leaf of good quality has been sold at remunerative prices which have been hundreds per cent, above world parity. It cannot be denied that crop infestation has been the biggest handicap to extended production. The Government will at all times give careful consideration to the production and consumption of tobacco in order to ensure that all usable leaf is absorbed. Whatever scheme or schemes may be adopted to ensure the consumption of any increased production of Australian leaf which may result from the successful control of blue mould, the Government must protect its revenue interest in tobacco. I am pleased to say that this principle has been endorsed by the growers' organizations. At present only about one-quarter of the quantity of tobacco smoked in the Commonwealth is grown here; but with the increasing use of the home product the Government will rearrange its taxation to keep up its revenues and protect the grower. A review of all of the developments in the tobacco-growing industry since 1932, and the action of the Government in insisting upon the purchase of leaf at reasonable prices, should satisfy honourable members, growers, and manufacturers of the Government's earnestness and sincerity in this matter.",39
133,Mr FORDE,NORFOLK ISLAND,Does the Minister still insist upon the sale of tobacco at what he would call a reasonable price?,39
134,Mr WHITE,NORFOLK ISLAND,"The Government endeavours to arrange that. The declarations which I have now made should allay any apprehension which growers or manufacturers may have had in regard to the sale and consumption of Australian leaf. Progress reported.

Tariff. mainly Increases .. 3 .. 7 which Tariff Decreases .. .. 9 7 since For the information of honourable members a summary of alterations setting out the immediate alterations of existing rates of duty consequent upon this resolution has been circulated. The rates under items 137, 139, 140, 144, and 151 have not been altered, but necessary alterations have been made to the verbiage of the items to include the metals concerned when plated, polished, or decorated. This is in consequence of the deletion of tariff item 146, covering metal plates, sheets, pipes, tubes, rods, bars, & c , plated, polished, or decorated. This alteration has been made on the recommendation of the Tariff Board, which considers that the present duties on unpolished metals under protective items should be sufficient to cover polishing costs if the plant established for this purpose is efficient. The amendments to these items should prove of particular help to Australian manufacturers of metal goods. In respect of item 1 7 9 (D ) (1) (c - motor s or machines for gearless l i - n o alteration has been made to the rates of duty, but the wording has been industry. altered to make clearer the intention of the Tariff Board that the duty should apply to the whole of the mechanism the gearless lift , and not merely motor. A further amendment to item 179 relates to electric human hair dryers treaties. of the pedestal type, which were formerly included in the same item as electric household floor polishers and household ironing machines, and which are now made subject to protective duties. Following on a second inquiry by the Tariff Board the protective duties roofing slates have been withdrawn, themselves. because the New South Wales quarry has gone out of production, and the South Australian quarry, the only other one in Australia, can produce only blue slates, which are unacceptable to builders. The demand for slates is confined replacement and extension of existing buildings, for which purple slates are required. Even with high protection for many years the South Australian assistance quarry has not been successful. Minor alterations are made, on Tariff Board inquiries, to the rates of duty on heat resisting glassware, item 2 5 0 (E ) , and fly papers, item 270. A new sub-item, item 3 3 2 (B ) (5 ) , is provided for flexible coupling discs to give effect to the Tariff Board's recommendations that the same rates as those on rubber manufactures, n.e.i., snould apply. The formula margin of preference agreed upon at Ottawa has been extended to item 389(c), fishing and rabbit nets and netting. Probably the most important item in the schedule is item 3 3 1 (B ) relating to rubber thread and elastic. The principal feature of the alterations is the imposition of a specific rate of duty on elastic less than one inch in width, in order to assist the local industry against the increasing competition it is experiencing from overseas. In the last item in the schedule-ite m 4 1 9 (G ) (1 ) - a n attempt has been made to protect the Australian manufacturer of dental chairs from the competition of the cheaper types of foreign chairs, ) (2) without unduly increasing the cost of the f t s higher priced imported chairs, which cause no detriment to the Australian As in the case of the proposals of the 28th November last an intermediate tariff of rate has been introduced to provide a to the convenient avenue for expressing the level of duties which the Government proposes should form the basis for trade The purpose of the customs tariff (exchange adjustment) proposals is to eliminate from the operation of the Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Act 1933-34, those items and part3 of items for which provision for exchange on fluctuations is now made in the items A new development has occurred in the manufacture of wireless valves, namely, the advent of the metal type valve. The purpose of the proposal is to allow the Australian manufacturer exemption to from excise duty on the metal type valve for a period until the experimental stage has beeu passed and the production is on a sound commercial basis. This to the local industry will , I am sure, meet with the approval of following honourable members. All duties in the schedules, whether increases or decreases, will operate from 9 a.m. tomorrow, with the exception of the intermediate tariff, which will not operate until some future date to be proclaimed. The proposals which I have just introduced will be discussed in conjunction with the proposals of November last. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT.

135,Mr CURTIN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"Fremantle) [3.43] In answer to a question which I asked today, the Treasurer (Mr Casey) said that it was the intention of the Government to invite an expert from Great B r it a in to advise the Ministry further in respect of national insurance. desire to place on record my utter dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Government is attempting to evade the responsibility it has incurred as a result of the promises made in the Prime Minister's policy speech at the. last election. Although a considerable period has elapsed since then, nothing has been done to honour those promises. The Government is, no doubt, anxious to retain some measure of respect for the promises it gave, and is now resorting to a series of shifts and devices in an effort to avoid giving effect to its promises. National insurance already has been investigated in Australia by a royal commission which furnished an in valuable report that, at the time of tabling, enabled, I should say, a reasonable picture to be visualized of the position of Australia, in respect of national insurance. No action was taken by the Govcrnmp.nt at that time, but the present Government has attempted to revive its prestige with the public by making frequent allusions to what it describes as its policy in this connection. Last year it had the benefit of the services of two highly competent actuaries who, the Treasurer (Mr Casey) has in formed me, have supplied answers to a series of questions submitted to them. The Government of Western Australia made available to the Commonwealth an actuary of great experience, who has been engaged at Canberra with the actuary of the Australian Mutua l Provident Society, who also has had long experience and is a most competent man. Those gentlemen finished their work some four months ago. Prior to the completion of their work, GUINEA: the Government decided that it would have a survey made of the European experience of national insurance, and informed this House that it had commissioned the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart), who was at that time Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Employment, to make this investigation. The honourable gentleman has completed his inquiries, and has furnished his report to the Government. All the data which any government anxious to do something in this matter needs is now available. A British expert can tell us nothing about the difficuties regarding national insurance in Australia, I which is not discoverable in this country by examination of the very voluminous literature available in respect of the British national insurance system. I have not the least doubt that Sir Frederick Stewart's survey included data concerning the working of the British system. The Government now , as the result 7 of consultation with honourable members, not in this chamber, but within the precincts of this House, and in order to allay their impatience as to the inaction of the Government, contemplates incurring additional expense. Investigations which have been made by Ministers and their staffs in regard to economic, trade and other questions outside Australia, during the last five years, have already cost this country about £50,000. and in addition, royal commissions set up in Australia have cost thousands more. To me it appears extraordinary that, no sooner has one report been tabled than the Government calmly proceeds to have a further investigation made by some other person regarding the report already before it . I object to this procedure as being unnecessary, costly, and extravagant. It cannot have any other motive than to staJemate action on matters on which the Government has pledged itself to act. I hope that wiser counsels will prevail, and that this matter will not be held up until' we get the benefit of any expert Great Britain is in a position to make available. It will be three months before the British expert can visit Australia. He will have to survey all the findings and data collected by the Commonwealth Government, and that will take some time.",45
136,Mr CASEY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,About an hour and a quarter.,46
137,Mr CURTIN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,An hour and a quarter! If all that is involved is that a British expert should visit Australia and make up his mind in an hour and a quarter,46
138,Mr CASEY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,That is the time that it will take him to read the available data.,46
139,Mr CURTIN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"Wel l then, post it to him and tell him to read it in Great Britain and to send a letter! That would be just effective as a survey here taking an hour and a quarter. One of the features of the conduct of Australian affairs by this Government and a similar government which preceded it some years ago, has been a desire to bring out to Australia advisers from overseas. The inability of the Treasurer to give me an effective answer as to. what action the Government proposes to take in regard to interest rates probably explains why Sir Ernest Harvey was brought from Great Britain to this country some years ago I see no occasion for bringing another British expert to Australia deal with our problem of national insurance. Statesmanship is not so bankrupt in this country, however deficient it may be on the treasury benches, as to be unable to formulate a system of national insurance if we are determined to formulate it. I object to the futile, vexatious, and delaying intentions of the Government, and also to its efforts to evade giving effect to the definite and decisive promises given at the election in 1934 that it would take steps to bring down a system of national insurance. Half of the life of this Parliament has gone, and we are no nearer having an outline of the Government's policy than we were when we first assembled. I object to the conduct which has marked the Government's handling of this matter.",46
140,Mr BAKER,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"Griffith) [3.54] - I cannot let pass this opportunity to refer to a subject of great importance and urgency. Two days ago I asked the Prime Minister what attitude was being taken by the Government regarding the sentence of death recently passed by ths Supreme Court of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea on a white man, one Ludwig Schmidt. I received the following reply from the right honourable gentleman this morning:On 18th March, the honourable member for Griffith asked me whether a sentence of death recently passed by a court in the Mandated Territory upon a white man named Ludwig Schmidt would be carried out. I then informed the honourable member that when a decision was arrived at it would be made known. I am now in a position to state that the Administrator ol New Guinea has reported that the sentence of death imposed on Ludwig Schmidt upon three separate counts of w i l f u l murder was confirmed on 19th March, and that the execution of the prisoner has been fixed for 25th March, 1930. The crime for which Schmidt h.is heen convicted was committed on the mainland of New Guinea in August, 1934, and at the time of the crime the accused wa3 one of a party consisting of himself and three other Europeans. Two of the other Europeans were sentenced to terms of imprisonment, one to a term of ten years on the charge of grievous assault, and the other to seven years on the charge of abduction with intent. The law of the Territory of New Guinea vests in the Supreme Court of the territory jurisdiction over all crimes and offences against the law. The High Court may grant leave to appeal to the High Court from any conviction or sentence of the Supreme Court of to the territory. In cases punishable with death, the carrying out of any capital sentence shall not take place without the sanction obtained under the hand and the seal of the Administrator. The law also empowers the Administrator to Temit any sentence imposed by a court exercising criminal jurisdiction in the territory and to commute any sentence of death and substitute there for a term of imprisonment. My object in bringing this matter forward is not with the intention of debating the justice or otherwise of the punishment inflicted, because the case has already been dealt with by a properly constituted judicial authority, and I trust that if any reference is made to it by honourable members that fact will be borne in mind. As Parliament is not' a judicial assembly matters of this nature cannot be considered as dispassionately as they would be in a court of law. I bring the matter forward because, since the inception of federation, no white man has ever suffered the death penalty under a federal law, whether a statute of the Commonwealth or an ordinance promulgated in the Territory of New Guinea or any other territory under the control of the Commonwealth. When the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) was Prime Minister, two residents of New Guinea were sentenced to death. each instance the Administrator was instructed by the Government not to give effect to the sentence; and in neither was the death sentence carried out. am not one of those who believe that punishment by death is a preventive, because it has been found that capital punishment is valueless when studied from that viewpoint.",46
141,Mr R GREEN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,It would prevent this man from committing any more crimes.,47
142,Mr BAKER,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"That is a particularly callous remark. It has been found that capital punishment is not, a deterrent. If the only desire is to prevent a repetition of such crimes, imprisonment for life should be quite sufficient. The old argument of those who support capital punishment is that it is the only way to prevent the repetition of certain crimes. In Great Britain, many years ago, over 100 felonies were punishable by death, and there are instances on record in which children between the ages of seven and nine years were executed. In such cases capital punishment was valueless. The Queensland government, in accordance with its policy, has abolished capital punishment, and in so doing has proved the inaccuracy of the contention that, if abolished, crimes for which death is the penalty would increase. Although capital punishment has been abolished in Queensland, there has not been an increase of the number of crimes committed. Another important phase of this subject is that, apparently by an oversight of this Parliament; full power is given to the administrators of these territories to deal with such matters. They possess powers which this Parliament, under the Constitution, cannot give to itself. In the instructions given to the Governor General under Letters Patent of the Commonwealth, we find the followingAnd we do hereby direct and enjoin that our said Governor General shall not pardon or reprieve any such offender without first receiving in capital cases the advice of the Executive Council for our said Commonwealth, and in other cases the advice of one, at least, of his Ministers; The Governor General's power to reprieve is thus limited, yet in the case of crimes committed in New Guinea or any In other territory under the control of the Commonwealth, this Parliament has by legislation deprived the Commonwealth case Government of the power to reprieve. I Under ordinances made in New Guinea and approved by this Parliament, the Administrator has full power. It was decided in the case Bex v. Bernasconi in 1915 that the laws of the Commonwealth did not include the laws of the territories. Evidently owing to an oversight of this Parliament the Administrator has full power in these matters, and therefore is able and has to decide whether this man shall suffer the full penalty of his offence. I am suggesting that the Government, if willing, should approach the Administrator who would certainly give very careful consideration to whatever advice it tendered. It is the duty of the Government to inquire fully into the matter. Even if it has not the power to reprieve it could give directions to the present Administrator, who, incidentally is an ex-member of this Parliament, and it is practically certain that its wishes would be respected. The sentence of death will be carried out on Wednesday next unless the Government inquires into the matter as it would have to do had the person concerned been a citizen of the Commonwealth. The Government should at least decide whether the sentence should or should not be carried out, and in doing so should give careful consideration to the fact that since the inception of Federation not one white man has ever suffered capital punishment for an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth or any ordinance of the Territory of New Guinea. If the sentence is carried out, it will be an unfortunate blot upon the fair name of the Commonwealth and its good record will be spoiled.",47
143,Mr MAKIN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"Hindmarsh) [4.2] - I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister in charge of War Service Homes (Mr Thorby) a case of hardship which merits more considerate action on the part of the Government than is indicated in the communications I have received from the Minister. I consider it undesirable to mention the name of the person concerned, but I am willin g to hand it to the Minister. I shall state the facts briefly and leave honourable members to determine whether they consider that the woman concerned does not deserve more sympathetic consideration. The case relates to the ownership and occupancy of a war service home in South Australia. The woman with her husband, who later deserted from her, was a joint owner of the home, and she has since secured a divorce. responsible for the maintenance of herself and the circumstances compel her to support the children. Up to last De'cember when this matter was administered by the State Bank of South Australia, which was acting as agents for the War Service Home Commission, she made an acceptable arrangement to pay 7s. 6d. a week, plus an amount of 10s. a month for rates while she occupied the home, but when the War Service Homes Department assumed control of war service homes in South Australia the weekly payment was increased from 7s. 6d. to 15s. She made endeavours to maintain the payments, but' as the total income into the home is only £1 18s. a week, she is unable to continue to do so, and at the same time, provide even the meanest comforts for the members of her family. The commission has adopted a very hard, and I feel, unwarranted, attitude in determining her occupancy of the home, because of her inability to maintain these heavy commitments. This week I received from the Minister in charge of War Service Homes, the following communication:. . . I desire to inform you that that lady is not eligible for assistance under the War Service Homes Act. I take it that the Minister means the leniency provisions of the act in respect of widows, but I maintain that this woman has a disability in actual fact equal to that of a woman whose husband has died. The letter continuesI understand that Mrs has divorced her husband who previously bad deserted her. The commission has extended, full assistance, but I regret (that the arrears cannot be permitted to accumulate further. Continued occupation cannot be given to Mrs. unless she pays the full rental value. In the circumstances, therefore, she has .been called upon to vacate the home, and I suggest that this action should bo taken. As there has been nothing in her behaviour to which exception could possibly be taken, and because she has made every attempt to meet her obligations, I consider that the commission has dealt very harshly with her case. She had the misfortune to make a bad choice in her selection of a life partner from whom she had to secure release, and now, because of her inability to discharge full y the added liabilit y imposed upon her, she is called upon to vacate her home. The She is Minister might very well give consideration to the application of the leniency provisions of the War Service Homes Act in this case. If that is not possible, surely arrangements could be made to revert to the original agreement entered into with the State Bank as agent for the War Service Homes Commission. I commend the case of this woman to the sympathetic consideration of the Minister in charge of War Service Homes.",47
144,Mr HOLLOWAY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"Melbourne Porte) [ 4 . 9 ] - I support the protest made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr C u r t in ). Among the people generally there is growing disappointment and disgust at the failure of the Government to honour its election promise to provide a scheme of national insurance. A very costly royal commission was set up by the Bruce-Page Government some years ago to inquire into this matter. A great deal of evidence taken by that commission must be still available in the Prime Minister's Department. Every year since then the Government has sent a tripartite delegation to the International Labour Conference and for the last ten years the question of national insurance has been discussed in some for m or other; sometimes only in passing, but at others as one of the leading items on the agenda paper. Surely it is not suggested that the expert from England will be able to supply t h p Treasurer, or the Government, with more information than has been compiled by the International Labour Office. The Australian delegate to the International Labour Conference,' who has recently returned to Australia made special inquiries into this subject. During the last ten years every volume issued by the International Labour Office has contained detailed information in respect of national schemes of social insurance. The English scheme has been fully dealt with in those publications. Only last week I received a voluminous report from the International Labour Office, containing in detail particulars of every scheme of national insurance adopted by the countries of the world. I am certain that the technical expert to be brought from England cannot simply more information than may be gleaned from that report. In all probability, that gentleman would, himself, have given evidence which appears in that report. The fear that the Government merely intends to postpone this question until the eve of an election is causing the growing discontent among the people of Australia. I was asked recently by a large deputation to urge the Government to consider the restoration of the 2s. cut still being made in invalid and old-age pensions. Commonwealth Public Service asociations have made representations that the cuts in their salaries should be restored. On every hand there is growing impatience at the failure of the Government to honour its promises. Certainly the pensions of soldiers' dependants are now paid in full, but the restoration involved only a small amount. The Government may deem it wise to make restorations involving only a small sum first; but Commonwealth Public Servants in receipt of low salaries were definitely promised that whenever the finances of the country would permit, they would be the first to have their cuts restored. The honoring of this promise would not involve a large sum. Yet nothing has been done. is now felt that the finances of the country have improved sufficiently during the last three years to warrant the full restoration of the cuts applied to salaries and social services during the period of financial emergency. During the last three or four years an average of £3,000,000 a year has been provided for the relief of primary .producers. No honourable member on this side of the House complains about that. I have not had an opportunity to examine the Mr Holloway. figures, but I think it can be safely said that during the last three or four years, remissions of taxation amounting to over £1,000,000 annually have been made to people who were not affected by the financial emergency legislation. But if during that same period the Government has remitted two or three millions of pounds more than would be required to make good its promises, the impatience of the pensioners and public servants is justified. It has been pointed out that all parties in this Parliament were unanimous that, at the first opportunity, the invalid and old-age pensions, and the salaries of public servants, would be restored to their former level. Remissions have been made of land., sales and income taxes, but these have benefited mostly the wealthy sections of the community. In addition, £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 has been given to the struggling primary producers in the form of subsidies and bounties, yet the only restoration of salaries and pensions has been a slight repayment to ex-soldiers' dependants, and a small increase of the salaries of public servants. No restoration, except the 6d. which automatically became due by reason of the increase of the cost of living, has been made to the invalid and old-age pensioners. Investigation into the subject of national insurance by a visitor from overseas, no matter how eminent an authority he may be, would be a sheer waste of time from the point of view of the public, though useful politically to the Government. The latest proposal of the Ministry is an insult to the intelligence of the experts whom we have in Australia.,, and who could well supply all the information required.",48
145,Mr MAHONEY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"Denison) [4.18] It Speaking in this chamber recently, the honourable member for ""Watson (Mr. Jennings) remarked that he had visited Hobart, and had found that apples of good quality were not obtainable there. He said he regretted that the people of Sydney could not secure good fruit from Tasmania. I do not believe that the honourable member intended to do an injury to my State. In the interests of the apple and pear industry in my State I point out that the best varieties are not available until after Easter. The State Government has appointed an officer to supervise tie distribution of the best fruit, and I believe that about 30,000 eases of Tasmanian apples are supplied to the Sydney market weekly when the season is in full operation. Tasmania can produce apples and pears at least equal in quality to those grown in New South Wales or any other State.",49
146,Mr CASEY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"Corio-Treasurer ) [4.20] - I did not have the privilege of hearing all the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), but I caught the general drift of them. The Government has not made any statement in public with regard to national insurance, although a report appeared in the press this morning purporting to give the result of a party meeting held yesterexpert day. This was a very brief account of what transpired. The Leader of the Opposition himself asked me a question this morning, and I replied that the Government would take into consideration a proposal that a leading British expert on the subject of national insurance should be invited to visit Australia. The Government has not yet considered the matter, but it will do so in the near future. The honourable gentleman treated the subject lightly, as though anybody with a reasonable amount of intelligence could prepare a national insurance scheme for Australia, and contended that, as we had already made careful investigation into the subject, further inquiries were unnecessary. I have the highest opinion of the ability of the Leader of the Opposition, and of some, at least, of the gentlemen whom he has the honour to lead, biit the introduction of a complete scheme is a matter the magnitude, importance and complexity of which I am afraid he does not quite appreciate. If such a proposal were put into operation, it would affect the social conditions of the 6,500,000 people in Australia. It would involve an attempt to give the average person security against all the ills against which he is not now able to insure himself.",50
147,Mr MAKIN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,Are there not men in Australia with sufficient brains for this task?,50
148,Mr CASEY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"I have no doubt that the honourable member considers that there are, but the problem of evolving a comsultation plete scheme means more than getting two actuaries, no matter, how clever they may be, to work on the subject for a few months. If I have any voice in the matter, I shall try to ensure that we get all the expert opinion that we possibly can, before Australia is committed to a scheme of this magnitude, and before a burden of many millions of pounds is placed on industry.",50
149,Mr HOLLOWAY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,The burden is already carried by industry.,50
150,Mr CASEY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"A complete scheme would involve a burden far heavier than that already borne. The Leader of the Opposition ignored the fact that, in the inauguration of the sales tax- a comparatively minor matter-the greatest that Canada could produce was invited to Australia, and rightly so, so that his advice might be obtained.",50
151,Mr CURTIN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,But no investigation had previously been made in this country on that subject.,50
152,Mr CASEY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"The royal commission made an investigation into certain phases of national insurance. Its inquiries were conducted ten years ago, and all the figures were entirely different then from those today. The Government would be justified in inviting any number of experts to come here, before it committed the country to such a scheme. We have reports on paper of what has been done in this direction in other countries, but we have not yet the information required on which a definite plan for Australia could be based. I am sure that, on reflection, the Leader of the Opposition will realise that he has made an error in raising this subject. I desire to inform honourable members that yesterday afternoon, the 19th March, after the representative of the German Government had submitted to the Council of the League of Nations the reasons for its action, the Council decided unanimously, the votes of the guaranteed powers not being counted, that there had been a breach of articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Peace, which refer to the demilitarized zone of the Bhineland. The Council has adjourned until today, when it will discuss future procedure. In the meantime the Locarno powers, other than Germany, are continuing their conwith a view to arriving at an agreement which will be acceptable to all parties. Prior to the vote of the Council, all State members submitted their views, and I give for the information of honourable members the view expressed by the Commonwealth Government representative, Mr Bruce.1 listened this morning with great attention to the very full statement which was made by. the German - representative. It has however, not altered my views as to the proper course which it is my duty to pursue in regard to the immediate issue that is before the Coimeil. That issue arises out of the Locarno agreements, to which some of us at this Council table were not parties. fact, however, does not mean that we have not a very great interest and a great responsibility in regard to the situation which has arisen. We have one immediate duty. That duty arises under article 4 of the Treaty of Locarno, which reads"" If one of the High Contracting Parties alleges that a violation of article 2 of the present treaty or a breach of articles 42 or 4.'! of the Treaty of Versailles has been, or is being, committed, shall bring the question at once before the Council of the League of Nations. soon as the Council of the League of Nations is satisfied that such violation nr breach has been committed it will notify its finding without delay to the powers signatory of the present treaty"". The governments of France and Belgium have brought to the notice of the Council of the League circumstances such as are contemplated in article 4, and the representative of France, on behalf of France and Belgium, has submitted a resolution, invitin<» the Council to declare that the German Government has committed a breach of article 43 of the Treaty of Versailles and of the Locarno Treaty. Upon that resolution it is now the duty of the Council to pronounce. On behalf of the Government of Australia, I declare that I propose to vote in favour nf the resolution. The duties of the Council, however, are not concluded by such a pronouncement, and the notification of the decision of the Council to the signatories of the Treaty of Locarno. A further duty is imposed on the Council, because the Treaty of Locarno was made part of the general system for the maintenance of security and world peace, which is the basis nf the Covenant of the League. Article 7 of the Treaty of Locarno stipulates""The present treaty which is designed to ensure the maintenance of peace and is in conformity with the Covenant of the League of Nations, shall not be interpreted as restricting the duty of the League to take whatever action may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of the world "". The issue which confronts us today is fundamental to the whole system that it has been the endeavour of the nations to create since the termination of the world war. Mr Casey. system is based on the scrupulous observance of treaties, and upon the fact that no power can free itself from the obligations it has undertaken by unilateral action. It is now for the powers primarily concerned to take counsel with a view to resolving the situation which now confronts us. During the period that must elapse while these important negotiations are proceeding it is essential that all the powers concerned should individually be prepared to make some contribution towards the maintenance of the situation until a satisfactory solution can be found. I am not without hope that such a measure of cooperation will be forthcoming. The statements made by the representatives of France and Belgium showed, under the most tryin g That conditions, n restraint and moderation that has impressed the world. In many speeches the German Chancellor has expressed his willingness and his desire to live in peace and friendship, and to co-operate in creating a true European solidarity. That sentiment was again reiterated on behalf of the German people by their representative this morning. Surely in this atmosphere it will be possible for a solution to be found. But behind the immediate issue which confronts us is the wide question of the whole system for it the maintenance of security and peace in the world. To the solution of that problem must As be addressed the minds not only of the Locarno powers of the State members of the League, but nf all nations. In the light of the experience of the years since the war, it is necessary that we should review the whole system of co-operation and common action fnr the maintenance of these great ideals. In this task it is the duty of the Council of the League to give a lead. Fundamental to such a system is the sanctity of treaties. Unless, as a result of that review, we can so strengthen the system as to ensure the f u l filment of its obligations by every nation, it is idle to persist in an ideal which engenders a sense of false security, and which creates incalculable dangers.",50
153,Mr THORBY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"Calare-Actin g Minister for Commerce) [4.30] - The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) has brought to my notice the complaint of a woman who had been occupying a war service home in South Australia. The facts associated with that case indicate that it is not within my power to do as the honourable member has suggested. Under the bill passed last year to amend the ""War Service Homes Act, the Minister is authorized to make certain concessions to widows or widowed mothers of war service homes purchasers and also to wives of returned soldier purchasers of war service homes who are permanently or temporarily insane.. There is ' no provision enabling the Minister to That give relief to a woman who has been deserted by her husband or has beeu divorced. Some line of demarcation must be drawn. This woman was deserted by her husband and then, I understand, she applied for a divorce which has been granted. Prior to the action for divorce she had been receiving certain concessions from the State Bank which had control of the home occupied by her. ""When the ""War Service Homes Commission took over her home, it made no alteration, until recently, in the conditions under which she was occupying it.",51
154,Mr MAKIN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,The conditions were altered in December last.,52
155,Mr THORBY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"I understand that is so. She was notified that she would bo required to vacate the house or pay the ordinary rental value of the property. But no adverse action has been taken against her; that is to say, no eviction order has been issued.",52
156,Mr MAKIN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,iHa s not the Minister discretionary power to permit the arrangement made by the State Bank to continue.,52
157,Mr THORBY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,No ; but in many cases I have been using my influence with the commission to restrain that body from taking drastic action.,52
158,Mr MAKIN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,This House would not object to the Minister's giving consideration to such cases.,52
159,Mr THORBY,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"I have been conferring with the Commissioner, urging that leniency be shown in all deserving cases, and I give the honourable member my assurance that what can be done in this case will be done. I am at a disadvantage in that I have no knowledge of the extent of the woman's family responsibilities, but I shall see if further assistance can be granted to her. Perhaps she will be willing to move into a cheaper house or to sub-let portion of the home which she is occupying, and thus obtain sufficient revenue to meet the demands made upon her. I give the honourable member my personal assurance that I shall give caref u l consideration to his representations.",52
160,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"Warringah-Minister for Defence) [4'.35] The honourable member for Griffith (Mr . Baker ) has referred to the sentence of death passed on a man named Ludwig Schmidt in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. The circumstances are much as he has described them. P u l l power is given to the Administrator to deal with a matter of this kind, under an ordinance passed in 1921, of which there has been no alteration by successive governments. This power was referred to in the New Guinea Act, passed in 1932, but no alteration of the procedure was then made. It is true that, according to the records, no white man has been executed in New Guinea during the period mentioned by the honourable member; but sentence of death was carried out in the case of two natives in December, 1932.",52
161,Mr R GREEN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,No white man has previously been sentenced to death in the mandated territory.,52
162,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T," Possibly that is the case. So far as the papers disclose, three charges of w i l f u l murder were laid against this man, and he was found guilty on the evidence of ten witnesses.",52

166,Mr R GREEN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,There is no jury system.,52
167,Mr ARCHDALEPARKHILL,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"H is Honor the Judge of the Supreme Court brought in the verdict of guilty against Schmidt. He stated that, on the evidence of ten native witnesses, he had no hesitation in finding the prisoner guilty.",52
168,Mr CURTIN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"It is a terrific penalty to have imposed on the judicial decision of one man, and is not in conformity with our practice.",52
169,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T," It is at variance with our practice. It appears that on different occasions discussions have taken place as to whether the practice should be varied, and no action in that direction has been taken, largely on account of the fact, of which cognizance should be taken, that Australia holds this territory under mandate and has to account for everything that it does not to its own administration but to other administrations. It seems to me that that fact is of some importance in a matter of this kind.",52
170,Mr BAKER,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"Eve n if the Government has not the power to interfere with the verdict, if it communicated with the Administrator I take it that he would carry out its instructions.",53
171,Mr AROHDALE PARKHILL,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"I listened to what the honourable member had to say regarding the practice of a Labour administration. Without doubting his word, I should like to inquiries made, because' I understand that the last administration merely requested the Administrator to report to the Government, and took no steps to alter his power or to interfere with his prerogatives in. this , regard. 1",53
172,Mr BAKER,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"I consulted the previous Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) and he stated that his Government had communicated with the Administrator on two occasions.",53
173,Mr R GREEN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"Thos e communications related to Papua, not to the mandated territory of New Guinea.",53
174,Mr AROHDALE PARKHILL,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"My mind is exercised by some slight doubt, because I have consulted one whom I regard as an almost equally good authority in the late Government, and the view expressed to me is that which I have stated. However, this is a matter which I think can easily be cleared up by a. further examination of the papers.",53
175,Mr OBRTIN,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"Meanwhile , will the Government defer the execution pending further inquiries?",53
176,Mr AROHDALE PARKHILL,DEATH SENTENCE ON LUDWIG SCHMID T,"The protection of the community has to be considered. The conditions in New Guinea are not the same as those that exist in Australia. I put it to the House, not cold-bloodedly, but as a simple fact, that we not only have a responsibility towards a man who commits the crime of wilful murder, but also have to ensure the safety of prospectors and other citizens of the territory, and to see to the maintenance of peaceful conditions and the preservation of law and order.",53

I cannot give offhand the undertaking asked for by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) r but I can. assure him and. the House that a meeting of Cabinet will be held before the date fixed for the execution, and it will investigate and consider the matterfully, just as it would if. sentence of death, were passed upon a person in Australia, with whom the Executive Council would have further have the power to deal.
