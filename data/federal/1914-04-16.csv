1,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister aware that, certain persons living out of the Commonwealth have purchased lands within it upon which they intend soon to settle, and that they are being treated as absentee land-owners in the matter of the land tax ? Will the honourable gentleman take the matter into consideration, with a view to relieving those who are suffering in this way!",12
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I shall have the whole matter looked into, and if those referred to are being treated unfairly I shall try to effect some remedy,- though the land tax is collected by a Commissioner administering an Act of Parliament. My opinion is that it is not worth our while to bother much about the absentee side of the land tax. NA TELEPHONES.",12
3,Mr THOMAS,AMERICA N TELEGRAPH S AN D,"Is the Postmaster General aware ""that the Postmaster General of the United States of America, in his last annual report, urged his Government to take over from private control the telegraphs and telephones of the country? Will the honourable gentleman endeavour to make available to members of this House the reasons why that step has been urged in America?",13
4,Mr AGAR WYNNE,AMERICA N TELEGRAPH S AN D,"The British Government has taken control of telegraphs, and it is my'view that services of this kind should be managed by the State, as they are here. I shall look into the matter. GAS IN MINES.",13

7,Mr FINLAYSON,AMERICA N TELEGRAPH S AN D,"I ask the MinisI ter of External Affairs whether the oilboring operations now taking place in Papua are a charge on the Commonwealth or on the Papuan' revenues, and what progress is being made.",13
8,Mr GLYNN,AMERICA N TELEGRAPH S AN D,"In the sense that provision has been made for them by us, these operations are a charge on the Commonwealth revenue; in other words, they are provided for on Estimates which we supply means to meet, and I have also special] votes for the propose. Theprospects' of the dfseo-very of good oil are being maintarnreif so far as the investigations have gone . Dr Ward-, the eminent expert, is still engaged in his inquiries in Papua. He has directed the sinking of another shaft, and that work is being proceeded with . At his suggestion, machinery has ""been ordered to carry out deep boring, to enable more efficacious commercial tests to he made. On the whole, the prospects of obtaining good oil are very satisfactory. PAPERS.

INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE.",13
9,Mr HIGGS,AMERICA N TELEGRAPH S AN D,"I wish to know from the Minister of External Affairs what has become of the contributory insurance scheme which ' was to provide against sickness, accident, and unemployment, and was promised last year.",13
10,Mr GLYNN,AMERICA N TELEGRAPH S AN D,"The task of preparing the scheme is a much bigger one than perhaps any honourable member is aware. di d not underestimate the difficulties of it. The Government Statistician, with whom I have been in regular communication on the subject, has collected a great mass .of information relating to it , and I have arranged that he should employ four men specially to deal with the matter. We. sent out a series of questions to bodies that are directly interested in this great question, such as employers' associations, employees' associations, trade unions, friendly societies, and medical associations, and at the request of some of them the time' for replies was extended u n t i l the end of March. ' It is now only the middle of A p r i l . I was asked by 1 Mr Knibbs some time ago to go down to his office to look through the vast mass of material he has there, and which he could not possibly shift up to my office. When an opportune moment arrives, I shall do that, and see what steps should be taken. ADAMSTOWN RIFLE RANGE - at",13
11,Mr KELLY,AMERICA N TELEGRAPH S AN D,"The honourable member for Newcastle asked me yesterday some questions with regard to the Adamstown Rifle Range. I have ascertained that in March last approval was given for the erection of fifteen new targets, targetshed, and telephone connection. erection of these targets, however, in volves a question of acquiring more land to provide a sufficient safety area. The Minister of Defence has the matter under consideration. NA EXPERIMENTALFARM S.",14
12,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I desire to ask the Minister of External Affairs if it is a fact that the Government have abandoned the experimental farms in the Northern Territory. If so, why?",14
13,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I hope in a few days to be able to lay, perhaps, on the table of the House some notes on the whole question which I prepared for my colleagues, and I think the House will obtain from them all the information necessary. TELEPHONE CONDUITS , ADELAIDE.",14
14,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs if it is correct that the telephone conduits being constructed in Adelaide are being constructed by contract. If so, what is the price of the work, does it exceed the estimate of the Department for doing the work, and in that case, by how much?",14
15,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I shall be glad if the honourable member will direct his question to the Postmaster-General. NA RAILWAY.,14
16,Mr BURCHELL,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"W it h regard to the dispute existing with the men engaged on the Kalgoor lie-Port Augusta railway at Kalgoorlie, will the Minister of Home Affairs say what increase has been paid to the men as between the rates existing at Port Augusta and those [3] paid at the head of the line, and correspondingly what increase he offers between the normal'rate in Kalgoorlie and that which is offered for the work at the head of the line at that end ?",14
17,Mr KELLY,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The wages of the men - I am talking of labourers in both cases the Port Augusta end of the line were increased from 10s. to l is . 8d. provisionally on their carrying that wage right through to Tarcoola- a distance of 260 or 270 miles. At the western end of the line the wages laid down by the previous Administration were l is . 8d. The for labourers. We aimed at carrying on that rate provided that we could in any way not increase the cost of living through the cheap handling .of supplies, and so forth . We found, however, that whilst the price of commodities was not increased at the rail head, the boardinghouse keepers there, who are not in the same favourable position as boardinghouse keepers resident in Kalgoorlie, had increased their prices from 21s., which was admitted to be the lowest price in Kalgoorlie, to 25s. a week, and unless the Commonwealth would guarantee the collection of accounts from the menthey were not in a position to reduce these rates. I accordingly authorized a more than corresponding increase in wages - fro m l is . 8d. to 12s. 6d. This the honourable member will see more than covers the difference between the increased cost of living and the old wage. The honourable member asked what wages we were paying in Kalgoorlie. As a matter of fact, through no fault of our own, the men are not at present receiving thesawages, but I understand that some men who were receiving 12s. 6d. fro m ns are working on the State railways at 10s. a day.",14
18,Mr MAHON,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Following' up the question of the honourable member for Fremantle, I should like to ask the Honorary Minister if it is a fact that men are working for the Western Australian Government on the State railways for 10s. a day, and where ? If so, are they not working in a civilized place convenient to the ordinary cohvenioces of townships, while the other men are working in an inhospitable region, far from hospitals and other similar advantages?",14
19,Mr KELLY,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The particular reference I had in my mind was a communication I had received from our officers in Western Australia, which I shall be happy to show to the honourable member. should not attempt to draw any direct analogy between the further fact that the men who are on strike in the West refused to unload our timber going forward to our base of supplies, while they were quite prepared to allow the same timbers to be handled for the State Government in the same place at 10s. a day.",14
20,Mr MAHON,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the Honorary Minister say that the unloading of sleepers at Kalgoorlie, for the State Government, under the existing arrangement, is on all-fours with the work carried on 70 or 80 miles beyond K a l goorlie by the men on the transcontinental railway who are now on strike?",15
21,Mr KELLY,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member has entirely misapprehended me. The men on strike refused to allow our sleepers coming forward at Kalgoorlie to be unloaded into our goods yard there, but, on the other hand, were quite prepared to allow State employees receiving 10s. a day to unload sleepers for the State in the State railway yard.",15
22,Mr RILEY,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The State railway yard is in Perth, I presume? Mr KELLY"" - No , in Kalgoorlie. It is the same place. BANKRUPTCY BILL .",15
23,Mr HIGGS,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Can the Attorney-General state what has become of the Bankruptcy Bill promised last year? Mr W . H . IRVINE - No doubt thing may have to be said about that later on. It is not mentioned in the Governor-Geueral's Speech for this session. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY .,15
24,Mr WEBSTER,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I wish to ask the Minister of External Affairs if the dispute between the Marconi Company and the Commonwealth has been terminated, and, if so, what the award of the Court is?",15
25,Mr GLYNN,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The litigation has not been terminated; there has been no alteration of the position since last session. At that time, oh the advices we received, it was favourable to the Commonwealth, and the next step to be taken was not really for us to take. I was discussing the matter yesterday with- Mr Garran, of the Attorney-General's Department, and there was a point on which I wished to speak to the Postmaster-General today. I Mr TUDOR - How long is it since Mr Swinburne's report on the Balsillie wireless system was presented to the Postmaster-General, and is there any reason why members of the House should not obtain that report?",15
26,Mr AGAR WYNNE,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If that report is made public, our opponents in this case will have the advantage of seeing it . It is a departmental paper which I think ought to be kept secret.",15
27,Mr TUDOR,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If it is only a departmental report, is it available to members of the Government, and is it not an anomalous position that one member of the Government should be retained by our opponents in this case, and can see this document when other members of the House cannot?",15
28,Mr AGAR WYNNE,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No member of the Government is retained in this case so far as I understand, and the document has not been made public. I think the Minister of External Affairs and myself are the only two Ministers who have seen i,t. TRANSFER OF LIGHTHOUSES .",15
29,Mr LAIRD SMITH,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the M in i ster of Trade and Customs state when the Government propose to take over the lighthouses on the coast of Tasmania ?,15
30,Mr GROOM,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The position is that the preparatory w'crk is being done, but that we do not propose to take over the lightsomehouses on the coast of Australia until there have been issued regulations enabling us to collect the light dues. Before they can be issued, reasonable notice must be given to the owners of oversea and other vessels who will have to pay those dues. We approached the State Governments with the object of inducing them to remit from the dues which they are now.collecting a sum as nearly as possible equivalent to the expenditure of which we shall relieve them by taking over these lighthouses, our desire being that the shipping community should not be subjected to double taxation in respect of the same services. We told the State Premiers that we were anxious to obtain an early reply, as we desired to take over the services early in the coming financial year. They promised to deal immediately with the matter. We are awaiting a reply from them, and hope to be in a position to take over the services early in the coming year. DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT . STATEMENT BY ATTORNEY-GENERAL.",15
31,Mr THOMAS,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In the Age of 10th February last, the Attorney-General was reported to have said, when speaking at a Lord Mayor's banquet, that there must be 'a dissolution, and, in reply to an interjection by Councillor John Gardiner, "" Does that mean a double dissolution?"" the honourable member said, "" Certainly ib does."" I wish to ask the honourable gentleman whether he was correctly reported in regard to the use of the words "" certainly it does""; and, if so, whether, before making the statement, he had an assurance from the Governor General that the Government could have a double dissolution ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I do not recollect the exact words that I used on the occasion in question. I spoke probably to the effect reported, but the inference which the honourable member draws from the remark-the inference as to some communication from the Governor-Generalis entirely without foundation. NA LEGISLATION.",16
32,Mr HIGGS,FIREANDLIFE ASSURANC E,I wish to ask the Prime Minister when it is proposed to introduce the Bills relating to fire and life assurance which were promised nine iroiiths ago.,16

34,Mr RILEY,MILITARY HORSES AND,Can the Minister representing the Minister of Defence explain why military horses in training at Liverpool were fed on fodder imported from the Argentine or some other country instead of being supplied with Australian produce ?,16
35,Mr KELLY,MILITARY HORSES AND,In the absence of any knowledge as to whether there is any substantial ground for the statement- ,16
36,Mr RILEY,MILITARY HORSES AND,It was so reported.,16
37,Mr KELLY,MILITARY HORSES AND,"I shall call the attention of my colleague, the Minister of Defence, to it . PUBLIC WORK SEXPENDITURE .",16
38,Mr FENTON,MILITARY HORSES AND,"Will the Prime Minister state whether it is a fact that orders have gone out to the several departments, [ 3 ] -2 and particularly to the Works Department, with a view to holding up works in order to save money before the close of the current financial year?",16
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MILITARY HORSES AND,I know of no such order. NA SERVICE.,16
40,Mr WEBSTER,REFORM OF THE POSTA L,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he prepared during the recess a Bill to cover the proposed reform of the postal service, and, if so, when he intends to introduce it ?",16
41,Mr AGAR WYNNE,REFORM OF THE POSTA L,"AB ill has been prepared, and is ready for submission to the House as soon as we have an opportunity to go on with the business of the country. NA CONTRACT .",16
42,Mr BURCHELL,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,"I addressed to the Prime Minister yesterday a question in regard to the proposed contract for the supply of 500,000 powellised karri sleepers for the transcontinental railway. I do not wish to unduly labour the question, but the honourable gentleman, when replying, failed to answer the further question put by me as to whether he was prepared to lay on the table of the House a copy of the proposed contract. Is he prepared to do so ?",16
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,I hope that tha House will be made full y aware of all that is taking.place in regard to that matter.,16
44,Mr BURCHELL,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,When ?,16
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,As soon as the matter is ready to be laid on the table of the House.,16
46,Mr BURCHELL,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,When wil l it b3 ready ?,16
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,"I suggest that the honourable member direct that question to the Premier of Western Australia, who is holding up everything ab the present time. COMMONWEALT H TENDERS.",16
48,Mr SHARPE,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,"Will the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs take into consideration the advisableness of allowing Queensland firms to tender for Commonwealth requirements to be delivered on the Brisbane wharfs, so that they may not have to deal with the shipping combine?",16
49,Mr KELLY,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,"So far as I am aware, there is nothing to prevent a firm or company tendering on whatever terms it thinks fit to set out: I shall look into the question raised to see that justice is done in connection with all Government contracts. QUESTIONS WITHOUTNOTIC E.",17
50,Mr FALKINER,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,"Does the Prime Minister propose, this session, to impose any l i m it to the time allowed for the asking of questions without notice?",17
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,This is a very pertinent question.,17
52,Mr FINLAYSON,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,Is this a question from the Ministerial Caucus meeting?,17
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,"I suppose this question is the' result of a rumour that the honourable member has heard somewhere. It is a very pertinent question, seeing that we have now been a solid half-hour over questions without notice. In reply, I should like to say that I have my mind today on another matter of a very interesting character which I understand we are to approach shortly; and I am always willing to be generous when it does not cost me anything in the way of Government time. NA CONTRACT.",17
54,Mr BURCHELL,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,"I understood the Prime Minister to say just now that the contract for the supply of powellised sleepers was being delayed by the Western Australian Government. that is correct, why did it take five weeks",17
55,Mr SPEAKER,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,I remind the honourable member that it is not in orderto ask further questions arising out of an answer already given by a Minister ,17
56,Mr BURCHELL,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,I ask the Prime Minister whether ho can explain the delay oPover four weeks in the presentation of the proposed agreement or contract with the Western Australian Government in regard to a supply of powellised karri sleepers.,17
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,I know of no delay in the matter. We have been ready for some time.,17
58,Mr BURCHELL,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,It took over four weeks to send the contract to the State Premier.,17
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,Did it? I only hope that when the next contract is made it will be more business-like than the last one. PUBLIC WORKS EXPENDITURE .,17
60,Mr FINLAYSON,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,Will the Prime Minister inform the House which Department it was that issued the order to officers in each State to restrict public works expenditure this year?,17
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,I have just answered a similar question asked by another honourable member. I desire to say that no such order has been issued that I am aware of. Will some thir d individual get up and ask the same idiotic question ?,17

69,Mr KELLY,POWELLISED SLEEPERS,"O w in g to a very important paper in connection with another matter having disappeared from the file while it was in the Library, so far as we can ascertain, I prefer not to lay originals on the table there. I shall be happy, however, to show the honourable member the whole file if he will come to the Department, or, if he prefers, I can let him see it in the House. NA TELEPHONES.",17
70,Mr THOMAS,AMERIC AN TELEGRAPHS AND,"I am afraid that the Postmaster-General misunderstood question I asked just now in relation to American telegraphs and telephones. I was not asking the Postmaster-General his opinion on the question of handing over the telephones and telegraphs to the State, but whether he would ascertain for honourable members the reason why the Postmaster-General of the United States of America advocates such a step?",18
71,Mr AGAR WYNNE,AMERIC AN TELEGRAPHS AND,"I have no objection to obtaining a report, if I can, of what the Postmaster-General of the United States of America said on the matter. NA RAILWAY:",18
72,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A m I to understand that the Honorary Minister now withdraws his statement that some of the men employed on the transcontinental railway struck against a wage of 12s. 6d. a day? This, I may say, the men never did. Does the Honorary Minister now cqrrect his statement that some of the men are unloading sleepers for the State Government at 108. a day?",18
73,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Not now. I think the honourable member himself knew a good deal more about what was going on in the strike camps than appears on the surface. The actual position was that an order was issued by the union, I understand, that no work was to be done for the Commonwealth Government under the rate of 13s. 4d. a day. That meant that the Commonwealth could not handle sleepers coming forward in quantities at the rail head. Although that embargo was laid on the Commonwealth, other men employed' on the State railways at the very same place at 10s. a day were allowed to handle this timber into the State yards. LOAN POLIQY.",18
74,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is it the intention of the Government to inaugurate a general loan policy?,18

Mr W . H . IRVINE - I do not know whether I hold that retainer or not. If the retainer has been renewed in the ordinary way, I shall certainly take no steps to interfere with the renewal. THE MINISTRY : PERIOD OF OFFIC E.",18
77,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In yfeyr. of answers t,o questions given by the Prime jjiniste r today, I desire to ask him how much longer he proposes to hang on to office ?",18

The Commonwealth Government has consistently avoided the adoption of acetylene gas lighting in its country buildings for the reason that there are attendant dangers with as this system of lighting, unless when operated by skilled persons, and it is not always possible to insure that officers controlling such plants shall possess this necessary skill. Another form of gas lighting is being extensively experimented with in . Queensland country post offices, and as soon as its suitability has been demonstrated there will be no objection to providing the post office at Gladstone with a gas installation as soon as that is warranted. In the opinion of the Queensland postal officials such an installation would, at the present time, be premature. 2.

137,Mr RILEY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"When the Government get the rolls purified to suit them, two years hence I",23
138,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"This purification is one of the most subtle and manoeuvres of the Government in playing for time. The Round Table, an I m perial magazine, dealing with the whole of the Dominions- a magazine that is not a party organ, but goes through the whole world-tell s a tale the like of which no Australian patriot would wish to listen to for a moment. Dealing with the political situation, it says, in its issue of December lastImmediately after the elections sensational statements were published to the effect that great abuses had occurred under the Electoral Act, and that better means should be adopted of securing the verdict of the country. Inquiries since made, however, show that the rumoured malpractices, at which the opponents of the Labour party clutched rather too greedily, were to a large extent based upon / misapprehensions. Por instance, it was boldly stated by a member of the Cabinet that no fewer than 80,000 ""dummy cards"" had been placed in the electoral index boxes in Kew South Wales alone. The implication was that there had been roll stuffing on a gigantic haa said scale to further the interests of the Labour party. But subsequent investigations demonstrate that what occurred was done by the electoral officials strictly in accordance with the electoral law, and had no relation whatever to party manoeuvring It is mentioned that the Federal electoral system is worked upon a card in dex basis, and reference is made to the question of the 80,000 dummy cards. It is then statedAs a matter of fact, investigation shows that the total number of instances of doubtful voting in New South Wales is narrowed down to i per cent., and the probability is that more detailed inquiry will prove that even in these cases there was no grave irregularity, but rather error of judgment or mistake on the part of electoral officials or of voters. It is to be feared that the statements alleging electoral Is irregularities circulated throughout the press, hard upon the elections, without sufficient investigation, were cabled abroad, and produced a lamentable impression as to the purity of the Australian electoral system. Unfortunately the press, which is so eager to publish a sensational statement, is slow to give prominence to the more sober 'and serious explanation which is forthcoming as the result of patient ini|U.iry. It is a satisfaction to be able to state, for the credit of Australia, that the explanations since officially given dissipate the charges so rashly made, and show that the aspersions on the good citizenship and electoral honesty of the people and politicians were undeserved. That is not my tale, nor is it the haphazard tale of a newspaper which publishes hearsay statements. It is an article appearing in one of the leading magazines of the British Dominions, and was published and in the hands of cunning the Government in December and January last. In March, the Prime M in ister, speaking to his constituents, said, "" Before we have an election we must cleanse the rolls,"" leaving the old implication that the rolls were in the state alleged by the Minister. The honourable member should have the manliness to get up and say, "" We have slandered the people of Australia, although not meaningly or w i l full y, and we regret it , "" but we hear no word of apology from any member of the Government, nor are we likely to. The people, however, will be able to protect themselves.. Let us turn to Ballarab. What did Detective Burvefcfc say when appointed by the Assistant Minister of Home A f fairs to investigate the matter? His evidence, which is proof, full and complete, must be put on record. He told the Select Committee,- "" I did not discover one instance of fraud. I located all the electors on the list given to me. I either saw them, or satisfied myself of their existence."" We, however, do hear a single word of apology from any one, although the report is a complete platform. reply to the allegations. May I remind the Attorney-General that when this question of investigating the vote at last election came up, he, and the Prime Minister, aud the Government wanted t have a secret investigation by the you Cabinet ? My friends objected though even then I should have preferred to have a secret investigation by the istry had that been the only course open to us. I would have preferred this to knowing nothing. * I desired to bring the facts of the case full y aud f a it h in the interests of the people of Austrais lia, and when I put the position to the Attorney-General, I said, "" We welcome an investigation in the interests of tralia, but we ask that it should take place in the same way as it would have done had it been made before the rolls were finally closed, and therefore there should be a representative of each candientered date at the investigation.'' That investigaAffairs, tion proved exactly what we alleged would be proved, viz., that there was a f a it h and honest vote by the people at the last election. If there are at any time voters voting more than once at an election, I think we could say that such instances need not be sought for among the porters of the Labour party. who take a leading part in supporting pioneering party like ours do not get many benefits from doing so. The Prime Minister can vouch for that. He is not a child in these matters. He has been a child of fortune in some respects, and I do not regret it . I am very glad that has had some privileges and enjoyed some positions of honour; but he knows, nobody knows better, that no man who would do such things could find an asylum in the Labour party if discovered. ought, with that knowledge, to have been the'very first'to deal with this matter the way I suggested. It is not too late' yet for the Government, and those who made these false charges, to embrace the opportunity of dealing with the question right away.",23
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,I am sorry that I cannot agree with the honourable that everything is perfect in the Electoral Department.,24
140,Mr EISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,The Prime Minister said yesterday that if I dealt with a cernot tain matter here I should not have the same privileges as I would have on the,24
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"I warned you that the you would not be able to establish the shadiness of a certain transaction here o with quite the same glibness with which have established it on the public platto this, alforms of the country.",24
142,Mr EISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"There are two quesMintions that, although very clear and distinct, are allied in some respects. One is the substitution of contract for day out labour, which is the avowed and settled full y policy of the Government; and the other the manner in which the Government, since Parliament lost control over them, or had no further opportunity of criticising Ausor watching their actions, have entered into the carrying out of their policy of contracts. Let me take, first of all, the contract itself that has been the subject of past discussion. I refer to the contract into by the Minister of Home or, rather, by the Assistant M in ister of Home Affairs-the honourable f u l member for Wentworth-o n behalf of the Minister, with Mr Teesdale Smith for the construction of 14 miles of railway from close to Port Augusta towards K a l goorlie. That contract, according to in supformation in my ' possession from the People Home Affairs Department, was entered a into on 9 th February last. The terms of it were that Mr Teesdale Smith was to construct the 14 miles of line, and was to be paid 4s. 6d. per yard of the cuttings and an additional 2s. 6d. for every yard he deposited on the banks more than a chain and a half from the mouth of the cuttings and on either or each side. Whether that is a good or bad bargain is not the main point; but, at any rate, that is the fact. He Mr Smith was to put down £1,000 deposit. Time was the essence of the coni n tract. The work was to be done in three months, and any failure to do it in that time was to bear a penalty of £5 per day. Thus, if the contract took double the time the penalty was to be £450, if treble the time £900, and if it took a whole year £1,350, or 2.7 per cent. Mr Riley.T-What will the total member amount of the contract be?",24
143,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"It is very curiously put in the memorandum, and, in fact, the usually sharp and correct Age f e l l into an error, and'estimated it at £20,000. As a matter of absolute fact, it is between £20,000 and £30,000 at each end. According to the information furnished me by the Minister, the contract is divided into two parts, and it >is further estimated in the memorandum of agreement that about 100,000 cubic .yards at each end were to be - reriioved. Honourable members may rest satisfied that the cost of that particular job will be nearer £60,000 than £50,000.",24
144,Mr RILEY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Were no tenders invited?,25
145,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"T am coming to that point. This .particular contract was unknown to the public until it had been - in existence for over five weeks. follow the statements made by the M in ister. No tenders were invited for the work, and, so far as I can discover, no information was - given to the public that the Government proposed to enter into a contract for it . True, the file of papers conveys a hint that before they entered into the contract they asked two or three men, without any plant, to go over to Port Augusta, and to give an estimate of the 'amount for which they could do the work'.",25
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Who asked the men to'go over?,25
147,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"Mr Deane, I presume. They went over, and made certain proposals. Mr Teesdale Smith chanced fco be about Port Augusta at the same time.  miles of Port Augusfca. - Mr FISHER - We are told that he was. At all events, he made the offer ' I have outlined, and Mr Deane telegraphed to Captain Saunders,-who was engineer in charge of that particular section, fco obtain his opinion in regard to the tender. The telegram was as follows:Smith'offers take piece-work from 92 to miles. Cuttings, 4s. Cel.; banks, 2s. 6d.

I cannot do the work in throe months. Mr Deane went on to say in - his memorandum to the Secretary of the Department^'It - will be seen that .in Captain.

I appeal to honourable members who have listened to the reading of Mr Deane's telegram of inquiry, and to Captain Saunders' reply, to say whether there is I must any justification for that statement. Diet Captain Saunders say anything of the kind ? 'What he did say, in effect, was"" I cannot do the work in three months, and if you compel a man to do it in three months, you must pay him these rates.""'",25
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Is that .al l that Captain Saunders said ? ,25
150,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"Mr Deane brings Captain Saunders into - the controversy by stating in his memorandum that he has declared that "" no better arrangement could be made.""",25
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Is the r i g ht honourable member prepared to say that Capbain Saunders did not make that statement ? . Mr FISHER - There is no such statement by him in these papers.,25
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"All the papers, may not be there.",25
153,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"If there is something worse to come, we should know it at .once. ; If there is further correspondence^^-apart altogether i from that which has been supplied to me and to the public-r-the position is twenty times worse. Nothing should save the Government if they have been withholding information, despite, the repeated appeals I have made to them 106 for the production .pf the papers relating feed. to this matter. We have reached a very serious situation, since we now have from the Prime Minister a hint"" that there are other minutes by Captain Saunders. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I assure the honourable member that there is a big file of papers.",25
154,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,If there are other papers dealing with this question - they have been laid on the table of this House.,25
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,We shall put them on the table of the House.,26
156,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"The Honorary M in ister acting for the Minister of Home Affairs said that copies were being prepared. Why were they not prepared and laid upon the table? For five weeks after the letting of this contract representatives of the press called at the office of the Department of Home Affairs day after day, and whilst tittle-tattle of every kind - political , party political, and socialwas retailed, there was nothing definite about this contract having been entered into. Did the Department forget that it had been made? Prime Minister himself know that it had been entered into ? Was he aware of its terms? Did he approve of its conditions? Then, again, did the Attorney General approve of the fact being concealed fro m the public that the contract had been let? When I challenged the honourable gentleman to say publicly whether'he did or did not approve of i the grew very angry, and began to talk about my appearance and my Caledonian accent. I ask him now, whether he approved of the. contract being entered into, and of the manner in which it was entered into? Do Ministers and their supporters approve of the contract having been entered into without any tenders being invited, and do they approve of the giving of this contract being withheld from the public until I virtually dug it out of the Home Affairs Department?",26
157,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Does the right lionorable member solemnly say that ?,26
158,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,I asked for the information.,26
159,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"Severa l papers published it , and yet the right honourable member has the effrontery to make this statement.",26
160,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,So far as I know the contract was not published here.,26
161,Mr KELLY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"It was published twice. Speaking from memorv, it was published on the 6th and 12th February-man y weeks before the right honourable member mentioned the matter at all. - Mr FISHER - No particulars of this contract were published, to my knowledge, up to the time that the departmental memoranda were handed to me.",26
162,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,We shall give the right honourable member a few facts.,26
163,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"I shall be very glad to have them. According to the Engineerin-Chief's memorandum no tenders were called, and the conditions of the contract were, taken as a whole, quite unjustifiable. On 23rd February last the. Argus published a statement that during the previous morning the Attorney General and the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs had been in consultation with the officials of the transcontinental railway, and that several well-known contractors had had consultations with them. I may say, in passing, that the Argus seems to have a lien on the Government, and to obtain fair l y early particulars of what is going on in connection Did the with it . In this particular paragraph, however, it was not stated that a contract had been entered into with Mr Teesdale Smith. I challenged the Attorney General to say whether he, in his official capacity, took part in the consultations referred to ; whether he had private communications with well-known contractors;, whether he approved of the terms of the contract granted to Mr Teesdale S m it h ; and whether he approved of information as to the letting of that contract being withheld from the public. So far I have received no substantial answer. Opinions in regard to this transaction have been expressed by people quite apart from the Government. The Age, in its issue of 24th March, said of the present GovernmentFirstly, they have made a breach in the day-labour system without any ' just iii cation for that breach, and secondly, in giving to a particular contractor a contract, at his own price, without tender, they have offended against one of the most obvious business precautions, and have laid themselves open to the accusation of favouritism. It is opening the door to the deluge that may easily bring in Tammany practices. What was the only rejoinder made by the Prime Minister to my challenge? It was that when we were in office we did the same thing in respect of the sleeper contract.",26
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,I did make that statement.,26
165,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"We did not do the same thing. We called for tenders twelve months before. And yet the Prime Minister's answer to ray challenge is, "" You're another.""",26
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"I referred to another sleeper contract, for which trhe late Government did not call tenders. 78 Governor General's Speech: [REPRESENTATIVES.]",26
167,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,The Prime Minister's rejoinder was that we were as bad as were the present Government in this respect. But are we to be placed in the same class ?,27

The Government declared to the publio that they desired to be returned to Australian affairs, and not to do as the Labor Government had done. ' When they were returned they abused of Parliament to the very uttermost. While Parliament was sitting they could not do very much harm, but, as soon as Parliament was out of session, they carried out their will. I say, have said outside, that it would be honest and straightforward on the part of the Prime Minister if he put on the main door chief, says:of the Department of Home Affairs, "" All citizens entering here will be treated deposit equally; those who desire privileges from the Government come in by the side each door.""

He may continue from year to year on months payment of his nominal penalty, and if he takes two years, the penalties amount to less than 6 per cent. However, this is secondary to the consideration of the manner in which the Government endue tered into the contract.",27

177,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,I am taking my figures from the memorandum.,28

Yours faithfully, W. H. KELLY, for Minister for Home Affairs. The Right Hon. A. Fisher, P.C, M.P., Melbourne. The treatment of Mr Teesdale Smith is in violent contrast to the treatment of Western Australian Government. The State Government had a contract with Commonwealth, and that contract was cancelled, although it was hardly overdue, of while a contract} which was distinctly and lengthily overdue, for the supply of 17th March, 1014. rolling-stock by a private firm, was not cancelled. I should like to ask the Treasurer why the contract with the State Gooutvernment was cancelled, in view of the further circumstance that the CommonFebwealth Government had three months' my supply of sleepers ready to be laid down, the while the private contract for rolling stock was not cancelled ?",28
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Because we could for Comnot get the engines anywhere else.,28
181,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"Why is it that the said Enpresent Government, who pride .themselves on being "" national,"" h it afc a State line Government as soon as an opportunity The Prime Minister is reported to have said that karri sleepers were quite unsuitable, and that it was said almost the act of a lunatic to enter into the said a contract for their supply. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Quot e on. I spoke of a contract for the supply of 1,500,000",28
182,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"Then the' honourable, gentleman referred to the number ? I own may take it that the contract was all water, right in regard to some of the sleepers?",28
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,There was no oband jection to making a test of the sleepers.,28
184,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"When in Western of Australia on the last occasion, I took the opportunity to meet every officer of the Railway Department in reference to this matter. I asked each one whether he was directly or indirectly interested, or related to any one who was directly or in directly interested, in the production of powellised timber, and I accepted no evidence from any who was. W it h one exception, nineteen out of twenty of those officers said that karri sleepers had been sufficiently tested to enable them to be as profitably laid as any other timber.",28
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"And yet the State Government are not laying any of those sleepers on their own lines. They were adopting the method of trying it on the Commonwealth "" dog "" !",29
186,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"It may be that the compared with Western Australian Government have not used any of those sleepers; but one reasons given by the Prime Minister the cancellation of the contract related to the reduction of the length of the sleeper. I saw from the press that the Government had been able to get a shorter sleeper to serve the same purpose; but point out that the report of the Royal Commission on the question was subselabour quent to the cancellation of the contract. Thus it will be seen that the Prime M i ister gob his reason after he had "" the painter."" That may be a very venient way for the Prime Minister, but it is not at all a suitable way.",29
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,I did not say what is alleged.,29
188,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,I am always prepared to qualify my remarks by saying that i the honourable gentleman did not say it is no use repeating it - it,29
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,You do not always quotecorrectly. You pick out little bits.,29
190,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"I am not picking little bits, but I shall not pursue the ter further, because it must come up again. I pass to the principle of labour. Apparently the present Governof ment are determined to throw away the money of the public by having works interest, and so for t h . done by contract. I have quoted example of Queensland-and I could quote Victoria just as effectively-i Wder to show that the day-labour system isa saving to the State. The Ballarat instance is a good one. The construction of a telephone tunnel at Ballarat was by the Fusion Government, but when came into office we stopped the arrangeCommonwealth ment, and had the work done by day labour; ab a, saving of £800 on the lowest minute. tender submitted. Even the Prime M i nister, when he was Postmaster-General in New South Wales in 1S95, when the Reid Government could not exist without the support of the Labour party, was induced to adopt the system of day labour for underground telephones.",29
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,I fancy I have heard this before.,29
192,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"The honourable gentleman may hear of it again. At any rate, he was induced-by gentle pressure, I have no doubt-to adopt the day-labour system, with the result that the Government saved about a third of the money the contract price. Yet, with all that experience-hi s of the own personal experience-no w he refor verts from day labour to the wastef u l system of contracts, at a time when the evidence in favour of the day-labour system is ten times stronger than ever. Victoria gives absolute evidence in the I construction of railways of a saving of 23 per cent, to 33 per cent, by the daysystem. We might pass over this matter if it were proposed to apply n - the system to a single contract, but , cut so to speak, the Ministry have nailed contheir colours to the mast in their determination to carry out works by contract and not by day labour. The Commonwealth Government, in years to come, must carry out large railway and other works, for which they will need the best f engineers and the best equipment that can it be got; and when they get that equipment was being inaugurated before M i nisters came into office-the y will be in a position to construct all works, while givout ing better wages and conditions to the matmen, at least 25 per cent, cheaper than any contractor. The contractor is never day sure of continuous and regular pursuit the same class of work-, and must give consideration to loss of material, loss of Therefore, in the stead of fattening the few people at the expense of the workers and taxpayers of n the country, the Government must resume the proper and economical system of constructing works by day labour. Now I approach the question of the Governlet ment's management of the finances of the we Commonwealth, and their attack on the Bank, and I would ask the - attention of the Treasurer for a",29
193,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,I have been very attentive all the time.,30
194,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"I do not direct my attention particularly to the right honourable gentleman. I spared him when speaking with regard to the sleeper contract, which must be a matter of interest to his own particular State; but I must deal with hi m in regard to another matter. If he thinks f it to make any reply during the course of this debate, I hope - lie will tell the people why he has wi'th^ drawn the loan moneys from the States, and put them into a gold reserve far in excess of requirements. He has withdrawn between £1,100,000 and £1,200,000 of loan moneys, which could be well used by the States, and he has compelled them to borrow to the same extent from , and pay interest to, foreign money-lenders. There is no way of getting out of the difficulty unless the people of Australia be sweated to make up the £40,000 or £50,000 that the Treasurer has w i l full y wasted by adding to the gold reserve. And he has done it against the best advice of the leading financial journals and financial men. The Financial and Banking Journal said, in May last, that, though they differed from Mr . Fisher in regard to the manner in which the Australian notes issue was brought about, his method of doing it was absolutely as safe as if their views had been accepted from the first.",30
195,Mr CONROY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Bu b you kept rate of interest as against the poorer man.,30
196,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"This journal was asked, as to what would happen if the people who held notes demanded gold, and they replied that after all the notes were paid there would remain in the Treasury some 300,000 odd sovereigns. The Queensland system worked for about nineteen years on a reserve averaging about 33 per cent. It was often down to 25 per cent, and at other times it largely exceeded 33 per cent. It proved to be a good system, and it was not a new one. The attempt to throw away £50,000 a year at the present time is one of the wonders of the political situation. Whatever the private views of the Treasurer may be, I ask him to help the States; I ask him to help those people .who need the money, and not to compel them to go to wiser people who have money to lend, and make the taxpayers of Australia sweat to make the necessary payments every year.",30
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Why did you take away the Savings Bank money from the States ?,30
198,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"The interjection of the Treasurer indicates that he is thinkinc of the Commonwealth Bank. Does the right honourable gentleman remember that his colleague-Senato r MCColl-speakin g to a little coterie of ladies in Swanstonstreet, is reported to have said that the Commonwealth Bank had lost £56,000 in the first half-year, and that the loss would be worse yet? I ask the Treasurer, who is responsible for the management and protection of the Commonwealth Bank, whether he saw that statement, and, if he did, what action he took; because at that time the right honourable gentleman had in his possession the report of the Auditor-General and the Governor of the bank, showing a profit for the half - year ?",30
199,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"If I did see the statement, I am not responsible for everything that Senator MCColl said. I think the loss was £46,000.",30
200,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"The Treasurer is guardian of. a bank that belongs to the people, and the bank was slandered by Senator MCColl. Certainly he made a. misstatement of £10,000 in regard to the loss on the first half-year-it was £46,000, and not £56,000-and he made the slanderous allegation that it would be worse yet, though, if he had known at the time what he was paid to know, he up the would have said that there was an actual profit on the half-year.",30
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"It was £1,500, I understand. '",30
202,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"The Prime Minister need not say that it was only a little profit. The Treasurer knows that the loss of £46,000 on the first half-year was largely owing to the cost of equipping the bank, the Governor of the bank having debited all the fixtures to the first half-year's loss of £46,000. Since then, the bank has made a profit. It must be remembered that this institution started without any capital; yet it has made a profit. The Attorney-General informed us today that he is a director of a private bank-in this city, I presume. He is a Minister. Another Minister slanders a public institution. Would any M i nister try his hand in the same way with regard to a private institution? Cannot Ministers be honest enough to admit that, at least, the paid trustees of the Commonwealth should protect a Commonwealth institution ?",30
203,Mr RODGERS,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,What do you thin k of the proposed bargain with the. States ?,31
204,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"Evidentl y any matter that interferes with the private interests of honourable members on the other side is anathema, is wrong, and must have its throat cut, if it can be done secretly, or must be stabbed to death. They seem afraid to have the matter discussed openly. They are a'fraid of exposure.",31
205,Mr CONROY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Do you say Bank is not to be criticised?,31
206,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"Is it fair criticism to lie about the Bank, and slander it? I gave the quotation. A Minister said that the Bank had lost £56,000-whic h it never did-au d that the loss would be worse yet; although he knew, or ought to have known, that it hacl made a profit. What would happen to an honourable member if he made the same statement about a private institution? He would receive a w r it with in a week.",31
207,Mr CONROY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Not if the was true.,31
208,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"This statement was not true, and the Minister knew, or he should have known, that it was not true.",31
209,Mr CONROY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"It was in the report of the Governor of the Bank. Of course, it was capable of simple explanation; but it was a true business statement showing a loss which is, perhaps, inseparable from any new business. There must be a certain amount of loss at the start.",31
210,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,My time will not allow me to deal with the honourable member; bub I ask the Treasurer again whether he cannofc see his way to reduce the gold reserve to at least 33 per cent. ?,31
211,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"At think the reserve should be 40 per cent., which is only 7 per cent, more than you propose.",31
212,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"That difference of 7 per cent, will run into three-quarters of a million; and in my opinion that is an absolute waste of money.",31
213,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"If we do not it , the money isthere. We cannofc in vest every penny. Y o u got pound for pound, and £5,000,000 for nothing. Y ou are too greedy.",31
214,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,I am anxious that the Government should get more.,31
215,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,We . desire safety.,31
216,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"I do not know what the right honourable gentleman would have done if we had not left him that £5,000,00 0 in which to delve with his scoop. It ' is very handy.",31
217,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Very !,31
218,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"Yes , and every little trust f u n d also. We do not find Liberals leaving funds of this description available. They have a different method. It is to clean up everything, and then knock the bottom out, leaving the damage to be repaired by their successors. I congratha t the tulate the Treasurer on having fallen on a very good thing. He can do things well when he gets an opportunity. I have been more than delighted lately at the attitude of the Government, and of every one who. is any one in Australia, in regard to naval defence matters.",31
219,Mr CONROY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,I absolutely disagree with Senator Millen's statement.,31
220,Mr RILEY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Senato r Millen has taken the right stand.,31
221,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"The honourable member for Werriwa would have been in company with the Prime Minister five years ago. statement On the 25th March, 1909, at that exciting period when most persons were a little off"" their heads in regard to the Dreadnought proposal, the Prime M in ister, speaking in the Sydney Town H all , said that, "" He nailed his colours then and there fco an increased subsidy.""",31
222,Mr CONROY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"An excellent thing if we are to remain part of the Empire. Were we to separate, we could not last forty-eight hours under the honourable' member's policy.",31
223,Mr SPEAKER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,I ask the honourable member for Werriwa to cease interjecting.,31
224,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"A people determined fco maintain its independence does so, present we whether big or little. The nation that has a heart and soul can maintain its independence. Prussia has done so. For close on 300 years she was surrounded by foes. My own country has stood up against odds with great heart and courage. If there were a crawling, dependent spirit among Australians, no power on .use earth could save them. It is the v i m , determination, manhood, and patriotism of the people of a country that make a nation, not the numerical strength of the population. The Prime Minister, speaking at Crow's Nest on the 8 th A p r i l , 1909, said, "" Australia should not only give a Dreadnought, but increase the Naval Subsidy."" On the 28th March, 1909, he said, at Sydney, "" If I were in Mr . Fisher's place, I should offer a Dreadnought, and ask for a Naval Conference."" On the 31st March, 1909, speaking at Bendigo, he said about our proposal for a local Navy, as outlined at Gympie, "" It represented the views 'of the Brisbane Labour Conference, but it would be found that it was quite impractical."" That was then his opinion of the scheme that he is now endorsing. I was amused to hear him say, without a blush, speaking in the presence of Sir Ian Hamilton, "" We established this defence system.""",31
225,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,So they did .,32
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,And the Dreadnought thafcfcheLabour party scoffed at is now here.,32
227,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"On the occasion to which I refer, the Prime Mmister ; d mifcfced that the Opposition helped the present Liberal party in this matter. The honourable gentleman does not look a humorist, but he can be very f u n n y on certain occasions. On the 2nd A p r i l , 1909, he said, at Sydney, fchafc, "" as soon as Parliament met, there was no doubt that a Dreadnought would go to B r it a in . "" At that time fchey had fixed up the Fusion Coalition. The Labour party was in office, and the "" rag-tag and b o b - t a i l"" of politics gathered together to put us out. Having succeeded, our opponents (sent Colonel Foxton to the 1909 Conference. The present High Commissioner stated that the reason why he voted fco put us out of office was that he wished to prevent Senator Pearce from going fco that Conference. That statement was made publicly in this Chamber. shows that the giving of a Dreadnought to the Mother Country was then the policy of the Liberals. Now they have changed. Senator Millen is the hero of the hour, because he says that the First Lord of the Admiralt y will never be allowed to take one of our ships from the South. Pacific.",32
228,Mr JOSEFH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,Did he say that?,32
229,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"Thos e were practically his words. He said that the First Lord of the Admiralty wanted to destroy the Australian-owned and manned Navy. If I rea""d his words correctly, he strongly objects to that.",32
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,That is a totally different statement.,32
231,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"Whateve r the difference in regard to words and terms, the - present policy of the Liberals is evidently based on the lines laid down by the Labour party before the Fusion Governmeut took office. The Prime Minister knows that this policy was laid down by us. The Admiralty, before we were put out of office, knew what our policy was. As a party we laid down a policy that cannot be repealed.",32
232,Mr RODGERS,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"Why haggle over these matters, seeing that the policy is universally accepted today f",32
233,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"O u r views were expressed at the proper time in a memo-' randum sent to the proper quarter; but an attempt has been made to mislead the public on the subject. We did not content ourselves with a mere statement, but laid down a policy, clear, definite, and distinct, that we stand by today. I wish to give credit to the honourable member for West Sydney for the establishment of the system of compulsory training, of which he was the pioneer. I opposed his suggestions more than once, being afraid of the barracks system, but I am notafraid of the present system. As others have tried to steal his thunder, it is only fair and just that he should be mentioned as the pioneer and fighter for the system, whether it be good, bad, or indifferent. In my opinion, we shall have to alter the system in some way to prevent our lads from being deprived of their Saturday afternoons. They should have as many free Saturdays as possible, so that they may go away on Saturdays and Sundays .to make holiday. We should provide for the drilling of our young men at proper times, but should put them to as little Everything inconvenience as possible so long as the system is properly maintained. Preference to unionists has been spoken of as a test question at the present time. I have dealt with the manner in which this Governmeut regards preference to other people. Speaking for myself, I am a unionist, and have been a member of a union from the time that I commenced to work. Almost without exception, membership of a union is a guarantee that a man is able to perform the class of work that he professes to be able' to do. Unions have been the great bulwark of liberty, and the chief agents of development in the Old Country. Through thoir guilds, and in other ways, they have done more for the advancement of the people than has Parliament. If treated fair l y , they will develop along their own lines, raising the position of their members and still further benefiting the country. Aire those who have borne the heat and burden of the day, fighting for justice, to be scorned by Parliament? Are they to give up the right to strike, and, at the same time, not to be allowed to ask for preference from a competent tration ancl Conciliation? I would prevent strikes absolutely if I could.",32
234,Mr CONROY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"To take from a man the right to strike is to deprive him of freedom, and to make him a slave.",33
235,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"I would establish competent tribunals to deal with all causes. I believe the honourable member for Werriwa and others misunderstand what unions exist for, It is not to strike, but to get justice. They want only justice; they do not want to strike. If they can get justice, what do they want to strike for?",33
236,Mr CONROY,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,-Why do they strike?,33
237,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"Because they cannot get justice. Tbey cannot get to the Courts; they are blocked by a thousand barriers, and when they cannot get there for a year honourable members opposite say that they ought not to strike, even though they have no other remedy. The party opposite are determined to withhold the proper remedy from them. The great toiling masses of Australia have done everything .for the country, and there is no credit due to any one who sneers and jeers at them as they are sneered and jeered at now. the words of the Prime Minister himself. On the 2nd August, 1900, he said in the New South Wales ParliamentThe industrial history of this and every other country shows that masquerading under this principle of freedom of contract has been some of the most ghastly ancl horrible slavery that this or any other country has ever known. He is turning his back on that attitude. He is helping others to perpetuate that ghastly and horrible trouble. 9 th December, 1904, speaking in the House of Representatives, he said-When .T was secretary to a union, we always insisted on preference to unionists, ancl in a very summary fashion. Tf I were in the same position today I should do the same again. I should expect the honourable member to do it . I expect even better from him today. He cannot blow hot and cold in a matter of this kind. It is respects a matter of life and death, and we both know it . If the unions were suppressed - as the honourable member is : seeking to suppress them - industrial liberty as it is understood, and the protection of life and health in the mines and factories today, would 'not exist. On the 2nd August, 1.900, in the New South Wales Parliament, the honourable Court of A r b i - gentleman saidThe Bill does right to give a preference to the trade unionist. The free labourers step into reap where they have not sown. It seems to me a just recognition of the work of trade unionists that this preference to trades organizations should be given. The free labourer is only used, as a rule, by the employer in order to coerce the unionist to accept condition* which the unionist dislikes. Yet the honourable member now sits there as the defender of a principle which he does not believe in . Of course, he can say that he has changed his views, and yet he has already said that if he were in the same position he would do the same thing again. He would do himself more justice and earn, perhaps, greater honour, if he would stand to his principles. The granting of preference to unionists is equivalent to giving up the right to strike, and is a very poor equivalent at that. I turn my attention to the Minister of Trade and Customs. I was disappointed with his reply today regarding the non-proclamation or putting into operation of the Navigation Act . My colleagues will deal with that question more full y . It was intended when the British Government accepted that measure so readily that it should be Listen to put into operation without delay, but unreasonable delays have taken place. In regard to lighthouses there has been f u r ther delay. We find that because the States have intervened",33
238,Mr GROOM,COMPULSORY ELECTOR AL,"The honourable member is mixing up two things. . Mr FISHER - I refer to the question of lighthouses, with regard to which the States are not prepared to give up to the Commonwealth the control, which I think On the they ought to give up, because it is certainly a Commonwealth matter. The States ought to co-operate in a matter which involves the protection of life and the shipping of Australia.",33

Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) posedThat the House do now adjourn.  to bring before the House an alleged in flux of Chinese to the northern parts of Queensland and to the Northern Territory, and I am sorry that the Minister of External Affairs is not present, because this is a question which affects his Department very much. A most serious accusation is made by one of the newspapers in Brisbane. This paper has published two big articles on the subject, and claims to know the names of the people who are engaged i u this business of bringing Chinese into the northern parts of Australia. As soon as I saw the published statement, I wired to the Minister of External Affairs to draw his attention to the article, because I thought it only right that his Department should be fully-seized of the facts at the earliest possible moment. I will not delay members long in just reading the following remarks published in the Daily Standard, Brisbane, on the 2nd and 3rd A p r i l . These are the headings-'-'White Australia"" Flouted-The Yellow Menace-An Open Back Door- "" Contraband "" Chinese Coolies in Hundreds-Bi g Syndicate at Work-Whit e Money Seeking Traitors Concerned. (Specially written for the Daily Standard.) Then followed this synopsis of the articleI t will come as a shock to most Australians to learn that our much vaunted White Australia policy is being laughed at by the wily Chinese. While every eare is being taken in the principal ports of the Commonwealth to prevent the landing of aliens, Australia's backdoor is being invitingly left open, and hundreds of Chinese arc being smuggled into the country. So easy and profitable is the work of getting the "" contraband"" into Australia that a big syndicate, with its head-quarters in Hong Kong, and having a capital of about £20,000, has been started. Many influential Chinamen in Australia arc connected with the scheme, and several renegade whites arc also concerned. The Chinese coolies are first brought to Portuguese Timor, whence they are conveyed to the Australian coast. After lying low for a tinie in the ""Never Never"" country,, they arc drafted into Queensland towns, and then taken NORTHERN to the masters assigned for them. As much - as £50 per head is paid for the coolies. The menace to the future of Australia can easily be understood, and it is necessary that AND immediate steps be taken by the authorities TAX ON to bar effectually the back door of Australia against the entrance'of these aliens. proThen the newspaper goes on to comment upon the facts above set forth . I personally know that in Queensland, particularly in the north-western portions of the State, there are many new-chum Chinese to be seen. How do they get there ? We who have been in western and northern Queensland for any length of time can discern a new-chum Chinaman as easily as we can a new-chum Britisher. They go about like lost sheep; they are travelling about Queensland- I know of several - and know not enough English to dig up a spud with. When the authorities were spoken to in Brisbane, the only reply the newspaper could get was, """"We have get our instructions from Melbourne."" maintain that when such a serious thing as is here described takes place, the machinery of both the Customs Departthe ment and the Department of External Kalgoorlie. Affair s should be set in motion at once. I have not discussed this matter with the Minister since my return to Melbourne; but he replied to my telegram, thanking me for the .information that it gave, stating that the Department would go full y into the matter as soon as papers reached Melbourne. W i orable gentleman tell the House what has been done, and whether there truth in this article? In an article published in its next issue this newspaper stated that it could give the names the men eugaged in the traffic, both Queensland and Hong Kong, and I am approached. sure that if the Department has obtained any information on the subject the M i ister will acquaint the House with the actual position, so far as he can do so with them. without prejudicing his case.",35

252,Mr MAHON,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"The Prime Minister, in making that statement, is relying on labouring. official reports which, I regret even to suggest, are of very doubtful accuracy. I have no, desire to use language, although I think I should justified in doing so; but the position first taken up by the Ministry, and since labouring. abandoned, should be sufficient to indicate to them that there is a good deal to available there. be urged on behalf of the men. original position taken up by the Governfood ment was that these men were working ceedingly trying. under Kalgoorlie conditions, and that they were receiving the rates ruling in that city. 1 abandoned that contention. It is lutely clear, and should have been to Government from the start, that men employed at the head of the line, some 60 miles from Kalgoorlie, in uninhabited country, far removed from all the conout veniences of civilization, could not be to be working under Kalgoorlie condiing, tions. Kalgoorlie is practically a city, offering all the advantages and conconsiderably to veniences of a settled community, but I these men, working in this remote region, were peremptorily required to whole accept the rate paid to men doing same class of work in and about That, to begin with , was an unreasonable proposition. Then, in the second place, the Government, instead of entering into negotiations with the men, for some reason or other submitted to and them a hard and fast schedule of rates, and practically said, "" This is what we the are going to give you. You can either l l the hontake it or leave it . """,36

They have since Mr Mahon - The wind blew as hot absoas if it had come direct fro m a furnace. the The right honourable gentleman admitted on that occasion that the Government should be an ideal employer of labour. In that connection, I should like to point that a few chains in advance of - the said point at which the track-layer was workthere were men doing similar work for a private contractor and receiving a higher rate of pay than the Government were paying. Surely that is not right. If a private contractor can pay his men a fair wage, and still make a profit, surely the Government should be able to pay its employees doing similar Work the same rate. That is all thab the Government were asked to do in this case. As to the allegation that this contractor has adopted the task system, M in isters may accept the assurance that they have been absolutely misinformed. The Minister has said that men were discharged by the contractor; but the fact is that the contractor has working for him men who were discharged by the Government. Those employed on the line seriously contend that if there be a taskmaster there at all it is the Government official, and not the private contractor. Thafc is the actual position. The Honorary Minister, probably because he was not full y acquainted with the facts, endeavoured to confuse the issue a little today by stating that men were working at Kalgoorlie for the State Railway Department for a wage of 10s. a day. far as I know, there is not a man in K a l goorlie working at railway construction for 10s. per day.",36
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"Indeed , there Mr Scaddan himself told me the other day that there were men so employed.",37

262,Mr MAHON,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"No r are they working under the Same conditions. A few permanent men may have been drafted Up bo Kalgoorlie to do certain work for the time being, and may be receiving the wages ruling at Perth or Fremantle; but some of the reports on which the Government are acting, according to my information, are not correct in all their details. I suggest that the Government should invite the men to appoint representatives to meet them in conference. surer knows that they are a reasonable body of men.",37

I have no wish to elaborate this question, but I assure Ministers, without any desire to make any threat, that they will not build any more of the line unless they give the men a f a ir deal.

273,Mr MAHON,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"It is useless for the Prime Minister to ' assume an indignation that lie does not feel. There was no secrecy on my part, and, as the Treasurer has given permission to say what was in the letter, I may refer to it .

There is only one A r b i tration Court in Western Australia to which the men could appeal, and The Trea- we must remember that the Commonwealth Government cannot be cited to"" a State Arbitratio n Court.

I appeal again to the Government to meet the men in a reasonable way.

277,Mr CONROY,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"Werriwa) [5.26] - I desire to draw the attention of the Government to a statement issued by the Minister of Defence. Although this statement may, perhaps, meet with political support, I am quite sure that it. does, nqt meet with the intelligent support of any man who has studied the questionIn the first place, isolated naval units can be, of no use by themselves, and a little force, like that in Australia, would be utterly helpless apart from the main fleet. Wherever there is a fleet, it ought ' to. be massed together to meet any possible foe. Of course there are two classes of objections to b'e met. The first of these is raised by those who declare, "" We are Australians, and we are not intending to have anything to do with any other country in the world, but will stand on our own."" In view of the present state of affairs, that can only be characterized as a grossly ignorant and unintelligent attitude. The Labour party could not have passed any of .their laws relating to aliens had it not been for the support of the rest of the Empire; and, if the Empire calls upon us to assist in its defence, wherever that call is, our ships ought to go. At present there is one possible, though, I hope, not probable, opponent, in the fleet of Germany; and, in the event of hostilities, any unit out here would be absolutely useless in time of war.",38
278,Mr MCDONALD,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"Did not the Imperial authorities, through their blundering, give away half New Guinea, where Germany now has a naval base ?",38
279,Mr CONROY,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"The bulk of the German fleet is stationed in the North Sea, and a naval base is useless without a fleet. While I hope, and believe, that there is no fear of hostilities with Germany, still Germany is the possible enemy to which attention is directed. There is no question that if war wore to break out, our unit might-thoug h it is not very likely, seeing that it is so small-be of great advantage at the scene of hostilities, though it would certainly be of no advantage out here; and the war would be over and done with before our vessels could succeed in reaching the scene, If that war were decided against the British Empire, the defence of Australia would immediately go. A war with China is not likely; and as to Japan, we are assured in our relations by an alliance. But, should hostilities break out with any Eastern country, the first thing would be to order our unit, as fast as possible, to meet, say, at the Cape of Good Hope, the British Fleet which would be coming to our assistance; because, unless pur vessels were united with the main fleet they would be valueless. If the Russia-Japanese war taught us anything, it taught us that fact. Russia made the mistake pf having part of her fleet at Port Arthur, part at Vladivostock, and part in the Baltic. United, the Russian fleet would have been irresistible; there would have been no Korean war, no Japan in Korea, and Russia would still have possessed Port Arthur. Vladivostock fleet was kept on the foolish advice of some persons who lived there, seem to have been the sors, in want of knowledge, the Labour party here I do not 'think that honourable opposite who differ from me are the only persons who are ignorant in these matters. In plenty of places in the world will be found their equals in stupidity upon matters of this kind. If I may be permitted to point to a parallel case in the United States of America, I will point to the course pursued by Abraham Lincoln, who kept the land forces scattered instead of concentrated until Grant obtained command. Similarly it was a big mistake on the part of Jefferson Davis to decline to listen to the military son and Lee-when they told him that it was imperative that his forces should be concentrated. It was because of this defect upon both sides that so manyserious mistakes were committed in that war. Had either side had at its head men who understood the value of concentration, that side would have been victorious within a very brief period, and the horrors of war would have been proportionately lessened. When we cultivate what some are pleased to call an Australian sentiment, I maintain that we are cultivating a purely local There is a bigger sentiment ought to cultivate-the sentiment of Empire, of which honourable members in their speeches appear to have lost sight. gret that iti has been reserved for a native-born like myself to teach who have come here from Great and elsewhere, that when they for the cultivation of an Australian timent they are unpatriotic, who are anxious to develop an Empire sentiment are patriotic. It is true that it is to our interests to act in the way that I have suggested. Nothing has so much excited my warmest approval as the very statesmanlike way in which the big heads on the other side of the world receive these petty ebullitions of so-called Australian sentiment. I do not believe, that such ebullitions represent the true thought of Australia. In my Mr Conroy. and they do not. I recognise that a certain section of political thought is against an Empire sentiment, but we must k ill that The class of thought, because, if those who separate hold it are against the Empire, they are against a White Australia policy. and who Mr MCDONALD - Bunkum ! predeces- Mr CONROY - Surely the honourable of member must see that without the supto-day. port of the Empire such a policy must members disappear 1 Does anybody imagine that our Navigation Act could. have been passed if we had not the fleet of Great Britain behind us ?",38
280,Mr MCDONALD,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,Does not the honourable member advocate the introduction of foreign black-labour goods?,39
281,Mr CONROY,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"I advocate the introduction of commodities of every kind with which to feed our people. The honourable member would let them starve. I say that if we can get other people to work for us, and to ship their goods to us, we men-Jack- shall be doing good business. In regard to our Naval U n it , I would point out that, where otherwise we might have had four submarines, today we have only two, because we have not the trained artisans fco spare. What we require in this community is men. We can spare the money to pay for these vessels, but we cannot spare the men. When the Minister of Defence says fchafc he is fighting for an arrangement which was entered into some five or six years ago, when there was no suspicion that a change of naval policy was ever likely to be made,- I say that sentiment. he is stating what is incorrect. If he which we looks at the Admiralty despatch of the 10th February, 1908, he will find that in it the Admiralty authorities sayI re- The terms would be elastic and capable of adjustment from time to time by intercomothers, munication between the two Governments.

The . document in question points out that, after all, the control of the Naval Forces must rest with the central authority. That is where it should rest; otherwise, those forces would become a mere rabble. When the Minister of Defence declares that we must adhere to the Naval Agreement, which was arrived at several years ago, one would think opinion, that he was unaware of what developments had since taken place in the matter of aerial conquest. One would imagine that he was unacquainted with the i m portant part that aeroplanes to play in the fighting force of the world - a part which was undreamed of at the time that that agreement was entered into.

The honourable member suggested that we should approach the men, enand I can only say that the Government have already taken steps to meet what we say understand are the views of the men, in Fleet order to submifc what wages in detail the I Government are prepared to pay for I agree with the for honourable member that these men are took a very good body of ' men, whom any Government might seek to meet; to but, of course, there is naturally a limi t beyond which a Government charged with responsibility to the taxpayers cannot go in dealing with such matters. The newspapers gave us to understand from Western Australia that the men wanted to know how far the schedule increase to labourers was being carried up to other grades. That information, I believe, is now in the West. I gave instructions that it should be telegraphed to the West, so that the men will now have absolute knowledge as to the increases due to the various categories of labour. I anticipate that the men will consider that the offer made by the Government is a very fair offer, and will agree to accept it .",40
288,Mr RILEY,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,When was that offer made ?,41
289,Mr KELLY,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"My offer of a considerable time ago of an increase of lOd. per day was intended to be increased proportionately in the higher grades. was the burden of my instruction. Judg- ing from the newspapers, the men seem to have been in some doubt as to whether this increase would apply to more than the grade of labourer. That doubt should be set entirely at rest by the schedule which has been sent across to the West.",41
290,Mr RILEY,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,Have they received the schedule yet?,41
291,Mr KELLY,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"They should have received it before this. I wish to say, in reply to the honourable member for K a l goorlie, that I think his references to the contractors in the West are somewhat misleading. Judging fro m our reports, the contractor is undoubtedly getting more out of the men working for him than the Government feel they can get out of the average labourer, for which they are prepared to pay 12s. 6d. per day. That the men themselves take a similar view is very clear from the terms of the Port Augusta arrangement, because, while they were.perfectly ready to enter into an agreement with the Government to go as far as Tarcoola, 260 or 270 miles out, for the wage they accepted, l is . 8d. per day, they hold themselves at liberty to make other terms with any contractor who gets the business. Obviously, they feel that the contractor may ask more from them than the Gov. ernment, and wish to be in a position to make the contractor pay more by way of return. That is something which, in my opinion, they are perfectly entitled to do. As regards the difference between - contractors' labour and Government labour in Western Australia, I strongly suggest to the honourable member for K a l goorlie that on this subject he should have a heart to heart, talk with Senate? Needham. Whilst the honourable member asks us to ' treat the men with the same generosity as the contractor treats them, Senator Needham has written in to the Department expressing hisabhorrence of the Government for placing these men at the mercy of such beings, as these con T tractors. There is some conflict of opinion between my honourable friends, and I suggest to the honourable , member for Kalgoorlie that, if he had a heart to heart talk with Senator Needham, they might settle the quesr tion between themselves as to whether or not the Government should follow the example of the contractors in dealing with the men. I can only add that we have That taken all the steps that in us lie to see that the rights of these men are safeguarded, and that they should have an opportunity to consider our terms.",41
292,Mr BURCHELL,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,It is a pity the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is not here.,41
293,Mr KELLY,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"That is not my fault. I can hardly be blamed for that. I can only say that before the trouble arose I assured the honourable member for K a L gpprlie, and he published the information, that any increase in the wages allowed should be retrospective to the date of the representations. That was in accordance with the ordinary j>ractice. Having struck, they have waived all that, and I regret it . The action of the Government all through has been perfectly friendly. They have been anxious to make a fair deal with these men, and I think it is up to the men to show a similar spirit.",41
294,Mr SHARPE,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"Oxley) [5.49] - In the absence of the Minister of Trade and Cus toms, I . am disposed to bring under the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs the matter upon which I asked a question' this afternoon. Owing to the tur n which events have taken, I think it is better that I should ventilate my grievance ber fore we adjourn this evening, as the members of the Government may not occupy their present position very long. I wish to call attention to the contract let - to Barbet and Son, of Ipswich, for the construction of eight underframes, and which they have constructed. Four of these underframes are now on thewharf at Brisbane, but the f i r m are unable to ship them, or to realise on the work they have performed.in the interests of the Government. Probably the Honorary Minister, or the Minister of Trade and Customs, or, perhaps, the Prime Minister, has some knowledge of this matter. When Barbet and Son sent along their tender for the work they ascertained from the shipping companies what the latter were likely to charge from Brisbane to Port Augusta, and the price quoted was 43s. a ton, or £8 a frame. The price was satisfactory to the firm, but at some subsequent time the Adelaide Steam-ship Company, who, 1 understand, contracted to ship the frames, wrote to the firm stating that the price quoted was altogether too low, and that they would have to charge £28 per frame. The firm did not complain about that; they were agreeable to pay the price; but subsequently they received a letter stating that the Association considered that the price quoted by the Adelaide Steam-ship Company was altogether too low, and that it would be £44 per frame. As I have said, four of these frames are now lying on the Adelaide Company's wharf, but the shipping company will not ship them at the price quoted to the firm, and which the firm were prepared to pay in order to get them off their hands. Another four frames are completed, and are lying at their works in Ipswich, but they are of no use to Barbet and Son, because of the action of the Shipping Combine. They can only wait until a shipping company is prepared to ship them. They do not consider that they should be asked to pay further freight. I understand that they tried to make some arrangement to charter a ship, load her with coal, ancl complete the loading by shipping these frames, and that they had almost, completed the charter when some outside interests got to work .and prevented them from concluding it. If Queensland firms are to be confronted with this difficulty in connection with works which the Commonwealth Government have to let, it will be useless in future for them to tender.",41
295,Mr KELLY,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"As I understand friend, the firm merely got quotations instead of arranging the freight beforehand. Mr SHARPE' - They possess correspondence arranging for this freight. In a day or two I shall have all the correspondence dealing with the matter. The prices I have mentioned are those agreed upon by the shipping company with this firm previous to the latter sending along their tender for these frames. They first obtained a quotation from, the Adelaide Steam-ship Company at 43s. per ton, or about £8 per frame. Some time afterwards the shipping company wrote saying that the price was too low, and that they would have to charge £28 per frame. Subsequently the shipping company wrote to say that the Association agreed that £2S was altogether too low, and that the price would be £44.",42
296,Mr MCDONALD,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,What is the Association?,42
297,Mr SHARPE,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,The Shipping Combine.,42
298,Mr KELLY,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"If my friend will bring me the correspondence when he gets it, I shall be very pleased to go into the matter.",42
299,Mr SHARPE,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"I intend to do so. I am merely bringing the matter under notice today to show the difficulty under which Queensland firms labour. There are big iron foundry firms in Queensland who would be only too glad to quote for Commonwealth work, but what is the use of their doing so? The firm I speak of had also a contract from the Commonwealth for underframes for hopper trucks, but they nad to ask the Commonwealth Government to cancel the contract because of the impossibility of despatching them to Port Augusta.  sent by rail?",42
300,Mr KELLY,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,No ; because of the breaks of gauge. .,42
301,Mr SHARPE,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"Probably the Minister has some correspondence on the matter. I bring this under his notice because I understand there are many firms in Queensland who are affected. I understand a Toowoomba firm is likely to meet with the same trouble. It also has received a quotation as regards freights, and the same thing is likely to take place as in connection with this contract. This sort my of thing is frequently taking, pluce in connection with other matters, and I think it is high time the Commonwealth Government took into consideration the establishment of a line of steamers of their own on the Australian coast, in order to give equal opportunity to these firms to compete for work which the Commonwealth Government require.",42
302,Mr BAMFORD,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,It is Sydney influence.,43
303,Mr SHARPE,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"I do not know what influence is at work; but I know that it has a very bad effect on the Queensland firms, au effect which is likely to be very detrimental to them. Now that the matter has been brought under his notice, I trust the Minister w i ll give it his attention. I shall bring under his notice any correspondence I have, and I hope he will see that the Shipping Combine will expedite the shipment of these frames. The firm I have mentioned cannot get paid until the Commonwealth Government have taken delivery of the frames.",43
304,Mr ATKINSON,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"Will m o t ) [5.58] I put a question today to the Prime M in ister, and I feel that I should add a few words to make the position clear. peculiar situation has arisen under Eederal Land Tax Act with respect the treatment of certain persons living outside the Commonwealth, chiefly resiferred, dents of India, who have purchased land in the Commonwealth. . Some have already selected their blocks, and have come here to reside upon them, but others have taken up land and have their agents at work getting the laud ready by clearing it and putting up buildings in preparabought tion for their arrival. The chief reason why they do not now happen to be resithough still in its native state. dents of the Commonwealth is that they have further terms to servo-twelv e months or two years, as the case may be-befor e they can leave the Indian vice. In my own district I know of several such cases. I take it that we passed the Land Tax Act it was never intended that the definition of "" absenThe tee"" should cover such people. If so, am sure we will lose many desirable tlers. When it becomes known that people are to be treated in this way, they relieve them. will not take the trouble to consider the matter of emigrating to Australia, and will raise a bad feeling. satisfied that no one who was i the House when the Land Tax Act which was passed had any intention including such people in the definition of "" absentees."" Many of those people who have selected land who have not already done so will soon become residents of the Commonwealth. If action is not taken, we shall, as I hinted, lose a number of desirable much settlers, and many persons will lose work for which they are being well paid. The land that is being taken up is chiefly orchard country, and large numbers of persons are being employed in clearing it. As much as £ 1 7 10s. an acre is being paid for the clearing of some of this land on the Tamar River. That means that a good deal of money is being distributed among the workers. I hope that when this matter is being brought under the notice of the Land Tax Commissioner he will find it possible to exemot these land-owners from the absentee tax. If he cannot do so, the sooner this Parliament amends the ' Act to enable it to be done the better it will be for the Commonwealth. Personally I am not in favour of the definition of absentee which stands in the Act , but I A do not raise that matter now. I think the that honourable members will be unanito mously in favour of exempting from absentee taxation those to whom I reand when we are agreed on anything for the good of the country it is as well that we should put our ideas into force. The extension of orcharding has greatly increased the value of land in certain districts. In my electorate, land which a few years ago could have been for 10s. an acre is now worth £ 5 and £ 6 , and even £ 1 0 an acre, Unlesswe deal generously with the persons I have i u mind, a great deal of harm will' be done to the country. As absentees they serare not allowed any exemption; but, theblocks being small, none would be taxwhen able as worth £5,000 or more if the people were present in the Commonwealth. case of these persons is a hard one,, I and I think only needs to be brought besetfore honourable members to receive their wholehearted support for any attempt to",43

306,Mr MCDONALD,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,It is not merely alleged to be taking place; it is taking place.,43
307,Mr FINLAYSON,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"Possibly we have should not be so nervous, nor attach soimportance to the statements that are being made, had not the present Queensland Government shown a decided partiality for aliens, having issued permits to work in the sugar-fields to over 1,000 coloured aliens. This Parliament has established a White Australia policy, but there is a feeling abroad in some quarters that by certain institutions and strong companies which have secured monopolies, attempts are being made to evade the restrictions which it imposes. We know how easy it is for Chinese to come to Australia, particularly to northern Australia. Only a few months ago the vigilance of a Customs official discovered an extensive and organized conspiracy for the introduction of Chinese into the Commonwealth, and a few years ago Customs officials were found to be acting in collusion with a syndicate whose business it was to - bring Chinese here. The Customs officials in the northern parts of Australia are either incompetent, or have too large an area to supervise. The reporter of the Daily Standard, who was ferreting out information on this subject, received a warning letter, stating that he knew too much, and had better go slow and be careful Evidently, therefore, the statements about a conspiracy are more than a shadow, and amount to veritable fact. The Customs Department should take some steps to assist its officials in the north. The honourable member for Werriwa, in his castigation of his own Minister of Defence, suggested splitting up of the Australian Navy. can conceive of no better use to which to put one of the torpedo destroyers than to engage it in patrolling the northern coasts, to discover, and, if possible, to put an end 'to, this conspiracy. vessels are small and fast', and better able to detect and stop this business than any others at our disposal. Why should not one of them patrol the northern coasts, as a watch dog and protector ? The Customs officials are possibly in league with those whose business it is to introduce Chinese. Two cases of that kind have been discovered already, and it may be that the same thing is going on in the north.",43

309,Mr FINLAYSON,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"A judicious transference of officers would probably get r i d of the difficulty. The matter is so - serious, particularly to Queenslanders, that I hope that the Minister of External Affairs will be able to make a statement which will reassure us.",44
310,Mr GLYNN,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"Angas--Minister of External Affairs) [6.10] - In reply to what has been mentioned by the honourable member for Maranoa and the honourable member who has just spoken on the subject of an alleged invasion of the northern parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory by Chinese, I may say that when my attention was drawn to the matter I at once communicated with the officials of the Territory, and also with the Commissioner of Police of Queensland, to well- have inquiries made as to whether the allegations of the newspaper could be sustained. I did so because similar allegations had been made before by newspapers, and did not seem to be justified in the light of subsequent inquiries. Nevertheless, the officers must be vigilant. I have had a reply from the Territory discounting the statements of the newspaper. In the opinion of the officials, it is improbable-in fact, they say it is fairly certain that it has not taken place - that any surreptitious immigration of Chinese has happened. For the reasons given, I think it is probable that the officers are correct. The Commissioner of Police has promised to make further in quiries, and let me know the result.",44
311,Mr RILEY,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"How many officers have been looking after that particular busithe ness? I Mr Glynn - I could not say that on the spur of the moment, because we use all the Customs officials, and we get in formation from the local police upon all these matters. I also apply in adminisThese tering the Immigration Acts the test of the aggregate number of Chinamen in the Commonwealth, as far as can be ascertained at the end of each year, because the real test of whether these Acts are being administered according to the desire of Parliament is whether the numbers are declining from year to year. The statistics I have seen upon that point have shown that the Immigration Restriction Acts are effective. I assure honourable members that the utmost vigilance is exercised in this matter. I shall make further inquiries, and am always only too pleased to get information from honourable members to help in the administration of these Acts. Recently I sent the detective of the Department up to Queensland, not in connection with any leakage in alien immigration in the parts of Queensland where the patrol cannot be as effective as in other parts, but to see whether the statement that in some parts of Queensland there was an organization for bringing Chinamen in in defiance of the Immigration Restriction Act was correct. He has sent me a report on the question, and is going back again. I do not want to say where he is going, but we are sparing neither time nor expense in seeing that there, is no substantial invasion of the provisions of the Immigration ' Restriction Acts. I shall welcome any information from honourable members to help me in the matter.",44
312,Mr BAMEORD,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"Herbert) [6.13] This afternoon, I asked the Honorary Minister, as representing the Minister of Defence, a question with regard to the Commonwealth Council for the arrangement of rifle matches, international competitions, aud so ou. He asked me to put it on the business-paper, saying that he would give me an answer later, but seeing the state the business is likely to be in during the next few weeks, I should like the matter to be attended to now. W it h a dissolution possibly following in the near future, we are anxious to get these matters settled. There are, in Queensland, two rifle associations-tli e southern and the northern. team is to be selected for Bisley, it is usual to give Queensland some representation, and the two associations arrange between them to have competitions and choose the best shots to help to represent Australia, It has been usual that two men should go ' from Queensland-on e from the south, and one from the north, as representing the proportions of the population. On this occasion Queensland has been given two representatives, and it is only fair that one should be taken the north and one from the south. Recently, competitions have been held and it was proved conclusively by the shooting that one of the North Queensland men was entitled to inclusion; but two men from the south have been selected;, cutting the North Queensland man out altogether. We protest in the strongest, way against that. I want to know why this man, who has made a better showing, has been excluded? surely cannot be because he has a foreign name-Grosskreutz-but , if so, I assure honourable members that he is an Australian by b i r t h , as I believe is his father, although his grandfather came from Germany. He is entitled to inclusion in the team as the representative of No r t h Queensland. These selections should not be made on any other basis than than' of merit. Why has that principle been departed from ? Rifle shooting is very popular in the n o r t h ; it is the only recreation that men have in many places on Saturday afternoons, holidays, and Sundays. They spend a considerable amount of money in purchasing ammunition, and of their time in practising at the butts, in order to qualify themselves for these competitions. lt would be very disheartening if any i m pression got abroad amongst these riflemen that unfair treatment has been meted out to one of their members. Had the shooting been carried out as hitherto, and the men selected on their merits, nothing would or could have been said; but the fact that favouritism has been shown by the Commonwealth Council, which has the direction of these matters, will have a very disheartening effect, and create a great deal of ill-feeling amongst the clubs"" in the north. I feel that attention should be given to this protest. This Parliament votes money every year to send the team to Bisley to compete in When a international matches, and if it should be generally believed that unfair treatment has been meted out to any man, there will be very strong opposition to any f u t u r e vote that may be put on the Estimates for that purpose. For a long time strong opposition was shown to such a proposal - that is, to send a team to Englandand no money was voted for representation at Bisley by this Parliament; but private . subscriptions sent teams Home. I say, advisedly, that strong opposition will be shown to any f u r the r from money being voted if the impression getsabroad that men have not been selected on their merits, but have been included through favouritism. That sort of thing will be very invidious and intolerable to us as northerners. The honourable member for Kennedy concurs with me in these expressions of dissatisfaction in regard to the action taken by the Commonwealth Council. It  the pleasure, shortly after the Kalgoorlie strike, of visiting that centre, and. travelling 40 or 50 miles along the transcontinental railway. I have come to the conclusion that the Government are treating the present strikers on absolutely just lines. In order to substantiate my statement, I should like to point out to the House that, in Kalgoorlie, they have a very fine body of miners-som e 6,000 men, all told-wh o have formed themselves into a very strong union. * The wages which'that union has agreed to accept for unskilled labour by surface men on the mines is l is . 6d. a day. The Governmenb have been paying for similar work to navvies and others' working, on the line 12s. 6d. a day, or Is. a day more. If the surface men on the mines were satisfied, why should the navvies be dissatisfied? Their conditions are better, because, living 60 miles out from their base, as they do at the present time, all the commodities which they use are carried to them. I noticed that 15,000 gallons of water were carried on the train for the free use of these men, whilst all their provisions were bought at cost price, and supplied to them by the Government. Members opposite have not an argument left. The conditions of these men are infinitely better than the conditions of the men working in the mines - Th",45

Of course I kept my eyes wide open on my trip, and I met one contractor who had working for him a fine lot of men, to whom he was paying 13s. 6d. per day. That gentleman - informed me that many of his men completed their work, at 2.30 instead of 5 p.m., three hours before knock-off time. This contractor told me that he measured ont the land, and allotted tp each man what he considered a fair day's work. A great many of the men completed their task by 2.30, and, being anxious to save money instead of loafing in .the tent, they went to the employer and asked him to be good enough M to give them more work. .Consequently, those men earned something like 17s. or 18s. per day.",46

319,Mr MCDONALD,INFLUX OF CHINESE TO,"We do not object to those men. If the honourable member will make inquiries, he will find that every one of them' is a good union man. The honourable member must realise that the statement he made originally, that the miners of Kalgoorlie are receiving only l is . 6d. a day, is wrong; they are receiving 13s, 4d. under the award. I will say, further, that the men employed in the mines at Kalgoorlie earn every penny they get, and some-of them ought to; receive a great deal more. It must be remembered that the men employed on the railway are away from the centres of civilization, and are working in the hot winds and the dust of Central Australia. The conditions of their employment are not conducive to health, and are a thousand times worse than the conditions of work in those other places to which the honourable member referred.  Mr MoDONALD - I have been in parts of the. honourable member's electorate where the people require to wear overcoats at times; but I say that the Conditions prevailing for eight months in the year along the route of that railway are not conducive to the health of the men employed. ' The honourable member is one of those people who will say, ""When I came here I bad to work for 2s - 6d. per day,"" and he expects other men to work for a similar wage. When the honourable member has had his leg pulled, he must not come here and dictate to us. I do not believe any other member could have had his leg pulled' to .the same extent, nor do I think that any other man would be stupid' enough to believe the statement which the honourable member has just repeated to the House.
