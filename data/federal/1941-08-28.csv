1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W. M. Nairn) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. DEATH OF EX-iSENATOR CHARLES HARDY.",12
2,Mr MENZIES,Unknown," Honourable members will have learned of the air crash in northern Queensland yesterday, which unfortunately resulted in the loss of three lives-thos e of Mr Charles Hardy, a former member of the Senate, who was recently engaged on Commonwealth defence work; Lieutenant-Colonel Miller, Director of Works, Department of the Army; and Mr Cohen, the pilot of the ill-fated aircraft. Honourable members will, I feel sure, wish me to express deep sympathy with the relatives of those who lost their lives in this tragic occurrence. It is appropriate that I make special reference to the death of Mr. Hardy, who was very well known to many members of this House. The late gentleman served as a senator from 1932 to 1938, and was Leader of the Country party in that chamber from October, 1935, to June, .1938. Mr Hardy saw active service during the last war. His enlistment soon after he had reached his eighteenth year was typical of the enthusiasm that he subsequently displayed in his public life. It will he remembered that the late Mr. Hardy founded, in 1931, the Riverina. Movement, the object of which was the recognition of that area as a new State. It was at the general elections held during the latter part of that year that he was elected to the Senate. Charles Hardy was an able, energetic and patriotic man, and his death at the early age of 42 years has caused a real loss to this country. He had many friends in this Parliament, and was widely respected for his sincerity and capacity for work. He gave his services to the Commonwealth in an honorary capacity in connection with certain important aspects of defence works, and it was while travelling in the course of tlmse official duties that he met his death. We are erateful to him for his valuable public work, and for the zeal that he displayed in the service of the people of this country. His death is a particularly sad blow to Mrs Hardy and her sons. I move That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of Mr Charles Hardy, a former member of .the Senate, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its heartfelt sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.",12
3,Mr CURTIN,Unknown," I second the motion, with, I am certain that every honourable member will believe, the very deepest regret. The late Mr Hardy served in this Parliament, and was a familiar figure to honourable members of this House. The remarks of the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) concerning his patriotism are, I believe, a just ciation of his outlook as a man. He was imbued with the desire to be of service to Australia. He interested himself in the promotion of principles which he thought, if applied, would be of value in the political structure of this country. Although he was not re-elected to the Senate at the expiration of his first term of office, he yet found at the outbreak of war that it was impossible for him, because of his nature, to proceed quietly with his own affairs; consequently, he offered his services in an honorary capacity for use by the Government wherever the employment of his talents might be of value. I know that he was engaged in very important work connected with the general plan of Australian defence. With two other members of the fighting forces of this country, he yesterday met his death. Charles Hardy worked conscientiously for Australia, and I state'a simple truth when I say that he died in the service of Australia. That there are men of his disposition in this country makes us feel very humble, and that there are so many of them makes us also feel proud. I offer to Mrs Hardy and her sorrowing children the deepest sympathy of every member of the Opposition- a sympathy in which, I am confident, the whole of Australia shares.",13
4,Mr FADDEN,Unknown," I associate the Country party with the sentiments that have been BO [HI fervently expressed. The tragic and untimely death of ex-Senator Charles Hardy was a severe shock to me, because he and I were personal friends. Only on Wednesday of last week I had a long conversation with him prior to his departure for north Queensland. The late Charles Hardy served Australia with distinction, not only in the Senate but also during the Great War of 1914-1S. As he was only 42 years of age at the time of his death, it is obvious that he was a very young man during that conflict. His sole desire was to serve Australia in any capacity. After his defeat for the Senate he did not dissociate himself from the Country party movement-wit h which he had been identified for the previous six years-bu t appre- kept in touch with its policy and its views, and gave very valuable co-operation in respect of the rural problems of Australia. His loss is a serious one in the critical times through which we are passing. I join in conveying sympathy to Mrs Hardy and to the two beautiful boys who have been left to mourn the loss of a fond father. He set for them an example which will sustain and guide them throughout their lives. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. CANADIA N TROOPS.",13
5,Mr CONELAN,Unknown,"Has the Minister for the Army seen the press report that Canadian troops in England "" booed"" the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King, and protested at being kept inactive in England. Can the honourable gentleman give any reason for these troops not being employed in the Middle East?",13
6,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,The employment of Canadian troops is not a matter for determination by the Australian Government. DAIRYI NG INDUSTRY.,13
7,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Commerce aware that the Victorian Dairymen's Association has asked for the appointment of producers' representatives on the Dairy Produce Control Committee and the Priority Dairy Products Committee? Is he aware that the persons appointed to these committees are the representatives of vested interests, and not of the producers I What consideration does the Minister propose to give to the requests of the producers for representation on the committees}",13
8,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The facts are not as the honourable member stated. The Dairy Produce Control Committee consists of seven gentlemen, three of whom are actual producers, though two of them are also directly representative of cooperative factories, of which they are chairmen. They are amongst the biggest dairymen in Australia. Until the death of Mr Angus MCKenzie, who was president of the Dairy Produce Association of Victoria, and was also a member of the Export Control Board, the producers had in him direct representation on the board. Consideration is now being given to the appointment of a further producers' representative. NA WORKERS.",14
9,Mr DRAKEFORD,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"Has the Government yet given consideration to the constitution of the Housing Trust which it proposes to appoint, and will the munitions workers be given representation on it?",14
10,Mr HOLT,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"Detaile d decisions have not yet been reached regarding the representation of bodies which will be asked to co-operate with the Housing Trust. The personnel of the trust itself has been decided upon; the gentlemen concerned have been approached, and have agreed to serve. Representation will be given to the States most likely to be activities of the trust, and the various State representatives on the trust will consult with local interests in their own States, including the workers themselves.",14
11,Mr DRAKEFORD,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,But will the workers have direct representation?,14
12,Mr HOLT,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,That matter will receive consideration. ABBCO BREAD CONTRACT.,14
13,Mr WARD,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"What action does the Government propose to take as a result of the finding of the royal commission which inquired into the Abbco bread contract, and in its report commented caustically on the conduct of Major Rigney, Lieutenant Hart, and Sergeant Benjamin?",14
14,Mr SPENDER,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"The report of the royal commission, which I read very carefully, did not seriously reflect on Major Rigney concerning the discharge of his duties as an officer, but said that whatever he had done reflected great efficiency. The report did, however, contain some adverse comments on the evidence which Major Rigney had given before the commission; it stated that he had given unsatisfactory evidence in an endeavour to protect his subordinates. Caustic comment was made on some portions of the evidence, and the commissioner stated - that he was not wholly convinced that the state of Major Rigney's health, which was admittedly bad at the time, could be. regarded as entirely responsible.",14
15,Mr ROSEVEAR,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,The commissioner stated that Rigney had driven the other firm out of the contract.,14
16,Mr SPENDER,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"Yes , but stated that he was not motivated by personal considerations, but by a desire to get the best deal for the Army. The utmost that can be said against him is that his earlier evidence was unsatisfactory; upon the circumstances of his bankruptcy the commissioner made little comment. The position of Major Rigney is different from that of the other men involved. I have given direction that they should be dealt with immediately, but I am informed that they are entitled to be tried by court-martial. My own view is that they should be dealt with without delay, and I am having further inquiries made affected by the into the position. SLR RONALD CROSS.",14
17,Mr MORGAN,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a statement made by the British High Commissioner, Sir Ronald Cross, at a function in Canberra, in the course of which he offered gratuitous advice regarding Australia's economic policy and the conduct of the war ? Is it not time that an intimation was conveyed to overseas representatives that they should confine themselves to diplomatic work, and refrain from trying to influence the economic policy of this country?",14
18,Mr MENZIES,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"I have not seen a report of the statement to which the honourable member has referred, and therefore cannot offer any useful comment on it. TINN ED PLATE SUPPLIES.",14
19,Mr BREEN,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,Has the Minister for Commerce received any information regarding a possible shortage of tinned plate to deal with next season's fruit crop? Will he bring the matter to the attention of the newly-appointed Tinned Plate Committee in order to ensure that sufficient plate is set aside for canning purposes during the coming season?,15
20,Sir EARLE PAGE,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"This matter has been engaging the attention of the Government for many months past, and recently a committee was set up by the Department of Supply to deal with it.",15
21,Mr BBEEN,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,Does the Minister anticipate a shortage ?,15
22,Sir EARLE PAGE,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,No . DOCK AT CAIRNS.,15
23,Mr RIORDAN,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"Has the Prime Minister received a report from the Manpower and Resources Survey Committee recommending that a dock be built at Oaims? If so, will he give the recommendation favourable consideration?",15
24,Mr MENZIES,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"I cannot remember such a report having been placed before me, but any report from any parliamentary committee will receive the earnest consideration of the Government. COAL REFERENCE BOARDS.",15
25,Mr JAMES,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"Has the Government considered the suggestion I made some time ago regarding the desirability of amending the regulations which provided for the setting up of District Coal Reference Boards, the purpose of the amendment being to reduce the number of appeals to the Central Reference Board regarding matters of purely local concern ?",15
26,Mr HOLT,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"The matter has been considered, and some minor amendments of the regulations are now in draft, and should be completed shortly. Whilst the effect of the amendments will not be to crease the jurisdiction of the local boards, it has been decided that when matters affecting a particular district come before the Central Board from local boards, some representation on the Central Board will be granted to that district. POLITICAL CRISIS.",15
27,Mr WARD,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"Will the Prime Minister state whether he was correctly reported in the press as having said that important decisions on matters of policy were being delayed because of the unstable political situation? If so, will he state to what matters he was referring?",15
28,Mr MENZIES,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,What newspaper reported that?,15
29,Mr WARD,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,The local newspaper.,15
30,Mr MENZIES,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"Oh ! If the local newspaper reported me correctly, it would be for the first time. I did not say anything about decisions being held up.",15
31,Mr WARD,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,It was in the Sydney Morning Herald also.,15
32,Mr MENZIES,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,Surely the honourable member does not regard the Sydney Morning Herald as one of my supporters. TINN ED MEAT.,15
33,Mr CONELAN,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"Recently , I asked the Minister for the Army to lay upon the table of the House the file dealing with the purchase of tinned meat for the Army and the Navy, and I am not satisfied with the answer. The Minister's reply states that I have already received information about the hot-curing process and the cold-curing processes. Will the Minister now inform me what proportions of hot-cured tinned meat and cold-cured tinned meat has been purchased for the Army and the Navy?",15
34,Mr SPENDER,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"I regret that I am unable to give the information offhand, but I shall make inquiries and furnish an answer to the honourable member. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.

35,Mr CALWELL,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"Has the Cabinet given consideration to the acute shortage in- of tobacco which, in the opinion of many people, is growing more serious? Is the Government aware that several tobacconists in Sydney and Melbourne claim that they will be compelled to cease trading in cigars, cigarettes, tobacco and papers for making cigarettes if supplies are not made available very soon? Is the Government also aware that inquiries reveal that tins of cigarettes are practically unobtainable in those cities?",15
36,Mr SPENDER,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"I shall discuss the matter with the Minister for Supply and the House? the Minister for Trade and Customs as it probably concerns both departments, and I shall endeavour to convey an answer the honourable member today. MALNUTRITION.",16
37,Mr MORGAN,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS,"Has the attention of now being undertaken. the Minister for Health been directed to the statement by Dr F. W. Clements, Director of the Commonwealth Institute of Anatomy, that investigations in various parts of the Commonwealth disclosed that between 10 per cent, and 20 per cent, the children were grossly under weight and that some were suffering from malnutrition? As there is an abundance of foodstuffs in Australia, what action will the Government take to deal with serious position ?",16
38,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,HOUSING FOR MUNITIONS," Yesterday, I answered a similar question by a colleague of the honourable member, but I avail myself of this opportunity point out that the fact that Dr Clements, who is an officer of my department, ducted the investigation and submitted the report, indicates the interest which the Government takes in the health of the people.

41,Mr WARD,COPPER AND BAUXI TE,"I k the Minister for External Territories whether the vernment prosposes to investigate the reported existence of flow oil in the controlled area of New Guinea? If so, when will the Minister be in a position to make a statement about the matter tc",16
42,Mr MCDONALD,COPPER AND BAUXI TE,"As long ago as 1911, seepages of oil were discovered into New Guinea, and in 1918 the Federal Government expended in the territory approximately £400,000 in a quest for oil. Extensive boring operations are Recently I visited a district where a bore had bpen sunk to a depth of 3,500 feet, progress being at the rate of approximately 70 feet a day. Although many people appear to think that the Government has taken noof steps to search for oil, such a view is unfounded, because considerable sums have been expended in this direction. Replying recently to a question similar to that asked by the honourable member for this East Sydney, I mentioned that a certain company is seeking permission to explore the uncontrolled area. We have a special obligation to the natives m the territory, and until the region is brought to under control by the administration, white men will not be allowed to enter conit. I see no reason to alter that rule.",16
43,Mr WARD,COPPER AND BAUXI TE,"Has the Government formulated plans for exploring the uncontrolled area? If so, when will the exploratory work begin?",16
44,Mr MCDONALD,COPPER AND BAUXI TE,"Althoug h I am not aware when thu exploratory work will be undertaken, I know that the Administration of New Guinea is now carrying to out definite plans in this regard. For maginstance, patrol officers who have been specially trained for the work have been in appointed. Each year, they extend their influence into the uncontrolled area, and is by that manner of peaceful penetration that the whole of the region will be",16
45,Mr MARTENS,COPPER AND BAUXI TE,Did the Minister for External Territories see any evidence of feeling between the white residents of New Guinea and the natives while he was on his recent visit to the Territory? I understand that after the murder of a white woman by a native there has been a strong reaction against the natives. a 5,16
46,Mr MCDONALD,COPPER AND BAUXI TE,"I know that the Gohonorable member will not hold me responsible for the murder. As soon as unthe murder was reported, two detectives were sent to make investigations. One of them, Detective Arnold, is still in New Guinea. So far no one has been, arrested for the murder.",16
47,Mr MARTENS,COPPER AND BAUXI TE,I do not suggest that the Minister is responsible for any happening in New Guinea. I want to know whether he noticed any signs of antagonism on the part of the whites ro the natives?,17
48,Mr MCDONALD,COPPER AND BAUXI TE,"In the neighbourhood where the murder occurred great feeling was naturally aroused, but generally throughout the Territory the behaviour of the natives is wonderfully good, considering the fact that a great many of them were taken from their home villages and separated from their women folk for their periods of three years as indentured labourers. PENSIONS.",17
49,Mr GUY,COPPER AND BAUXI TE,"As the purchasing power of money has been reduced by the rising cost of living, and invalid, old-age and military pensions have been increased, will the Treasurer, when preparing the budget, consider the advisability of making a similar increase of disabled soldiers' stabilized pensions?",17

60,Mr DRAKEFORD,COMMONWEALTH OFFICE,"Will the Minister for the Army conduct an immediate investigation of the facts which I submitted to this House last night regarding the proposed eviction, by the Director of Hirings, of certain firms from premises in Melbourne?

63,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH OFFICE,"I ask the Minister for Social Services whether it is the practice to treat war pensions as income when assessing eligibility for invalid or old-age pensions? If so, will that practice be discontinued ?",18
64,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,COMMONWEALTH OFFICE," There has been no change whatever in the pensions system, except that income from allotments made by soldiers to their parents or invalid wives is not classed as income and does not in any way interfere with the granting of new pensions or the maintenance of existing pensions.",18

If this be so, is the honourable gentleman prepared to place the relatives of members of all forces on the same bftsis ?",18

NA OF PARLIAMENT.",18
73,Mr JAMES,SERVICE MEN AND MEMBERS,"Is the Prime Minister aware that the commanding officers of various sections of the defence forces have issued instructions to all members of those forces that they must not take grievances to members of Parliament?

If the men have no appeal to their local members, to whom can they appeal?",18

The question dealt with an instruction issued by the Treasury to the Department to ignore the concessional allowance for all except the first child under the age of sixteen years in any family when deducttaxation instalments from the salaries of the department's employees. The answer stated that no such Treasury had been issued.

Nobody else will be permitted to attend, and speculation is rife as to what will happen. At House any rate, I shall be a disinterested onlooker in the National Capital until the fates have decided what is in store for those who are Ministers, those who hoped to be Ministers but were not so fortunate, and those who still have hopes of achieving Cabinet rank. All that reposes in the Turning now to more important matters than the prospects of individual r members of Parliament for ministerial appointment, I desire to refer to several subjects that are causing great concern to some of my constituents and to the community generally. Earlier I asked the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) why certain producers were not given representation upon the Dairy Produce Control Committee and the Priority Dairy Products Committee. The Minister replied that the of those bodies were representative of the producers. For the information of the right honourable gentleman I shall read a portion of a letter that I have received from the secretary of the Victorian Dairymen's Association. He wrote to me because the head-quarters of the organization is situated in my electorate. The letter readsMy association, representative of the dairy farmer producers of Victoria and the Primary Producers' Union of New South Wales, two organizations with a farmer membership of 27,000 have made repeated representations to the Minister for Commerce, Sir Earle Page, for producer representation upon the control committee and all other committees set up to control the dairying industry, and so far we have not succeeded. Kvery member of the committee represents some other interest than the interests of the man who produces and owns the product.",20
92,Sir EABLEPAGE,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"That does not mean that the representatives are not far m e r s . For instance, I a m a d a i r y - far m e r, and am also a member of this body.",21
93,Mr CALWELL,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"The Dairymen' s Association, w h i c h claims to speak on behalf of tbousands of p r o ducers, declares that it is not satisfied with the manner in w h i c h this matte r bus been handled.",21
94,Sir EARLE PAGE,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,The association satisfied with the w ay in w h i c h the money has been expended.,21
95,Mr CALWELL,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"T in v it e the M in is ter to listen c are full y to the r e m a in in g portion of the letterI am awaiting a further reply to the enclosed resolutions from Sir Earle Page, but am very far from confident our demands will be met. The same position applies to New South Wales, which you may verify by communicating with Mr .T. Shute, general secretary, Primary Producers' Union, Sydney. The resolution w h i c h was enclosed with the letter is as f o l l o w s : That the Central Council of the Victorian Dairymen's Association f u l ly recognizing the urgent need of diverting cream for butter manufacture into milk for cheese manufacture, and being desirous of rendering all possible assistance in this regard, emphatically expresses the opinion that at least l j d . per gallon compensation must be paid to the farmer for the loss of skim milk and further stresses to the Dairy Produce Control Committee that in order to obtain the ready co-operation of the producers, must immediately announce that the minimum compensation will be as suggested in the foregoing for it is seriously considered that delay in so doing will result in failure to obtain milk for cheese in Victoria. That this meeting of central council instructs the executive to demand and take every possible action to procure the appointment of direct representation upon the Dairy Produce Control Committee and any other industry committees which may be formed and are seriously concerned that whilst drastic changes vitaliy affecting the livelihood of dairy farmers are being contemplated they liave no direct voice in these vital matters. I shall hand the correspondence to the Minister in the hope that it will influence him to change his opinion about the matter. Although the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) does his best to get on top of the military machine, he sometimes, unfortunately, slips down among the cogs. I wish that he would extricate himself occasionally, because he is usually most attentive to my requests. I have complained to him about the action of the Assistant Director of Medical Services in Victoria in calling up for compulsory military service certain doctors in the age groups. One of them, who Victorian is a highly qualified practitioner, has a large industrial practice, is an honorary surgeon at a leading Melbourne hospital, is a lecturer in one of the colleges, and is very well regarded in the profession. 1I have suggested that, because of his is engagements, and because he is a gynaecologist and an obstetrician, he should be exempt from military service.",21
96,Mr SPENDER,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,The Director-General of Medical Services also has those qualifications.,21
97,Mr CALWELL,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,I do not dispute that; but this doctor is in general practice.,21
98,Mr SPENDER,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,Has he a partner?,21
99,Mr CALWELL,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"No , but he has a part-time assistant. Colonel Shaw is confusing the issue by suggesting that the doctor has a partner who could take his place.",21
100,Mr SPENDER,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"If he has no partner, I shall consider the matter.",21
101,Mr CALWELL,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"Definitely , he has no partner. His part-time assistant qualified as a doctor at the last supplementary examinations, and, as a result, failed to obtain appointment as a resident at one of the leading hospitals. The doctor employs him as a clinical clerk. The doctor does not permit him, on account of his inexperience, to attend surgical cases or confinements. My suggestion is that medical officers should be divided into "" reserved "" and "" non-reserved"" classes. Every specialist should not be required to enter camp simply because he belongs to a certain age group. His value to the community should be weighed before he is called up for military service. Many young doctors, who are doubtless good general practitioners, could be obtained for the Army, but highly-qualified men, some of whom studied in London, or pursued higher studies in Melbourne and other Australian universities, can render better service to the community by remaining in civil practice. In. the early months of the war many more doctors were in camp than were required. After the sick parade each morning they had nothing to do for nearly 24 hours. There is a serious shortage of medical men, and I am not prepared to take the word of some of the older doctors as to who should go to camp and who should stay in their practices. Many of them have been out of practice for years, and ought not to be in military positions today. I hope that, during the brief period for which he will be permitted to remain in office, the Minister for the Army will carry out something in the nature of a purge on the medical side of the military establishment. I am not at all impressed by the fact that a letter has been sent by the secretary of the British Medical Association in Victoria to Sir Alan Newton, a leading Melbourne surgeon, who gives a judgment against my doctor constituent, because the decision is based on wrong premises. If the Minister will reconsider the application for exemption and act fairly and courageously, as he generally does with regard to matters brought to his notice, I think that he will grant the desired exemption. I ask the Minister representing Minister for Supply and Development to take action against the Liquid Fuel Control Board in Victoria on a matter concerning its general administration. I am not referring to the allotment petrol ration tickets or to related matters, but to the control of the staff bourne which is employed by it and to the board's attitude to the organization which desires to make representations to it behalf of the staff. I have a copy of letter which the secretary of the Victorian Public Service Association, of which I was one time president, has forwarded to the Minister for Supply and Developfurther statedment (Senator MCBride) in which the mittee charge is made that the board has refused Mr Calwell. to receive representations by this organization regarding the salaries and conditions of employment of the staff. In refusing to recognize the association as competent to speak on behalf of the employees, the board is claiming a right which is denied to employers of labour generally. Such bodies as this association have every right to organize employees, for, by that means, industrial peace is maintained. The board has no reason for refusing to permit the association either to organize or make representations on behalf of its staff. A unique situation is brought about by the fact that the salaries, sick leave and recreation leave of many members of the staff are entirely unsatisfactory, and the association claims that the staff should be treated in these matters in the same manner as officers who are at present permanently employed under the Commonwealth Public Servce Act. That is quite a reasonable claim, but the board desires to be a law unto itself. Like a great many more of the boards with which we are plagued, this board could well be abolished, but while it administers some law or regulation, the Minister in charge of it should see that the Victorian Public Service Association is allowed to make representations to it, that it receives those representations, and that it grants conditions of employment equal to those of other Commonwealth employees. I have been asked to see that steps are taken immedately to bring the salaries and conditions of tie employees into line with those of other Commonwealth administrations. the [Extension of time granted.] On the 23rd July, the Melbourne City Council forwarded a letter to the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) informing him of that, immediately after the outbreak of war, the Corporation of the City of Meldecided that permanent officers and employees of the council engaged on naval, military, Air Force, or other on military duties in connection with the a war, be paid any deficiency between the amount of their pay and allowance for such duties and their salaries or wages in the service of the corporation. The letter At the last meeting of the finance comof the council, reference was made to the fact that such payments, which have been estimated to amount to £22,700 for the current municipal year ending on 30th September. 1941, are subject to the incidence of the Pay-roll Tax Assessment Act 1941, and Councillor Calwell, M.H.R., informed the committee that he had personally submitted a request to you that such ex-gratia payments should be exempted from the pay-roll tax. I have, therefore, by direction of the committee, to ask that consideration be given to the question of exempting such payments, which the council has voluntarily undertaken, from the pay-roll tax.",21
102,Mr FADDEN,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,I have already made a statement through the press that such payments by employers would be exempted from the pay-roll tax.,23
103,Mr CALWELL,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"That is news to me, and I am pleased to hear it.",23
104,Mr FADDEN,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"I recently gave instructions, in anticipation of an amendment of the law, that that be done.",23
105,Mr CALWELL,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"Thes e are ex gratia payments, and they are made by not only the Corporation of the City of Melbourne, but also State governments and many private employers of labour who have done what they regard as reasonable and fair. I draw the attention of the Minister for the Army to the contents of a letter received from a soldier who is serving overseas. The letter is dated the 13th June last, and, as it has already been passed by the censor, the statements contained in it may be accepted as true. writing to his father the soldier statesWe are still in camp. Am having my teeth attended to, lost bottom set when ship down. Still short of clothes and until some I cannot go on leave. Some of the lads went on leave without permission and Colonel has handed them all 28 days. I might mention that as well as 28 days in clink, lose 28 days' pay. I thought he was a bit tough, seeing the lads had no leave for six months and had been through three campaigns. Troops are only getting one or two days' and very little of it. Of course the officers, including the Colonel, have seven days. it was the day after he arrived back from his seven days that he handed out the 28 days. Still things may even up some day. I might mention my pal "" Slim"" took three days he fronts tomorrow. It'e guineas to gooseberries on 28. A lot of funny things happen in these wars that I don't agree with. Without mentioning anything of a military nature, it is with regard to losses in Greece. I lost everything, from a gold watch (a present) and blade razor, clothes-righ t down to my false teeth. I get nothing. Officers who only lost the as the troops, with perhaps the exception their valise that they sleep in, received replace their lost property. I am still practically naked. Officers left their trunks and cases in Alexandria before they left for Greece. They arrived the next day and they are O.K. The lads left their sea kit bags there, with some gear in them. They have not arrived and nobody seems to give a hang when they do. To some this may seem fair, but I'm blowed 1 if I can see eye to eye with it. Still what can you do? In the army, nothing but grin and bear it. I ask the Minister for the Army to take notice of that letter. It is unfair discrimination if officers receive an allowance with which to replace losses, and privates nothing. It is also unfair that men after three campaigns are confined to barracks for 28 days and lose pay for that period, because, having had no leave for six months, they take leave. I hope that the fines will be remitted and that something will be done to ensure that men shall be given reasonable leave. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the statements in that letter, but I know the writer, and he is a man who tells the truth. I hope that when we meet again, there will be no further cause for complaints such as I have made today.",23
106,Mr HOLLOWAY,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"Melbourne Ports) [5.17] - I bring to the notice of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holt) a dispute in the textile indusI n try which threatens to develop into a major stoppage of work, with serious effects on production of articles required went in the prosecution of the war. I have I get nothing to say about the merits or dethe merits of the dispute. My reason for rising is to solicit the aid of the Minister you in inducing the employers to accede to the request of the employees for a round-table conference. When I was handling indusleave trial matters with the Chamber of Manufactures, Sir Eobert Gibson and In fact I never refused each other a conference, and we used to do everything} possible, not only to settle disputes amicand ably, but also to avert them. The Chamber of Manufactures seems to have forgotten that conciliation is a part of its constitution, because it has refused to meet the representatives of the employees at a conference. I now suggest to the Minister that he agree to meet me and two same or three representatives of the employees of in Melbourne with a view to his assisting £27 to them in their desire for a round-table conference with the employers in order that conciliation may replace direct action.",23
107,Mr HOLT,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"Pawkner-Minister for Labour and National Service) [5.19'J - I bad already taken cognizance of the dispute in the textile industry when my attention was drawn specifically to it Depa rtment of Supply, which pointed out that the stoppage of work was interfering seriously with the production of certain woollen goods, blankets, for example, which were urgently required for military services. I should be glad to accede to the request of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway), that I meet him and some representatives of the union, because I am always happy to confer with representatives of parties to matters in dispute, if they consider that my doing so will serve a useful purpose. I make it clear to the honourable member and through him to the parties to this dispute that the responsibility of the Government is to ensure that an impartial tribunal is readily available for the settlement of industrial disputes. In this case, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court investigated the matters in dispute and gave its award. I should not like any indication by me that I should be prepared to meet the representatives of the union to be construed as a promise that I shall use my influence to affect the decision of the Arbitration Court. Nevertheless, if there is any aspect of the matter in which my good offices would be of assistance, I shall be glad to meet the representatives of the union.",24
108,Sir EARLE PAGE,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"Cowper-Minister for Commerce) [5.23] - The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) suggested that the Dairy Produce Control Committee consisted of vested interests which had no personal interest in the dairy farmers' product. The Dairy Produce Control Committee consists of seven members. The chairman is Sir Give MCPherson, who. as government representative on the Australian Dairy Produce Board for the last 20 years, has given universal satisfaction to every dairy producer in Australia, and whose sagacity and wisdom have been of incalculable benefit to the dairying industry. I do not wish to speak particularly about Sir Clive MCPherson. I shall confine my attention to the remaining members of the committee, all of whom are members of the Australian Dairy Produce Board, and who were chosen by that board on which the producers have four direct representatives. The first is Mr T. Flood Plunkett, M.L.A., chairman of the Ausby the tralian Dairy Produce Board, and a dairy-farmer living on his own farm in Queensland. He has been chairman of that board for eighteen years.",24
109,Mr CALWELL,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,He has other interests.,24
110,Sir EARLE PAGE,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"Hi s interests lie almost entirely in the management of his farm. He is also chairman of directors of the Beaudesert Butter Factory, but he is essentially a dairying man. He is a' dairy-farmer and he also looks after the interests of all dairy-farmers in Australia. Other members of the board are Major J. R, King, who is manager of the Producers Co-operative Society of New South ""Wales, and Mr W. J. Broadhead, manager of Norco. Those two organizations comprise the whole of the co-operative butter organizations in New South Wales. They are owned entirely by the farmers of New South Wales and there is not a penny of outside capital invested in them. Major King and Mr Broadhead speak entirely for co-operative companies. Then there is Mr A. W. Wilson, who is on the board as a representative of Victorian co-operative interests. He is also a dairy-farmer, and the co-operative companies which he represents do not possess one penny of outside capital. The fifth member is Mr H . E. Hand'bury who, in addition to being a representative of proprietary dairy produce manufacturers, is himself a dairy-farmer. Originally. Mr MCKenzie, the president of the Victorian Dairymen's Association, represented the producers' organizations, but when he died a few months ago it was suggested that it would be wise to appoint in his place a man associated with the technical side of butter production. Accordingly, Mr J. Proud, the president of the Australian Institute of Dairy Factory Managers and Secretaries, was appointed. As it has been suggested that since then the producers have not had direct representation on the Australian Dairy Produce Board, I point out that Mr M . P. Dunlop, of New South Wales, who was the person most likely to be chosen died suddenly two or three weeks ago. Only this week I have been in touch with primary producers' organizations in New South Wales, and as soon as the negotiations with them have been concluded the question of the direct representation of that section will be considered and finalized. Honourable members may have noticed that the writer of the letter which the honourable gentleman was good enough to hand to me, in which it was stated that hundreds of thousands of pounds had been expended-hal f of it came directly out of the pockets of the taxpayersadmitted that the money had been wisely expended. Indeed, the administration has received the endorsement of practically all of the dairymen of Australia.",24
111,Mr CALWELL,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,Will the right honourable gentleman receive a deputation from the Dairymen's Association when next he is in Melbourne?,25
112,Sir EARLE PAGE,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"I shall be pleased to do so, if necessary; but as the result of a discussion which I have had with the honourable member for Gipps touch with the dairymen of Victoria, suggestions were made which I think will be satisfactory to the dairying interests, in which event a deputation will be unnecessary; however, should the dairymen not be satisfied, I shall be pleased to receive a deputation from them. On the 22nd August the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), raised the question of the bona fides of Vestey's Limited, in handling the eggdrying process for the Commonwealth Government on behalf of the producers of eggs in this country. He implied that there was something sinister about the whole undertaking. Far from that being so, the Commonwealth Government, and every producer of eggs in Australia, is indebted to Mr Bowater, the general manager in Australia of the company, and to the company itself, for making available to the Commonwealth at shortnotice egg-drying plants which were about to be erected in China. Before the war, Australia exported about 12,000 tons of refrigerated oggs each year, but as the result of shipping restrictions the British Government intimated that space could not be found for eggs in refrigerated form on ships trading with England, and that the only way in which eggs could be shipped was in dried form as ordinary cargo. The Commonwealth Government was also told that the maximum space which could be allotted to eggs was about 1,000 tons. The Government immediately endeavoured to arrange for the drying of eggs in Australia this year. At first it seemed to be impossible to get the plants ready in time, owing to the enormous demands of the Department of Supply in respect of munitions. It was thought that we should be fortunate if we could establish in Australia one plant to handle one-tenth or one-twelfth of the supply of eggs. Fortunately, the Government was able to arrange for Vestey's Limited to transfer to Australia, plants intended for use in China; it also arranged for shipping space to enable the plants to be brought here. We had to get the plants as quickly as possible and also specialists with experience of the eere-drying process. The result is that we have been able to establish six of these plants in Sydney, and four in Melbourne. In addition, we have persuaded the British Government to provide hufficient refrigerated space to enable the eggs produced in South Australia and Western Australia - to be exported. It was not found practicable to erect egg-drying plants in those States. In the light of these facts, the statements which have been made regarding Vestey's Limited are to be deprecated. I assure the honourable member for Melbourne that his charges are without foundation. Had it not been for the timely assistance of Vestey's Limited we could not have shipped eggs to Britain. I point out, further, that Vestey's Limited merely process the eggs; at all times the legal possession of the eggs remains with the Commonwealth Government. The assistance afforded by this company has been of inestimable value to the poultryfarmers of Australia, whose industry has been saved from destruction.",25
113,Mr MCDONALD,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"Corangamite-Min ister for External Territories) [5.30] - On the 27th August, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) asked a question, without notice, in regard to the wasteful use of ministerial cars. The Minister for the Interior (Senator Foll) states that he has no record of the wasteful use of cars by Ministers. Cars have been made available to Ministers to enable them to carry out their ministerial duties and responsibilities. It will be appreciated that Ministers, by virtue of the offices they hold, are called upon to carry out many important functions in connection with which the use of cars is essential. Moreover, the high pressure at which Ministers must work, particularly in view of the present international position, renders it necessary that cars be used. The use of cars is not confined to monwealth Ministers. Ministers of State governments also are compelled to use cars to enable them satisfactorily to carry out their duties; in some cases cars and chauffeurs are specially allotted to indivijustified. dual State Ministers. The Commonwealth chauffeurs work under a roster system, which provides that each driver will have an opportunity to earn any overtime that may be necessary in driving ministerial cars. All costs in connection with the use of ministerial cars are debited to one vote in the Department of the Interior. Recently the honourable member stated that a minister sent a car from Melbourne to Brisbane in order to bring his wife back to Canberra. No record can be found in the Department of the Interior of any such trip.",25
114,Mr MCEWEN,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"Indi-Minister for Air) [5.32] - In a recent speech allegations concerning conditions at the Richmond Aerodrome were made. I take this opportunity to reply to those allegations which an investigation has shown to be substantially without foundation. The official report furnished to me indicates that the statements made by the honourable gentleman were due to some misunderstanding of the position actually obtaining at Richmond station. At no time did a "" sit-down"" strike occur at Richmond. The commanding officer, upon receiving information that certain men who were dissatisfied with the hours of work, were attempting to induce the men of No. 2 Aircraft Depot to hold a ""sitdown"" strike, promptly called a conference of all unit commanders. In order to maintain the maximum output from No. 2 Aircraft Depot, which is a vital link in the maintenance of flying at flying training schools, the men had been granted two days' leave a fortnight. After full consideration, the commanding officer decided to alter the hours of work in order to enable the men to have three days' leave a fortnight. This, of course, was distinct from, and in addition to the normal four days' quarterly recreation leave granted to all non-flying members of the service. The commanding officer did, in fact, address the men on parade, and stressed the necessity for each one to do his utmost in the present struggle. He informed them, as he had done on other occasions, Com- of the correct manner of bringing any complaints to official notice, and assured them that complaints so made would receive prompt and full investigation and that remedial action would be taken, if With regard to the reference to periods of leave, no Air Board instruction was addressed specifically to Richmond that the men were to have four days' leave, later increasing the period to five days. The general policy, as laid down by the Air Board, is that nonflying personnel shall be granted four days' quarterly leave if the exigencies of the Service permit. It is thought that the reference must have been to this policy, and not to any specific instruction issued to Richmond. As I have already stated, no such instruction was issued, and the week-end leave which was referred to is distinct and additional to normal quarterly recreational leave. The decision to grant three days' week-end leave a fortnight has been adhered to, and I am advised that the whole of the men's leave was not cancelled as alleged, either because some of the men desired to catch a particular train or for any other reason. The honourable gentleman's statement that men were marched backwards and forwards three or four times in the rain, owing to their having hurried to avoid the rain, is also without foundation, according to the investigations that have been made. Furthermore, the report shows that at no time did the commanding officer have occasion to march the men, although he was at times present at parades when the men were marched by their unit commanders. The honourable gentleman also referred to the entraining of personnel at Clarendon station. The official report in this connection confirms that no order was issued that airmen were not to walk upon the platform at Clarendon railway station until the officers had entered the railway carriages. Owing to the fact that one man had been injured, and another had fallen between a moving train and the platform, due to the men rushing to board the train, the commanding officer issued an order that personnel were to parade on .the platform, and not move to the carriages until trains had stopped. This order proved to be ineffective, as it was found that, notwithstanding the order, men still endeavoured to board the trains before they had stopped. For their own protection, the commanding officer then ordered that the men were to "" fall in "" off the station platform and wait under the control of non-commissioned officers until the train had stopped, when they would be allowed to board the train. Before that order was issued, a request was received from the stationmaster at Windsor that action be taken to stop the men from boarding moving trains. There is a militia camp in the vicinity of the Clarendon station, and the militia authorities have been requested to co-operate with the A ir Force when large batches of men are about to board trains. Those authorities have given an assurance that they will adhere to a practice similar to that of the Air Force. This procedure would not, however, apply when only small batches of men were to entrain. The suggestions that the commanding officer had ordered men not to board trains until officers had done so is not confirmed by fact. It is regretted that the honourable gentleman made certain disparaging statements concerning the commanding officer. I have no hesitation in assuring honourable members that that officer, Group Captain Wilson, enjoys the full confidence of the Air Board. That is evidenced by his recent transfer to a higher command with increased responsibilities. While he was at Richmond, he took a keen interest in promoting and fostering the welfare of the personnel serving at that station.",26
115,Mr FADDEN,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"""Darling Downsdoubt Treasurer) [5.40] - Earlier this afterminds noon, the honourable member for West general Sydney (Mr Beasley) asked a question relating to departmental procedure with regard to taxation deductions. He claimed that I , as Treasurer, had given an incorrect answer to a question which he had asked last week. I have since made investigations, and have received the following report from the Commissioner of Taxation:The answer given to the honourable member's questions last Friday contained no misstatement, and does not call for any action. The honourable member is obviously confusing the matter of the collection of income tax by instalments with the matter of the liability for payment of tax - when the latter is definitely established by the issue of an assessment notice. The reply made in the House last Friday definitely admitted there was a Treasury instruction issued relating to the collection of the tax by instalments, but no Treasury instruction issued regarding the assessment or computation of the tax which would in due course be notified strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I also take this opportunity to reply to points raised by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), and the honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt), regarding the deduction of tax instalments from Public Service salaries. They challenged the right of the Minister, in the issue of a Treasury instruction, to take into account the proposed decrease of concessional deductions under the Income Tax Assessment Act for the purpose of income taxation for 1941-42. The basic consideration in connection with this matter relates to the arrangements, which were discussed in this House, for financing the Commonwealth child endowment scheme. Honourable members will recall that the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holt), when introducing the child endowment legislation in this House, set out very clearly that finance was to be provided by means of a 2£ per cent, pay-roll tax, from which a return of £9,000,000 was anticipated, and that more than £2,000,000 would be derived from the abolition of the income tax deductions for each child under sixteen years of age, after the first, in each family. The balance of the £13,000,000 involved in the scheme was to come from general revenue. There was never any in my mind, nor, I suggest, in the of honourable members and the body of taxpayers, that the abolition of the exemption provided in the Taxation Act for dependent children in excess of one was being more than offset - except in the higher ranges of incomeby the amount of £13 per annum that was to be paid as endowment in respect of such children. Referring now to the Treasury instruction to Commonwealth paying officers to take this proposed reducthese tion for children into account in arranging the tax instalment deductions for public servants, I point out that, whereas, for the majority of salary and wage earners, the act and regulations provide for a certain deduction to be made on the basis of the gross salary or wages-to meet which employers purchase tax stamps and hand them to their employees--there is a provision in section 221K of the Income Tax Assessment Act for group schemes to be arranged with the Commissioner of Taxation for cash deductions to be made in lieu of the utilization of stamps. These group schemes for tax deductions generally facilitate the work of the paying officer in large industries and government departments, and have been introduced mainly for the purpose of making it easier for the taxpayer to meet his taxation obligations. There is no doubt in my mind that the group schemes effectively contribute to that result. also tend to bring about economies in the pay sections of the various departments. There is a further power in section 221D of the Income Tax Assessment Act to vary the amounts of the instalments in order to facilitate the payment of taxes, and it is under this power that the Treasury officials have sought the Commissioner's consent to vary the basis of deductions for the group scheme as far as Commonwealth public servants are concerned. I stress that the arrangement to which exception is being taken relates only to Commonwealth public servants, and that, in making it, the sole desire of the Treasury officials was to assist public servants to meet their taxation obligations. The various Commonwealth departments have certain information regarding concessional deductions allowable to employees which ordinary businesses have not. In order to make the fortnightly instalment deductions approximate as closely as possible to the actual assessment of tax to be met towards the close of the financial year, the Treasury offiMr Fadden. cials arranged, in connection with the 1940-41 instalment group scheme, to take these known concessional deductions into account. The deductions cover the allowances for children, superannuation payments, and life assurance. By making deductions and calculating the instalment by reference to the net income instead of the gross income, the amount deducted from the salaries of public servants is very considerably less than that which could be deducted under the regulation. The same provisions were taken into account by the Treasury officials in working out a group scheme of instalment deductions for 1941-42; but in making the deduction for children, the Treasury officials, after having obtained my approval, limited such deductions to the first dependent child only. The consequence is that, though the instalment deduction thus calculated is slightly higher in respect of a Commonwealth public servant with more than one child, it is still a lesser amount than that which would be payable on the gross income as provided for by the regulation. Notwithstanding what has been said in this House by the honourable member for West Sydney, I have no doubt that the They general body of the Commonwealth public servants are really appreciative of the Treasury officials' endeavours to ascertain as closely as possible the appropriate tax instalment deduction. In those instances where the number of children is such that, under the present law, no tax at all is payable, it is quite a simple procedure for the officer to apply to the Deputy Commissioner for a certificate of exemption. Such certificates would not be refused. As a matter of fact, thousands of exemption certificates have already been issued to Commonwealth public servants. I suggest that the particular aspect honourable members need to keep in mind in this connection is the fact that the instalment deductions are distinct from the tax assessable. Later in the financial year an assessment will be made in accordance with the law as declared by this Parliament. The instalment deductions will then be applied in meeting the actual tax assessed. Whether an additional amount will then have to be paid to meet the tax assessed, or whether a small refund will be due to the taxpayer, will depend entirely upon the approximation to the tax that has been reached in fixing the instalments. The remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney with regard to the Government robbing taxpayers of their concessional rights and of "" rigging "" the endowment scheme are unworthy of reply. I give a deliberate denial to the statement of the honourable member that the Deputy Commissioners in the various States have been given an instruction that, in making assessments of returns furnished for 1940-41, the concessional deduction for children should apply to one child only. Question resolved in the affirmative. PAPERS. The following papers were sented :Lands Acquisition Act-Lan d acquired for Defence purposes-St . Mary's, New South Wales.

The following answers to questions were circulated:DEPENDANTS OF MERCHANT SEAMEN.",27
116,Mr ROSEVEAR,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"the Minister for Commerce, upon noticeWhen does he anticipate that he will be able to make a decision as to whether the benefits of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act shall be paid to the widows of the crew of the M.V. Nimbin, which was mined off the coast in December, 1940? . Sir EARLE PAGE - It is understood that the following amounts of compensation have been paid by the owners of the lost ship to the widows of mariners who lost tlieir lives:-Unde r award-To wife of master, £1,720 10s. 6d.; and to wife of mate, £1,153 10s. 6d.

The Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act was intended to provide for war accidents and losses not otherwise covered. It was not intended to provide for double compensation.

117,Mr LANGTRY,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"the Minister for Commerce, upon notice I. Is it a fact that Australia has sold wheat to Japan and that such wheat has not been paid for? 2. If so, at what price was the wheat sold? 3. If it is a fact that the wheat has not been paid for, can he inform the House when it will be paid for? pre- 4. Is it a fact that Eussia has placed an order with the Commonwealth Government for a large amount of flour when available?",29
118,Sir EARLE PAGE,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as 1. Payment has been made for all Australian wheat sold to Japan. 2. It is not the practice to disclose details of transactions of this nature. 3. See answer to 1. 4. No. FLINDERS NAVAL BASE: WEEK-END LEAVE.,29
119,Mr SHEEHAN,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"the Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. Is it a fact that there has been a curtailment of the week-end leave of the ratings at Flinders Naval Base; if so, is it causing grave dissatisfaction among the men and seriously interfering with their visits to friends and relatives on Sundays by compelling them to leave Melbourne by an early train on Sunday night? 2. Will he see that the leave arrangements previously in operation requiring ratings to report by 9 a.m. on Monday are restored?",29
120,Mr HUGHES,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Ratings proceed on week-end leave on Friday afternoon and are required to return to Flinders Naval Depot by Sunday night. As ratings have had at least 48 hours' leave, there is no reasonable cause for dissatisfaction and none has been reported to the Naval Board. 2. The reason for requiring ratings to be in the depot by Sunday night is to enable training classes to get under way promptly on Monday morning. Under previous arrangements, ratings did not reach the depot t ill after 11 a.m. on Monday. In the existing war'conditions, it is not proposed to vary the present instruction. COST-PLUS SYSTEM.",29
121,Mr MENZIES,PRIORITY DAIRY PRODUCTS COMMITTEE,"On the 21st the honourable member for Cook (Mr. Sheehan) asked me the following question, without notice:Will the Prime Minister say whether the Government proposes to discontinue the letting of contracts under the cost-plus manufacture of munitions and war equipmentV I desire to inform the honourable memment ber that when the Department of personnel Munitions was established last year it faced an enormous task of procuring large quantities of complicated items munitions and military stores, the manutogether facture of which had never been attempted in Australia, and, consequently, there was no commercial counterpart to guide Sleigh'. either the manufacturers or the departmittee ment on the price aspect. In many cases, improvisation was necessary owing to the absence of the correct raw materials or components. Moreover, factories and workshops which were not set up for production of munitions had to be reasked, organized on an efficient basis to enable manufacture to be undertaken. The whole of the circumstances were such that adoption of fixed prices was quite practicable, and would have been unfair from the contractors' point of view also from the Commonwealth's point of view. Tho only manner in which a manusented facturer could have covered himself against possible loss arising out of the newness of the work and the unforeseen difficulties relating to both labour and material would have been to quote a fantastic price, which would have been open to grave objection. In the circumstances surrounding the inauguration of the of munitions programme, there was no altercapacity native to the so-called cost-plus system, of which there are many variants and representative concerning which there are many checks. No doubt, it will be necessary to continue the cost-plus system in relation to certain contracts, but where an' effective altermembers-Messrs native can be followed, this will be done. It is necessary to appreciate, however, that the various cases have to be decided on their merits, and the whole system has Limited, to be sufficiently flexible to cover such cases, and at the same time ensure that delay is avoided and maximum producof tion obtained. This the Government has which accomplished. OIL ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
