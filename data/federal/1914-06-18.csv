1,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister aware that a shadow of suspicion rests on honourable members generally in connection with the removal from your desk, Mr Speaker, of your copy of May's Parliamentary Practice, and the destruction of the notes which were contained in it, and does he not think that the man who is mean enough to let this suspicion - remain on his fellows should he dealt with? When are we to have the report of the Committee which investigated the matter t",11
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I remind the honourable member that the subject is still under investigation.,12
3,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"May I ask the honourable member for Robertson if he will be good enough to reveal the name of the member to whom he refers, if he knows it?",12
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Thes e questions cannot he allowed to .go any further at this stage, the matter being still under investigation. COMMONWEALTH WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION"".",12
5,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister if he will expedite the payment .of compensation under the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act. I have a case, and, I believe, other cases have been brought .under .notice hy other honourable members, in which, although a considerable time has elapsed since the occurrence of an accident to a workman in the performance of :his duties in the Commonwealth employment, compensation has not yet been paid to him.",12
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have not heard of .any oases of delay, but if the honourable member will be good enough 'to bring - any that he may know tof amder my notice, I shall have matters expedited to the fullest possible extent. ELECTORAL ROLLS.",12
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yesterday a good deal was said about the printing of the electoral rolls. I have wired to the authorities in the various Status asking how matters were progressing, and would like to read the replies that I have received. Leave granted.",12
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Fro m Sydney, New South Wales, comes this telegramAnticipate principal rolls all divisions this State will he printed and available for issue by 13th July. liolls for some divisions will be available much earlier. From BrisbanePrinter has undertaken to produce reprinted rolls in one month from Monday last. Copy is being supplied nt rate over 25.000 names daily. Approximately 370,000 name? on roll. From HobartAll rolls for State, except two small subdivisions, now in printer's hands. Expret complete Denison division Friday night. Four remaining divisions at regular intervals up to, but not later than, 10th July. I have not received a reply from - Adelaide. In Victoria the rolls are expected to be printed witliin a month from now.",12
9,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"This is the 18th June, so that the rolls for Victoria will not be ready until the 16th July, and if the writs are issued on the 24th July, there will be only n few days for the examination of the rolls by the public and the enrolment of names that have been left off. Does, the Prime Minister think that that will he sufficient time?",12
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not know. This agitation of honourable members - opposite is an absolutely now thing. We have not seen this feverish activity ih connection with enrolment on any previous occasion. Why is there all this trouble on the other side just now?,12
11,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Is the Prime Minister replying to the question ?,12
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes . I should like to know why there is this .constant questioning about the rolls. Do .honourable members think that we are going to try to keep names off - the - rolls ?,12
13,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I believe that ithat .is the - opinion.,12
14,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,Unknown,"Then the honourable member believes all the lies that nro being circulated about the country. In that case, I have no more to say to him.",12
15,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I ask the Prime Minister if he docs not think that electors who are entitled to be enrolled should be given an opportunity to get their names placed on the rolls?,12
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,-What a silly question.,12
17,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Does not the Prime Ministeithink that there should be an interval of at least fourteen days ""between the printing of the rolls and the issue of the writs, to provide a fair opportunity for the enrolment of uames that have'been left off ? Does ho not think that it is hisduty, as well as mine, and that of every member, to give the fullest opportunities for enrolment, so that as many people as possible may exercise the right of citizenship at the pending election, wlien the poll is likely to be the largest that we have 1 had in the Commonwealth?",12
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The answers to the questions are so obvious as not to need stating, and I shall make only this comment, that there will be more facilities for enrolment on this occasion than there were on the last occasion.",13
19,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I would remind the Prime Minister that in the outlying districts of Northern Queensland the distribution of the rolls is a tremendous task, because some places are served only by a fortnightly and others by a monthly mail. If the rolls do not catch the mails, they have to be sent out by special messengers, which costs an enormous sum. I urge that the printing of rolls for outlying districts should be done before the printing of rolls for districts in which they can be easily delivered, so that there may bo time for proper distribution ?",13
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I shall bring 'the matter under the notice of the electoral officers. It is a point that needs stressing.,13
21,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Electoral Department claims the right to make further revisions of the rolls after the writs have been issued, and I desire to ask the M i nister of Home Affairs whetlier he will have the rolls, as so revised, posted outside every registrar's office, so that those whose names have been erroneously struck off, although they are properly entitled to vote, may learn of this before polling day ?",13
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I should like to tell my right honourable friend that this Government is going to do something more than has ever previously been done in this respect. We are going to have the rolls made public with the names struck off.,13
23,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That has been done before.  the electoral officials are being flooded with thousands of fresh applications, will the Prime Minister be good enough to have hung outside each post-office the names of such applicants, and the names of those struck off the rolls? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I am afraid there will be no good done until I make - every member of this House a returning - officer. HEATING OF CHAMBER .",13
24,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"May I suggest, sirthat if we are to be here much longer a radiator should be provided at this end of the chamber? It is very cold down here, not to mention the prospect outside.",13
25,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Las t year I consulted the engineer about the placing of radiators in convenient portions of the chamber, but with regard to the fixing of a. radiator at that end, the difficulty was pointed out to me that it would interfere with the movements of honourable members passing from one side of the chamber to the other, especially during a division. The idea was found impracticable.",13
26,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I wish that you would take these radiators away. AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURES.,13
27,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"T he Minister of Trade and Customs was reported in the Age of Tuesday as having said at a gathering of manufacturers that in the course of twelve or fifteen years Australian manufacturers had increased their output from £95,000,000 to £148,000,000. I desire to know if the honourable gentleman was correctly reported, and if he is not aware that Mr Knibbs has published some figures, showing that in 1907 the output of factories was only £93,000,000, and that between that year and 1912 the output had gone up to £148,000,000, an in crease of £55,000,000 in five years, and not in fifteen years, as reported i u the newspaper ?",13
28,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member mentioned to me that he intended to ask this question. I have not with me the exact figures which I quoted; but if the honourable member will wait t ill tomorrow, I will give them then. If a mistake has been made, I shall he only too pleased to correct it . I spoke from figures I had by me. COMPULSORY TRAINING . IMPRISONMEN T OF CADETS.  senting the Minister of Defence now in a position to inform the House as to the number of cadets who were imprisoned by the last Administration for breaches of the Defence Act?",13
29,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The notice-paper for today contains a question on this subject and I am going to ask that the question be postponed. I do not mind informing my honourable friend at once that this regulation has been in force for a number of years, and has been acted upon in a number of instances. FLOOR OF DRILLHALL .",13
30,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"W it h regard to the building of the Essendon D r ill H all , I desire to know from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether the latter will have a jarrah or Tasmanian hardwood floor substituted for the proposed asphalt floor? Perhaps I may be permitted to mention that when Sir Ian Hamilton was here he expressed his surprise that our d r ill halls were being floored with asphalt instead of with wood, so as to permit of social gatherings taking place.",14
31,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I shall immediately look into this question. NAVAL BOARD.,14
32,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Can the M in ister representing the Minister of Defence tell me whether it is a fact that the Home naval authorities have refused to nominote a member for the Naval Board; and if so, will he lay their letter on the table so that we may read it?",14
33,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I am informed that there is no substantiation for the rumour. TELEPHONE EXTENSION.,14
34,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Is the Postmaster General prepared to reconsider the decision of the Department not to sell supplies to persons who privately construct telephone lines? I may explain, sir, that in view of the congestion in the Department, many persons are hurrying on private construction. These lines, when they become payable, are very often taken over by the Department, but the material used does not pass through the critical in spection that the departmental material does, and finally the Department will get wire and material of which it should disapprove. It is all a question of public utilities whether privately or publicly constructed.",14
35,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,I have not given any instruction that the Department should not supply wire and material to people who desire to carry out lines that may be taken o^er.,14
36,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,You will not do it .,14
37,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,I do not know that.,14
38,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"In view of the answer given by the Postmaster-General to my last question, I hasten to assure the honourable gentleman that supplies have been refused.",14
39,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,14
40,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I am coming to the question, sir.",14
41,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member will not be in order in asking a question arising out of the answer given by the Minister to a previous question.,14
42,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,I wish to ask the Postmaster-General if he will direct that supplies be granted to those privately undertaking the construction of telephone lines in order to cheapen and facilitate their construction ?,14
43,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,I shall look into the matter. I cannot say what quantity of stock the Department has in . hand. I do not know that we have sufficient for our own requirements. LIGHTINGOF POST OFFICES .,14
44,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Is th& Postmaster-General yet in a position toannounce the improved light to be adopted for the illumination of post-offices?,14
45,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,No .,14
46,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Will the Postmaster General be good enough to allow an installation of air gas at the post-office at Gladstone, which is a very important town in my constituency? At present kerosene lamps are used for lighting the building.",14
47,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"I cannot understand why the Department has not provided aerogen gas in the majorit y of country post-offices before this time. Departmental officers- I do not knowwhether it is in the Home Affairs Department or in mine-hav e been experimenting, or are supposed to have been experimenting, with this system for sometime, but I know perfectly well that I could make up my mind in twenty minutesas to the kind of aerogen gas I would install if I were putting up a place. I have done it on my own account, and I am going to try to force the thing for tha benefit of honourable members. FINLEY POST OFFICE.",14
48,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,Can the Minister of Home Affairs inform me what stage the proposal for a new post-office at Finley has reached?,15
49,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I have never known anybody so eager for works as is my honor- control. able friend. I congratulate him. I ask him to put a question on the notice-paper. He has got the land for his district, and he is getting the building during the same year. He is a marvel. NEW HEBR;DES.",15
50,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Has the Minister of External Affairs noted the announcement quoted from French newspapers of the possibility of a partition of the New of Hebrides? Has he any communication make to the House on the subject, or he say how far the negotiations have proprincipal ceeded through the Colonial Ofiice?",15
51,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"As far as I can rememmatter ber, there has been no mention official communication of partition being possibly, or probably, the solution of the New Hebrides question. The question of cession has been mentioned in the press; and at this stage, now that the Conference is sitting, I think I may say that the attention of the Imperial Government called to the fact that the Commonwealth would favourably consider a solution might involve the cession of the islands to Great Britain, even if it were sary that we should assume some reasontralia, able financial responsibility. The perial Government are quite seized of views of the Government on the matter. Indeed, some time ago, about the beginwill ning of March, when an answer was given to a question in the House of - Commons, which seemed to me somewhat to indicate that there might be a possible misapprewhen hension on the point, for which our munications seemed to leave no opening, the Prime Minister telegraphed to the Imshould perial Government, calling attention to certain despatch and what had been and in reply an assurance was given that the matter had not been overlooked. feel sure that the Imperial Government will remember, when the occasion serves, into the question. our suggestions as to the solutions possible. As to partition, if I was moment t.o offer an opinion on the point, I would say that it, may involve some difficulties which writers seem not to fully f861 appreciate. Assuming there is a difference in effectiveness between the two systems of national administration, partition diminishes but does not remove the alleged evil, though it does remove the weakness incident to any system of joint",15
52,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Do you not think that yon had better settle the Northern Territory before you settle the New Hebrides?,15
53,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The Minister is replying to a question.,15
54,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,That is a poser for him.,15
55,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I am only dealing with this question now. I might also say to the honourable member that if one takes up a map and considers the possible lines division in the light of the interests that to are acquired or claimed in the New can Hebrides, and also the situation of the harbors, it may be thought that partition will raise a good many difficulties. At least, it is not quite so simple a as the writer in the French newsin any paper seems to consider it. NA CONFERENCE. UNIVERSAL PENNY POSTAGE.",15
56,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,INTERNATIONA L POSTAL,"vvne n was the Postmaster-General attends the International Postal Conference, to be that held shortly at Madrid, will he urge the desirableness of holding the next necesmeeting of the Conference in Ausso that these Old World specialImists may become better acquainted with the the Commonwealth ? I desire also to know whether the honourable gentleman urge, as the vast majority of the people of Australia desire, that we should have universal penny postage.",15
57,Mr AGAR WYNNE,INTERNATIONA L POSTAL,"I believe that, the honourable gentleman attended comthe last International Postal Conference, he moved that its next sittings be held in Australia. I shall follow a in his footsteps by submitting the same said; proposition. As to universal penny postage, there is some difficulty regardI ing the matter of weights, but, when at the Conference, I shall go carefully at this PERTH GENERAL POST OFFICE. USE OF DONNYBROOK STONE.",15
58,Mr BURCHELL,INTERNATIONA L POSTAL,"Will the Honorary Minister state whether tenders have yet closed for the supply of Donnybrook stone, which, it is proposed, shall be used in constructing the new General Post Office, Perth; and, if so, whether he is in a position to make any announcement regarding the use of that material ?",15
59,Mr KELLY,INTERNATIONA L POSTAL,"Tender s closed in Perth, I think, yesterday or the day before, but I have not yet had an opportunit y to go into this question, which is a very complicated one. The use of Donnybrook stone in the construction of the Perth General Post Office was first brought under my notice by the honourable member for Perth, who raised the question just after we took ofiice. I told him then that I was very anxious to use this Western Australian stone, if it could be employed at reasonable cost, in the construction of the building, and I sincerely hope that the result of our calling for tenders will demonstrate that it is possible to use it . TOBACCO INDUSTRY .  representations made some time ago to the Minister of Trade and Customs by the honourable member for Maranoa and myself, regarding ithe tobacco-growing industry in New South Wales, the low prices paid for the leaf, and the quality - of the leaf grown, I desire to ask the Minister whether he has been able to - obtain, for the benefit of growers, any information on the subject?",16
60,Mr GROOM,INTERNATIONA L POSTAL,"The honourable member mentioned this question to me last night, and I am in a position now to furnish the House with a reply to our - communication on the subject, which we have received from the Government of New South Wales. The honourable member, together with the honourable member for Maranoa, made representations to me some time ago, and during the recess I forwarded to the honourable member for New England copies of the replies which we had received to our communications from the Governments of Queensland and Victoria. I propose now to read the following letter, dated 4th instant, which we have received from the Premier of New South Wales:Sir,-Wit h reference to your letter of the 12th December, 1913, with regard to the tude of tobacco companies towards Australian tobacco-growers, I have the honour to inform you that from inquiries made it would appear that the trouble has been caused by the production locally of large quantities of inferior tobacco leaf. The manufacturers have stated that they are prepared to take almost unlimited quantities of first quality leaf, but that the consumption of low quality is very small, and they are now overstocked with it. Having regard to the above facts, this Government is now inviting applications for the position of tobacco expert, whose duties will include the instruction of growers in up-to-dato methods of growing, harvesting, and curing leaf. This, it is hoped, will result in the production of a muuh higher quality leaf. If this can be successfully accomplished, the industry will be placed on a much more satisfactory footing. Two petitions with reference to the question of Excise Were presented by the honourable member, and these have been referred to the Inter-State Commission, who have advised me that the matters referred to are now set down for hearing, and that the producers will be advised of the date on which the Commission will be able to take evidence on the subject. PAPUA. OIL INDUSTRY : SUPPLY OF MACHINER YNA ISLAND.",16
61,Mr RILEY,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"Can the Minister of External Affairs inform the House what progress has been made in the erection of machinery in Papua for the development of the local oil industry, and when any definite result will be known ?",16
62,Mr GLYNN,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"Dr Wade, an expert, is on the field at the present time. The reports coming from him are rather technical in character, but they indicate that, as the sinking goes on, the good prospects evident on the surface are being maintained. I am told that it is very difficult to be absolutely sure of the oil prospects of a field until a great depth has been reached. I cannot say exactly to what depth the shaft has been sunk. On the advice of the expert, a new shaft is being sunk on a new part of the field, and about a month ago a depth of 254 feet had been reached. I was then informed that the prospects of the field were then even more favourable than they were at the outset. As to the question of machinery, I may say that, speaking generally, a boring plant is the only machinery on the field at present. A new plant for heavier atti- sinking was ordered about two months ago, but I cannot say whether it has yet reached the field. I can assure the honourable member, however, that no time is lost in acceding to every request that comes from the expert in Papua to supply whatever is necessary to full y develop the field.. On the whole, I am rather sanguine that a ' ' big t h in g ' ' has been discovered in Papua.",16
63,Mr WATKINS,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"Following up the question asked by the honourable member for South Sydney, I desire to ask the Minister of External Affairs whether the Government have yet considered the almost absolute necessity of establishing a wireless station on Woodlark Island? Is the honourable gentleman aware that the white people throughout the Territory feel that it is more necessary that a station should be established there than in other parts of the Territory which have been mentioned in this connection ?",17
64,Mr GLYNN,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"I considered this matter, and reconsidered it when the Lieutenant-Governor of Papua was here recently. I intend to ask the Treasurer for a sum of money to enable wireless communication to be established between Woodlark Island and Samarai. that the Treasurer will be generous enough to give us all that we want, but I think that, even if we do not get all that we ask, a station should he established first of all at Woodlark Island.",17
65,Mr SINCLAIR,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"I ask the Minister of External Affairs whether any decision has been arrived at with regard to the ap explored Papua for oil, for a lease of a portion of the oil-bearing country. The honourable gentleman might say, generally, in what position the matter is at the present time?",17
66,Mr GLYNN,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"Speakin g from memory, I think that the application referred to must have been made some months past. I cannot, for the moment, give the particulars. I know that generally I have refused to give any leases of oil-bearing country u n t i l we know exactly what has been discovered there. The question whether leases should be granted or not will then come up for consideration. COMMONWEALTH BANK. LOANS TO FARMERS-EXCHANGE .",17
67,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"Will the Treasurer suggest to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank that loans should be granted to farmers and settlers at the [86]- 2 same rate as is charged to municipal councils, namely, 4$ per cent., instead of & per cent., as is being charged farmers at the present time?",17
68,Sir JOHNFORREST,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"I shall be glad to bring the honourable member's suggestion before the Governor of the Bank. As he knows, I can do no more than that.",17
69,Mr TUDOR,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"I wish to ask the Treasurer a question similar to that put to him by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. Will the right honourable gentleman undertake to ask the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank not to differentiate between town and country in the matter of loans? Will he ask that money be available at 4£ per cent, to dwellers in town as well as to farmers?",17
70,Sir JOHN FORREST,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"The honourable gentleman must know that the management and control of investments .is not in the hands of the Government, but in those of the Governor of the Bank.",17
71,Mr FALKINER,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"I ask the TreaI hope surer whether it is possible for the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, outside Savings Bank deposits, to lend money at 4£ per cent., and make a legitimate profit? I ask also, whether, in view of the serious state of our finances, as mentioned by the honourable member for Kennedy yesterday,, the Treasurer will try to stop the leakageof £S,000 a year for exchange, which, I assume, is still being charged on Government business?",17
72,Sir JOHN FORREST,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,The matter of exchange will have to be considered.,17
73,Mr FALKINER,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,Why not alter the account if the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank charges the Government exchange?,17
74,Sir JOHN FORREST,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"The arrangement was made before I took office and I did not feel justified in interfering with it off-hand. At the same time, I am not at all pleased with it . We used to get exchange free throughout Australia with the exception, I think, of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Wohave now to pay exchange.",17
75,Mr FALKINER,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is giving the Tasmanian Government exchange free now.,17
76,Sir JOHNFORREST,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"We shall have to look into the matter again. It is not very satisfactory. The Government have been anxious to do all they can to assist the Commonwealth Bank. They have no desire to put any more obstacles than already exist in the way of its progress. In regard to the question as to whether the loans referred to will pay or not, I should say that, being a banker, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank would not be likely to lend money unless he could make a profit by doing so. ALLOWANCE TO MEMBERS.",17
77,Mr HIGGS,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"I wish to ask a question about what is known as the "" root of all evil."" We have been told by the Minister of External Affairs that the Treasurer is in a generous mood, and I should like to know whether the right honourable gentleman is aware that I was deprived of several weeks' salary last year, and that, in all probability, I shall be deprived of several weeks' salary this year. I ask the honourable gentleman whether he is aware that during those weeks in this year in which T shall receive no emoluments I shall be carrying on my duties as a representative of the public. Is the Treasurer aware that last year during several weeks I was occupied in attending to my public correspondence and receiving deputations without receiving remuneration for my work ? In view of the fact that of Australia are under the impression that I , and other members of this House, will be receiving full remuneration for serving the country, will he place on the Estimates a sum to recoup me for the loss which I shall sustain as a result of the double dissolution. I put it to the right honourable gentleman to say whether he does not think it is fair and just that he should do something of the kind ? I hate to have to refer to these matters.",18
78,Sir JOHN FORREST,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,"The honourable memher is aware that if it was a sonal matter I should be very glad to oblige him, but the allowance to members of Parliament is governed by Statute. The honourable member was well aware of the provisions of the Statute when he acceded to the request of his constituents to test the election. I have not the power to deal with the matter other than as proin vided by law.",18
79,Mr MCDONALD,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,I ask the Treasurer whether he is aware that he makes provision for the payment of the salary of Mr Speaker during the time Parliament is being elected. I should like to know from him under what law and by what authority that is done ?,18
80,Sir JOHN FORREST,WIRELESS STATION AT WOODLARK,I believe that it is by the authority of a vote of this House. NA RAILWAY . MB . TEESDALE SMITH'S CONTEACT : SELECT COMMITTEE-CONDUC T OF WORK.,18

84,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Yes .,18
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I should say, if I were the Honorary Minister, I should let the Senate do as it pleased.",18
86,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It is pretty well doing that now.,18
87,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,This is not very conciliatory.,18
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I want to point out a fact. If the statement of a fact antagonizes the Senate, well, it will have to be antagonized, that is all. It is only peranother instance of many that are occurring every day to show how impossible is the working of the two Houses of this Parliament as at present composed.",18

102,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Melbourne Ports) [11.13] - Firs t of all, I should like to offer my sympathy to the Victorian members on the Government side. My reason for doing so is that a certain decision has been come to which, to my mind, belittles those honourable members. I say in all sincerity that those who are their friends, and are particularly friendly to Mr Watt, have gone out of their way to make it appear that, as the present honourable member for Balaclava is leaving the House, there must be Victorian brains brought into it , because there will be none when the honourable gentleman leaves. We heard of the Conservative leagues imploring Mr W at t to leave the State House and enter this Chamber, and we are told that if he is returned here he will take up a portfolio at once. If that is the intention, it is a b it rough on the Victorian members on the Government side, whom I have known for some years to be capable men when they have the opportunity. I do not think it is fair for their friends to make it appear that PAPERS. it is necessary to introduce brains into the House because there are none amongst the Victorian members already here. I believe that there is just as good brains in this House today as there will be when Mr W at t enters the chamber. To make the position more contradictory, it appears now that the reason why he left the State Legislature was that there was need for brains there, because I see in the Argus this morning that the Liberals are looking for a brainy man to lead the Victorian Legislative Assembly. However that may be, I do not think the articles that have appeared in the press lately treat Victorian members fairly,, and they have my sympathy. The present situation in Federal politics is most peculiar. Like all other individuals I have my own opinions, and however strong they may be I will express them. I have expressed the opinion that the contemplated dual dissolution is not fair to the people of Australia. I have publicly disagreed to the steps taken to bring this situation about, because I felt that it was not in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution. I believe that the Attorney General created the present position, and that it did not arise constitutionally. May I remind honourable members that the Chief Justice of the High Co.urt told the representatives of the Labour unions, and the legal gentleman who was appearing for them, that they had no right to create a position which would enable them to come to the Court. If the position had not arisen naturally, they had no right to make a position for the simple purpose of getting their case'before the Court. If they did create such a position, they would have to be put out of Court.",19
103,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The majority of Court disagreed with the Chief Justicewrongly, I admit.",20
104,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The majority of the Court have done many wrong thiugs. If it is wrong to create au artificial position in order to get a case before the High Co"".urt, how much more wrong is it for gentlemen occupying the Treasury bench to prepare a case and create a position upon which the Governor General is asked to give a decision ? Either they presented a case to him that was not a fair statement of the condition of things in this chamber, either it was wrong and misleading, or His Excellency did not go into the case with due regard to the spirit of the Constitution. If the Ministry created a position for the purpose of misleading the Governor General they are unworthy of holding their present positions, and ought to leave them. The only opportunity we will get of proving whether they have done so is to ascertain exactly the contents of the memorandum sent to the' Governor General, and I will not be satisfied until I know the purport of that document. I feel that the Government are afraid to place before us the reasons which they submitted to the Governor General in support of their request for a. double dissolution, either because they do not desire to show us that they misled His Excellency, or because tliey wish toconceal the fact that, in acceding to their request, His Excellency acted weakly, inasmuch as the reasons upon which he based his action were weak. It has been demonstrated again and again in this Chamber that the Government Preference Prohibition Bill could accomplish nothing, inasmuch as preference to unionists had already been abolished by administrative act. But the Government recognised that whilst that measure would accomplish nothing, members of the Labonr party were bound to fight it because it was intended as an attack upon a great principle.",20
105,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It was the enunciation of a great principle.,20
106,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It was the enunciation of a principle which could operate in no direction at all. The Attorney General created an artificial crisis because he knew that members of the Labour party would be bound to oppose the that measure on principle. I come now to the second so-called test question-the proposed restoration of the postal vote. To me it is amazing that that section in politics which, for centuries, has opposed the enfranchisement of women should be consumed with anxiety to restore the postal vote. As a matter of fact, the birthrate amongst the labouring classes of the community is much higher than it is amongst other sections. The honourable member for Yarra has convincingly demonstrated that the highest birth-rate in Victoria obtains in districts which are represented by Labour men. Are we not desirous of securing as large a poll as are my honourable friends opposite?",20
107,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Then why do the Labour party object to postal voting?,20
108,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Because of the abuse which has attended the operation of that system. In this connection I am reminded of an old rhyme that discloses the difference which exists between the birth-rate amongst the labouring - classes and that amongst the Conservative sections of the community-for example, between the birth-rate in the electoral divisions of Melbourne Ports and Kooyong. It runs'There was an old woman who lived in a shoe, She had so many children she didn't know what to do. There was another old woman who lived in Kew, She had no children-sh e knew what to do. I have alluded to this aspect of the matter only because we shall be told by the Women's National League, during the coming fight, that the Labour party refused to allow the mothers of Australia to exercise the franchise. They know perfectly well that this is so much claptrap. They know that whilst the Labour party lose by the abolition of the postal vote it prevents the corruption which, takes place when that system is in vogue. In Queensland the Conservative section are afraid to handle the question.",20
109,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The postal vote has been restored in that State.,21
110,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Because our Conservative friends have found that the corruption attendant upon the system operates more in their favour than against them. To my mind, if we had a Court of appeal to which the question of the double dissolution could be referred, that tribunal would declare that the decision of the Governor General was wrong; first, because he was wrongly directed by the - Government; and, secondly, because it was against the weight of evidence.",21
111,Mr BKENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Then it was bad in law and in fact?,21
112,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Exactly .,21
113,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member has cast a reflection upon the Governor General, which he must withdraw. Our Standing Orders are very definite on the subject, and the expression that His Excellency's decision was "" against the weight of evidence "" is not in order.",21
114,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If I am not allowed to give expression to my views in that way, of course I shall have to withdraw the remark. But I am forced into taking up my present position by the action of the Government in refusing to disclose the reasons upon which they based their request for a double dissolution. However, sir, I bow to your decision and withdraw the observation. We have been told that this Parliament was unworkable, and that a double dissolution was necessary, because the Senate would defeat any legislation which the Ministry attempted to place upon the statute-book. I admit that there have been two sessions of wasted effort. But the Labour party are not responsible for that, although, doubtless, the Conservative press and the Conservative leagues will endeavour, during the coming fight, to show the electors that we wasted the time of Parliament. As a matter of fact, the time was wasted by the Government themselves. They could have brought forward Bills which would have been beneficial to the people, and for which the Labour party would have been compelled to vote ",21
115,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member's own party said that they would not allow anything to be passed.,21
116,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What a nonsensical remark to make.,21
117,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member for Kennedy said it .,21
118,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member for Kennedy is not the party. At any rate, I did not hear him say it , and I would rather take his own construction of what he said than that of the honourable member for Wilmot. The Government might have introduced legislation that the Opposition would hav© been compelled to support, and, in view of the peculiar position of the two Houses, that would have been a common-sense, or statesmanlike, policy. . It is nothing to the people of Australia that their Parliament is so peculiarly controlled, and that, by an accident, certain honourable members should be on one side and others should be sitting in opposition; the people have sent us here to pass legislation beneficial to them-somethin g tangible-and not the puny measures that have been brought down by the Government. We have heard the honorablo member for Wannon and other honourable members talking about the necessity for producing more grass for the cattle and sheep to feed on, and about the necessity for increasing our industrial production and manufactures, but the Government have made no attempt in that direction. Though, no doubt, this Parliament, in view of the legislative powers given to the Commonwealth, cannot do much in the direction of legislation such as is desired by honourable members on this side, had the Government so wished, we could have enacted much that the people of Australia have sent us here to pass. legislation would have been carried, not only in this Chamber, but also in another place.",21
119,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,You are a b it late with your assurances.,22
120,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the honourable member could have had his way, he would have brought in much that honourable members of the Labour party would have had to support. Why could not the Government have brought in an amending Defence Bill 1 There was nothing to stop them. The experience we have had of our Defence Act has shown us its weaknesses, and that we could pass a really good measure that would give us a better defence system, both naval and military, and, at the same time, considerably reduce expenditure. There was no need for the Government to put off that measure until next year or next session. When next session comes, Ministers will have such a lot of work to do that they will not he able to undertake matters which are crying out for legislation.",22
121,Mr BURNS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The present Government will not be in power.,22
122,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"My remarks will apply to any Government that is in power. Proper discussion of the defence question will occupy a considerable time, and will produce much good; but while present Ministers know that there is an amendment to the Act necessary, they proceed with their Government Preference Prohibition Bill , and with their Postal Vote Restoration Bill , in order to create a position which, according to the Chief Justice of the High Court, they have no right to create, which should have come about naturally, and should not have been created by the Government with any party motive. One of the few things that I have heard of as being on the Liberal platform is the matter of national insurance. I have not heard how M in isters intended to raise the necessary money, but the question is of such great importance that the House should have considered it on non-party lines, and come to a decision beneficial to the people. The scheme might have been embodied with the old-age pensions and maternity allowance. We might have provided for unemployment insurance, and for death in surance, and also for payments to widows. At any rate, we should have had the opportunity to place on the statute-book a Such measure which would have been beneficial to the people. Divided, as the House is, almost equally, we might have got a better discussion upon the question than we could get with a Government in a very much stronger position. Even Free Traders have said that they are desirous of wiping out anomalies in the Tariff. I have often said that the only anomaly in the Tariff is that the duties are not high enough; but, of course, I could not get my way. There are many items, however, in respect of which the duties should be wiped out. For instance, there are duties on raw materials, whereas there are very small duties on the finished articles, or duties not as high as those on the raw materials. Again, there are many industries that are, perhaps, protected; more than they deserve, and there are others that should have more consideration. All these matters could have been considered by the House if the Government had wished f o bring about legislation of benefit to the people. It only proves that the Attorney-General had his mind made up prior to going to Warrnambool, about five or six months ago, and making that speech of his which was reported by a friendly press, which he cannot deny, and in which he told us that it was his intention to bring about a double dissolution by hook or by crook.",22
123,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Mainl y by crook.,22
124,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"K n o w in g that the Government could have done much to bring about beneficial legislation, is it any wonder that I feel, with many others, that some trick has been perpetrated onus by the Government? As far as I am concerned, I know that, B . V . , I shall bereturned at the forthcoming elections, so, while I feel strongly on this matter, it is not from a personal stand-point, but from a party stand-point. The Government have refused to let us know what they told the Governor General, and I hope that pressure will be brought to bear tocompel them to disclose it . If any vote of mine will keep them here until they disclose it , it will be cast in that direction whenever the opportunity occurs, becauseI feel that we should know what reallywas said to the Governor General, in order that we may draw our own conclusions as to what did take place, and what should have taken place. large The late Government's policy in regard the Post and Telegraph Department, which is a huge concern, was to construct all possible works out of revenue. The present Government wanted to borrow for the purpose, saying that future genethey rations should pay tlieir fair share to them at least £ 1 per week. wards the cost of works by which they are benefited. The Department will reservice quire huge expenditure for centuries, and once a borrowing policy is begun, i will become necessary to borrow tco much. It is just as well, therefore, to the work out of revenue while we can. The way to get the necessary money out of revenue is to make the postal, teleon graphic, and telephonic services pay.",22
125,Mr JOHN THOMSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Do you advocate increasing the charges?,23
126,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"We ought never'to have lowered the postal rates. I fought the Bill , and went so far as in Victoria the postage should remain - twopence. We had no right to throw away £400,000 of revenue per year from gram ? postage. In fact, the first year we lost - nearly £500,000, and the loss is nearly £400,000. The reduction does not benefit the people as a whole. It simply been introduced. benefits merchants and others carrying on large concerns in the cities.",23
127,Mr ATKINSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Did you vote against penny postage?,23
128,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I both spoke and well. voted against it . That £400,000 per Annum would have been better expended gram pay? to provide increased facilities in country districts. Penny postage is of no use to the man on the land. How many thounothing sand letters would he write in even a lion years?",23
129,Mr BENNETT,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Would you increase the postage on advertising circulars?,23
130,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have not conare sidered that phase of the question. I man wanted to advertise, I would make l i i m pay for his facilities. The people the country cannot get the telephonic facilities that they require, and yet Tevenue is being given away to the large merchants by the reduction of postal rates and far too low telephonic charges. The telephone subscribers in the cities are not paying half what they ought to pay for the benefits they ceive. It costs only £ 6 per year, or about man 2s. 2d. per week for my telephone, and I can say honestly that I could not do without it . Many business men running concerns in Melbourne are paying, to at the most, from 5s. to 6s. per week for their telephones, which save the cost of many messengers. In many places, without, the telephone, they would have to employ men as messengers; but even if employed only boys, it would cost One big business man told me that his telephone cost him £ 1 6 per year. When I asked him if it was cheap, he winked the t other eye. Of course it is cheap, and he ought to be made to pay proper rates if do the service is being run at a loss. We cannot hope to make the Department a paying concern while we are losing money the postal, telephonic, and telegraphic services. A man uses the telegraph wires not for the benefit of the country, but for his own wants or requirements. Why, then, should he not pay adequately for the services he gets ? If the Telegraph Department is not paying, the rates to move that should be increased.",23
131,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What about the letter,23
132,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If it is not paying, still the charge should be increased.",23
133,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It should never have,23
134,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I got a telegram from one of your union secretaries only the other day saying that they are very pleased with it , and it is paying very",23
135,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the letter,23
136,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I say "" Yes . """,23
137,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Then I have to say against it ; but I know m i lthe Telegraph Department is not paying. People in isolated places who are clamouring for services ought to get them, and the people in the cities who already getting them ought to pay a f a fair price for them. I am not dealing with this matter on party lines at all. in One estimable gentleman who used to be in this House thought the most heinous crime that the Labour party ever committed was in raising the telephone rates. When the honourable member for Barrier, who was then Postmaster-General, rose in large this chamber to explain why he had raised the rates, most of us were against rehim. I thought that the £ 5 per year had been unjustly attacked, particularly in Victoria ; but the honourable gentleman proved conclusively that it was necessary to raise the rates, and now we are told by the present Postmaster General that every telephone for which the Department is receiving £4 per annum, costs more than £4 per annum in maintenance.",23
138,Mr AGAB WYNNE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I did not say that applied everywhere. I said the maintenance cost in Sydney was £ 4 2s. 8d.,24
139,Mr YATES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Adelaide) [11.48] - The Governor General has undoubtedly been advised by the Government that the present Parliament is unworkable, and that has evidently been made the main feature of the memorandum upon which the Governor General has acceded to their wishes: but as we are not allowed to know what representations were made to His Excellency by the other side, it is impossible for us to say what reasons they have urged why Parliament is unworkable. D u r in g the time. I have been here I have seen no effort on the part of the Government to make it workable. The only evidence we have had of their doing anything beneficial to Australia as a whole has been their recognition of the fact that there is a Meat Trust in existence. We have forced the Government to recognise and admit the position, and they have emphasized that admission by appointing n Royal Commission.",24
140,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Does the honourable member not know that his own party appointed a Royal Commission, which . in-Chief, has found no evidence of the existence of trust ? fework",24
141,Mr YATES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It does not follow that there is no necessity for an inquiry now, and we are speaking of the state of affairs today. Further, a short R ill has been introduced and passed, in view of the fact that the powers of the Commonwealth %jto were not sufficiently elastic to allow Ihe^jtheir Royal Commission to do the work re-tjme quired of them. The Governor General gjbeen has been advised that Parliament is un-fjissue - workable, but this Bill , the only workable piece of legislation introduced, was passed with expedition in both Houses, although the Senate has been charged with defying the House of Representatives. facts cannot be refuted. This morning it has been alleged that the Senate is ing to make the House of Representatives a. football in the game at the coming electhe tion ; and the Prime Minister has said that if he were Honorary Minister, notwithstanding what this House might advise, and notwithstanding the rights of the Senate, he would refuse to give evidence before the Select Committee appointed by another place to inquire into' the Teesdale Smith contract. The Honorary Minister evidently takes the attitude that the Senate has no righ t to inquire into the actions of the Government, but I maintain that the Senate is the StatesHouse, and that the States are deeply in terested in the question. There is every right on the part of the Senate, by mean* of a Select Committee, to submit questions to those responsible for that contract, and, on the evidence given, to pronounce judgment; and the public ought to know that it is quite contrary to the fact that Parliament is heing rendered unworkable by the actions of that House. Had the Government made any attempt to make the best use of this Parliament, it could have continued for the remainder of the term. And what is the issue on which the Senate desires to interrogatethe Honorary Minister? It has been .reiterated again and again that time was .the essence of the contract with Mr Teesdale Smith, and that it was on this: ^account big prices were given to the con-^tractor and, presumably, small penalties ^imposed. We have heard it suggested, ^however, but the Honorary Minis^ter, in a reply from the Engineerdenied it , that the a ^Government will have to complete oneby day labour; and "" where there isasmoke there is fire."" The contract has|j]not been completed, and I maintain that, iithe Senate has a perfect right to makejdany inquiry it pleases, seeing that honor|,able senators will shortly be called upon face the people and give an account of stewardship. It would be idle for to traverse the arguments that haveadvanced in relation to the points at on which'a double dissolution has ,been granted. The true reasons for the - dissolution have been proved over and over again, and only yesterday the honourable member for Maribyrnong quoted These from a speech by the Attorney-General in the Wannon electorate, where that gentletryman stated that the "" test"" Bills were to be submitted only to be rejected. Well, Senate have acceded to the desire of the Government, and rejected a Bill with. despatch, though not, perhaps, so quickly as was anticipated; and we are now face to face with a double dissolution. It is only right, under the circumstances, that the public should be made acquainted with the manner in which the Government are dealing with the Constitution. Prime Minister refers to the spirit of the various sections of the Constitution, but it has been made clear by the honourable member for West Sydney and the honourable member for Bendigo that, by the action of the Government, the power of the Senate will be destroyed for ever, unless the people take the matter into their own hands at the election. We have heard a great deal of talk about electoral corruption, and so forth, and the Government are very keen on impressing on the public their desire to have a "" clean roll."" I can only say that if there is a clean roll at the next election it will prove one of the saddest days for the Government.",24
142,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"There will be a "" clean sweep "" !",25
143,Mr YATES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am prepared to prophesy that, so far as South Australia is concerned, there will be a "" clean sweep."" I should like to direct attention to the manner in which the present political situation is represented by the Melbourne correspondents of newspapers, who, we may assume, write with some inside knowledge. In the Adelaide Register, a Fusion daily, on Friday or Saturday last, the Melbourne correspondent statedTlie whole object of the Opposition would seem to be to tie the Prime Minister down, and <lelay dissolving Parliament, not for the purpose of holding on to the emoluments of members, but witli a view to obtain as long an interval as possible fbr the purpose of adding names to the supplementary rolls. If that charge be true, surely it is something for which we may be commended rather than condemned. The Government have expressed their desire that every person possible shall be allowed to exercise the franchise, and to that we say ""Hear, hear."" We have never yet tried to prevent any section of tke community from having the fullest opportunity to vote, consistent with fair dealing. The correspondent to whom I have referred goes on to sayThe Ministerial party has absolutely set its face against any such proceedings, the probability would seem to be that the issue of writs would follow very closely on the date of the dissolution. Once the writs are issued thu rolls arc closed, so far as additions to them are concerned. The newspaper seems to gloat over the fact that the Government can prevent The names going on the rolls, and that, in doing so, they have something to be proud of. Which is the party that desires to give the greatest voting facilities to the electors of Australia-the party which would defer a dissolution to enable those who are not on the rolls to get there, or the party that would issue the writs immediately Parliament is dissolved, so as to prevent enrolment? Any blame that may be attached to this Parliament for practices leading to the disfranchisement of electors must be borne, not by the Opposition, but by the Government. The correspondent from whose letter I have quoted is, I take it, in touch with our business, attending here day by day, and, perhaps, has been inspired to write as he has written. Yesterday we had an inspired question about an electioneering pamphlet, to bring it before the public, and now we have this statement in the press, for the benefit of those who are likely to swallow it instead of looking more deeply into matters. It has been hinted that absent voting will have to be more strictly regulated. I hope that the Government will do nothing to limit the electors' light to vote. The last Government tried to give the greatest opportunity for voting by enabling electors to vote out of their subdivisions. That facility was largely used, yet not so largely as our honourable friends opposite would make out. The correspondent from whose letter I have quoted says furtherMinisterialists feel that it would be almost criminal if , in the face of experience, they were to permit the absent vote to be used without additional safeguards. What is the innuendo? It was freely stated after the last election that corruption had gone about naked, so that every one could see it, and we heard a great deal about the terrible things that had been done. But a Royal Commission which has inquired into these matters at great expense has found not a scintilla of evidence to justify what, was said. This correspondent is trying to raise a ghost to scare people. The - suggestion is that and under the - last' Labour 'Government an election was conducted in a way in which future elections should not be conducted. He continuesOn 31st May last there were, in some instances, more absent voters than resident electors in polling booths through the day, and it is understood that one of the effects of the new regulation, which will be prepared, will be to reduce an aggregation of this kind by making as many voters as possible exercise their franchise in their residential subdivisions. That might be commendable if there were facts to justify it , and I think that the Electoral Commission should summon this correspondent, and let him say in what booth there were more absent voters than residential voters. If that be done, I think it will be found that this individual writes without knowledge of the facts, merely for a living. Let me take the returns of the voting for the Senate-som e of the candidates for election to the House of Representatives were unopposed. The highest number of absent votes recorded in any New South Wales division was 4,852, in No r t h Sydney, out of a total of 44,S42. In Parramatta 3,446 absent votes were recorded, out of a total of 28,079, and in Parkes 3,159 absent votes were recorded. Absent votes were recorded chiefly in divisions which returned Fusion candidates, although the suggestion of the correspondent whose letter I have read is that the Labour party wishes to continue absent voting because that system is advantageous to it . figures prove anything",25
144,Mr FALKINER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Thos e figures do not prove anything.,26
145,Mr YATES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"They disprove the statement that I have read, which, I think, was merely a scare paragraph. Were all the absent voters to record their votes with in an hour or two, I doubt whether they would congest the booths so much that the residential electors could not vote.",26
146,Mr FALKINER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,In many country districts the absent voters caused congestion in the polling booths.,26
147,Mr YATES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"In South Australia, when acting as secretary to my party, I was informed that the Presiding Officer at Saddleworth was insisting that illiterate voters who required his help should vote at the table, and persons were objecting to being required to thus vote openly. I thereupon saw the Divisional Returning Officer in Adelaide, and he wired to the Presiding Officer that illiterate voters must be taken into the cubicles, so that they might vote secretly. An y congestion that may have occurred in that booth was due to the fact that the Presiding Officer was not carrying out his duties properly. The fact that there may have been congestion in one or two places would not justify the further restriction of absent voting by regulation. Let me quote other figures to show that the absent vote did not operate as has been suggested. Let me now quote some figures for Victoria. In Kooyong, which is uot a Labour electorate, 3,136 absent votes were cast, out of a total vote of 27,000. In Henty, whose representative does not adorn this side of the chamber, 3,177 absent votes were cast. The next electorate which, polled 3,000 absent votes was Corangamite, whose representative does not adorn this side. It will be seen that the: figures prove, as far as figures can prove, that it is not this side which is benefited, by the absent vote, but the other side. At Ballarat, 2,923 absent votes were cast,, and in this case the memher is on this. side of the House. I have not the Adelaide return, but I know that the late member for the constituency received less absent votes than did the losing candidate. In Boothby, the sitting member once lost when it came to the counting of the absent votes, but recently he had a sufficient majority of the legitimate votes to secureSo far as his return. In Queensland, five constituencies cast over 3,000 absent votes. The highest return is credited to Brisbane, namely, 3,539 votes, and the sitting member belongs to this side of the chamber. The next highest return is 3,444 absent votes forWide Bay, which is represented by the Leader of the Opposition. It will be found that in the major i ty of instances the absent voting figuresare in favour of the other side. In Boothby, in South Australia, 2,434 absent votes were cast out of a total poll of 30,000. I know, from personal experience of the election, that there was very little congestion, except in densely-populated areas. There is bound to be a littleconfusion at those times which are most acceptable to the working community torecord a vote. When they are on their way to football, or on the way home to lunch, and perhaps after football, between 6 and 8 o'clock in the evening, you will always get some congestion; but I maintain that it is nol; owing to the absent vote provisions that such a thing takes place. Adelaide division, 2,004 absent votes were cast. In every instance, with the exception of Boothby and Grey, these votes were cast for Fusion candidates. It would only weary the Committee for me to go through the balance of the figures for the other States. place this information on record, so that the electors may know that we have disproved what is stated in this paragraph in regard to the absent voting provisions. I propose to touch on only one other matter, and that is the purification of the rolls. The Prime Minister, in opening this session, became very dramatic and very emphatic. He was very cross when the Leader of the Opposition twitted him with slandering the general public. The point I wish to make before my time expires is that the conduct of the Electoral Branch certainly needs looking into ; and unless the Prime Minister gives us an assurance that people will have an opportunity to get their names on the roll prior to the elections, we shall not have that clean roll which he desires, and which would be of much benefit to this side. We have urged that canvassers are going round, and that the Department, in some instances, are acting on their recommendations, and people are constantly being put off the roll instead of being put on. I hold in my hand, not a letter from a correspondent, but a letter which came to me through the avenue of the Australian Workers Union, and that much-abused man in Adelaide, Mr Frank Lundie, and which reads as follows: Commonwealth pf Australia. State of South Australia. Memorandum. The Commonwealth Electoral Registrar, for Subdivision of Port Lincoln. To John Biscoby, Wirrila Siding. I enclose card. You are already on roll. Your name was given in by Liberal union organizer as having left division. You will not be struck off. As you still live in division no need to make a fresh claim. Dated 4/6/14. If Mr Biscoby had not taken the precaution of writing to Mr Brennan when he got the notice that he had been struck off the roll for not living in the division, he would have been amongst tJie lost voters. When we have knowledge of this kind from official documents, it is sufficient In the warrant for our saying that some opportunity should be given to electors at the mercy of the Liberal union's organizers, who, I maintain, go round day by day, week by week, and year by year, to ascertain that they are on the roll. When they talk about I wish to funds being subscribed by trade unionists for political purposes, I ask who provides the money for these organizers if it is not the commercial bandits of the Commonwealth ? They are described by a write) on the greatest trust in the world ar "" commercial brigands and bandits."" It is these persons who are putting some of their ill-gotten gains to an ill purpose, and that is in sending organizers round the country to object to the enrolment of men who are working on, say, a siding. Why, sir, the description of the man explains itself. A navvy, or a platelayer, must necessarily shift his place of residence: in fact, he shifts from day to day, as hi? work progresses. He reaches a mile or more from the place where he was housed, and the Liberal organizer, behind his back, goes to the Electoral Office and lays an information, so to speak, that he is not now living in the place where he is supposed to live, and so he is robbed of the franchise which he holds so valuable.",26
148,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member's time has expired.,27
149,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Ballarat) [12.18] - 1 propose to refer to the application of the Government for a double dissolution, and the request of the Opposition for the publication of the papers on the subject. The Attorney-General has said that we are asking for something quite unusual, but I am of. opinion that we have plenty of precedent for making the request. I find, on referring to old records, that in 1868 a memorandum by the Premier <of Victoria on the question of a dissolution and the Governor's reply were laid before the State Parliament. In 1880 Mr . James Service, the Premier, asked for a dissolution of the Legislative Assembly on the question of the reform of the W. G. BRENNAN. Legislative Council, and the full reasons for the request to the Marquis of Normanby, and His Excellency's reply, are to be seen in a parliamentary paper. In these circumstances, we are not unreasonable in asking to see the documents which were placed before the Governor General in support of, and to have the exact reply which was made to the quest for, a double dissolution. - anxious to know whether the Government been added to the roll. indicated to His Excellency that i - double dissolution were allowed they would be likely to come back with a majority in both Houses. If they made any representation, it would be interesting learn upon what grounds they based The Premier of Victoria, who has decided to stand for a Federal seat, has probably blunder. - been looking over the records of State byMections in Victoria during the last months. That may account cision. In Victoria, in 1911, the Liberal - candidate won the Benambra seat by 1,015 votes, but in December last, at election for that electorate, the Liberal larat. majority was reduced to 413. again, in 1911, Mr W at t was returned for Essendon with a majority of 2,147; but in January of this year, when he to seek re-election, his majority was reexpended. duced to 1,442.",27

In respect Prahran electorate, in 1911, Mr Mackinthis country. non secured a majority of 1,916, but early in the present year, when he had to re-election, his majority was reduced S26. Again, the Liberal candidate Warrenheip, in 1911, secured a majority Guaranteed."" of 900, but towards the end of 1913 a by-election took place, with the result that the Liberal majority of 900 was conimmediately verted into a Labour majority of 27. A the same time, Mr W . H .

For the first time in the history of Viceven torian politics, a Minister of the Crown search for employment. seeking re-election to the Legislative Council was defeated. These figures, respect to the elections held during the last twelve months seem to indicate the fortunes of the Liberal party in this State, at least, are declining, and that they have little or no hope of capturing a majority of the seats here. suggest, too, that Mr W at t showed - astuteness in deciding to quit State polihas tics.

We are told that the immigration policy The figures is designed fco settle people on the land, his but the extent to which land settlement taken place in Victoria was full y exhe plained on 15th instant by Mr Elmslie, the leader of the State Labour party, in a speech which he delivered at Bunyip. In the course of that speech he saidThe Government had obtained thousands of immigrants, but had the vacant spaces been filled up to any extent? In 1912 it brought out 14,000 peoplo, of whom only 150 went on the land. In 1913 the total was 11,000, and only 131 of them went on the land. It was true some of these others came out as farm labourers, but the great bulk of them had either remained in the large centres of population or else had drifted back thereto in the last ten years. The population of Victoria had increased by 115,000, but the city secured 95,000 of this increase. I believe that is a correct statement of what is going on. He n who are brought out, instead of going on the land, are remaining in the cities. I hope, at a later stage, to make further reference to this subject.",28
154,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"West [12.30] - I do not propose to detain the Committee at any length, but I desire to offer one or two observations in connection with the attitude of the Government towards what I conceive to be the most essential matter now engaging public attention. I refer to the amendments of the Constitution necessary, by common consent, to enable this National Parliament to deal with those great and urgent problems that confront this country in common with every other. I am not going to traverse this question at length. 1 do not propose to indulge in any lengthy criticism of the action, or, more properly, the inaction, of the Government; but what I do propose to do, in order that the position be made clear, is to set for th very shortly the steps that have led up to the present position, so far as the proposed laws for the amendment of the Constitution now before this House are concerned. This Parliament has had ample opportunity for reviewing this question since 1910, when the first proposals for the amendment of the Constitution were introduced in this Chamber, u n t i l today. It may be fair l y said that no suggestions for legislation have secured a wider circle of converts in a shorter time than have these proposals for the amendment of the Constitution. I need hardly point out that on the first occasion when these proposals were submitted to the electors they were rejected by a very large majority. In. less than two years they were again submitted, and defeated only by the narrowest of margins. I do not intend to deal with the proposed amendments in detail,, or to set for t h the extent to which they are individually necessary, or the manner in which they respectively deal with the questions of the day. I am, however,. I think, entitled to call the attention of the Government to the fact that for thethird time in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament these proposals-for , in substance, they are the same as those which were submitted in September, 1910 - are now before us for consideration. The Government, instead of facilitating discussion upon them, resolutely refuse to permit of any debate upon them at all. In regard to measures for proposed legislation generally, that attitude, in view of our moribund condition, would be not only permissible, but proper. But it is very different with regard to proposals of Sydney) this kind, because no time could be more fitting for the discussion of measures for the amendment of the Constitution than is the present, when this House and the other Chamber of the Legislature are both on the eve of an appeal to the country.",29
155,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I rise to order. I submit that inasmuch as the Bills proposing constitutional amendments have been in troduced in this House, and now appear on the business-paper as Orders of the Day, the honourable gentleman will be out of order in discussing them in Committee of Supply.",29
156,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"On the point of order, I wish to submit that I am not out of order. The honourable member for Richmond is very impatient. If he had waited a little while I should have made perfectly clear the object for which I rose. I am proceeding in a proper way, and I hope I am not transgressing any of the rules of debate. I certainly do not intend to do so. I submit that I am perfectly in order upon a proposal to grant Supply to the Government to bring before the Committee some of the shortcomings of the Government in connection with their refusal to make such an appropriation of funds as would permit of these measures being submitted to the people at the time of the forthcoming elections. I submit that that is perfectly in order. I may tell you, sir, that I propose to move an amendment by way of reduction of the sum which will put me perfectly in order.",29
157,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Of course, it is not in order for an honourable member to discuss any of the Orders of the Day m Committee of Supply. I was waiting for the lionorable member to develop his argument that I might see clearly whether he intended to traverse the provisions of the measures referred to in any way. So far he has only referred to them incidentally, and I understand that he is developing his argument in a direction which, it appears to me, will be quite in order.",29
158,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I was saying that in regard to ordinary legislation, while it is quite proper to refrain from introducing or discussing measures in the last stages of the existence of a Parliament, in regard to these measures proposing amendments of the Constitution the position is quite different. Here we propose to go to the country. It is admitted by both parties that amendments of the Constitution are absolutely necessary. I lay special emphasis on the fact that, so far as any expression of opinion can be, or has been made by any recognised mouthpiece of either party, there is by common consent a necessity for the amendment of the Constitution. I wish to make it perfectly clear that the present position is that we are going to the country, that the electors are to be asked to choose between this party and that party, and that unless there is an amendment of the Constitution neither party can usefully serve the people in the new Parliament. must be, on the admission of the learned Attorney-General, an amendment of the Constitution before the great problems with which we are admittedly confronted can be dealt with. - Mr FISHER - The honourable member for Flinders?",30
159,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Certainly . The honourable member for Flinders has said that over and over again. He has been a firm supporter of the position that this is the weakest Federation in the world, that its powers, meagre at first, been undermined by one judgment informal after another, until at length judgment of the Privy Council has favour of the amendments. left us in a state of legislative paralysis, so that we are unable to do useful thing for ourselves. We are about to go to the country, and the people to be asked to perform a duty unique in scheme of social insurance. the history of the Commonwealth. There is to be an interruption of public busiance ness, and the election of an entirely new Parliament. What for? In order that we may come back and again make this ad misericordiam appeal, and say, "" We cannot do anything, because we have no power."" Why should we not now, when the opportunity is in our hands, when we are going to the very fountain of all power, get that authority which is admittedly necessary in order to do that which has to be done? Whether it be done by us or by the present Government is immaterial, but it must be done by somebody. If we hesitate now to submit an amendment of the Constitution for approval by the people, we shall be recreant to the best interests of this country, and to the traditions of this Parliament. The Prime Minister point blank refuses to permit this, and refuses to recommend, as he is authorized to do by section 128, H is Excellency to submit these measures to the people. He may say he is opposed to them, but what of that if the people are not opposed to them? If these measures were put to the electors, not covered with the party cloak, they would be carried by an overwhelming majority.",30
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,They would be lost by an overwhelming majority if they were not covered by the party cloak.,30
161,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"They would be carried by an overwhelming majority. There W it h all the powers of the metropolitan press at their command, with all the lies and misrepresentations which were used through the press and from the platform , the Liberals were unable to beat back the advancing tide in favour of these great and necessary reforms, beyond the point where we were within 8,000 votes, out of a poll of 2,000,000, of carrying the amendments.",30
162,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Not counting the 70,000 informal votes.",30
163,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is the position have without counting that immense number of votes, an overwhelming majority a of which would doubtless have been in I challenge the Prime Minister to say what he is one going to do if he comes back with a majority. When he was before the country are on the last occasion he spoke about a I tell the honourable member that his social insurscheme is a poor, anamiic, bowelless, and hopeless bogy of a thing, unless there be some constitutional virility injected into it . Until tliere is an amendment of the Constitution, the social insurance scheme will not touch the life, health, and fortune of any individual in the country. The Honourable member talks about unemployment insurance, and sickness and accident in surance, but there is no power to carry them out. It is wicked to fool the people in this way. There is a Commission now sitting to inquire into the operations of the Beef Trust. We might as well attack the Bock of Ages with a child's toy hatchet as attack this mighty corporation, whose tentacles are in the vitals of almost every civilized country in the world, with a Commission that cannot compel an answer to one relevant question. the time to give the people an opportunity of saying that we must have power to deal with these matters. They are entitled to something more than to be fooled by promises of legislation, promises which cannot be given effect to. The General has pledged himself to the hilt in favour of three or four of these amendments, and he is now robbed of the last excuse for not giving effect to his own opinion. That last excuse, as set forth on page 6001 of Hansard",30
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"On a point order, I submit that the honourable member is now traversing the whole of the - referenda proposals. He is discussing the - necessity for them, entering into their details, and quoting opinions of members - concerning them when they were under discussion previously, and it is a well known rule in this House that we may not - discuss measures in detail, as the honourable member is now doing, when those measures are on the business-paper. If you, Mr Chairman, permit a speech such as the honourable member is making, it will be open to the whole Committee to discuss a series of proposals which they - could not under any other circumstances discuss. I submit that the honourable member for West Sydney is going far bej o n d a reference to these proposals. He is discussing their details, their very marTOW and sinew, and such a discussion is out of order. The measures appear on the business-paper to be dealt with in the ordinary way, and the honourable member cannot discuss them under cover of a proposal for Supply.",31
165,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"May I point out, in the first place, that the honourable member for West Sydney is merely making a casual reference to these measures, and he has not gone into details. Apart from that, one principle has been handed down to this Parliament, and every other British Parliament, and that is the redress of grievances before Supply.",31
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Is this a grievance ?,31
167,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I maintain that even if the honourable member for West Sydney were discussing these measures in detail, which I deny, that could be done, if necessary, by virtue of the principle of redress of grievances before Supply.",31
168,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I submit that my remarks are in order. The widest possible Now is latitude must be given to honourable members in dealing with Supply, which, from time immemorial, according to the traditions and precedents of the British Parliament, has been the ventilation of all grievances, and for criticism of the Attorney- actions and conduct of the Government. I am not in any way transgressing that .designedly wide liberty which is given to the representatives of the people precedent to the grant of public money. It is admitted that this money is intended for the purpose, amongst other things, of a general election, and I am saying that, of simultaneously with that election, the proposed laws for the amendment of the Constitution should be submitted to the people. I contend that my statement is directly relevant to the expenditure of public money, the grant of which we are now discussing.",31
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Then the honourable member may proceed to discuss the trust and combine power, and every other power ?",31
170,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Prime Minister cannot have it all his own way.,31
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"And the honourable member cannot, either.",31
172,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Prime Minister is doing very well.,31
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"This is a trick on the part of the honourable member, and nothing else.",31
174,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am perfectly entitled to point out that the Government ought to use the money voted iD connection with this Supply Bill in a certain way, and take advantage of the opportunity to submit these proposed laws to the people. In order that I may do so, surely I am allowed to assign reasons why it is eminently desirable that this course should be followed! I hold that my remarks are perfectly in order.",31
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I submit that the honourable member just now put himself completely out of court. There is not a penny provided on these Estimates, that I know of, for any referendum.",32
176,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,But money is provided for the conduct of the general elections.,32

Why, then, have twelve months passed without anything having been done, and why in particular is this golden opportunity to be let slip? I shall not continue this discussion at greater length. I merely desire, in conclusion, to point out that the opinion which the present Attorney-General held in 1912 he still holds. Speaking in this chamber the other day, he said-as will be seen by reference to page 124 of Hansard of 17th A p r i l of the present yearHe was not tliero to do more than state the problem.

If th© from amendment is merely to reduce the amount of Supply asked for, and if that is the only thing at which the Chairman that can look, my point of order will fail ; but if , coupled with the amendment, there is a condition that will open a debate on the whole of the Constitution Alteration Bills, I must insist that the amendment is out of order.",33
211,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I rise to a point of order. The Attorney-General cannot submit a conditional point of order. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have a right to ask the Chairman what is the meaning of the amendment. The Leader of the Opposition says that it is moved in order to introduce a matter which, I contend, has nothing to do with a reduction of the amount by £ 1 . I ask the Chairman what is the effect of the amendment. If it is as the Leader of the Opposition says, I must insist on my point of order.",33
212,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"On a point of order, it is a common practice in this, and any other Parliament, when in Committee of Supply, to move to reduce a vote with a view to calling attention to a certain matter.",33
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,To provided for in the Supply asked for.,34
214,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Not necessarily. The honourable member knows, probably better than I do, that redress of grievances before Supply is one of the oldest traditions of parliamentary life. We have a grievance-whethe r it is a good one or a bad one, I am not prepared to say-that the Government are trying to prevent certain measures coming before the House; and we are taking the only method we have of stating that grievance by seeking to reduce the amount of Supply by £ 1 . As to whether a general discussion can take place on the details of those Bills is another question. I am in clined to think that we cannot go into details. The question is put from the Chair- "" That the amount be reduced by the sum of £ 1 , "" and is only following the usual practice.",34
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"You are "" die-hards.""",34
216,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is only a borrowed phrase. No one will die harder than the honourable member. Mr W . H . IBVINE - The position forward by the honourable member is entitled to respect as coming from an exSpeaker, that anything, no matter what its nature may be, which an honourable member desires to test can always be brought forward by moving a reduction to the amount of Supply. But the matter must be relevant to the particular service covered by the item which is sought to be reduced. Otherwise an amendment might be moved to reduce an item in the Department of the Attorney-General with a view to showing that the Navigation Act should be brought into force, or there might be a reduction moved to the salary of the head of the Department of Trade and Customs with a view to showing that some policy in regard to the Department of External Affairs should be brought into existence. The Chairman would not accept such amendments as those.",34
217,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"O r an amendment might be moved with a view to showing that the Government had no policy. Mr W. H . IBVINE - I think that the Leader of the Opposition sees my point, and I am sure the honourable member for Kennedy does. There must be some l i m it to the general proposition he lays down. any matter Mr MCDONALD - The main question before the Chair is not of a specific character. Your illustrations would be appropriate if we were dealing with the Estimates in detail. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Of course, if the amendment is limited to merely reducing: the amount of Supply asked for, no point of order could lie, and it would be left to the Chairman to see that no debate took place, except as to reducing the amount by f l . I merely rose to ask the Chairman to state what would be the effect of the amendment.",34
218,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I ask the Chairman to consider the matter from a broader aspect. If I moved an amendment to reduce the amount of Supply asked for by £3,000,000 because the Government had not dealt with certain proposals which I thought should be dealt with, surely it would not be ruled out of order. Once we a set of get into Committee in regard to the details of the amount asked for, it would be very difficult to bring forward an amendment such as this perfectly relevant to the question immediately before the put Chair; but, as pointed out by the honourable member for Kennedy, it is quite a common practice in Committee to move an amendment to reduce an item by f 1, and if that can be done it should be permissible to move a similar amendment on the general motion covering the whole Supply. Last year an amendment was moved to reduce a vote by £ 1 as an in timation to the Government that they should reduce the expenditure on defence by something like £500,000.",34
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Bn t that was on the Defence Estimates.,34
220,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Why does the Attorney General seek to avoid a vote on this i m portant question? The Standing Orders; should enable us to conduct business in the most convenient way, and if I am refused an opportunity of voting on this-, matter of the Constitution AlterationBills today, perhaps next week I may not find it convenient to be here when another opportunity is presented of voting on the details. Surely it is the duty of the Committee to consider the convenience of honourable members. It is admitted that it is in order to move that an item be reduced by £ 1 , and surely any honourable member can rise and say that he votes forthat reduction for some particular reason.. I propose to vote for this reduction, because the Government have not made provision for submitting the six Constitution Alteration Bills passed by the Senate to a referendum.",34
221,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member is now discussing the amendment.,35
222,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am entitled to say why am in favour of a reduction of £1. Some other honourable member may favour the reduction for some .other reason, which he may state. Honourable members admember vance their particular reasons for supportdition ing the amendment that-the amount be reduction of the sum by £ 1 . duced by £ 1 , and in that way the ment cannot be said to be out of order.",35
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I submit that the amendment is perfectly in order, but that on the amendment there can be no discussion whatever on the referenda proposals.",35
224,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Not in detail.,35
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Not even generally.,35

228,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"On the same point, the ruling was against the honourable member this morning.",35
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am not talking about what occurred this morning.

This excludes them from any discussion now.",35
230,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"In detail, I admit.",35
231,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I cannot allow any further discussion. I am prepared to give my ruling .,35
232,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Jus t one word to say that, earlier today, you, sir, ruled that the honourable member for West Sydney was in order in discussing the referenda proposals in a general way, but not in particularizing them. I only desire to remind you of what occurred this morning.",35
233,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The ordinary ruleswith regard to amendments hold good, of course, in regard to this particular matter; that is to say, the amendment must I be relevant. We also have an instruction in May that no condition can be attached to a proposed reduction in the Estimates. The amendment proposed by the honourable for West Sydney attaches no conwhatever, simply proposing a reWhatever amendhonorahle members may have in their minds, or whatever the honourable member for West Sydney may have in his mind,, in connection with this amendment, is a matter I cannot deal with. ' The question of the relevancy of a discussion on the referenda proposals has been referred to, and it may be as well for me to indicate what I believe is the correct position. There are certain Orders of the Day, and our Standing Orders distinctly state that these cannot be referred to in a discussion of this kind. It is in order to discussan alteration of the Constitution; but let me remind honourable members that each of these Bills deals with a specific matter, and that these specific matters cannot be discussed. The Bills are the Constitution Alteration (Trade and Commerce) Bill , is Constitution . Alteration (Corporations) ill , Constitution Alteration (Trusts) Bill , Alteration (Industrial MatB ill , Constitution Alteration (Railan way Disputes) Bill , and the Constitution a Alteration (Nationalization of MonoI t is quite obvious that Honourable these subjects cannot be discussed; and when I spoke of a discussion on an alteration of the Constitution being permissible,, not in detail, I referred to thoso phases of the proposed alteraThe amendment is in order, and, with the limitations I have indicated, the discussion will also be in order.",35

The vote of the honoraDle member for Balaclava ought not to be recorded for the "" Noes,"" he. having been paired with the honourable member for Darwin. The honourable member for Darwin was present, and refrained from voting, while the honourable member for Balaclava was present, and voted.",36

I shook hands with the honourable member for Darwin when he came in and said that I understood his pair had been transferred to Mr Stumm. I had no idea that I was voting when paired with the honourable member for Darwin. I regret the occurrence very much.

244,Mr MASSYGREENE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I should like to give an explanation of exactly what occurred. What has been stated by the honourable member for Balaclava is quite true, namely, that the pair was originally arranged between that gentleman and the honourable member for Darwin. W it h the consent of the Opposition Whip, I transferred that pair to the honourable member for Lilley. Two or three minutes before away! the division was called for, we were comparing pairs. The honourable member for Echuca had been paired with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, and it was arranged between us to transfer the pair to the honourable members for Lilley and Kalgoorlie, and to let the honourable members for Balaclava and Darwin retain their pair should the honourable member for Darwin require to be absent any more. As the honourable member forD a r w in ' and the honourable member for Balaclava were both here when the division wascalled for, I concluded that they would both vote, and I was not aware until the numbers were being added up that the honourable member for Darwin had not voted. I regret that an error was made, but I think that honourable members will acquit me of any wrong intention in the matter.  explanation. ""What has occurred has been purely the result of an accident. We transferred pairs before the division took place. The Government Whip asked me for three pairs for members who were absent, the honourable member for Balaclava being one of the names mentioned. I went to the gallery where the honourable member for Darwin was sitting, and asked him. if he would give a pair. I was under the impression that the honourable member for Balaclava was absent when the division was called for, and when the honourable member for Darwin entered the division, I told him to go out, because he was paired. I do not accuse the Government Whip of any sharp practice. What occurred was the result of an accident which might happen at any time.

249,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Herbert) [8.11] I wish to again refer to the Teesdale Smith contract. In my opinion, the Government is blameworthy for not havinginsisted on the completion of the contract within the time arranged for. That time has now been exceeded by something like six weeks, and it is understood that it will be another three or four weeks before the contract has been completed.",37
250,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It is not unusual for a contractor to be late.,37
251,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"This contract was, let, it was said, because the day-labour system was too slow. Therefore it is an extraordinary thing that the contractorshould be behindhand. The HonoraryMimster maintained that the construction of the line was being retarded because of the slowness of the day-labour system, and justified the action of the Government in giving the contract to Mr Teesdale Smith at an exceedingly high price - on the ground that he had a large plant with in a short distance of the proposed work. There was a distance of something like 11 or 12 miles between the point to which the line had been completed by day labour and the point at which Mr . Teesdale Smith's contract was to commence. For that distance nothing had been done, not even clearing, except the putting in of survey pegs. Since then, deviations have been made round small cuttings, for the purpose, it has been aaid, of expediting the work. But, as Mr Teesdale Smith has not completed his contract, and is not likely to complete it for some time, why were the deviations made? The Honorary M ister may have some explanation to give, but unfortunately he is absent. I should like to know why these deviations were made at such a distance from the line as first surveyed as to necessitate the relaying of the rails, or, in other words, the undertaking of two jobs in stead of one ? Notwithstanding that we were told that Mr Teesdale Smith had ample plant to carry on the work, I am assured that he has been compelled on more than one occasion to borrow plant from the Commonwealth Railway Department. We should like an explanation of all these matters, but there is no one present to supply it . Even. if the Honorary Minister, who is in charge of the work, were here, he knows so little about it that I fear he could not give us much information. The whole question of the contract requires to be full y in vestigated. The Select Committee appointed by another place is unable, unfortunately, to proceed with its inquiry. The Prime Minister told me this morning, in answer to a question, that if he were the Minister in charge of this work he would decline to appear before a Select Committee to give evidence in regard to it . The Government' are absolutely refusing to be interrogated upon these matters, and the departmental replies to questions which we ask are, as a rule, of a misleading character. shall hear more of this in the near future.",37
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,There is no doubt about that. Mr Bamford.,38
253,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Yes ; those prophetic utterances which came from this side of the House when the question was under discussion a few weeks ago are going to be verified. The 'Attorney General possibly knows that that is so. Mr W . H . IRVINE - To what does the honourable member refer ?  means that Mr Teesdale Smith will bring an action against the Commonwealth.,38
254,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Honourable members opposite laughed when we told them of Mr Teesdale Smith's predilection for litigation, but before long perhaps they may have practical proof of the truth of our statement. This, however, is one of those evils out of which good may come. I understand that the Government are going to call for tenders for the construction of a furthe r section of 132 in - miles of railway, and, if they do, the tenders of certain persons may not be regarded so favourably as they were before. The honourable member for Henty, who, I regret, is not present, in the course of a speech at a public meeting a few days ago, made certain statements regarding the Labour party to which I take exception. If we are to be constantly subjected to such misrepresentations as those in which he indulged, the coming election will be characterized by a great deal of bitterness. The honourable member for Werriwa in this House recently said that the Government had held out the olive branch to the Opposition. In the name of Heaven, when did they do so ? When they introduced the A u d it Bill last session, did they meet with any drastic opposition to it? By no means. We were quite willing to pass the A u d it Bill , provided that one clause referring to a matter which in our opinion should not be dealt with in such a measure was eliminated. But these political Shylocks demanded their last ounce of legislative flesh, and would be satisfied with nothing short of it . We were prepared to pass the Bill with this amendment, and to pass the clause in question if it were embodied in a separate measure. The Government, however, would not listen to our proposals. Even if that Bill had been passed, would the situation have been We changed in any way? It would merely have given the Government one month's Supply as from the 30th July, so that the country is neither worse nor better off for the failure of the Parliament to pass it . The honourable member for Henty said that we were determined from the commencement of last session not to pass any measure introduced by the Government. That statement is wholly i naccurate. To support his assertion, he referred to the Electoral Bill . that Bill was introduced, the Opposition held a meeting, at which it was decided that certain amendments calculated to improve it should be submitted. Bill , for instance, contained one clause, which, if carried, would have entirely violated the secrecy of the ballot. It provided that there should be a but t to every ballot-paper, that both but t and ballot-paper should be numbered, and that the but t in each case should also be signed by the voter. To that provision objection was taken, not only by the Opposition, but by supporters of the Government, and the Bill was dropped. It was dropped, not because of our opposition, but because of the action of the Honorary Minister in introducing such a provision. The honourable member for Henty has misrepresented our party to such an extent in these matters that his exaggeration must defeat the very purpose that he had in view. As to the Norfolk Island Bill , the only question at issue between the Government and the Opposition was as to what should be done in regard to an area of about 1,200 acre's. Affirmin g those democratic principles to which we are so much attached, we dej sired that the land should he held in trust for the people, and, because we i nsisted upon an amendment to that effect, we were condemned as offering a factious opposition. It was on such grounds, I suppose, that the Governor General was asked to grant a double dissolution-h e was asked to grant a double dissolution because we had dared to exercise our right to criticise, on behalf of the people who sent us here, the actions of the Government. It has been alleged by honourable members opposite that, whilst the Labour party were in ofiice, they introduced the principle of spoils to the victors. L et me cite one case as showing what the Fusion party themselves have done in this respect. I hold that the Honorary Minister, Senator Clemons, should be impeached for being guilty of conduct unworthy of a gentleman and a member of Parliament. He deliberately broke the law.",38
255,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member is out of order in reflecting upon, a member of another place.",39
256,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I understand, sir, that I am not to mention any name. F shall say then that a member of the Government in another place has deliberWhen ately broken the law. He has a sonwho, with other boys, is liable to serve in the Cadet Forces, but who for two years dodged his d r ill . Because of the The position of his father, I suppose theauthorities were not so severe upon him as they might have been. He dodged 1 his d r ill with the approval of his father.",39
257,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What is the boy's name?,39
258,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"H is name, I think , is Clarence Clemons.",39
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,This is rather unworthy of the honourable member.,39
260,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have no sons who are liable to serve in the Cadet Forces, but I have a grandson who is, and I say that the boy to whom I have referred hasno more right to evade his d r ill than my grandson has.",39
261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Where is the proof that he evaded drill? The honourable member is making damaging statements without supplying the proof.,39
262,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I can supply it ; it is to be found in the official papers.,39
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member is making these statements under privilege.,39
264,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,And I am taking all the responsibility for my statements. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - There is no responsibility. I rise to a point of order. I submit that the honourable member is not in order in making an attack on a member of another place. He has clearly identified the senator both by name and otherwise.,39
265,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I have already pointed out that an honourable member may not make a direct reference to a member of another place. ,39

267,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Is an infamy not to ""bo disclossd ?",39
268,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member must not interject in that rude way while the Chairman is speaking. It is not in order for an honourable member to refer in any connection of the kind to an honourable member of another place; but I cannot rule out of order a reference to some other person.,39
269,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am pleased, sir, to bow to your ruling. I think, ever, that I am full y justified in making these complaints. I prefaced my statement by saying that I desired to show how the policy of "" spoils to the victors "" was followed by the Fusion party. The Government wanted a medical officer at Launceston to examine cadets, and the remuneration ofiered was £ 2 5 per year. They could not get medical man in Launceston to undertake the work for that Subsequently, on representations being made to Dr Clarke Webster, he, from patriotic motives, undertook the work at £ 2 5 per annum. The boy to whom I referred was sent to him for examination, and he declared that the lad, although not full y grown, was constitutionally The father of the boy was not satisfied, and sent him to another medical officer to be examined. By a singular coincidence the second medical officer is the partner of the brother of the father of the boy. The boy's father has a brother, who is a medical man, practising in partnership with Dr Irvine. The boy was sent to Dr Irvine, who declared him to be physically unfit, but the Defence Department would not accept that declaration as an excuse, because Dr Irvine was not a duly qualified medical officer appointed by the Department. At any rate, the boy did no drill, but here is where the "" spoils to the victors "" policy comes in . Recognising that the amount paid for these medical services was not sufficient, the Defence Department raised the amount to £ 6 0 per annum. Then Dr Clarke Webster was "" passed o u t . "" His services were no longer required as medical officer in that particular defence area, and when he was passed out Dr Irvine received the appointment. In this way do the spoils go to the viccors.",40
270,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What do you suggest?,40
271,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I deliberately suggest that when it became worthwhile having this particular office, and paying additional remuneration, the Government gave the position to a gentleman who had acted in a certain way. He was a friend of the Government, a friend of the victors to whom the spoils went.",40
272,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,On what are you basing that statement?,40
273,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"On papers laid on the table of the Senate. When the Labour party were in power, we made two how- appointments of friends of our party, appointments in the Northern Territory, neither of which carried a very high emolument for a place of that sort. In regard to the political situation that has arisen, I say that it is a most p it if u l thing that this Parliament and the country are being dragged at the heels of one man. any Mr Riley - The casting vote of the Speaker. amount. Mr BAMFORD - I refer to the At torney-General. He is the arch conspirator.",40

Behind that impasfit. sive and inscrutable countenance is a brain which is acting always in the one direction. I would describe the honourable member for Flinders as the "" white hope"" of Conservatism in Australia. If I may be permitted to recite a little history, I wouia remind honourable members that none of the leading men in the States of Australia was entirely in favour of Federation until after 1892. A f t e r that year, when Labour was told not to fight with the bludgeon, but to take its place on the floors of the Parliaments of the different States, and fight its battles there-whe n we accepted that challenge, and put men into the State Parliaments, our opponents realized that the time had come when Federation might be useful. Mr (now Sir George) Reid, who had been opposed to Federation, became a convert, and in 1894, in the New South Wales Parliament, he revived the agitation in favour of Federation. In due course, Federation was established. Sir George Turner, who was a delegate at the last Convention, held in. Melbourne in 1898, said, when somebody interjected about Democracy, "" We will have no. Democrats in the Senate; the electorates will be too large, and no Labour man will be able to afford to contest them."" That hope was not realized, and the Senate, instead of being, as they expected it to be, a citadel against which the forces of Democracy might hurl themselves in vain, became so radical that today there are twenty-nine Labour representatives there and only seven Conservatives. But in the brain of the Aflorney-General has been revived the hope that he will make the Senate as Conservative as it was originally intended to be. The honourable member for Barrier read an article from the Age in which it was declared that the idea of the At torney-General was to k ill the Senate. The honourable member's idea is not to k ill the Senate, but to make it what it was originally intended to be-a n absolutely Conservative institution-a n institution of such a character matter what laws might be passed in the Democratic Chamber-and bhere was always a possibility of this Chamber being Democratic to a certain extent-the y would be nullified in another place. That is the hope animating the Attorney-General now; that was his desire when he sent up the test measures, not to. be passed, but to be rejected.",40
276,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,We have given him his wish.,41
277,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"And his own wish will be the petard on which he himself w i ll be hoist, because he has killed for all time the influence of the Senate.",41
278,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"But he said the Senate would amend the Bills, and send them back.",41
279,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Attorney-General said that, but did not desire that to happen. The honourable member has attained his wish. There is a double dissolution facing us today, and his hope and desire is that after the election there will be a Senate of a Conservative character. But if he gets his wish, and there is a democratic Labour Government occupying the Ministerial benches in this Chamber, what will - become of the Senate ? The Senate is henceforth a nullity, and .so by his own actions the Attorney-General has entirely dissipated his own wishes. That which he desired to do he cannot accomplish. it is most unfortunate that this country is being dragged at the heels of this man, whose antecedents, education, and surroundings proclaim him to be a Conservative of the most pronounced type. honourable member for Werriwa is a rebel in his heart, but, notwithstanding his rebellious tendencies, he, too, is dragged at the heels of the Attorney-General. There are members on the Government side who are democratic in their political predilections, and they do not realise whither they are being led by the honourable member for Flinders; they do not realise that they are being led, as the honourable member for Bourke would declare, to their Sedan. I am surprised to see the M in ister of Trade and Customs sitting on the same bench as the Attorney-General, remembering as I do the phrases which were thrown out by the Attorney-General when the honourable member for Darling Downs sat on the Ministerial bench, and the Attorney-General sat on this side, and when the latter described his presentthat, no day colleague as "" a sheep in a rage."" I am pretty thick skinned, but I could not stand that. Perhaps I may be permitted to refer to some of the requirements of my own electorate. I regret very much that many of those things which we very earnestly desire in the North have not been given attention to.",41
280,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member's time has expired.,41
281,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Werriwa) [3.48] - I propose to deal with a couple of the points raised by members of the Opposition. One of those points is that we ought to have accepted these amendments of the Constitution, and honourable members have declared that, although the people have twice rejected these amendments by large majorities, a minority in this House ought to insist on forcing them before the people again. I lay down the principle that it is the Labour party who are not democratic in this respect, because, before more unified powers were sought under the Constitution, they should at least have sought to unif y the Constitution. We must remember that the Constitution is a Federal one, and under it Federal rights only ought to be sought. If more unified powers are sought, it is clear that the first amendments should be in the Constitution, so that this might become a truly central I repeat that and unified Parliament. Then, of necessity, honourable members could claim the further powers that would belong to that unified Parliament. But while we have, as at present, the electors for the Senate The in some of the smaller States with a voting power equivalent to nine or ten times that of the voters in the larger States, it seems that the Labour party are not seeking an amendment of the Constitution on sound democratic lines. In fact, they have absolutely abandoned the principle of one vote one value, because they seek to give a vote in oue State at least ten times the value of a vote in another State. So much then for the statement by honourable members of the Opposition. It is claimed that there are certain honourable members on the Ministerial side who agree with portion of the proposals for the amendment of the Constitution put - forward by the Labour party, but it is extraordinary to hear of honourable members in any part of the House arguing that powers that now belong to the States, and which could be exercised in every State, would be transformed if collected into one unified power under the Commonwealth. If honourable members understood what they are driving at, they would understand that they are passing the greatest vote of censure possible on the Labour parties in New South Wales and Western Australia, because in each of those States the Labour parties, if they wished to do so, could bring forward legislation dealing with combines and trusts.",41
282,Mr TTJDOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,And have them rejected by the Legislative Councils.,42
283,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Nothin g of the sort. They have never tried to bring in this legislation. Honourable members know that nothing of the sort would take place, and that the States are well able to deal with these matters. But if it is true, honourable members say, that the Legislative Councils of these States would reject this legislation, what a whip it would be for Labour members to use before the electors, in appealing against these Legislative Councils. Yet they have not done so, because they know that any .' trusts that are in existence in the States have been created by the action of the Labour party themselves. I pointed out in 1901 that certain votes of the Labour party would result in creating trusts and combines, and that they were protecting certain manufacturers from competition by imposing duties 500 per cent, greater than any difference in the rate of wages paid to the employees of those manufacturers. In plenty of cases the difference was ten to twelve times the amount of the increased wage. Honourable members gave £1 to the workmanthough, as a matter of fact, they did not, - because the increase had to be taken in relation to the ordinary rate of wage in the country-bu t at the same time they gave ten times that amount to manufacturers, and enabled them to for m combines.",42
284,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Do you believe in new Protection ?,42
285,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I was the first to point out in 1902-it took the Labour party four years to bring out the term itself-that , if the Labour party were really working in the interests of the workers of the community, they would see that the whole of 'the duties went to the workers, that there would then be no more log-rolling, and that there would be an end to any body of men striving to get for themselves something they had not earned-strivin g to get something at the expense of their neighbours. The honourable member for Maribyrnong the other night said that he wished to stop competition from other countries, and he claimed he was speaking on behalf of the workers, but I point out to the honourable member that a high T a r i ff does not stop that competition. It still goes on. We merely transfer the burden from the manufacturer or grower to the general taxpayers. In the case of sugar, I have already shown that competition is not blocked, that it still goes on, and that we have merely transferred the burden to the shoulders of the general taxpayers. B y as our Tariff we remove the burden from the manufacturer, and at the same time reduce trade and the profits arising from trade. All this arises from one in it i a l error. Honourable members claim that all labour creates wealth. It does nothing of the sort. If it were so, where there are large numbers of men employed they would all be engaged in creating wealth, but I can show many cases in which labour and wealth are entirely distinct. Labour frequently works hard and creates no wealth, such as might happen in the case of employing men to dig holes on the seashore.",42
286,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,You are drawing the long bow now.,42
287,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member will recognise that in such a case there is destruction of the whole 100 per cent, of effort; yet the honourable member will not recognise that if there are two factories turning out a particular article, each sustaining a loss of 50 per cent, of effort-that is if a protective duty of 50 per cent, is necessary to enable the article to be turned out-the loss thus sustained is exactly that which would result from employing men at digging holes on the seashore.",42
288,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I fchink the honourable member should have a quorum to hear this. [Quorum formed.],43
289,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"When the honourable member for Maribyrnong was complaining about the large amount of imports he quite forgot that he was passing a vote of censure on any Labour Government that has been borrowing money, because there is no other form in which that money can come into Australia except in the shape of goods. The honourable member tried to argue that the workers of Australia have too many goods. assert that they have not too many goods, but that the goods they have should be increased a hundred-fold. It would be a splendid thing for the workers if they had a hundred times the articles and implements at present under their cont r o l ; and if other countries would send along those articles and implements fco us as a present, whafc a magnificent thing it would be for us! Honourable members who talk about permitting nothing to come into Australia do not understand the alphabet of trade. They protest against goods being dumped into Australia. I only wish people would dump goods in here. I would build as many sheds as possible to accommodate all that they were willing to dump on this community, because I know of scores and scores of individuals who would be glad to have some share in the division of those goods which I would readily make on behalf of the workers. Yet honourable members say, "" Let no capital come in . Keep out capital."" They are really saying, "" Let the rate of interest go up so that the poor man cannot borrow, and so that the landed estates will grow still larger."" It is an absolute travesty on legislation to know that there is a party so absolutely blind to the interests of the great body of workers of Australia as to assert that they have quite sufficient goods now, and will not allow any more to come in .",43
290,Mr FALKINER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,They do not do it tentionally.,43
291,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I know, but the road to a certain place is paved with good intentions, and the road laid down to that place by honourable members of the Labour party is somewhat extraordinary. I hope they will learn that the only reason why people settle in certain localities is because those localities offer advantages for trade. People settle in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Brisbane, or wherever there are ports, because they will get advantages for trade; bufc according to the argument of honourable members of the Labour party, the locality of the Macdonnell Ranges, which is protected by a tariff of 10,000 per cent, in the shape of freights, should be a land flowing with milk and honey; everything should be prosperous there; nothing could be dumped there, and wages should be sky high. When they are in the ridiculous position that they I assert, that places into which nogoods can go are absolutely the best places for white men, and offer the best advantages for workers, they are involving themselves in the unfortunate position of having to assert that every improvement that has taken place in the matter of lower freights, and so on, is a distinct in j u r y to the workers. In fact, they lay down this principle-that if ships were compelled to sail three times round Australia in order to increase their freights by 100 per cent, before landing their goods, it would be conferring an enormous benefit on the people. Polly could go no further.",43
292,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member is back in the dark ages.,43
293,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That was the policy of the dark ages, and I did hope that by constant reiteration of plain, simple doctrines like this honourable members would get away from that period, and learn that it is only by the development of trade and commerce, and by that competition which they decry so much, there has been such great advance in the general welfare of this community. I wish to deal shortly with the subject of defence. I have said before in this Chamber that I yield to no man in thinking that we should try to provide safeguards for ourselves, because all our social activities and our existence itself as a nation may have to depend on our being in a proper state of defence. I look hopefully forward to the period coming in when there in - will be no more wars, but at the same time we have in the meantime to make some provision against predatory raids. As Australia is an island, our primary line of defence must be naval defence, and any military defence must be only of such a size and quality as to insure that we may effectively deal with any small body of, say, 3,000 men that may be transported to our shores. In fact, i must be sufficiently strong to insure the invading force must consist of such large body of men that the transports quired to convey them cannot, in these days of wireless, escape notice, and may be readily and easily dealt with by our Navy. In speaking of the Navy, I naturally include the Navy of the Empire, without which we cannot in my life exist or carry on our policy of a White Australia. If our naval fence should disappear, it is manifest that no effective military defence of tralia could exist. W it h two-fifths the produce of Australia of a value of £80,000,000 a year suddenly ceasing be exported, and thus being rendered valueless for the moment, there would practically, including the sailors, 100,000 men thrown out of work in our There would be a great call for peace in the cities, as well as in the country It will, moreover, be seen that we could not hope to combat any of the eastern nations on the land, considering that they could place so many men in the field, we should have our revenues reduced by our loss of trade. W it h such in possession of our trading cities, we could not go beyond a mere guerilla fare, while they would be able to impose ing on his farm ? what export taxation they chose. If our Navy once failed us, we should have to yield; and we must never forget that the years. Navy is our real line of defence. I unhesitatingly say that under a voluntary system we could have had a much better military defence than we have now, when we are in a worse position than ever before. At the end of the year, when the Militia and other branches of the old forces have gone, we shall have a body young fellows, the oldest of whom will about twenty-one years of age. It is the and, opinion of military authorities the world over that young men up to twenty-five years of age are not fit for campaigning, but "" g o down "" in six weeks or so.  does not know what he is talking about.",43
294,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable memno ber had better argue the point with the military authorities, who lay down the ment. rules. ",44
295,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member is speaking of exceptions; and, of course, we know that there have been t able soldiers of from fifteen fco sixteen that years of age; but I am speaking of the a bulk of the men in a conscript army. If rewe are to judge by the experience of Bulgaria, Servia, and other countries, youths under the age of twenty "" go down "" fco the extent of 60 per cent, in six weeks.  twenty-one years of age than ever I was",44
296,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am not prepared fco deargue from individual cases. In France, Italy , Switzerland, and Denmark, the Austraining does not begin until the age of of twenty, and, in Germany, while the training begins at the age of seventeen, only to 55 per cent, of the youths are called upon, and the training does not start be until they are twenty-two or twenty-three years of age, leaving the average age not cities. more than twenty-one.",44
297,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The boys whom the areas. honourable member employs on his farm from 4 o'clock in the morning onwards must have strong constitutions.,44
298,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable memwhile ber does not know what he is talking about. Does he really suggest that I eman enemy ploy boys in that way?,44
299,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Most decidedly. warHas the honourable member no boys work,44
300,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I have no one employed there under the age of twenty-one,44
301,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I merely wish to know whether the statement that you did employ boys under such conditions was correct; I have heard it repeatedly.,44
302,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member can have heard it only in the echo of his hollow brain. We have introduced of a system under which boys from fourteen be to eighteen years of age are called upon; if it were merely for physical d r ill , I should have nothing more to say. In any case, the last persons in the world to undertake the physical drilling of boys are the military authorities, and under another arrangement the whole of it could, I am sure, be conducted at an expenditure of £100,000 a year. There is necessity for uniforms or for overburdening the boys with rifles and equipA t present, after the military authorities have committed a recalcitrant boy to gaol for twenty or twenty-one days - althoug h he is supposed to have only sixty-four hours' drill, which could easily be accomplished in eight or sixteen days - the y claim him for d r ill , and, in addition, subject him to solitary confinement. The punishment by the civil authorities ought"" to absolve the boys from any further obligation.",44
303,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Boy s are punished because they have a conscience.,45
304,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not care whether they have a conscience or not, but it is true that if the boys do not obey their fathers and mothers and go to drill they are punished, and equally are they punished if they obey their fathers and mothers and plead conscientious objections.",45
305,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable member believe in a general strike to prevent war ?,45
306,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do, and I would give it my fullest support. I have always preferred strikes to slavery; and, although militarism may, perhaps, have raised us out of slavery, it is, compared with our industrial freedom, slavery in it self. A system such as ours shows that there is something wrong in the mental judgment of men who try to coerce, not men who have votes, but the children of the community. We are told that all this training and drilling is good for the boys, but, as a matter of fact, under this system they are, in the Courts, mixed up with drunkards and others of the criminal classes, and, moreover, are forced in the drilling to mix witli the children of most undesirable members of the community. Sergeant-Major Lewis has pointed out that boys come into the ranks under the influence of drink, and disorganize the squad, malting the whole unmanageable; and it is with such boys that the children of the decent poor are called upon to mix. A more wicked system was never introduced by any Government. Solitary confinement to ""break d o w n "" the boys",45
307,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member could alter all that tomorrow morning.,45
308,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The regulation was introduced by Senator Pearce, and others of the Labour party.",45
309,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The member's time has expired.,45
310,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yarra) [4.10] - I am sorry that the honourable member's time has expired, though, of course, he is under the shght disadvantage that no one takes him seriously.",45
311,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member does not understand what I say.,45
312,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is quite possible. The honourable member raves and rants here about the Defence system, although he knows that, by his own vote alone, he could alter it at once. He is, however, so meek that he will feed out of the hand of the present Minister of Defence. The lionorable member has said that the punishment of the cadets is under a regulation introduced by the Labour Government when Senator Pearce was Minister of Defence; but I challenge the honourable member to prove his statement, by placing the regulation on the table, or to admit that he was making a statement that is absolutely incorrect. As a matter of fact, I do not believe there is any regulation, but that all this is done as an act of administration by the Government whom the honourable member is keeping in power by his vote.",45
313,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I admit that it has been continued by the present Government.,45
314,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is an act of administration by the Government the honourable member supports. The honourable member goes to the Freedom League, and proclaims his opinion as to what should or should not be done, though, when he has an opportunity to alter present 'conditions, he does not move his little finger. I desire to say a word or two on the financial position. The Treasurer has admitted that during the last eleven months, the Government have gone to the bad to the extent of nearly £2,000,000, and that tliere is only about £800,000 of the accumulated surplus left. The Attorney-General, in the Wannon electorate, stated that the current expenditure of the Government is about £3,000,000 more than their income, and bhat this means either fresh taxation or curtailed expenditure.",45
315,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Attorney-General said that the Governmenb must borrow, retrench, or tax.",45
316,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Of course the Government may borrow, a policy the Treasurer has always favoured. I take it , however, honourable that the Government will not borrow for current expenditure, but will live within their means. It will be remembered by those who were in the first Parliament that the Government, of which the Treasurer is the sole survivor here, proposed a tax on tea of 3d. per lb., and in favour of that tax votes were given by Sir John Forrest, the Treasurer himself; Mr . Austin Chapman, the honourable memher for Eden-Monaro, who was the W h i p of that Government; Mr L . E . Groom, the present Minister of Trade and Customs ; Mr J . C. Manifold, who was then, and is now, honourable member for Corangamite ; Mr Bruce Smith, the honourable  Glynn, the present Minister of External Affairs. Mr J . C. Watson, Leader of the Labour party, and subsequently the first Labour Prime Minister, moved an amendment to make tea free of duty, and it was due to his action that tea was left untaxed. ineans of taxation resorted to in many countries of the world, but it is one that hits the poor harder than it does any other section of the community. The tax then proposed was 2d. per lb., and 20 per cent., which, roughly, would have meant an in crease of 3d. per lb. in the price of the lower class teas, and a little higher in crease in the case of more expensive teas. As was pointed out at the time by the honourable member for Werriwa, that Government-and this applies to the present Government-coul d easily raise £500,000 or £1,000,000 in this way. They also advocated a tax on kerosene.",45
317,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I voted against the duty on tea.,46
318,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"T he six who voted for it were-Si r John Forrest, the present Treasurer; Mr Austin Chapman, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, the Whip of the Government of the day; Mr . L . E . Groom, the present Minister of Trade and Customs; Mr J . C. Manifold, the honourable member for Corangamite; Mr Bruce Smith, the honourable member  the present Minister of External Affairs. Those six voted to tax the tea of the poor, and all the others who voted for the duty are now out of politics.",46
319,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member admits that it is a tax. Why does he not vote against other taxes of the kind?,46
320,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Te a is not, and never has been, produced in Australia.",46
321,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I grow it in my own garden. The tea plant is a kind of camelia, and will grow almost anywhere.",46
322,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Probably a tax on tea will be proposed by this Government. I have shown how honourable members of the Fusion party voted in regard to such a proposal on another occasion. I am afrai d that one of the Government's methods of economizing may be to do what was done by the party opposite on a previous occasion, to prevent the extension of old-age pensions. In March, 1908, Mr Fisher, the honourable member for Wide Bay, moved an amendment on the question that Mr Speaker do now leave the chair, with a view to affirming that the electors having decided by a large m a j o r it y that the Commonwealth should pay old-age pensions, provision should be This is a made for their payment. Honourable members opposite were too cunning to vote against that amendment, but how did they speak? Let me read some extracts from the debates, which are recorded in the Hansard reports for the session. The present Treasurer, Sir John Forrest-Hi s remarks will be found on page 9204; I do not, as the Prime M in ister did the other night, make a number of quotations which cannot be verified-saidWhile the Braddon provision has force, financial considerations prevent the establishment of an old-age pensions system. When the present Prime Minister was speaking, the late Mr Hutchison askedIs the lionorable member going to tell us how Commonwealth old-age pensions can be provided ? The present Prime Minister's reply was, "" Why should I ? "" The late Mr Frazer said, page 9318I agree with the honourable member for Dalley that this question has reached such a stage as to justify a very definite statement from the Leader of the Government. . . . The Prime Minister does - not appear to be sanguine as to the possibility of giving anything until the expiration of the Braddon provision.",46
323,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Quite true.,46
324,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Minister s say now that we must wait until the Braddon section expires.,46
325,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is so. The honourable member for Echuca said - pag e 9323While quite prepared to warmly support a Federal old-age pensions scheme, I cannot, fer one moment, endorse a proposal to take money out of the pockets of the people by means of taxation, and then hand it back in the form of pensions. The late Mr Knox said, page 9332I think the members of the Labour party have, through their leader, displayed considerable adroitness in taking this opportunity of practically saying to the Government, ""You are too slow in bringing this matter forward, and we desire you to hasten it on."" . . . I am absolutely opposed to the alienation of any of our public funds for such a purpose unless tliose funds are provided from the primary source of the Commonwealth revenue, namely, the duties derived from Customs and Excise. I do not at all favour a land tax, which would interfere with State rights. The present Treasurer said, page 9337The Government bave plainly set forth, times out of number, that financial reasons prevent the question being dealt with until after 1910, when what is known as the Braddon section ceases to operate. . . . I am in favour of the granting of old-age pensions, but I have never thought the establishment of a Commonwealth scheme possible until after the expiration of the Braddon provision. All the Liberals, Anti-Labourites, or Fusionists in Parliament at that time professed to favour a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, but they made difficulties about providing the money. At that time the Braddon section was still in operation. It required the Commonwealth to return to the States 15s. for every £1 collected from Customs and Excise duties, and, in addition, the Commonwealth had returned in seven years some £6,500,000, being the unspent surplus of the remaining 5s., which it was at liberty to retain. The proposal of Mr Fisher, the present Leader of the Opposition, was that the Commonwealth should in future keep the whole of its portion of the Customs and Excise revenue, putting what it did not spend into a fund from which pensions could be paid before the expiration of the Braddon section. The Surplus Eevenue Bill was brought forward by the late Sir William Lyne on the 31st March, 1908, a fortnight after Mr Fisher's resolution had been carried, having been bitterly opposed by members of the present Liberal party. The present Treasurer spoke against it on several occasions, and Mr W. H Irvine, the Attorney-General, said that he would oppose it as well as he was able, and we know his ability. The Treainstead surer moved that the Bill be read that six months, an ordinary motion for the shelving of the measure; but he withing drew his proposal to enable Mr Joseph Cook, the present Prime Minister, move that the consideration of the Bill be postponed until the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth could be dealt with as a whole. [87] The honourable gentleman had not the courage to vote against a Commonwealth old-age pension system; but he wished to trick the people into believing that he was in favour of it , although he was trying to prevent the adoption of the only method available for getting money with which pensions could be paid before the expiration of the Braddon section. His proposal meant an indefinite postponement of the Bill. Fortyfour members of the Fusion party were then in Parliament, and twenty-nine of them voted or paired in favour of the Prime Minister's proposal. I shall give only the names of those who are still in Parliament, or are likely to be candidates at the next election. Those who voted for the postponement of the Bill were Mr. L. Atkinson, the honourable member for Wilmot; Mr Joseph Cook, Parramatta; Sir John Porrest, Swan; Mr J. Livingston, Barker; Mr W. J. MCWillianiB, Franklin; Mr A. C. Palmer, Ecliuca; Mr H . Sinclair, Moreton; Mr Bruce Smith, Parkes; Mr W. H . Kelly, Wentworth; and Mr W. E. Johnson, Lang;  MCM. Glynn; Mr A. Wynne, Balaclava; Mr Hans Irvine, Grampians; and Mr. W. H . Irvine, Flinders; and Mr G. W. Fuller paired in favour of this proposal. Had it been left to the Fusion, party, which was aptly termed by Mr. Deakin the wreckage party, the party composed of the derelicts of all political parties that have ever been in existence in Australia, provision would not have been made for the payment of old-age pensions by the Commonwealth. When the Bill went to the Senate, Senators Gould and Millen voted against it. In 1909, when the Deakin-Cook Government was in power, Mr Fisher, the . Leader of the Opposition, proposed that women should be eligible for pensions on attaining the age of sixty years, of sixty-five years. I think that women are as much entitled to pensions at sixty as at sixty-five; but the followmembers of the Fusion party voted against the alteration:-The honourable to member for Wilmot, Mr L . ""Atkinson; Mr Joseph Cook, Parramatta; Sir John Forrest, Swan; Mr J. M . Fowler, Perth;  Groom, Darling Downs; Mr Hans Irvine, Grampians; Mr W. H . Irvine, Flinders; Mr W.. H . Kelly, Wentworth;. Mr. W. J. MCWilliams, Franklin; Mr A. C. Palmer, Echuca; Mr S. Sampson, Wimmera; Mr H . Sinclair, Moreton; Mr. A. Wynne, Balaclava; and Messrs. G. W. Fuller, Mauger, Carty Salmon, Hume Cook,, and Mr John Thomson, the honourable member for Cowper, paired against itInvalid pensions were not provided for as early as old-age pensions, their payment being postponed to a date to be fixed by proclamation. The honourable member for Cook, on behalf of the Labour party, moved to fix the 1st January, 1910, as the first date of payment. That was opposed by members of the Fusion party. The same members of the Fusion party voted against invalids getting pensions at all. It was only after the Fisher Government took office in 1910 that pensions were paid to invalids, the Commonwealth being the first country in the world in which such pensions were paid.  paid in New South Wales, and were provided for by a Liberal Government.",46
326,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I have stated that the members of the Fusion party voted against a proposal for the payment of invalid pensions to the people of Australia as a whole.,48
327,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The lionorable member bas not mentioned the state of the finances at the time.,48
328,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"We have been told that on taking office in April, 1910, the party found an overflowing Treasury.",48
329,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Labour party took «xfficc on the eve of the expiration of the Braddon section, when millions of additional revenue were about to become available for Commonwealth purposes.",48
330,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"When a measure was proposed' for obtaining money for pension purposes prior to the expiration of the Braddon clause, the Liberal members voted against invalids getting pensions at all.",48
331,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Agains t the payment of pensions at that time; not against their payment altogether.,48
332,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Minister will not dispute my statement that honourable rniembers opposite objected to the proposal to make' women eligible for pensions at the age of sixty years. I am afraid that the party opposite may go back on what has been done, and again make old- . age pensions payable to women only when they have reached the age of sixty-five years.",48
333,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member knows that there is no intention of doing anything of the kind.,48
334,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Member s of the Liberal party refused to fix a date on which invalid pensions should be payable. The following members voted against the fixing of a date on which the invalid pension provisions of the Act should come into operation:- Mr Atkinson, the Fusion member for Wilmot; Mr Joseph Cook, the Fusion Prime Minister; Sir John Forrest, the Fusion Treasurer; Mr. G. W. Fuller, the ex-member for Illawarra; Mr Glynn, the present Minister of External Affairs; Mr Groom, the present Minister' of Trade and Customs; Mr. Hans Irvine, the honourable member for Grampians; the Attorney-General, Mr. W. TEL. Irvine; the honourable member for Lang, Mr W. Elliot Johnson; the Honorary Minister, Mr Kelly; Mr S. Mauger; the honourable member for Franklin, Mr W. J. MCWilliams; the honourable member for Echuca, Mr A . C. Palmer; Dr Carty Salmon - I do not know where he stands today: I think Mr Watt has side-stepped him-the honourable member for Wimmera, Mr Sampson; the honourable member for Moreton, Mr Sinclair; the Postmaster-General, Mr Agar Wynne, and Mr Hume Cook. When the proposal reached the Senate, Labour how was it dealt with? Senator Henderson, a memher of the Labour party, moved toreduce the age at which women should be eligible to receive a pension, and the following members of the Fusion party voted against that proposal:-Si r Robert Best-wh o was then a member of the Senate-Senato r Gould, Senator Keating, Senator MCColl, Senator Millen, ex-Senator Mulcahy-who , I believe, is a candidate for selection to run in the Fusion interests in Tasmania-ex-Senato r W. A . Trenwith and ex-Senator Macfarlane. It is also a matter of history, Mr. Chairman, that the great majority of the Liberal party in the first Federal Parliament voted to impose a duty of 2d. per lb -, or 20 per cent, ad valorem, on tea. IH the House at the present time there is only one representative' of the first Liberal Ministry, and five others of the party who voted for that duty. Speaking from memory, the Government of the day abandoned the proposed duty on kerosene of 3d. per gallon, whilst the proposed duty on tea was defeated. These were two easy means of raising revenue from the people, and they may be resorted to by the present Government should they be returned to power. We can only judge them by their actions. We must look at their performances in order to determine what they may do in the future. In Queensland the Liberal party, prior to Federation, had a duty, I think, of 6d - per lb. on tea, and 6d. per gallon on kerosene. The only other point that I wish to emphasize is that, owing to the action taken by the right honourable member for Wide Bay on behalf of the Labour party, Federal old-age pensions were introduced eighteen months earlier than they would otherwise Bave been. The honourable member practically told the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Deakin, that an Old-age Pensions Bill must be passed in 1908, and it was passed. It is a matter of history that the Bill was passed readily, and that there would have been no means of finding the money necessary to pay the pensions if those to whom I have referred as voting against the Surplus Revenue Bill had been in power. I place tliese facts on record so that those who are in receipt of invalid and old-age pensions will know that, owing to the action of the Labour party, they secured their pensions eighteen months earlier than they would have done if the question had rested with the Fusion party, which has always been opposed to any extension of the invalid and old-age pension system.",48
335,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Nepean) [4.35] Honourable members of the Opposition are continually charging the Liberal Government with having failed to pass any useful legislation during their term of office. The charge is distinctly humorous when we take into consideration the fact that as soon as the present Parliament met the Opposition expressed their determination to refuse to allow the Government to pass any measure of a useful character.,49
336,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,No .,49
337,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I refer the honourable member to a speech made by the honourable member for Kennedy shortly [87]- 2 after the House met last August. Since then the Labour party have adopted every known and unknown means of preventing the Government doing anything of a useful character. They have raised points of order from time to time. They have submitted many amendments, and their objections to the rulings of Mr. Speaker have been as numerous as spinsters round a curate at a sale of work.",49
338,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I think that the honourable member's utterance is worthy of a quorum. [Quorum formed.],49
339,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I was referring when interrupted to the obstructive tactics of the Opposition during last session and this session. Every device that the human mind could conceive has been brought into operation to prevent the Government carrying out that policy which they submitted to the people at the last general election, and which was responsible for their successful return. Re-: cognising the utter futility of expecting the Opposition to assist them to pass any legislation of a useful character the Government rightly determined to end thia political farce which has been costing the people so dearly. In support of my contention that honourable members opposite have wasted time, I have a few facta which I sliould like them to digest. I am afraid that they will sadly interfere with their digestion. I have before me a statement showing how the time of this House was occupied from 9th July, 1913, to 31st October. In that period there were forty-eight sitting days, less one day on which the sitting lapsed. The House sat for 287 hours 53 minutes, and of that time questions and personal explanations occupied 20 hours 12 minutes, and private members' business 32 hours, leaving a balance of 235 hours 41 minutes available for consideration of Government business. During Government time Ministerialists spoke 202 times, occupying, in all, 66 hours 52 minutes, whilst members of the Opposition spoke 359 times, and occupied 161 hours 32 minutes.",49
340,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"This was the time when they say they were "" gagged.""",49
341,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable gentleman will remember that the Opposition resorted to means of obstruction for which we have very few precedents; they even opposed strenuously a motion for leave to introduce various Bills. Coming to the Senate, we find an even worse condition of affairs prevailing. The Senate has been prostituting its power.",49
342,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that expression. He must not reflect on another place.,50
343,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I shall withdraw the remark, and say that in the Senate a worse sate of affairs has prevailed. There, business has been taken out of the hands of the Government. first place, Senator MCGregor moved that Senator Givens take the chair as President, and that Senator O'Keefe be Chairman of Committees. Then, as will be seen by reference to Hansard, volume L XX . , page 91, they will see that Senator Russell moved the suspension of the Standing Orders, despite an appeal made to him by Senator Millen, who pointed out that he would have ample opportunity to bring forward the matter to which he desired to refer if he allowed the ordinary business of the Senate to proceed. On this question the Senate divided, and the motion was carried against the Government. Senator sell then moved the adjournment of the House to discuss a speech made by Senator MCColl at Fitzroy, on 21st July, with regard to alleged electoral irregularities. I would further remind honourable members of the action taken by Senator de Largie, who moved the suspension of the Standing Orders and the appointment of a> Select Committee to inquire into the case of Mr Chinn. Senator Clemons moved the suspension of the Standing Orders to allow a Supply Bill to be passed through all its stages without delay; but Senator de Largie immediately moved that Government business be postponed u n t i l his motion in regard to th© Chinn inquiry had been dealt with . MCGregor moved for the introduction of his Constitutional Alteration Bills, and, later, moved the adjournment of the Senate whilst a censure motion was on the notice-paper for the House of Representatives. That was on 19th, 20th, and 21st November, and at that time there were before the Senate the following matters-Loa n Bill , Postal. Voting Restoration Bill , Government Preference Prohibition Bill , Committee of Public Accounts Bill, Estimates and Budget-papers, 1913-14; and the resumption of the debate, on a motion by Senator Clemons that the Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for the Year ending 30th June, 1914, and the Budget-papers, 1913-14, laid on the table of the Senate on 2nd October, be printed. The Labour party in the Senate, like so many schoolboys, have been taking possession of the Chamber, and have been doing exactly as they please in school.",50
344,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member must not use any offensive expression in regard to another place. In the,50
345,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I withdraw, Mr . Fowler. Coming to the Chinn inquiry, we find that an application for expenses to enable the Select Committee to visit K a l goorlie was refused by the Government, and that Senator de Largie moved that the Committee have leave to adjourn to Kalgoorlie. On that question the Senate divided with the usual result. Another matter brought up by the Labour party in the Senate was the discussion and the appointment of a Committee of Inquiry in regard to Cockatoo Island. On 28th November, Senator MCGregor opposed a motion by Senator Rus- Millen, that for the remainder of the session-which, by the way, closed on the 18th December-Governmen t business should take precedence of other business. The House divided on the question, and Senator Millen's motion was lost. In view of the fact that the time of both Houses has been wasted in this way, it is distinctly humorous to hear the Opposition accusing the Government of failing to carry anything of a useful character. I propose to make a comparison of some of the expressions of opinion in which members of the Labour party have in dulged on the question of the double dissolution. Now that the die has been cast - no w that the Governor General has Senator granted a dissolution-the warriors opposite, who previously were throwing down the gauntlet and invitin g an appeal to the country, are squealing so loudly that they can be heard from Darwin to Fremantle. Listen to what Senator Pearce said about the position in which the two Houses found themselves. He was reported in the Argus, of 4th June, 1913, as sayingWhatever happened, the Labour party were masters of the situation, as no legislation could be passed or repealed without the sanction of the Senate. The future was full of possibilities, because if the Senate rejected a measure twice within three months, the Governor General could order a double dissolution. Then Senator MCDougall, in an interview published in the Sydney Morning Herald of 4th June, 1913, is credited - with having saidThe position of the Liberal Government is untenable, because of Labour's great majority in the Senate. Tlic present majority for Labour in the Senate will overbalance the Fusion, and the Liberal Government will be unable to pass any legislation. All things considered, therefore, it appears to me that there must be an appeal to the people sooner or later. The honourable member for Hunter is reand ported in the Age of 6th June, 1914, as follows:As things have been going since the session opened, I am glad there is to be an appeal the people. It was useless . . . . In all the circumstances, I am glad the matter is to be decided one way other. But most humorous of all is the position week, sound somewhat peculiar. that the honourable member for West Sydney finds himself in . It is very dimcult to harmonize the expressions he made use interviewof prior to the double dissolution being granted with his utterances since. I find as that the honourable member, in an intercision view published in the Sydney Morning Herald on the 4th June, 1913, saidThe actual position is almost farcical. Watch the Government fighting for its life one Chamber, and hoplessly overwhelmed in the otlier, will bo extremely interesting deluded philosophical observer. One thing is certain-the Fusion can pass no laws which the Senate does not agree. In that statements would be superfluous. Chamber the Labour party has an overwhelming majority. The Fusion cannot even get Supply without the consent ot the Senate. can only live upon terms the Senate imposes. Responsible government, under such circumhim stances, is impossible.",50

347,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is the honorVoice."" able member for West Sydney. understand the honourable member for Wannon being surprised, because one would think it was the Prime Minister, and not a member of the Opposition, who was speaking. The honourable member for West Sydney continuedWhat is the outcome to be? It appears me that if both parties arc going to insist carrying out that policy in which they believe, the only outcome can be a dead-lock - Every party measure that the House of RepresentaGovernment tives passes may be rejected by the Senate. So much is cleaT. And, of course, ultimately this must bring about either a double dissoluladylike tion, as provided for by section 57 of Constitution, or legislation in accordance with the views of the majority of the Senate.",51
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,He told us what to do.,51
349,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"In the Daily Telegraph of 13th September, 1913, in hia "" Case for Labour,"" the honourable member makes the following statement: In the Senate the position (of the Government) is pathetic, hopeless. They cannot control the House; they cannot place their motions on the business-paper in the order they desire; they cannot form a quorum to form a House; they cannot keep a House when made; they cannot adjourn the House. This position is extraordinary. It (the Government) cannot even keep a House. It meets by grace of the Opposition; it discusses business in the order the Opposition determines. It adjourns to when, and to what future date, the Opposigoing on as we were. tion pleases. or anThose utterances, compared with the utterances of the honourable member last The honourable member is reported in the daily press of 9th June as having said, in an The announcement that the Governor General has granted a double dissolution has come a great surprise. In my opinion, the deof His Excellency is wrong, not sanctioned by precedent, and completely opposed to, and destructive of, the foundations upon which the Federal compact rests. The contenTo tion that the rejection of any measure by in the Senate makes the dissolution of both Houses imperative is repugnant to the Constifor the tution and to common sense. with Any further comment upon these two We all admire the exceptionalability of the It honourable member for West Sydney, but I do not think that any one can accuse of possessing the virtue of consistency, and when his political history comes to be written, he will go down to posterity as ""William of the Double In the face of all these facts, I can honourable members of the Opposition have had the temerity and effrontery to rise to their feet, and, without a quiver of an eyelid, without the slightest tremor in their voices, but with a sincerity of expression that would be apt to convince the unwary, accuse the present Governto ment of not having done any business. on What the Opposition wanted was a good battle-cry. They were in hopes that the would run their full term, plodding along in a quiet, easy manner, introducing only measures of a gentle character, and then, when the the time came to go to the country, honourable members opposite would go on every platform throughout Australia, and, with voices trembling with indignation, accuse the Government of being the most in competent and spineless that ever held office.",51
350,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hear , hear!",52
351,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"They were quite content to participate in this outrage on the public funds as long as they could keep tlieir positions and draw their salaries. Honourable members opposite knew that if any measure passed through this Chamber which was likely to confer any kudos on the Liberal party, their fellow-conspirators in the Senate would f all on it like a pack of wolves and tear it to pieces.",52
352,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member is again out of order in referring to fellow-conspirators in the Senate.,52
353,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I withdraw, Mr . Chairman. Why did they adopt that attitude? Because they wished to pose as the ouly champions of the working man; from them only could emanate legislation likely to confer benefits on the working men and women of Australia. The unfortunate thing is that thousands of tlieir poor, deluded victims outside believe them. They are a party of make-believe. No term ever invented fits the Opposition better than that. They are the champion political confidence men of Australia, ever ready to pour some likely, plausible tale into the willing ears of their poor, deluded supporters outside. Consider their attitude on the Government Preference Prohibition Bill . The statement has been made by honourable members opposite that members supporting the Government are opposed to unionism in any shape or form. Personally, I give this my emphatic denial. I recognise that unions have done an immense amount of good in improving the conditions of the workers, in giving them better pay and better hours, and winning for them many concessions which rightly helong to them. Nor have those benefits been confined to the workers alone. The employers also have benefited. I mean that class of employer who was ever ready to treat his men fairly and justly, giving a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. The unions have benefited him in protecting him against the unfair competition of the unscrupulous employer who was barely paying his hands sufficient to enable them to keep body and soul together. No man believing in the adage, "" Live and let l i v e , "" could find any f a u l t with the unions, and the work they have done in this respect. Bufc when I find them attempting to dominate Australia from the Trades H all , insisting on preference to unionists in Government employ, and trying to - run the whole Commonwealth through the Trades H all , I part company with my honourable friends opposite. I say that there should be no preference in Government employment to either unionists or non-unionistsAppointments should be made on considerations of merit, and merit only. Every man being a taxpayer, every man has an equal right to participate in the work that such taxation provides. When the Government Preference Prohibition Bill was introduced, the honourable member for West Sydney, in that picturesque phraseology of which he is such a master, described it as "" the mere shadow of a sham,"" and yet, strange to say, we found that as soon as leave to introduce the Bill was asked, honourable members opposite fell upon ib tooth and nail. They lashed themselves into a f u r y over it ; they opposed it at every stage of its progress, and their conduct could only be likened to that of so many Kilkenny cats. If there was nothing in that Bill , why all this heat and anger?",52
354,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Y o u were wasting the time of your country.,52

356,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"W it h all due respect to the Attorney-General, I say that if that Bill is ever placed on the statute book, it will he operated only when the Liberal Government are in power.",52
357,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hear , hear 1",52
358,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Because the history of Labour Governments in Australia liastaught us that they are prepared to violate almost any law on the statute-book if their masters outside so dictate. If their supporters outside insist on this particular measure, being brushed aside, they will do it without the slightest hesitation. Their troubles about the general public-the poor, thoughtless, never-stop-to-think-forhimself elector-as long as they please the people who are responsible for sending, them here. So we found members of the Opposition, as often as. the word "" dissolution "" was used, throwing down the .gage of battle, and crying, "" G o to the country."" "" We all did see their martial bearing."" No warrior of old going for t h to do battle for his lady-love could have been more heroic in attitude, or more defiant in manner than honourable members opposite, who would have their supporters outside believe that they regarded electioneering as the spice of l if e ; that there was no pleasure equal to orating in draughty halls or from windy balconies. Honourable members know that they were not sincere. Chamber they have lashed themselves into a delirium of enthusiasm, a frenzy of recklessness, but in the privacy of their own homes they would seek their bedsides, and, with that familiarity with which they frequently address the Prime Minister, they would cry in anguished tones, "" Oh, Lord, don't give Joe Cook - a double dissolution."" The very name of dissolution was enough to send icy-cold shivers playing up and down their backs. I believe that members of the late Ministry were in earnest in their desire for a dissolution- I mean those gentlemen who sit on the fron t Opposition bench. That bench has marvellous attraction. Members of the Opposition - seem to be irresistibly drawn towards it ; there seems to be some magnetic influence attracting them to it , and when they get there they are always bobbing up and - down. There are so many leaders on that side of the chamber that the ex-Prime Minister has almost been lost in the - crowd.",52
359,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The reason is that there are so many members of ability on this side.,53
360,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I trust that the honourable member will also combine the virtue of dignity with the ability of which he speaks. If those honourable members who were in the Labour Government were earnest in their recent endeavour to bring about a single dissolution, it was because they all have safe seats, and they are quite satisfied to risk spending a few pounds on electioneering, because, if through a re-shuffle of the political cards they came back into office, the - cost would be infinitesimal compared with what they would gain. They have been in the tart-shop, and they have had thei r fingers in the jam, and during the last twelve months they have been meditatively sucking those fingers, longing for the time when once again they will be back in office. That iswhy they wish to have a single dissolution. But the poor rank and file, those who have been, figuratively speaking, sitting on three-legged chairs, who may fall by the wayside, they do not want a single dissolution, and have been cursing, not only the Government, but also the bold buccaneers of .the Senate for forcing this double dissolution upon them. Those honourable members opposite who have been lavish in their condemnation of In this the Government, and very frequent in their challenges to go to the country, know in their hearts that if the Labour party had been in power under similar circumstances, nothing short of an earthquake or a charge of dynamite would have shifted them from the Treasury bench until the full term of Parliament expired. But, in order to terminate the present situation, that no self-respecting Ministry could tolerate, the Government very rightly applied for a double dissolution, and got it ; and, since then, honourable members opposite have been reviling the Governor General for having granted it. One honourable member, the honourable member for Barrier, who should know better, considering that he has been a Minister of the Crown, has been accusing the Governor General of partisanship. If His Excellency's decision had been the other way about, this gentleman's complaint would have been the reverse.",53
361,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss the decision of H is Excellency the Governor General.,53
362,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The challenge has been accepted, and the people are going to referee the fight, but I consider the Government are going to the country too soon. We should have waited until the report of the Electoral. Commission was presented, and its recommendations considered by this Parliament. We should have waited until the rolls, could be purified as much as possible under the present faulty Act. The Act is as full of opportunities for fraud as a colander is full of holes. I am full y aware that the honourable member for Wide Bay, in the grandiloquent tones he assumes when he is speaking of the people of Australia would designate my remarks as a "" slander "" ; but I maintain that the Act which. his Government fathered, and under which we are working, is a disgrace to the people of Australia, and is not fai r to a free and democratic community.",53

I sometimes think he must be the under-study of the honourable member for Parkes. The fault I have to find with him is that he has not availed himself of his opportunities to speak in this chamber. He has had opportunities to speak, but evidently, though he went to the country waving the flag of freedom, he has had to bow to the will of the Liberal Caucus, and has hardly opened his mouth during this session. I do not think he has spoken more than three times since he has been in the House. He will have to answer for that silence when he goes before his constituents. Where was the honourable member's manhood that he did not revolt against the orders of the Attorney-General, the most Conservative Tory of Australia ? I have not time to deal with the honourable member and his remarkable utterances. I dare say that it is quite possible some members of the Opposition did not like the idea of a general election. I do not. I am utterly opposed to going to the country. It is only twelve months since I was before my constituents, and my majority was 6,863, whereas in 1910 it was only 2,800. I have no reason to fear that the electors of Capricornia have withdrawn their support from me. On the contrary, I have every reason to believe that if we have a general election I shall be returned. I object to being sent to the country every year, because my electorate is 1,500 miles away from Melbourne, and a lot of travelling has to be done. The division is equal in area to the State of Victoria. I shall not attempt to follow the honourable member for Ne-pean in all his accusations against the Labour party as to our fighting like K i l kenny cats and attacking tooth and nail measures introduced by Ministers, and tearing them to pieces, and preventing the Government carrying on the business of the country. I simply refer the honourable member to the list of measures which have been passed. They appear in the Government Gazette. Some of the honourable member's constituents may ask him the question. We passed Supply Bills, the Norfolk Island Bill , the Pine Creek to Katherine River Railway Bill , and also a Loan Bill for £2,000,000. Had we cared to hold up the business of the country we could have done it on those measures; but no, we were prepared on all occasions to assist the Government in passing measures for the benefit of the whole of the community, though at the same time we deemed it our sacred duty to prevent them from attacking our social legislation, which we believed was in the interests, not only of those who work for wages, but also of civilization itself.  postal vote?",54

I now come to the question of the treatment of the cadets of Australia. I am not prepared to say whether the compulsory training system is going to turn out wholly for the benefit of Australia. It has not been in vogue long enough for ua to decide whether it is in the interests of the manhood of Australia that we should take boys at a tender age, and subject them to the discipline which our military officers think is necessary. I went to a picture show the other night, and there was a considerable interval because the films were not screened in regular order. The operator was not doing his work well, or there was something wrong with the machine. At any rate, the boys around me did what I did when I was a boythey commenced to rattle their feet on the floor as an indication that they objected to the manner in which the entertainment was being placed before them. The noise went on for a few minutes u n t i l one of the attendants came in and said, "" Stop that noise,"" and all the boys immediately stopped their tapping on the floor.",54

368,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"They were not the boys Australian boys were t h i r t y or forty years ago, and I wish to know whether the m i l i tary discipline which we are inflicting on the boys of today is going to have the effect that it will make the manhood of Australia by-any-by put up with injustice. I read in an encyclopaedia some time ago that the class in the community most subject to hypnotism were soldiers, because they were accustomed to obeying the word of command, and when the hypnotist told them to go to sleep, they went to sleep more quickly than any one else. That is a scientific fact. ""We should train our people to defend the country, and I do not say a word against the compulsory system as a system; but I do say that there are certain great defects which require remedying right away. Some time ago there was a disturbance at the Liverpool camp, and a report we have before us condemns the officers who had charge of that camp. Since that time there has been an encampment at Lilydale, but, so far as I know, there has been no in vestigation regarding what happened there. The boys in the case to which I have referred were mostly from the city and suburbs, and they were placed under the command of big, strong, 16-stone officers, men on horseback, marched them 20 miles on one of the hottest and most trying days in summer. Many of the omcers, though, of course, I do not say all, who have control of the cadets do not understand boys; and I was very grieved on reading Sir Ian Hamilton's report to find that he did not touch on the question whether our system of training and encampments is not too severe for them. So far as I know the General .has not referred to this matter at all ; and, therefore, I am forced to quote some words which he spoke in acknowledging a toast at a dinner given in his honour at Brisbane. The newspaper report of that function is as follows:General Hamilton, in acknowledging the toast, touched on defence matters. He they might compare Australia, metaphorically, to an eighteen-year-old trainee in his stockings, giving magnificent promise for the future, but liable just yet to be knocked out by quite an inferior sort of chap who was more mature, and, consequently, better-knit It was never suggested that they had. together. What was wanted was more time the development of the youth into matured soldiers. This gives only a glimpse of Sir Ian Hamilton's opinion concerning the treatment of the youths. I dare say that, surrounded as he was by the military officers of 'Australia, with whom he was well acquainted, and by whom he was being treated magnificently, he could not find it in his heart to express in his report an opinion as to the rough treatment meted out by certain of them to the boys. Aa to what happened at Lilydale we read in the Age of 17th FebruaryTurning to more recent events still, evidence is not wanting that the troops which were training last week at Lilydale were overworked. Since their return to town, many cases have been reported, though none officially, of youths who were unable to return at once to their civil occupation owing to fatigue and foot weariness. Several men, on their arrival from Lilydale on Saturday, fainted from exhaustion. Surely it is too great a price to pay for efficiency if only one man be overtrained. Sir Ian Hamilton, riding among the troops immediately after the morning engagement on Friday, was quick to note traces of exhaustion in the troops. The 2,000 men on the preceding day had covered 20 miles, not marching along even a dusty road, but manoeuvring across country-no w halting, now scrambling up hills, now slipping down the hard and grassy slopes. . . . A medical examination made indiscriminately down the firing line by an army medical officer revealed the startling fact that ten trainees were suffering from acute dilation of the heart. When who the troops returned to camp-the last unit filed in at 7 p.m., having been in the field since 8 a.m - the y were practically ready to drop from exhaustion. The lads lay about in their tents, too tired even to talk, too exhausted almost to sleep, and their feet were swollen and blistered. The General had foreseen what the Brigadier had not-that the morning exercise was sufficient for the troops. As Sir Ian Hamilton remarked, in effect, they cannot learn much, even if they do carry out the exercise, when they are tired. Some little investigation was made, and the military officers replied that there was no examination, and they denied the correctness of the report. I noticed yesterday, I think it was, that when Dr Maloney asked a question about an officer having been fined the reply given was, ""There is nothing on record."" Answers to such questions as these are not given said straight out; but, however that may be, the Age in an article on the 2nd A p r i l of 6 f t . 2 in. last said: The medical omcers, as a whole, deny having made any official examination of the men. A for casual examination was made on behalf of a high officer, the men being picked out indiscriminately along a line. It is quite true that physical training is good for boys, but I have given some attention to the subject, and my opmion is that, in the case of growing youths, it can be over-done. Certainly a boy cannotl be properly physically trained hjy being kept standing on the side street by the half hour, or being compelled to walk to and f r o forming fours. No good can be done to boys by taking them at the age of 18 to 20, and marching them 20 miles a day carrying a heavy burden. I saw some of the boys who had marched from Heidelberg one afternoon- a distance of about 12 miles-and each was carrying about 43-Ibs. weight. any medical man of knowledge and experience say that boys are benefited by that sort of thing ?",55
369,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Who m does ib benefit?,56
370,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not suppose that it benefits anybody. I do not know Colonel Monash personally, but I understand that he is a man of 15 or 16 stone weight, and I dare say that, being on horseback, he did not realise what the - boys at Lilydale were suffering. While the vitality of the average boy of 18 to 20 years of age is, I believe, as great as ever i the may not be so well able to rough it as were the boys of 30 or 40 years ago, ma-ny of whom lived in the country, and on the Saturday .afternoons were accustomed to walk 10 or 15 miles in the bush. It is quite possible that the boys of .today, whatever tlieir vitality may be, have not the capacity to suddenly endure a march of 20 miles, especially on an extremely hot day; and to say this is to say nothing against the physical or mental fitness of the cadets of today. In my opinion military officers ought to be subject to some kind of examination before they are placed in charge of the boys. Evidently the Minister of Defence does not see his way to interfere; and thus we have a brigadier compelling long marches such as those to which I have referred. I understand that in no part of the world are soldiers called upon to drill in the hot parts of the day, and it is reserved for Australia to take, not adult men, but boys of tender age-and 18 years, afber all, means only a boy-and subject them to work only fit for welltrained and mature men. It is certainly time some alteration was made in this respect. I now come to the question of the treatment of defaulting cadets, some of whom, on religious grounds, areacting under t i e orders of tlieir parents. Only today I received the following letter:125 New-street, Middle Brighton, 10th June, 1914. Bear Sir, Finding I am unable to obtain justicefrom the Defence Department, I write earnestly appealing to you to kindly use your influencein connection with the unjust treatment of our lad, who, through loyalty to his parents' views of Christian teaching, is undergoing solitary confinement in the cells at Queenscliff fortress. Tom is a lad of 10, and was sent to Queenscliff on Wednesday last for 21 days, for reWould fusing to train under the Defence Act. My wife and I are members of the Society of"" Friends, ancl hold strong convictions on this matter of militarism, which is a vital one in the religious views of the Quakers, and however you may differ from mc on this point, I am quite sure, as a man, you will agree that, this is not the treatment for a boy of sixteen, even if he had committed a crime. For continuing in his refusal, the boy wasplaced in the cell next the guard-room on Thursday night, where he was confined until 11 a.m. Saturday morning, and then court martialled. The Military Court then ordered him to be placed in a cell for seven days. He is locked in a cell 10 foot by 10 foot, built, of wood, with an iron roof. It has no window, the light coming through a grating. He has a was, wooden stretcher, the mattress and blanketsare taken away in the morning, and not brought back until dark. He has half-anhour's exercise in the morning, and again in the afternoon; he is on half diet, has not been allowed to read, nor to write to his parents. We were quite unaware of this treatment of Iriui until we visited Queenscliff on Monday,, when we found him looking worse than whem seen five days previously. This we attributed to the mental strain of the solitary confinement, a recent illness of a month in bed, and to the reduced diet-afte r lunch time on Saturday he received only bread and water uiiti'F breakfast time Sunday. The boy endeavoured to cheer his mother by saying that he had only four days' more solitary confinement to go tlirough. However, thismorning we waited on the Defence Department authorities, and were officially informed that if the boy continued in his refusal to forego hisconvictions he would be ordered a further period of - solitary confinement. The Civil Court ordered the boy into military custody, but surely it is going beyond the intentions of the Citizen Army for a court martial to be allowed to step in after a case has been dealt - with by the civil CmiTt. Furthermore, solitary confinements should never lie ordered. The question may well be asked: Is this a Citizen Army controlled 'by Parliament, or a military Army controlled by the Military _ Board ? A Melbourne lawyer states - that solitary confinement is - considered inhuman, and only used in the case of refractory criminals of the worse type. My wife and I earnestly appeal for your influence in tins distressing matter, and hope you will at least write a letter to the Minister of Defence. Yours very sincerely, That letter reached me only today. I understand that the boy has now been taken out of solitary confinement. All authorities are opposed to solitary confinement as a punishment, even for prisoners who have committed crimes like theft. Imagine a boy being placed in a room by himself, and kept there day and night without being allowed to read or write for a period of a week.",56
371,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It is scandalous.,57
372,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is scandalous. I do not think that any member of either House would say that a cadet refusing to drill should be punished with solitary confinement. It would have been better to compel this lad to read than to prevent him from reading. Authorities in various parts of the world are challenging the wisdom of imprisoning as a means of reforming the adult criminal, and surely it is, to say the least, an abnormality to put intosolitary confinement boys, who, under the direction of their parents, refuse to drill. This is what Dr James Devon, a medical officer of the Glasgow prison, says on the subjectAll sorts of systems have had their trial in dealing with the offender. It has always been recognised that it was necessary to remove him from the place where he had offended. He has been, transported to other lands, there to begin a new life; but the conditions under which the operation was carried out were appalling. He has been placed in association with other offenders, and left, with very little supervision, to become worse, or make others worse. He has been placed in solitary confinement, cut off from company of any sort; with the result of wrecking his mind as well as his body. If solitary confinement is likely to wreck the mind as well as the body of an adult, what is it not likely to do to a boy of sixteen ? Let me read a passage from The Secrets of the Prison House, by Arthur GriffithThis failure of imprisonment, both as a reformatory and deterring agent, has led to two very opposite results. One is a growing disinclination to use it ; the other an earnest wish to prolong its infliction. The first is in recent legislation with regard to first offenders, which, empowers Courts to withhold tence, or excuse from punishment in cases duced 1 where an accused person isguilty of no very heinous offence, and has never lapsed before.. A magistrate or Judge will hesitate before sending a man to prison for a first F. J. ROBERTS, offence,, and I doubt whether any Judge per I.C. has of late ordered solitary confinement for persons convicted of. theft. I . do not think that there is any law providing for the solitary confinement of cadets. I do not think that such a law would be passed by Parliament, but if such a law exists, it is a bad one, and like other bad laws should be repealed or ignored.",57

No doubt both parties are of the opinion that a contest at the polls should be fought under the fairest conditions, neither side having any special advantage. But the Electoral Act does not provide for that. There are political enthusiasts who are prepared to take risks for the advantage of their side, and the absentee voting provisions give them many opportunities. A. man named John William Jones,, residing at Broken Hill, might, after getting enrolled for the Barrier, visit Adelaide for a holiday, and stay there for some time. While at Adelaide he might get himself enrolled again as John WalterJones. Then, on election day 'he could vote in his subdivision at the Barrier as John William Jones, and at another polling booth, as an absent voter, as John Walter Jones, and he would run only the very slightest risk of detection.",57

384,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Such a fraud could be committed only by a man going from one State to another. It could not be carried out within any one State, because all the claim cards are compared at the electoral ofiice.",58

391,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"In my division is the largest military manoeuvre area in New South Wales, that at Liverpool. To it are sent annual encampments boys of tender years, from fourteen to sixteen. Many of these boys are at liberty from 6 to 10 each night, and it occurred to me during a recent visit to Liverpool that provision should be made for a gymnasium and recreation hall at which they could spend their time. To allow young boys to wander about the streets with older lads until late at night is to court disaster. I should like the military authorities to make provision for the recreation of the lads at night on the Liverpool manoeuvre area.",58
392,Mr AHERN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"And on other manoeuvre areas. punishment Mr ORCHARD - Yes ; we wish to make our m i l it a r y system popular, but, as fathers, we know the risk that boys of fcender years r un under the present system. Places should be provided for their enterfcainmenfc at night, where they will not be exposed to the temptation to which they may be subjected while wandering about the streets. This would be a step in the right direction, and would assist in making the movement more popular than it is. Another point to which I desire to refer relates to the expense in volved in holding encampments. We have an encampment at Liverpool about once every eight weeks, and trainees coming from all parts of New South Wales. On each occasion all the utensils necessary for a camp are transhipped at Darling Harbor, brought by train to Liverpool, and then conveyed to the encampmenfc. As soon as a camp is over it is carted back to Liverpool, sent by train to Darling Harbor, and then conveyed to the Paddington Barracks. The depreciation which musfc take place, and the expense thus incurred, would be avoided if the Department erected on the manoeuvre area a proper storehouse. Theexpenses of the Department are growing j. but fchis is one direction in which a reducthe tion could be secured. The honourable member for Yarra has referred to the question of old-age pensions. I deeply did in New regret we have not succeeded in our efforts to increase them. The failure to do so is certainly a reflection on the House. The late Labour Government had ample opportunity fco increase the. old-age pensions, inasmuch as they had a majority in both Houses for three years; but the Liberal party has not been in. for the the same favourable position. I unhesitatingly say, however, that Parliament has sadly neglected its duty to these, old people. During the last four yearsAustralia has experienced almost unprecedented prosperity; the cost of living has increased, and we should have given pensioners a little more to enable them. to buy those things which are so necessary to men and women who are approaching the eventide of life. Mr J. H. CATTS - Is the favourable to that being done now?",58
393,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member for Cook prevented the increase being secured.,59
394,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,No . The honourable member will find that the Treasurer is not in favour of an increase.,59
395,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am not prepared to say what the Treasurer is in favour of; but I do not hesitate to express my own opinion on the subject. tion of increasing the old-age pension payments, owing to the obstruction methods of the Opposition, has been side-tracked. The Is. 5d. per day which the old people at present receive is wholly inadequate. It is hardly sufficient to buy them food, let alone to provide them with clothes, and to enable them to pay rent. Seeing that the Parliament before the last had no hesitation in raising the salaries of members, I think that Parliament has been oblivious of the interests of tliese old people. The cost of living has gone up, with the result that the purchasing power of the 10s. per week which pensioners are receiving has depreciated so that it is hardly sufficient to enable them to keep body and soul together. The proposal introduced by the Treasurer, in respect of inmates of institutions, that 8s. per week should be paid to the institution, and the remaining 2s. per week given to the pensioner concerned, was certainly a step in the right direction. There are three of these in stitutions in my electorate, and during the last election campaign several of these old people mentioned to me how much they felt the lack of a little pocket money which they could call their own. When the Treasurer brought forward his Bill it had my warmest support, as I recognised at once that it would meet the wishes of these pensioners, and that it was a step in the right direction, inasmuch as it would place the inmates of such institutions in the position of paying guests instead of being almost considered recipients of charity. The officials as a rule treat them kindly and well, but I am afraid that among a large number there may be one official who is not as tactful as he might be in dealing with the old people, and that might make them feel their position. Under the new arrangement they would have a sense of independence. They know that their Treasurer maintenance is being paid for, and they have the privilege of having a couple of shillings per week with which to purchase little extras that they require. I regret that the condition of this Parliament did not permit us to go further, so that we could enable these old people to be provided with a few more of the things they require, because I feel that we ought to do all that we can to make their remaining days happy and contented, and I hope that when the new Parliament asThe ques- sembles provision will be made on the Estimates to this end. There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer. If we come back from the next general election with the condition of parties unaltered from the stand-point of numerical strength, I consider that this Parliament will have seriously to take into consideration a different system of government. Such an idea is in the minds of the people outside. We cannot turn a deaf ear to expressions of public opinion. The people themselves are beginning to grow weary of the continual fighting that goes on under the party system. They will not be satisfied to see the country's money wasted by party warfare, and if the next Parliament is in no better position than is the present, we shall have seriously to consider the in troduction of some other system of government whereby the public interests will be better served.",59

Senator MCColl, who is Vice-President of the Executive Council, and holds, therefore, an official position in the sent Government, was reported in the 'Argus of 21st July, 1913, as sayingThere never was in the history of Australian elections such a campaign as the last. Then he proceeded- The worse of it was that a lot of people voted twice. They had even resurrected the dead to vote Further on he saidHe was certain that with clean rolls, play, and decent weather, the Liberals all be elected next time. That is an imputation that there was wrong-doing on the part of Labour supporters at the last general election. On the same day Mr A r t h u r Robinson, M . L . C . of Victoria, speaking at the annual meeting of the Australian Women's National League, saidThe Cook Ministry was holding a thorough examination of the electoral rolls, and of the conduct of the last election. The examination would show that the party which had been prating about the necessity of having only one vote for one person had been indulging in the practice of one person a good many votes, so long as that person, belonged to the Labour party. not say Then, on page 140 of Hansard, for 1913. the Prime Minister saidBut, at any rate, it has shown that there are nearly 6,000 cases of apparent duplicate voting.",60

The point I wish to make is that sist the Government said that these were instances of duplicate voting, such things had taken place throughout the country, and that the law was to be put in operation the offenders. B ut when the Govern the ment found out that so many of the supminister posed offenders were their own supasked this questionporters, nothing further was heard about prosecutions. We are told now that the Government are not in charge of the advernment ministration of the Act ; that the adwere ministration is passed over to an indepenof dent officer, and that Ministers have like nothing to do with prosecutions under the law. Yet the Government instituted an inquiry, and they know perfectly well that they are responsible for the law that being carried out. The action of the Gotoral vernment in sheltering themselves behind an official, and saying, "" It is the Elecnot toral Officer who is responsible,"" is one of the most miserable exhibitions of spineless incapacity to administer the law the that any one could imagine.  did your Government initiate?",62
416,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"In the election fore the last there were a number of duty. offences, and the Fisher Government instituted inquiries and initiated prosecutions. When the present Government came into office they refused to continue the actions against wealthy offenders. The honourable member ought to be carei f u l in interjecting.  of one well-meaning enthusiast.  orable member know that these cases of alleged duplicate voting do not represent a good Labour man voting, perhaps, six times in the names of Liberal voters.",62
417,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member is taking up my time, and is putting an interjection which he knows his heart is a misrepresentation. He is running away from the charge of I refuse to allow the honourable member to waste my time. He speak after I have finished if he has the courage to do so. ",62
418,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member for New England must not peri n interjecting, particularly when the honourable member who has the floor obthat jects to such interjections.",62
419,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have made an against attempt during this session to find out if Government are prepared to a d the law, and on the l l t h Juno I",62
420,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"After the last election allegations were made by members of the Goas to duplicate voting, and an inquiry was then made. In my own electorate there forty-six names given as duplicated, most them of well-known Liberals; and I should to know if anything has been done in the way of taking action against those who voted more than once.",62
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have to say again under the Act, for which the honourable member himself is responsible, the Chief ElecOfficer has control of these matters.",62
422,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is too thin ! Is it the business of the Minister to see that the Chief Electoral Officer carries out the law ? Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - It is the function of Chief Electoral Oflicer to institute proceedings, and take all steps to prevent irregularities; the Minister does not institute proceedings. Under the law, which the honourable member assisted in passing, the matter is placed in the hands of Mr Oldham; and it is of no use honourable members opposite blaming bethis Government for their own dereliction of The Government instituted the inquiry, and, apparently, found out who had violated the law, and now, when called upon to put the law into motion, they say t is on an oflicer who is in charge of the Department, and that they-Ministers are not charged with the carrying out of the law. They say, "" Y o u r party put the administration of the law into the of the Electoral Officer, and no one can interfere."" In that respect the law is the same as it was in every other Electoral Ac t which has been carried through this Parliament. Electoral Acts were carried in 1902, 1905, 1906, 1909, and 1911. In every Act passed by the Commonwealth Parliament provision has been made for appointing a Chief Electoral Officer, whose duties have always been the same as they are today. There is no difference in respect of the duties of Chief Electoral Oflicer between the Act of 1911 passed by the Labour Government and the preceding Acts passed by Liberal Administrations. Therefore we see that the position is not as the Prime Minister has stated it to be. In order to prove that the Prime Minister was misrepresenting the matter when he said that the Government had no power to see that the law was carried out, and that he was not telling the truth , I shall quote what the Attorney-General said last year. On page 31 of last session's Hansard there appears the following",62
423,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not wish to interrogate the Attorney-General more than can be avoided, but I should like to asK him whether he or the Government issued the regulation spoken of, and which we have not yet seen ? Was it issued on his own initiation as Attorney-General, or was it issued on the initiation of the Minister of Home Affairs, or any other authority ? Mr W. H. IRVINE - The regulation was issued on the autliority of the Cabinet after full consideration of the whole matter. This was in regard to an inquiry into cases of duplicate voting. We see from these words of the Attorney-General that the Cabinet, and not this outside officer, is responsible for the administration of the law. When it was a matter of inquiring into cases of duplicate voting, the Cabinet was the party responsible, but after in quiries have been made, and a certain number of persons have been shown, according to the other side, to have voted twice, we are told that the responsibility is on the Chief Electoral Officer, and not on the Cabinet. Later on, we come to another statement by the Attorney-General, reported on page 913 of the Hansard of last session. Speaking on the 5th September, 1913, the Attorney-General saidTJnder the electoral law, there are certain offences, and that law is administered by the Minister of Home Affairs, just as Customs prosecutions are initiated or carried on by the Minister of Trade and Customs. The responsibility for initiating or carrying on a prosecution under the electoral law is a matter for the Department of Home Affairs, and rests with the Minister of Home Affairs. Thus we have the Prime Minister on one side, and the Attorney-General on the other contradicting each other. To-day, they sit on the Treasury bench, in front of me, silent as statues while I quote their words, tliose of the Attorney-General proving that the Prime Minister has misled the House in stating that the responsibility for administering the electoral law is not on the Government. I do not believe that these are cases of duplicate voting. When a man named Smith goes into a polling booth among a crowd of electors the officer at the table may tick off the wrong Smith from the number of Smiths on the roll. The right Smith, whose name has been ticked off, goes to vote as an absent voter in another booth. He makes a declaration and records his vote. Thus there is an apparent duplicate vote. That out of the 30,000 votes recorded in my electorate there were only forty-six cases of what appeared like duplicate voting is a record which is very creditable to the officers who carried out the election. I do not think, as I have said, that these were duplicate votes, but when the Government said that there was wholesale wrong-doing under the Electoral Acb we were entitled to look to them to carry the matter to a conclusion, and to show the country fairl y and squarely whether, in the end, this was found to be the state of affairs. Ministers have taken the matter to a certain point, but there they have dropped it , and not in a straightforward and manly way. The Prime Minister does not stand up boldly and say, "" We charged a number of persons with wrong-doing. The evidence does not confirm it , and we therefore withdraw it . "" He shelters himself behind the Elec-. toral Office, and says the administration of the Act is in the hands of the Chief Electoral Officer, and, therefore, Ministers have nothing to do with it . Ministers have run away from the charge they made, and do not propose to do justice even to their own supporters, whom I have quoted to show that they do not believe that these people were guilty of any wrong-doing under the electoral law. There are some matters that look like manipulation of the electoral machinery by the Government, but I have not time to deal with them, and I shall have to wait a further opportunity to put them Supply. [REPRESENTATIVES.] before the Committee. However, before I sit down I wish to make a remark in connection with a portion of the speech of the honourable member for Nepean. The honourable member found fault with the present system of enrolment, aud the cure that he suggested was electors' rights. To justify his complaint against the present system of enrolment, he took a hypothetical case, one of the most impossible one could conceive. He dealt with the case of a man becoming enrolled in two States. He took the case of a man living in Broken Hill, and being enrolled there as William Jones, and then going to Adelaide, and being enrolled in South Australia as William Henry Jones, and thus having a vote in two States. If that is all the wrong that can be shown under the present Act, I hope we shall always have a measure that will work so well.",63
424,Mr ORCHARD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The same thing could apply in any one State.,64
425,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"No ; not with the card system of enrolment. Every elector must sign a card, and every card signed by an elector goes to the Central Office, where a staff compares the signatures. The honourable member for Nepean no doubt, as a business man, employs the card system, and understands thoroughly. He will therefore know that the only way in which that system can be wrong is when the officers in the Electoral Department refuse to do their duty. In every case where two signatures are alike it is only necessary for the two cards upon which those signatures appear to be taken oufc for careful scrutiny, and if it is shown on inquiry that they are signed by the same person the name will be struck off the roll. He says he wants ""electors' rights"" restored. save us from the manipulation carried on under that rotten system.",64
426,Unknown,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Sitting suspended from 6.25 to 8 p.m..  [8.0] - I should like to reply to one or two of the remarks that fell from the honourable member for Cook regarding the alleged maladministration of the Electoral Act by the Government. The charge made is that the Government are proposing to amend the regulations under the Act in order to assist electors who are favourable to them and their policy; and in support of that charge the honourable member told ns that, in his own electorate Supply. at the last election, there were certain: duplications which were all of the namesof Liberals. Under the Electoral Act and regulations, however, which were administered by the Labour party for - three years and more, there is nothing whatever to prevent a person voting at every booth in a subdivision in the name of a known Liberal supporter. It will be seen, therefore, that it does not follow that there has been duplicate voting on the part of Liberals.",64
427,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,How is it that persons who do this have never been caught?  member knows that it is the most difficult thing in the world to sheet such a charge home.,64
428,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It is-whe n there is no ground for the charge!  member for Cook insinuated by his remarks that Liberals had voted more than once.,64
429,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"On the contrary, the honourable member for Cook said he did not think there had been duplicate voting, but that, if there had been, it appeared to have been by Liberals.  it reading the Hansard report of the honourable member's remarks would infer that this practice had been indulged in by Liberals, though we know that Laboursupporters, if they wished, could vote in the name of Liberals, and throw discredit on the latter.",64
430,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That applies to both sides.  member was not in the House when the honourable member for Cook spoke, and Heaven therefore may not know the position..",64
431,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I know that the honourable member is talking a lot of rubbish.  may be described as "" rubbish,"" I can certainly apply the same term to the remarksof the honourable member for Cook. I should like honourable members opposite to be consistent in their attitude on the question of a double dissolution. All their speeches would lead the country to believe that they are anxious for a general election; but we all remember the dejection on their faces when the death-knell was sounded a few days ago. We also know* Low certain members of the Labour parly grovelled to some of their colleagues to put, off the evil day; but when the test Bill had been thrown out by the Senate, and the shock came, all that was left for them to do was to lead the public to think that they were pleased at the prospect before them. The granting of Supply is urgent and important in view of the fact that the public servants have to be paid, and the works of the country carried on.",64
432,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Then why "" stick up "" the Supply Bill?  tain the Committee only a few moments, whereas most of the speakers opposite have occupied the full time allowed. It has been shown during the past fortnight that the earnest wish of the Opposition is to put off the evil day as long as possible - to be saved from their friends, the electors, and to draw their emoluments to the very last day. If they are consistent, however, they will allow this debate to be closed and Supply granted, so that the public servants may receive their salaries, and the public works be carried on. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Government are not going on with any public works; orders have gone out to stop them until after the 30th June.",65
433,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That statement is not corroct>  member for Darwin has been so long out of office that, probably, he has forgotten the procedure, and also the fact that after the 30th June there is no money provided. The electors, who are masters of the situation, ought to be afforded the earliest opportunity to show whether they are satisfied with the administration, not only of the Electoral Act, but of all the Departments, by the present Government. Mr BRENNAN"" (Batman) [8.10] It is rather late in the day to trouble selves with matters of policy so far as this Parliament is concerned, seeing that we have to go to the country. T. am very much concerned, however, to note that the >romise given by the Prime Minister a } ittle time back, that this was to ba a square stand-up fight in every respect, is, apparently, not to be carried out. If there is anything in a paragraph which appeared in the Argus of 13th June last, it seems to me that there is a determined effort Mr KING O'MALLEY - At corruption.",65
434,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am not going to make a charge of that kind against the Government, but I do say that they are following a practice which will prevent a square stand-up fight between parties. The honourable member for Henty is very much disturbed because we have adverted and readverted to the question of the Electoral Act.",65
435,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It seems to me that honourable members opposite only desire time to stuff the rolls.,65
436,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Electoral Act and the condition of the rolls are of the very highest importance at the present juncture.,65
437,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Ero m the honourable member's point of view, no doubt.",65
438,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the honourable member says that it is not so from his point of view, he makes a useful admission.",65
439,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Every man whose nams is not on the rolls ought to be fined £2.,65
440,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"We have heard from the Prime Minister, with tiresome reiteration, that he is doing all he can to purge the rolls. What does that mean? It means getting names off the rolls. I do not suggest that the Prime Minister deliberately sets out to disfranchise people, but I more than suggest that he comes here with an utterly erroneous idea that a number of persons, whose names are on the rolls, improperly exercised the franchise at the last election. Notwithstanding all the investigations that have been made, not a scintilla of proof has been obtained in support of the charge.",65
441,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member is talking before the report of the Royal Commission is tabled.,65
442,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Le t me read this our- significant passage from the ArgusIn any circumstances it is certain that the issue of the writs will follow very closely on the dissolution proclamation. The reason for this being that final purification of the rollsSave the markl may be immediately proceeded with. As no new names can be added after the writs have been issued, the supplementary rolls should be very small in every ease. Although new names may not be listed, names may be struck off almost up till the last moment, and every effort will, of course, be put forward to remove all those which are shown to be wrongly in print. That is, I submit, a very serious matter. If this does represent the intentions of the Government Mr KING O'MALLEY - There will be no Supply.",65
443,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is one possible consequence, but if that represents the intentions of the Government, it simply means that, after the rolls have been printed, there will be no opportunity to have placed on them names which have been wrongly omitted. If I could only get the Government to realise that it is infinitely more important that every person qualified to vote should be enrolled than that, in a few instances, names which are twice enrolled should be removed, some good service would be done. The repeated allegation of the Government that persons whose names have accidentally been enrolled twice will vote twice is absurd, and more than absurd, it is wicked- a scandalous slander on the electors of the country. Eor the Prime Minister to tell us continually that all his efforts, and those of his officers, are being directed to the purging of the rolls, the removal of names, is for him to show a poor conception of his duties as head of the Electoral Department. That honourable gentleman got the honourable member for Gippsland to question him about a certain circular, so that he might stigmatize the statements therein as a pack of lies. I therefore tender him this warning-that , if ample opportunity is not afforded to place on the rolls the names that have been improperly removed, and those which should have been enrolled that have been left off, I shall charge the Government with having deliberately obstructed enrolment to prevent a fair poll being taken. I make the statement now so that it may not be said that it was uttered outside by some one who had not the courage to make it here. The Act provides for a certain procedure in the removal of names from the rolls. It contemplates the making of a deposit of 5s. by every person who objects to any name. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs said the other day that that provision has gone by the board. Nevertheless, it remains the law, and should be observed. But in practice any person may now object to a name without backing his objection with a deposit of 5s. or of 5d. He need simply hint to a policeman or registrar that a name should be challenged, and to the person whose name is mentioned will immediately be sent a notice, informing him that unless within twenty days he shows cause why his name should be retained it will be removed from the roll. Such notices are sometimes not received by the persons to whom they are sent, and are sometimes not understood when received. In some cases they cannot be read, and thus names come to be removed that should not be removed. Many instances have been given, and I have here a notice which was directed to a person who had lived continuously for twenty years in one house. Had not her friends explained the notice to her, her name would have been removed from the roll. We wish to prevent occurrences of that kind. We are more concerned with getting names on the rolls than with anything else, because we desire a square, straight out appeal to the people. Honourable members opposite have been very persistent in stating that the Labour party is opposed to postal voting, and that we have prevented the passing of a measure which would give facilities for the exercise of the franchise by persons who, without some provision for voting by post, cannot exercise it. But I shall not forget to impress on the electors this fact: that of the two Bills which were to be sent to the Senate .in order to secure their rejection, and thus obtain ground for advising the Governor General to dissolve both Houses of the Parliament, only one was pressed, the Voting by Post Bill being dropped. It is the Liberal party that is responsible for the fact that some system of postal voting has not been provided this session. We submitted one amendment, and could have submitted others, believing that an understanding might be arrived at which would result in the adoption of a system of postal voting which would be acceptable to all parties. It is true that postal voting was abolished by the Labour party, but that was necessary to wipe out the vicious practices that the law, as it stood, permitted. We wiped the slate clean, and were prepared, pursuant to our policy of enfranchising every one who should be enfranchised, to support any reasonable system of postal voting, or other reasonable system of voting, which would assist the sick, and would prevent the abuses which occurred under the old postal voting system. We are not, and never shall be, prepared to accept the postalvoting system - which the Fisher Government abolished, because we know too well the abuses to which it gave rise. I wish to draw the attention of Liberals to a company established in Melbourne - just before the last referendum and election. It was named the Victorian Agency Company, composed of rich squatters, investors, lawyers, importers, and well-known supporters of the Liberal party, including some Liberal members.  member give the name of any Liberal member who was a member of the company?",66
444,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member for Corangamite was a member of it, as were also the ex-members for Fawkner and Fremantle, Mr Knox, of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, Mr Barr Smith, of South Australia, and other good Liberal supporters and fighters.",67
445,Mr HANS IRVINE,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What harm did they do?,67
446,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the honourable member will wait, I shall tell him. The primary, and, so far as I can ascertain, the only, object of the company was to establish, print, and publish a newspaper in Victoria or elsewhere; "" to carry on the business of newspaper proprietors, printers, publishers, and advertising agents."" All that company did was to print and publish a paper called Public Opinion, which was hawked round to election meetings, and elsewhere, and thrust under our noses as a vehicle of healthy, public opinion, particularly of Liberal opinion. A copy that I have here depicts Labour with a bludgeon about to knock down the "" free worker,"" the "" producer,"" the "" manufacturer,"" the "" consumer,"" and "" private enterprise."" The truth is that the company deliberately entered into a voluntary sequestration and failed to pay the men who printed its paper. It left them in the lurch. The Treasurer says that he does not think that Mr Fairbairn would be a party to such a thing.  orable member know that the workers can recover their wages?",67
447,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If I knew that, I should know more than the secretary of the company. I ask the honourable member to listen to this letter, which was addressed to the shareholdersDear Sir or Madam, I have to inform you that an extraordinary meeting of shareholders of the above company was convened for the purpose of passing a resolution to place the company into voluntary liquidation. At such meeting, however, a quorum sufficient to carry the resolution was not present, and the meeting was consequently adjourned for a period of seven days. Although every effort was made to obtain a quorum at the adjourned meeting, the necessary number of shareholders were not present at such meeting. It was decided by the shareholders, however, that the creditors be advised of the financial position of the company. I have therefore to inform you that the liabilities of the company amount to £718 15s., as per list herewith, and that the only asset is the sum of £80 which is to be received for the sale of the copyright of Public Opinion, book debts, contracts and goodwill of the company, and which offer the shareholders present at the meeting instructed the directors to accept. Unfortunately, this amount is insufficient to meet the liabilities to the preferential creditors, consequently there is no provision for the ordinary creditors. It was also resolved by a majority of the shareholders that unless the creditors desired to take action, the directors distribute the moneys in the hands of the company amongst the preferential creditors in proportion to the amounts of their debts, such distribution to be made at the expiration of fourteen days from this date. I am, yours faithfully, F. L. SMYTH, Secy. The honourable member will see that there was not much money with which to pay even preferential creditors, and let me remind him as a lawyer, since he appears to appeal to me as a fellow practitioner, that the men who printed this paper were not, and are not, preferential creditors. They have not received one penny of the £133 that is owing to them, and have themselves been driven into a condition of insolvency.",67
448,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Was it a limited liability company 1,67
449,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If c was a proprietary company. When a certain firm of solicitors wrote to it , to obtain payment for these men, pointing out that that should be the first consideration, it received a reply coolly stating that it was a mistake to suppose that Public Opinion was a political journal. The solicitors in question had said that it was a political journal, and that it was a matter of moral, if not legal, obligation that the men who had printed it should be paid before the company went into voluntary liquidation. I say deliberately that it was immoral and dishonest to leave these men unpaid, and that the action of the company reflects no credit on the Liberal party.",67
450,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What had the Liberal party to do with it?,68
451,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The paper belonged to the Liberal party. These were the representative men who fought the referenda and the Labour party. Public Opinion was published for the express purpose of fighting the Labour party and the referenda, and for that alone. able member ought to know that. But no sooner were the referenda defeated than this newspaper company proceeded to go intovoluntary liquidation and the workmen were left in the lurch. It was not a political paper, we are to l d ; yet here, in the copy which I present to the gaze of honourable members, will be seen a cartoon depicting Labour taking up a menacing attitude towards the poor weaklings of orivate enterprise, the manufacturer, the producer, and the squatter. Here is another political cartoon depicting the ex-Attorney-General, Hughes, in a perfect maelstrom, and with a diabolical look upon his face. Underneath it we have the statement, "" Mr Hughes, Federal Attorney-General, runs wild and threatens prosecutions."" The frontispiece and leading article in every issue were directed entirely to political purposes, and to fighting the referenda. Here is yet another copy in which the principal cartoon depicts "" The last hope of Labour,"" and talks of "" The In glorious 31st."" Every issue was distinctly Liberal, and distinctly political in tone. The paper was printed solely for political purposes by representative Liberals.",68
452,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Does not the Victorian law provide that wages shall.be a first charge on the assets of a company?,68
453,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,But this company had none-it had no machinery.,68
454,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The member for Henty is the last man in the world to whom I should be expected to give cheap legal advice. I am prepared to concede that wages are a preferential claim, but where there is nothing to prefer what is the use of a preference? The Public Opinion proprietary in Victoria comprised the Hon. Edward Miller, the Hon. E . E . Smith, Mr George Fairbairn, M.P. , Mr J . C. Manifold, M . P . , Mr . Merritt, M . L . C . , Mr James Riley-n o relation to the honourable member for South Sydney- Mr R. S. Whiting, a Western District squatter; Mr A . H .

Brown, President of the Pastoralists' Union; whilst in New South Wales it consisted of Mr E. W . K n o x , General Secretary of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company; Mr G. R. Jackson, The honor- and Mr Geoffrey Kiddle, of Walbundrie. The honourable member for Echuca unwisely, from his own point of view, dragged out of me certain names. The Treasurer said that he did not think Mr George Fairbairn would be a party to a wrong, and I am prepared at once to say that I do not think he would be a deliberateparty to the non-payment of tliese men, nor would Mr Manifold, who, I understand, came into the company late on in its history. I was asked to give certain names and I gave them as those of shareholders in the company. They did not, Mr perhaps, appreciate the wrong that was done in connection with this company. I have no desire to make any charge against them.",68
455,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,There must be some mistake about Mr Barr Smith. He is one of the most generous men in South Australia.,68
456,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,""" So are we all, all honourable men."" But the fact remains that these were shareholders of the company. They acted quite within the law. They were under no legal obligation to see that these men were paid. But since they were engaged upon a political fight the honourable course for them to pursue was to see that the working men who were employed in preparing the political instrument which they used in the fight were paid for their labour. It will be honourable derogatory to public life as well as to private dealings amongst men if it is possible to form a company with a capital of £10,000 for election purposes, and, as soon as the election is over, to wind-up that company, leaving unpaid those who have worked for it . It is a dishonest, dishonourable course of action, and I protest against it . It is grossly unfair te persons who enter in good f a it h into contracts with companies of the kind.",68

I know nothing of the merits of the case, but I believe that before the debate is over it will be put before us i u its proper aspect. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said last night that there was no necessity for a double dissolution, and that the Opposition would have assisted the Government had it endeavoured to bring forward legislation for the well-being of the Gornmonwealth. One of the first actions of the present Administration was to bring forward an amending Electoral Bill , and I defy any one who has had experience of our present Electoral Act to say that it does not need to be amended almost from beginning to end.

465,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is being insisted on now, and rightly so.",69
466,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"In Geraldton recently- I am - dealing with the State law - som e 100 applications for enrolment were received. The only address given was that of "" Geraldton,"" and I understand that the Crown Solicitor held that to be a sufficient address. The same thing might be done in connection with the Commonwealth rolls.. I desire that the Department shall insist upon the full address and occupation of the applicant and the witness being given so that when applications are investigated it will be possible to take .proceedings against, not only the applicant, but the witness in any case of wrong doing. Mr . ELnibbs told us that the rolls used at the last election contained 180,000 names, more than there were adults in the Commonwealth. That surely was .sufficient to make us consider whetlier an amendment of the Act was not necessary. The Government, as I have said, introduced an Amending Bill , but the Opposition would not even allow us to take it in to Committee, although the Attorney-General appealed to them to assist us in framing a sound electoral law. From beginning to end of our consideration of the Bill there was nothing but obstruction on the part of the Opposition, and werealized that if we desired to carry usef u l legislation the only course was to goback to our masters, the people, and to ask them to unravel the tangle they had created. I wish to impress upon the Government the advisableness of requiring the Inter-State Commission to visit, the other States, and particularly Western Australia, before they make any report on the Tariff. Western Australia, shall certainly is a country of magnificent distances, producing wool, wheat, meat, and f r u it . Many of those on the land have to go a. long way back, and the expenses of production are exceedingly high. They wish to put their case before the Commission, for under present conditions the cost of food supplies is high, and the duties upon the implements they require constitute a heavy tax upon those who have to go intothe world's market to sell their produce..",69
467,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I thought the honourable member was a Protectionist.,70
468,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"At the proper time. I am prepared to explain my policy on this question. The producers of Western Australia desire to be given an opportunity to state their case to the Inter-State Commission before it reports to Parliament. In regard to the finances, I was surprised that the honourable member for Kennedy, when speaking the other evening, seemed to be very sore indeed because the Treasurer had stated that it was estimated that the surplus at the end of the year would be £800,000. The honourable member was insistent on the fact being plained to the public that the difference between the receipts and expenditure represented a deficit of £1,800,000. When the Estimates were submitted last year it was realized that the expenditure would be very much greater than the revenue, and it was undoubtedly proved here that the draft Estimates approved by exMinisters showed an expenditure of some millions more than the Treasurer estimated to the Committee.",70
469,Mr KILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Where do you find that proof?,70
470,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Fro m the statements given to the House and the draft Estimates signed and approved by some ex-Ministers. I am pleased that the expenditure this year has not been so great as had been anticipated. When we realise the enormous additions to the revenue received by the Government during the past three years, one can hardly wonder at the extravagant financial orgy which was indulged in. In regard to the Estimates submitted last year, I fail to see that the present Treasurer made any great departure from the method of estimating adopted by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer. For the year 1911-12 the then Treasurer estimated to receive a revenue of £19,550,000; he estimated his expenditure to be £21,227,000, and he was going to expend the whole of the surplus of £1,712,000 which had accumulated prior to that date. The honourable member did not expend all that he estimated, and his revenue was greater than he had anticipated, with the result that the year closed with a surplus of £2,261,000. In the following year, 1912-13, the honourable member for Wide Bay estimated a revenue of £20,442,000, and the Committee was asked to agree to an estimated expenditure of £22,683,000. So that the honourable gentleman intended to expend, not only the whole of the estimated revenue of £20,442,000, as well as the surplus of £2,261,000, ' but he also borrowed £2,100,000, which meant that he obtained approval to spend in 1912-13 £4,360,000 more than the estimated revenue for the year. I do not know what the expenditure would have been had the same Government continued in power, but I do fail to understand the policy of the Leader of the Opposition after hearing him state the other night that he obex- jected to loan moneys being expended on the naval bases and similar works. In the face of that statement, I cannot understand how he induced Parliament to agree to the borrowing of money for the building of the Commonwealth offices in London.",70
471,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Is not that a good asset^,70
472,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Of course it is, and so are the Naval Bases.",70
473,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Where is the asset in the Naval Bases?,70
474,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"In addition to that expenditure of £2,100,000 from loan moneys on the Commonwealth offices and other works, there was £870,000 for the purchase of the Cockatoo Island Dock, and they treated it as a transferred property.",70
475,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Is that not a good asset?,70
476,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not know that it is, after the reports that I have read lately.",70
477,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,You are no judge.,70
478,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have not the wisdom of the honourable member opposite, but I prefer to accept the reports which have come from experts who have some knowledge of the subject.",70
479,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,They could realise the purchase money today if they were to sell the property.,70
480,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Then , in view of the reports which have been published, I think it would be a good thing for the Government to get rid of the dock.",70
481,Mr LATED SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Where is the dock you constructed at Fremantle out of loan money ?,70
482,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It was never constructed; it was abandoned. The point I am trying to make is that in 1912-13 the Labour Administration were willing to spend £4,360,000 more than their revenue, and to that must be added the £870,000 for the purchase of the Cockatoo Island Dock, or a total of over £5,000,000 of expenditure in excess of the revenue. We must realise that there are many recurring items on the Estimates which must increase from year to year. There are the old-age pensions, which I hope we will be able to increase, but which, in consequence of the natural increase of population and of our people becoming older, must increase in number, with the inevitable result that next year, and in each succeeding year, a greater amount must be placed on the Estimates. The same argument applies to the maternity allowance and the defence scheme. As the cadets are drafted into the Forces and our warships are manned, there must be in the next few years a far greater expenditure than there has been in the past.",70
483,Mr BKENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Do you not that the Attorney-General referred to the maternity allowance as a waste of public money? I understand that the Government are going to do away with that.,71
484,Mr GREGOEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I fail to understand what the honourable member understands. The honourable member for Kennedy was very insistent that the Treasurer should state how he was going to make good all this expenditure, and whether he was going to propose increased taxation. If the money required for big permanent works, such as the Federal Capital, which should be a charge on posterity, and the Naval Bases and other big defence expenditure is to be found from revenue there must be increased taxation to enable us to meet our expenses,",71
485,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Do you want your children to pay your debts?,71
486,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Probably the honourable member and I might get out. of our debts, but the Commonwealth will be compelled to pay its debts. Honourable members opposite practically admitted the truth of my argument, seeing that in the 1912-13 Estimates they proposed to spend £5,000,000 more than their revenue. If only the year before last it was a proper thing to spend £5,000,000 more than the revenue, how will honourable members foot the bill in future, having regard to the increasing cost of administration, unless we are going to have rigid economy, and construct such permanent works as I have described from loan money? If , on the other hand, we are going to adopt the policy of honourable members opposite, there must be increased taxation to enable the Treasurer to pay his way. If honourable members opposite are emphatic on that point, and want it to be clearly understood that we are to have increased taxation so as to pay for all these things, the sooner the public know their policy the better.",71
487,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,What is your policy in regard to loan moneys?,71
488,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"My policy is to use borrowed money for all permanent works, and especially for the Federal Capital. If we are going to build a great city that Avill be a credit to posterity, and should ultimately bring in a good revenue, why on earth cannot we build it from loan moneys with a reasonable sinking know fund attached, so that within fifty or sixty years the whole of the loan will be paid off ? Why should we be taxed for all these works?",71
489,Mr YATES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"You are going to use the city, are you not ?",71
490,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Well , I do not know, but I feel confident that honourable members opposite, if they return to power, and find that they have not sufficient funds available from revenue, will introduce a Loan Bill to cover the expenditure on the Commonwealth offices in London, the Federal Capital, the Perth Post Office and works of that description. They must have their tongues in their cheek, and must be trying to deceive the people, when they say they will not agree to the use of loan moneys in the construction of such works. I have just a few words to say in regard to the postal administration. I know that the Postmaster-General has endeavoured to liberalize the conditions governing the granting of telephone services to outback districts, so far as the regulations will allow; but I do contend that when a Srate Government spends hundreds of thousands of pounds in constructing a railway, building roads and establishing water supplies for the purpose of permanently opening up the country, the Commonwealth is justified in constructing telephone lines along those railways, and doing something t.o help the development of the country, without insisting upon a ll the conditions and restrictions that are enforced at the present time. I believe that such a policy can be adopted. As I remarked before, Western Australia is a State of enormous distances, ancl in many districts wliere railways have been constructed the population is very small and scattered.",71
491,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Do you think the railway we are building to Western Australia will ever pay?,72
492,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not know. That depends on the development of the whole of the country. Judging from the reports I have received, that railway should be a paying proposition in about ten years from the date of its completion. But from the progress that has been made to date, it is very difficult to say when the line will be completed. In connection with the building of spur lines in Western Australia, through districts where there was very little population, I notice that, although those lines do not actually pay at once, the net result to the whole system is such that the railways as a whole pay handsomely. Therefore, I commend to the consideration of the Government a similar system of railway construction for the development of the Northern Terri tory. Cheap lines could be constructed on a narrow gauge, and they could be standardized when the development, population, and traffic warranted. The Western Australian experience is that cheap rail-, way lines are a wonderful aid in developing the country. Reverting to the Postal Department, I think that most of the country members on both sides of the House would heartily concur in some amendment of the regulations which would enable the Postmaster General, in dealing with the granting of telephone facilities, to give to the people along those spur lines some of the conveniences which are given to the people in the cities.",72
493,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"He a r , hear!",72
494,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Thos e people certainly deserve consideration, and we know that the people in the cities cannot claim that they have been neglected, whilst, on the other hand, it can be claimed that in many instances the people in the country arc neglected.",72
495,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That is too true.,72
496,Mr GREGORY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"When we consider that the export trade of Australia is something like £79,000,000, and that, with the exception of a few thousand pounds, the whole of that trade is the outcome of the development of land, and thb production of wool, wheat, metals, and other primary products, greater considerationshould be 1 given to those who are trying to develop and pioneer the primary industries of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Postmaster-General will give full consideration to the request I have made^ and that that request will be endorsed by honourable members on both sides of the House-.",72
497,Mr BURCHELL,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Fremantle) [9.0] I was interested in the references of the honourable member for Dampier to the possibilities of f r a u d under the present Electoral Act.. If I remember correctly, the honourable member spoke of the door being open to fraud, and the inference certainly was that fraud was practised during the last election. I maintain that if any honourable member knows of an instance of fraud being perpetrated under the Electoral Act it is his bounden duty to go before the Electoral Commission that is now taking evidence, and give proof of it. When we find honourable members talking about f r a u d or the possibility of fraud during the recent elections, I would remind them that the amending Electoral Bill of last session provided for something infinitely worse by which the secrecy of the ballot was likely to be destroyed. The proposal of the Government was that the elector should sign the butt of the ballot-paper, and that the butfc and ballot-paper were to bear corresponding numbers by which, as will be readily understood, it would be easy to trace the elector's vote, and it ill becomes any honourable member supporting the Ministry to make such references fco the Electoral Act as the honourable member for Dampier has made when he is supporting a Government that introduced legislation that would destroy the secrecy of the ballot. I support the honourable member for Dampier in his request that the Inter-State Commission should visit Western 'Australia. I frankly acknowledge that we have not in that State as.many industries firmly established as in the Eastern portion of Australia. Prior to Federation there were a number of industries in Western Australia, but the introduction of the Federal system and the abolition of Inter-State duties caused a great slump in those industries. Now, however, I am glad to say the temporary depression is being overcome, and there are many manufactures in the State, and it would be a good move on the part of the Inter-State Commission to visit Western Australia prior to presenting their report. We have not any definite promise of an interim report from that Commission. The Minister of Trade and Customs made some reference the other day to amendments of the Tariff. Apparently his promise was on all-fours with the usual policy of the present Government. They have no intention of attempting to amend the Tariff "" n o w , "" or prior to the double dissolution, which has been granted conditionally by Governor General; but at some time in the far distant future they will do it . I believe in what is known as the new Protection, but if under the existing Constitution it is not possible for us to legislate along those lines, I believe that for a new country such as Australia a protective Tariff is desirable. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the country that steps should be taken as early as possible to revise and amend the Tariff in order that it may be more protective. I have just touched on one or two matters mentioned by the honourable member for Dampier in order to connect my remarks with liis speech. I wish now to say a word or two about the present situation, To refuse to produce the correspondence that passed between the Government and the Governor General is a peculiar attitude for Ministers to adopt. I cannot understand why the correspondence should be regarded as confidential. The stand I take is that as the community in general will be called upon to pay for the election, there is no reason why they should not be acquainted with the full position, and if the Government have nothing to hide, which is the inference to be drawn from the answers given by the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition, why do not Ministers come forward and lay that correspondence on the table of the House, in order that the country may be enabled to come to a decision? In my opinion, the existing dead-lock, or so-called dead-lock, between the two Houses has been carefully engineered and manufactured by the Government. They have made no attempt to bring forward legislation necessary for the well-being and good government of Australia, but they have sought from the time of tlieir taking ofiice to bring about the present situation, and, having been successful in their desire, they are now somewhat jubilant.",72
498,Mr ABTHUB,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Do you think that they are really jubilant?,73
499,Mr BURCHELL,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member for Edeii-Monaro, and one or two others, seem not to be too anxious to go before tlieir constituents, and there may also be one or two on this side who are not too anxious. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am not anxious. the Mr BURCHELL - So far tliere does not appear to be any one ready to oppose the honourable member. He is likely to have a walk-over. Mr KING O'MALLEY - But it is the waste of boodle that I object to.",73
500,Mr BURCHELL,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"When this Parliament was first summoned there were all sorts of wild and absurd charges made by all and sundry concerning the last elections. They were supposed to have been terribly corrupt, and it was said that every evil possible had been indulged in . The Electoral Commission has now been sitting for some considerable time, and, so far as I have been able to read in the daily press, nothing of a particularly startling nature has been disclosed. In fact, those who have been most insistent in regard to electoral fraud have been most backward in going before that Commission and proving their charges. This fact will serve to show the people of Australia that, after all, tliere was not much in the bogy raised after the last election.",73
501,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It was not a bogy; it was a campaign of slander.,73
502,Mr BURCHELL,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , from the Prime Minister down. In regard to the proposed regulation dealing with absentee voting, I cannot see much to cavil at in the matter of giving local voters the preference ; but I wish it to be clearly understood that I think the Electoral Department should make ample provision in the larger centres for absent voters at separate tables from those exercising their franchise in the ordinary way. If that is done, if a fair opportunity is given to the local voter, and alsofcofcheman who votes under the absentee regulations, there will be little cause for complaint so far as the working of the absentee voting system is concerned. I believe that it is a better system under normal conditions than the postal voting system. To have the rolls ready as' early as possible is essential. The Prime Minister does not desire that either side should have any He wishes us all to go to the country, and have a fair opportunity of explaining our views, and he seeks to have the election conducted under the best conditions. all agree with those sentiments, wish to make sure that the rolls will be in a proper state. Unquestionably period of three weeks or a month is essential between the issue of the rolls and the date on which the writs are issued, in order that people may make sure their names are on the rolls, or may send in claim cards if their names are not on the rolls. The honourable member Nepean made reference this afternoon to the old-age pensions. It was quite refreshing to hear some of the sentiments to which h.e gave expression. We are glad to know that honourable members on both sides of the Chamber are anxious to improve the lot of those who are in their old age, and who, through force of circumstances over which sometimes have had no control, are compelled to apply for the old-age pension. I was struck by one remark to the effect that honourable members on this side of the chamber had attempted to block any opportunity given for considering the increase the pension from 10s. a week to 12s. 6d., moved for last session by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. I find, on referring to Hansard, that, after two or three members had spoken on the motion the Treasurer was responsible for the adjournment of the debate, since when we have heard nothing about the matter except by way of questions. On the 29th May of this year the honourable for Eden-Monaro asked the what was being done in regard to this increase, and the reply was that consideration would be given to it when arranging the Estimates for the financial year 191415. Therefore, honourable members see that the responsibility for delay in this regard rests with the Government, not with the Opposition. Reference has been made to those pensioners who are living in institutions supported State. I was glad to see that the amending Bill brought down by the Treasurer Mr Burchell. last session provided that these pensioners should receive'the difference between the cost of their maintenance by the State and the 10s. per week allowed by the law.. On looking at the records, I find that the first reading was on the 14th Octoadvantage. ber, 1913, and that these champions for the increase to the pensioners, who desired, above everything, to give them all they are justly entitled to, took no f u r We ther 'action until the 16th December. but we The second-reading speech was then made by the Treasurer, and, after a a brief rejoinder of about five minutes in length from the Leader of the Opposition, the measure was shelved, and nothing more has been heard of it . If that there was any genuine desire on the part of the Government to deal with the question, they should have attempted to for do so this session, instead of proceeding with the so-called "" t e s t "" measures. One measure that has been before the Federal Parliament for several years past is what is now the Navigation Act . That was introduced some nine or ten years ago, and, after a chequered career, was passed during the term of the Fisher Administration. It was rethey ferred by the then Governor General to His Majesty's Government in the Old Country for the Royal assent, which was given on the 24th November, 1913. That was some seven or eight months ago. being",73
503,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,After the Titanic in disaster.,74
504,Mr BURCHELL,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Quite so; but very little appears to have been done to proclaim the Act, and bring it into operation.",74
505,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Minister has it "" u n d e r observation.""",74
506,Mr BURCHELL,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is hardly so bad as that, because by means of quesmember tions I have extracted some information Treasurer from the Minister of Trade and Customs regarding it . On the 15th A p r i l the honourable gentleman stated that the Regulations were being pressed forward, and that applications had been called will for the position of the Director of Navigation, and he wound up by saying that and he had no idea when the Act could be proclaimed. This was some five months after the Royal assent had been given. by the On the 3rd June, in answer to another question, the Minister of Trade and Customs said that it was impossible to fix a date, and that the Ac t could not Le proclaimed for several months. Later that month, on the l l t h , the honourable gentleman informed me' that the applications for the position of Director of Navigation were being ""considered."" Some evidence was supplied last night by the honourable member for Brisbane, and we have now this further evidence of the manner in which the Minister of Trade and Customs carries on his work. Except for the proclamation, the Navigation Acfc has been law for about eight months, and all that the Minister can say has been done is that the applications for the position of Director are "" under consideration."" Truly this is a wonderful record of administrative ability, one which it would be hard to equal. An attack has been made by the Treasurer on the maternity allowance. I was pleased to notice that the honourable member for Dampier included this allowance in his general benediction on social improvement. This is quite refreshing, in view of the bitter attacks that were made on the maternity allowance during the last election campaign, when we were told that it was a huge waste of public money, and that it ought not to be permitted. I admire the Treasurer, who is, at any rate, consistent, and now tells the same story he told twelve months or more ago. When in troducing this very Supply Bill , in response to an interjection by the honourable member for Yarra, the Treasurer said, "" Y o u are very generous with other people's money."" Underlying all this is the idea on the part of the Treasurer and others that it is criminal, in a sense, to expend money on a maternity allowance. Knowing your humanitarian views, Mr Fowler, I feel confident you w i ll not agree with expressions of the kind uped by the Treasurer, but would rather desire the maternity allowance to be granted throughout the land, without any class di. tinctions. I shall not deal with the financial position at any great length. I have again read the Treasurer's speech, and I find that the estimated revenue for 1913-14 £21,462,000, while the estimated expenditure was £23,281,000, showing an excess of expenditure of £1,819,000. I appreciate the point taken by the honourable member for Dampier that, in framing the estimate of expenditure, the revenue must necessarily be borne in m in d; but had it not been for the fact that there was a surplus of over £2,600,000 left by the Fisher Administration , the position of the Government today would have been considerably worse. We are told that there will be a surplus of £824,305. This is interesting, in view of the fact that the pre-election statements of our honourable friends opposite were very different indeed from those they are making today. We were then told that the Fisher Government had entered upon a 1 ' wild orgy ' ' in finance-that money was being squandered right and left-and one honourable member is reported to have said that sums of money had been frittered away nobody knew where, and that "" contingencies "" accounted for the whole. The statement of the Treasurer today clearly shows that the Government Bave not been able to do all they promised the people. They came into power to reduce expenditure, and they met their first Parliament with a Budget that provided for an increase of from £4,000,000 to £5,000.000. Yet we are told that the present Government know all that there is to know about sound finance! On the 16th A p r i l , 1913, the Minister of Defence, in another Chamber, said, in reply to a question, that approval, had been given to the paymenfc of the money appropriated for increases to Area Officers; and on the 13th May following he said that, in any case, the payment to these Area Officers would be made to apply fco the present financial year. I have in my hand a copy of Statutory Rule 55 of this year, which reached me only today, and from that I find that Area Officers who received £ 1 5 0 , excluding all allowances, are now to receive from £150 to £ 1 8 0 . There is, however, a certain clause in the regulation which providesSubject to provision being made by Parliament, the Minister may approve of an increment being granted at the rate of £30 per annum, after three years satisfactory service as an Area Officer, on a certificate from the District Commandant that the duties have been performed in an efficient manner. was This looks well; but how many area officers were there three years ago, or prior to November, 1913, from which the regulation dates? Is this simply a means of saving a paltry sum, or is it something with which to gull a certain section of the community into the belief that they are going to get something which they actually will not get? I have today received a wire from Western Australia informing me that'ten men were on Tuesday discharged from the works at the Henderson Naval Base, Cockburn Sound. It will be interesting, perhaps, to the Treasurer, and other Western Australian members, to know that the people of that State realise the treatment they can expect from the Cook Government. the 16th April, the Minister of Defence, in the Senate, when questioned regarding Cockburn Sound, said there was work which could be proceeded with, and which would be necessary. The honourable gentleman, later, stated fchafc a considerable amount of work would be necessary before the major portion of the work could be undertaken. If , as the Minister says, there was a ""considerable amount"" of work to be done in April of this year, what is the Minister's idea of a "" considerable amount "" ? Has the work been completed, seeing that the Government are'reducing the number of men engaged? We were told at one time that men were being put on these works for electioneering purposes. Have we now a case of men being put off the works for electioneering purposes? There are only a few men concerned; and I am glad to say, judging from the result of the last election, that, even if they were compelled fco leave the Fremantle district, I should not be affected personally. the Fisher Government went out of olB.ce there were between 180 and 190 men employed at Cockburn Sound, but, according to the return presented by the Honorary Minister the other day, there were, when the return was prepared, only fiftythree, and if ten have since been dismissed, we seefchafcthere are now only forty-three men engaged. Although the Minister has refused to acknowledge that the Government are going to wait for Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice's report, that would appear to be their intention, or they are trying to save money this year, and endeavouring to avoid the necessity of making financial provision for the work afc the Naval Base next year. The supporters of the Government, by the vote they cast on the Constitution Alteration Amendment Bills, have placed themselves in a very peculiar position; and it is to be hoped that, when they go before the electors, as they will within a very limited time, they will be able to explain what action they propose to take to reduce the high cost of living that is pressing on all Mr Burchell. of us, and will be able to show what they are prepared to do to make the Constitution more workable than it is at present. The Attorney-General has acknowledged repeatedly that there should be some alterations; but now, when an opportunity is given to again test the feeling of the people on the question, the On supporters of the Government are found voting in such a way as to show they do not approve of any such appeal.",74

He stated fchafc I and other members formed a company which was promoted to publish this paper for political purposes. I do not propose to speak in defence of any other person connected with the company, but I wish to explain my position in regard to it. One or two months after this Parliament was elected, a representative of the newspaper asked me to take shares in the company, informing me that certain persons were already shareholders, and I took 100 shares, for which I paid £ 1 each. The next information I received was that there was to be a meeting of the shareholders to wind up the company. As I was not a shareholder during the election campaign, and doubt whether there was one issue When of the newspaper after my £100 had been paid, I did not consider that I had any liabilities in regard to the debts that might have been incurred prior to my becoming a shareholder.

509,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am showing that I was pretty soft in this case. I was informed by the representative of the newspaper that it had a large circulation, but I ascertained afterwards that it had been circulated free. My £100. would not have gone into it had I known that before. If I join a rotten concern, and find oufc immediately afterwards that all I am to get from the investment of my money is the right to sign a proxy form in connection with the winding up of the company, I do not consider that I have any personal liability concerning it .",76
510,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Is it true that the workmen employed in publishing the newspaper were not paid ?,76
511,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not know anything about that. I saw a copy of - a letter written to another gentleman, which was sent to me by the firm to which the honourable member for Batman belongs, and I understand that its contents were inquired into by certain agents of mine'.",77
512,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Does not the - orable member think that it would have been a fair thing to find out about the - company ?,77
513,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I was pretty soft, as I have said, in going into the company, but the whole of it s liabilities were incurred before I became a shareholder.",77
514,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The workmen ployed by the company did not know that , and they were not paid.",77
515,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"They did know that I was a shareholder, and all the liabilities of the company were in - curred before I became a shareholder. I should not have been so simple as to go into the concern had I made inquiries about it before taking the shares. The honourable member for Yarra this afternoon said that I voted for a duty on tea when a member of the first Federal Parliament. He mentioned that there were five members of this Parliament who voted for a tax on tea, I being one of them. I admit that I was one of them. The duty was not imposed, because of a combination of the then Labour party with a few Free Traders. must admit that a duty on tea is a revenue duty, and the combination that I speak of thought, I presume, that the finances of the Commonwealth would be - crippled, to the disadvantage of the Government, by the removal of that duty. I considered at the time that the duty was a fair one, and that the revenue which would be derived from it was necessary to meet the nnancial position of several of the States. Queensland was then in a most distressed condition. Federation, it had derived revenue from a, heavy tea duty, and I considered a moderate duty-2d . per lb - a fair compromise. I remember that a particular brand of tea, which was Is. 4d. when there was a duty upon it , remained at the same price after the duty had been removed. The consumer got no benefit by the removal of the duty. I believe that since then tea has gradually increased in price.",77
516,Mr ARTHUB,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The quality is better.,77
517,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I did not know that the honourable member was in the tea business, but what he has said was the answer given to me when I asked why the consumer did not benefit by the abolition of the duty of 2d. per lb. which had been collected under the Victorian Customs Act . According to our Free Trade hon- friends, the consumers always benefit when duties are abolished. I was in formed that the quality of the tea imported had improved, and that, consequently, it had to be sold at the same price S,s before.",77
518,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member ought to change his tea merchant. em- Mr MANIFOLD - The honourable member for Bendigo informs me that it is the custom of the trade to increase the not quality of tea when a duty is removed.,77
519,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,How many years ago is it since all this happened ?,77
520,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is centuries ago. The honourable member for Yarra wishes the public to believe that his party removed the duty from kerosene, but that is not so.. The Government of the day, which I had the honour to support, got a pretty warm time in regard to the kerosene duty. I considered that kerosene was the poor man's light, and the light of the people in the country; that a duty on it would tax the poorer people in the towns-especiall y in the country towns, where then there was not electric light Every one or gas-the cottager, and the people living out in the back-blocks. The duty on kerosene never came before the House at all ; the Minister of the day knowing perfectly well that he would not have the slightest chance of getting it passed. It was his own supporters who made him take off the duty.",77
521,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I moved that kerosene be free. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Mr Watson moved to strike off the duty, and Mr . Prior to Reid backed him. We arranged it in the Caucus.",77
522,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"My honourable friends had not so well-controlled a Caucus in those days as they have now. On Tariff questions they had no Caucus control at all. As for some of them, I did not know whether they were Free Traders or Protectionists.",77
523,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It is hard to tell now.,77
524,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,When it came to anything affecting a particular State,77
525,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Is the honourable member going to refer to the vote on threelegged glue-pots?,78
526,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am going to refer to the vote on the banana duty. Members who had been Free Traders until that duty was proposed then became Protectionists. There are one or two other matters to which I wish to refer. It has been stated by the Labour party that the Liberal party wishes to starve the Defence Department; that in touring the country we have spoken against the defence expenditure, and have proposed that it be cut down. My position in regard to defence is absolutely clear. I stated it when I contested the last election, and I shall state it again on the public platform. We have put the duty of defending the country on the lads and young men of Australia. We have made our boys commence at the age of fourteen years to prepare themselves to defend the country. They have to bear the whole responsibility up to the age of twenty-five years. That being so, the older citizens ought to pay, and pay well.",78
527,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Who do you ought to pay?,78
528,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Labour party says that the whole expense should be put on the land.,78
529,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,On the large landowners alone.,78
530,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That has been the contention, though I do not know whether they will get enough from the large land-owners. I think that they have others in their mind. As we ask the boys and young men to train to defend the country, we should provide proper places for them to train in, proper areas for them to train on, and proper equipment.",78
531,Mr ABTHUB,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,How are we going to do it?,78
532,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If we are not going to do it, we had better stop our defence preparations. We older people of the Commonwealth have no right to ask the boys and young men to give up a great part of their holiday time in preparing for the defence of the country, if we cannot find the necessary money. Whether the present expenditure is too great is another matter. In all probability we shall have to cut it down to a certain extent, but not to a very great extent. In my opinion, drill halls, naval bases, and other defence works should be paid for with loan money, provision being made for a considerable sinking fund. But ordinary annual expenditure should be met out of revenue. The Defence Department should not be starved. I hope that the report that the Light Horse is to suffer is not true. At the present time £4 a year is paid for horse allowance, and it is rumoured that the allowance is to be reduced to £3. I hope that that is not so.",78
533,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,You have to be very careful about crediting rumours these days.,78
534,Mr MANIFOLD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I hope that that rumour is not true. At Warrnambool there is a battery of artillery that has been in existence for a considerable time, the men being highly trained. Young men leaving the cadet forces have good opportunities to learn artillery work in that battery; but I understand that provision is not to be made for its continuance. I have written to the Minister of Defence on the subject, and have received the usual reply that "" the matter will receive consideration."" We know perfectly think well what that means. Another matter to which I draw attention is the administration of the old-age pension system. When I first stood for this Parliament, I said I would approve of a Commonwealth old age pension system; but I think that the system which has been adopted could be liberalized. If an old man is allowed the use of a cottage, or given a few shillings a week for doing odd jobs about a place, he is not allowed to draw an old-age pension, the Commissioner construing the Act as he thinks best. I have had many cases of that kind before me. Some time ago the Commissioner refused a pension to a man of sixty-eight years of age because he was allowed to occupy a room for sleeping in, and was given 4s. 6d. a week. The result was that the man who had been making this allowance to him had to turn him out on the road. He had to say to him, "" You must clear out in order to be entitled to draw a pension of 10s. a week."" That does not seem to be just or equitable. Then there is the case of old married people who are living apart, but who have not obtained a judicial separation. I know of many such cases where husband and wife have been separated for many years. In one case the couple have heen living apart for t h i r ty years. The woman will not return to her husband, who has money, and as there has been no judicial separation, she has not been able to obtain an old-age pension. It may be said that she can sue for maintenance, but if she did so, the husband would at once set up the defence that he was prepared to take her back and to provide a home for her, and that since she would not live with him, he would not allow her a penny. I think that the old-age pension system should be liberalized in its application to such cases, or that the Commissioner, at all events, should use a little more discretion in dealing with them.",78
535,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Darwin) [9.47] - I wish to begin my speech by quoting section 83 of the Constitution, which provides thatNo money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under impropriation made by law. But, until the expiration of one month after the first meeting of the Parliament, the Governor General in Council may draw from the Treasury and expend such moneys as may be necessary for the maintenance of any Department transferred to the Commonwealth and for the holding of the first elections for the Parliament. I read this provision of the Constitution because I am constantly being told that if another place fails to grant Supply-, His Excellency can issue warrants, and enable a general election to be held. My answer to such a statement is that it is rubbish. The Governor General has no such power, and if he does issue warrants and permits the money to be spent, he will have to pay it himself. Let me say straight out that if I were in charge of another place, Supply would be granted only from month to month, unless there was an absolute guarantee that there was to be no tampering with the electoral rolls. I have just returned from Tasmania, wliere I found a perfect avalanche of names being swept off the roll.",79
536,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"What does honourable member mean by ' ' tamperi n g "" with the rolls?",79
537,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"1 mean im properly removing the names from them. If we are to have a fight, let it be an honest one. Thousands of names should not be removed from the rolls without justification. In Tasmania, notices of objection are being sent out to men who do not know what they mean. I have had them [88] brought to me by men who say that they have been living in the same houses for twenty years, and cannot understand, therefore, why objection should be taken to their enrolment. If the Cook Government wish to do the honest thing-if they do not wanfc to bring down upon themselves the maledictions of generations yet to come,fcheywill not allowfchissort of thing to be continued. God cursed Egypt, and the very angels flying in heaven are saying, "" W o e be unto the Cook Government!"" I wish now to deal with the Treasurer's Budget story. When the Fisher Government took office on 30th A p r i l , 1910, they were faced with a deficit of £500,000. We paid it , and we also reduced the debts of, the Northern Territory. We took the currency out of the hands of private corporations, and placed it on the solid rock of the nation's credit. We created the national bank system. True, it was a small beginning, bufc we made a start with it . We prepared plans for the building of the transAustralian railway, and we started the work. We also laid the foundations of the Federal Capital. In our three years of office we gave employment to thousands of men and kept money in circulation. Business men were prosperous, and the rents went up and interest went down.  ment came in and ""washed up the dishes.""",79
538,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"They did not even wash them. They threw them out unwashed. Wlien Ave retired on the 25th June, 1913, Ave left the marvellous surplus of £2,643,305. We gave our successors a start such as no Government ever had before. But Avhat is the position today? The Treasurer says he has done the best that he could do in the circumstances, and. that is bad. There is a vast difference between the financial statement which he delivered on the l l t h inst. the and his Budget statement of October last. I shall try, in a simple Avay, to analyze the two statements without any prejudice or feeling, because Australia is my country, and I Avish to see it prosper. During the Fisher Administration the business men of this country had no difficulty in selling goods. The wholesale merchant is glad to sell his goods, the retailer is glad to buy, and the farmer is glad to pay for them Avhen he is able to do so, and that is when money is in circulation-whe n the nation is prosperous-as it was during the Pisher regime. On the l l t h inst. the Treasurer asked for £3,060,026 for the ordinary services of the Commonwealth, and £800,000 for new works and buildings. The right honourable gentleman said that the Government had not issued any order that works should be cut down until after the 30th June. I do not like to contradict a Minister, but I think I know something. Let me compare the right honourable gentleman's statement with what was done by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer of the Commonwealth. that capacity he sent for me, as the boss of the Commonwealth works show, some time before the end of the financial year, and said, "" Get your undertakings well under weigh; the money has been appropriated, and see that it is expended before the 30th June."" That is the ference between the two parties. Why have not the Cook Government come forward and said candidly, ""We have done the best we could do, and the best we could do was bad""? Instead of saying that they have a surplus of £824,000 on the year's transactions, why do they not honestly admit that they have "" burst"" up the Fisher surplus, and will show a deficit of £3,195,000 at the end of the financial year. After all, it is not a crime. The Prime Minister is a great talker and a mighty promiser; but what has he done? While I was in Tasmania I had plenty of time to compare the last Budget with the Treasurer's recent financial statement. I was able to do so at night after I had finished my talking, and had completed my work of getting people on the roll.",79
539,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"And getting plenty of "" repeaters "" ? Mr KING O'MALLEY-No ; I do not believe that 100 people in Australia "" repeated "" at the last election. I think that the people would be too scared to do anything of the kind.",80
540,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"To o honest. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Quite so. In my own electorate at the last election there were several men from Ballarat. I said to them, "" If you have not heen long - enough'in my electorate to entitle you to vote for me, you had better vote for MCGRATH."" But they replied, "" No ; we are not too sure about our position, and,, by Jove, we do not want to go into the' cooler.'"" The Treasurer in his Budget statement of October last, estimated the current financial year's revenue at £21,462,000, and the expenditure at £27,246,747. He estimated a deficit of £5,784,747, which was to be liquidated partly out of the Fisher surplus and partly out of loan funds. While the expenditure of revenue is £834,000 less than the Budget estimate, in consequence of the starvation of public works, it is charged against certain lands required In for defence purposes, while in the Budget it is charged against loan funds. But how can an honest Government say that Mr Fisher's surplus, which was the result of the accumulation of the revenues of 1910-11-12, is an ordinary item of revenue for 1913-14 ? If Mr Grice, or Mr. dif- Sargood, or any of those big business men of Australia, were to take capital and utilize it for the payment of dividends, he would be prosecuted under the Companies Act. Mr Fisher's surplus was accumulated national wealth. It was a reserve, to all intents and purposes like the reserves set apart by the banks.",80
541,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,It is only a credit to profit and loss. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is national capital.,80
542,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"You know better than that. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I know as much about banking as the honourable member does, and I say it is capital. A sum of £200,000 of this surplus is only postponed or deferred expenditure out of the fleet item of £1,002,000. How is that a surplus? It is not even a contingency surplus, and if that amount is deducted from the £824,000, there is left only £624,000. I will go on until I get every feather off that alleged surplus. We find that only a paltry £160,000 has been saved out of this orgy of militarism, instead of the half-million which the Prime Minister promised would be saved on the occasion when we refrained from reducing the military vote. The honourable member for Werriwa and several other honourable members would have voted with us, but we did not force a division because the Prime Minister made that promise. That is all the saving that has been made on military defence. On 25th June, 1913, the date on which the Fisher Government received the royal order of the boot, Mr Fisher's accumulated surplus, which is national capital, was £2,643,305. I did not spend six years in a banking institution in the City of New York without learning something about the game, and I think one would learn as much in New Y o rk as in Melbourne or Warrnambool. The total revenue, according to the Treasurer's estimate, was £21,462,000. What does one usuallydo when he brings down an item of profit - and loss? He enters it as ""brought forward from last balance-sheet."" The Treasurer did not do so, but commandeered Mr Fisher's surplus as an item of revenue for the year 1913-14.",80
543,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Quite right.,81
544,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,How can an accumulated surplus from the revenue of the three preceding years be considered revenue for this year? The honourable member will have to go to a financial kindergarten. ^ Mr Born - Balderdash ! This is banking mullock.,81
545,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Order ! The honourable member for Henty must not make those remarks.,81
546,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the honourable member desires to shift mullock he may do so. The present Government commandeered that surplus and called it a revenue item for 1913-14. I say this is a travesty of a balance-sheet. I do not blame the Treasurer; he has got into bad society. The inclusion of Mr Fisher's surplus increased the current financial year's revenue from £21,462,000 to £24,105,305. Supposing that were done by a business man, would honourable members call the result a surplus? I will not say what would happen, but this seems to me to be one of those desperate plunges at Hindoo figure juggling, which the ordinary Australian or American does not understand. The "" Cooked "" Government started with Mr Fisher's surplus of £2,643,305, and after thirteen months in office, these business managers of Australia-w c were told that all the business men of Australia, all the brains and genius, and multiplicit y of exaltation, were on the Treasury bench-w e find they have arrived at an absolute deficit of £2,019,000. And that is after exhausting the Fisher surplus, and after the works all over Australia, except those that could not be stopped, have been hung up, and hundreds of men have been made idle, and business allowed to become the worse in the history of Australia. I have never known the business of Australia to be worse than it is today. The banks are full of money, but no one wants it .",81
547,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Rent s are still going up.,81
548,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , they have stopped. I am going to take another point. If the honourable member for Henty will be willing to give a tenner to a hospital, I will do the same, if any recognised financial writer in Australia does not call Mr Fisher's surplus capital. Is that a go?",81
549,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,You did not cover the last bet I made with you the other night.,81
550,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"On e cannot make a bet, but he can make a present.",81
551,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Order ! Mr KING O'MALLEY - If that £200,000 for the fleet item were deducted, there would be a deficit of £2,019,000. I find that immediately after the 30th June the Government will have to cut loose and meet their obligations. And the deficit is right here. I will not say that the Government know it , because I do not know that they are competent enough to know it . L et me take another point. When we get, after the next election, not a shandygaff or nondescript Protection, but a real effective Protection that wil l give employment to our young men and young women in Australian factories, so that the £27,000,000 worth of wool that leaves this country annually wil l be turned into a finished product here, and sent to the other parts of the world to be sold as an Australian product; when we have a diversification of the industries, and Protection helps to develop intelligence- a protectionist country is an intelligent country-the revenue of the Commonwealth must f all . But assuming that the revenue does not f all at the end of the next financial year there will be a deficit of £1,194,695. These figures treat of only expenditure out of revenue. I quite agree with my honourable friend on the other side, that for the works at the Federal Capital, big post-offices, and \axg& reproductive works, we ought, if we have not a borrowing system, to have a business method whereby we transfer the burden to a little bit ahead, and that can be done. But I do not want to go into the world's markets to borrow u n t i l our finances rest in the Commonwealth Bank, until we have control, and all the States do their business through that bank. imagine that in the conversion of loans for the last five years we have had added to our debt every year £166,000 for brokerage, underwriting, bank commission, exchange,' and other things.",81
552,Mr CONROY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Will you tell me one country with a State bank where there has not been State bankruptcy?,82
553,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The United States of America have not had State bankruptcy. Hamilton's first bank almost put that country in the finest financial position in the world, but General Andrew Jackson got cross about the appointment of a manager in Portsmouth, Massachusetts. I have carefully totted up affairs, and I find that the Treasurer's Budget statement in October was about absolutely accurate. Looking at the matter from any stand-point, and having carefully searched its record for the last twelve months, I can only say that the "" Cooked "" Government reminds me of a one-eyed featherless owl on a lonely sandy hill in the midst of a stagnant, financially demoralized river, hooting at the vanguard of Labour, marching along the bank, promising everything, accomplishing nothing, and, when anything is to be done, always in a state of masterly pr ocrastin ation.",82
554,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Henty) [10.16] - I feel prostrated after the peroration of the honourable member for Darwin. lowed one of his illustrations in which he referred to a multiplicity of exaltation, and asked a colleague to interpret it for me, but it seemed to me to befog one as much as did his explanation of what he termed the Fisher surplus. According to my knowledge of State finance the revenue and the expenditure of a country cannot in any sense be interpreted as the capital that would be put into an in stitution such as the bank to which the honourable member referred. trading concern, after they have disposed of the necessary expenditure and paid dividends, the surplus is carried forward to the next year, and taken into the ordinary accounts of the year. examine the Budget statement for any State in the Commonwealth we shall find that exactly the same course is followed. Whatever surplus remains is carried forward to the next year.",82
555,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Not in this case; it goes into a Trust Fund.,82
556,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The money that is voted Just by Parliament, and is unexpended at the end of the financial year, is carried forward to probably continue the works that were authorized in the preceding year, and in that case it cannot in any sense be called capital. It is simply revenue which has been collected in the previous year, and held over to pay accounts on works that are not yet finished.",82
557,Mr BRENNAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Does it not ever become capital ?,82
558,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,In this case it never becomes capital.,82
559,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Constitution of the Commonwealth forbids that.,82
560,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I know that tliere is a difference in the Federal Constitution, but mere words in the Constitution do not make any difference in the collection and expenditure of money; you may call it by whatever name you like. The honourable member for Darwin tried to explain that because certain works had been approved by Parliament, and had not been completed, therefore the money voted to carry out the works should be counted as an expenditure. He adds that amount to the ordinary expenditure of the year, and says the deficit is in creased by so much. The thing is so much moonshine. If the expenditure has not been incurred, how can it possibly be added to a deficit to increase that deficit ? Surely as public works are carried into I foleffect and payments made the payments should be debited only to the years in which the work is done. We have heard a considerable number of charges of extravagance on the one hand and the want of means of raising revenue on the other. It is very easy for a Government with an overflowing Treasury to carry out a huge amount of public works and save a considerable sum at the end of the year if anything like judicious economy is practised. The Labour party during their three years of office received £15,000,000 In every more revenue than their predecessors did in the same time. It is no credit to them, therefore, that they left a surplus of only £2,650,000. Parliament did not pass sufficient works to enable them to spend If we all their revenue. The lionorable member for Darwin told us that his instructions from his chief were to go ahead and spend all he could. The idea was that they had so much revenue coming into the Treasury that they determined to spend all of it and have a right royal time.",82
561,Mr KING OMALLEY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , my instrucject tions were not to spend all I could, but to get my buildings finished. Tliere was to be no royal time. It was a case of getting value for the money every time.",83
562,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"They were having their first three years' run of office, and wanted to make their credit good in the country. They were blessed with the most prosperous times that Australia has seen, and spent the revenue broadcast.",83
563,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Was it wasted?,83
564,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,A good deal of it .,83
565,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Where ?,83
566,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,-In the Federal Capital. Several Honorable MEMBERS - Poo r old V i c . !,83
567,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Member s from New South Wales seem simply to go mad when any one suggests that money spent in their State is wasted.,83
568,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,You r Leader complained that we did not spend enough.,83
569,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am speaking for myself. We heard a good deal from the honourable member for Darwin about the bank created by the Labour party. am satisfied that if he had had his way in the Caucus a different kind of institution would have been established. the Labour party with absolute fear, in the establishment of the bank, of the criticism that would have come if they had created a board of control to manage it . I know of no other banking institution where one man has the responsibility of controlling the funds supplied by the taxpayers. The Governor of this bank has the sole control of its capital. Questions have been asked in this House as to what the manager of the bank is doing, and the Treasurer invariably replies in a way that reminds me of the honourable member for Darwin's famous rubber phrase. If the Minister who is responsible to the House and the country for the conduct of the funds of Australia has no control over the manager of the bank, it is time we realized the necessity of creating a board of control or advice to assist him in running an institution which is now handling several million pounds, and will probably handle even huger sums in the future. These should not be under the control of one man, not because he is not absolutely honest and anxious to do his best, but because the responsibility is too great for any man to undertake single-handed.",83
570,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The bank is subto a public audit to which no otlier bank is subject.,83
571,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"That interjection refers only to the honesty of the staff. The audit is to keep straight the people employed in the institution, and no one in this House impeaches in any shape or form the honesty of any of the staff of the bank. I give the party opposite credit for exercising all their ingenuity and ability to get the best man possible to manage the institution. They offered a salary larger than is paid in some of the best banks in this city, and, assuming that they got a first class man, we must say that he is doing his level best, but the responsibility is too big for any one man.",83
572,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Do you suggest political control ?,83
573,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not.,83
574,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Contro l by the Treasury would inevitably mean that.,83
575,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"In Victoria there is a board of commissioners, who act as a board of advice in connection with the Savings Bank. The Treasury does not I interfere with them, or they with the Treasury. I think the manager of the bank would be sorry to be without a I charge board of advice.",83
576,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"On behalf of the Government I offered the 1912 Premiers' Conference to create a board, and they turned it down unanimously.",83
577,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable gentleman ought to have pushed it through, apart from the Premiers' Conference. He had a majority in Parliament, and must have been timid not to go on with his idea.",83
578,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That was a condition of the States coming in and managing the stamp whole thing as one; but they turned it down unanimously.,83
579,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"This House ought to put that question right as soon as possible. The honourable member for Darwin mentioned that the Prime Minister, at the beginning of the financial year, expressed a hope that he would save half-a-million pounds on defence. Parliament last year created a Public Accounts Committee and a Public Works Committee, and it is time those two bodies were appointed and got to work, because the amount of extravagance going on in those Departments is known only to the men who closely in vestigate the facts. I were promised by Lord Kitchener, in framing his estimate of the cost of defence, that at the end of about twenty years we would be spending £5,000,000 per annum, but we are spending more than that now, and we have not been going more than five years upon his scheme. I understand that villas costing from £3,000 to £4,000, that would be .good enough for Governors, are being l i u i l t for officials in high places. ' Mr KELLY - The honourable member is referring to the military officers' houses at Duntroon. They were all erected under the late Administration .",83
580,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Such extravagance should be curtailed. I one illustration in a small way which came under my notice. The Victorian training ship, which was anxious to get a set of flags, had heard that the Naval authorities had a set for sale, and, having made inquiries, was told that it could have them practically at a sacrifice, because the set was one flag short, and a new set had been ordered. Instead of getting a new flag in place of the one that was missing, the whole lot were thrown out by the Naval authorities, and the training ship got them for a song. Apparently, under the Naval Defence regulations, it is not possible to buy a single flag. I am sure it is about time investigations were made into the details of our naval system, because a large saving could be effected. I feel timi d in approaching my next item. I do not think there will be any cheers. There is a great rush at the present time to get voters on the rolls, and I suggest that the Treasurer, who is short of funds, and has a great deal of expenditure to face, for which he has not the revenue, should see that these people whose names are being put on the rolls, but who should have had their names there a considerable time ago, are fined the maximum of £ 2 for not enrolling. It is of no use our passing Acts which are not put into force. satisfied that the Treasurer could get considerable revenue from this source. There will never be a satisfactory roll until we issue electors' rights. honourable member suggests that electors' rights can be bought, but I remind him that a man can only vote when he produces his elector's right, which is immediately cancelled, so that there can be no voting a second time upon think we it. Every honourable member desires to prevent duplicate voting. It is necessary to have ampletime in order to see that people entitled to be on the rolls have their names registered, and that names which should not be on the rolls are struck off, but, unless there is sufficient time to systematically check these matters, we have no safeguard against duplicating votes. At the present time, if the roll for a division covers a dozen polling places, there is nothing to prevent a man voting a dozen times.",84
581,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,That can happen in the State elections.,84
582,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I know it can. I checked it on one occasion. shall give Mr MCGRATH - Was there a prosecution?,84
583,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , because I was not able to put my hand on the offender, though I knew there were duplications. The honourable member for Ballarat may know of the Port Fairy election, when Sir Bryan O'Loghlen, the Premier, was very hotly pressed. There was a desire to get as many votes as Sir Bryan's supporters could possibly get, and one man was caught going into the polling booth to vote in the name of Brannigan when the man on the roll in the name of Brannigan happened to be dead. This person was told that Brannigan was dead, but he said, "" Oh no, you are making a mistake. It would be a damn poor Brannigan from Clare that would not get out of his grave and vote for Sir B r y a n . "" In regard to the catastrophe that has overtaken us, Parliament, as at present constituted, has met with its just deserts There was no other solution of the diffi culty facing us than a double dissolution, except, perhaps, there might have been a single dissolution, that would have placed our friends opposite in power. With them a single dissolution would be a case of "" Heads I win, tails you lose."" I ask honourable members opposite candidly what they would think of the Government if I am Ministers had agreed to a single dissolution ? Ministers have done the only thing they could do in the circumstances without abrogating the rights the people gave One them, and allowing honourable members opposite to come over and take the loaves and fishes. I know I am striking a sympathetic chord in some of the hearts of honourable members opposite when I say that the present situation is due to the arrogant bumptiousness of the other Chamber in their treatment of measures sent to them from this House.",84
584,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Is that in order?,85
585,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Q u it e in order. did the Senate do ? Because of the strength of the Opposition in that Chamber it amended the Address-in-Reply to the Governor General's Speech- a thing which has never been done by a second Chamber in a British community.,85
586,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,We endeavoured amend it here.,85
587,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"A u d honourable members opposite failed in their purpose. always fail here, unless some of the supporters of the Ministry vote with them.",85
588,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,There is no British second Chamber which is elected on as broad a franchise as is the Senate.,85
589,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"For all practical purposes the Senate is a mere duplication of this House, and a useless excrescence on the Constitution. Since when has it cast a vote for the constituencies which it was intended to represent ? Since when has it recorded a vote in favour of State rights? As a matter of fact, it is purely a party Chamber.",85
590,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,How can we States House in a National Parliament?,85
591,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"When a Bill is sent up from this House for the consideration of the Senate, it is thrown out almost as soon as it has been received.",85
592,Mr ARTHUR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Why not abolish Senate ?,85
593,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Because we cannot. That Chamber has adopted a petition which is to be presented to the Governor General praying H is Excellency to submit the six referenda Bills to the electors. It has taken this action under section 128 of the Constitution, which provides practically the same machinery as is provided by section 57 in connection with a simultaneous dissolution of both Houses. In regard to the six referenda Bills the provisions of section 128 have not' yet been complied with. Nevertheless, the Senate has decided to ask the Governor General to submit those measures to the people. One might well exclaim, "" Those whom the gods intend to destroy, they first make mad.""",85
594,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,Will not the honourable member allow the Governor General himself to decide this question ?,85
595,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the Governor General is a wise man, he will act on the advice of his responsible Advisers, and the first men to make a fuss if he acted otherwise What would be my honourable friends opposite.",85
596,Mr MCGRATH,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Ministry would resign if he did not accept their advice.,85
597,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Of course they would, and that is what honourable members opposite desire. On the great question of taking over the State debts, on the alterato tion of the financial arrangements with the States under the Braddon section of the Constitution, and upon the establishThey ment of a Commonwealth Savings Bank, the Senate might well have been expected to take a stand as the guardian of State rights. But members of the Labour party in the Senate meet the representatives of that party in this Chamber in Caucus, and have to do as tliey are told. Labour senators are tied body and soul so that they have to do exactly what tlieir confreres in this House, who are in a majority, direct them to do. That is why the position in another place is a mere duplication of that in this Cliamber. Labour members of both branches of the Legislature caucus together- a condition of affairs that does not occur anywhere have a else.",85
598,Mr WEST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,The Liberal party here do the same.,85
599,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"We follow the Labour party's bad example. But the procedure the is absolutely wrong in both cases. Senators in another place caucus with our friends opposite, and thus make the States House a useless excrescence on the Constitution. The sooner an amendment in the constitution of the Senate is effected the better it will be for the people of Australia.",85
600,Mr ARTHUR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Bendigo) [10.46] - We have heard in this Cliamber, and other places, much talk of a dissolution of this Parliament, but the signs of dissolution are not yet very apparent. For a Parliament which is said to be approaching the throes of death, it is a very tenacious one. We heard from honourable members opposite very little throughout two sessions; but since the dissolution has been announced we have heard a great deal. The oysters have opened their mouths and wagged their beards very vigorously. Upon the question of the double dissolution I propose to speak only for a moment. I and many others on this side of the chamber do not condemn this way out of the difficulty which has arisen owing to party government. deplore the evil means by which it has been brought about. I have merely to offer this observation in a parallel The Chief Justice of Australia has said that for working men to fabricate a dispute with their employers for the purpose of taking advantage of a particular section of the Constitution was to commit a fraud upon the Constitution. what he would say if the matter which is now engaging our attention brought before him. ""We have seen the present Government deliberately cate a dispute with the Senate for the purpose of bringing about a double dissolution-for the purpose of taking tage of a particular section of the Constitution. The situations are absolutely parallel, and both cases the Chief tice would describe as a fraud the Constitution. This brings me to the matter upon which I wish larly to speak, namely, our Acts. I do not know whether the Government are Syndicalists or not. I believe that they are. The ral has gone about the country the mastiff of Syndicalism with blood in his nostrils, and employing turesque metaphors of that kind. if something be not done with our Arbitration Acts, we must inevitably come to Syndicalism. The Arbitration breaking down by their own weight, and if those people who want regulation law, and not by direct action, wish to avert an industrial calamity in this country, they must lay their heads with a view to devising a more means of regulating industries and thus insuring industrial our present Arbitration Acts there are many things which might be done by way of amendment. Only the other Mr Justice Powers found cumbent upon him to registration of one of the great organizations of this country-the gamated Mining Employes of Years ago they obtained their They went to work as they were obliged to do to secure the benefit of the Act. They were invited to join an association Mr Arthur. and to register under the Act . That entailed an enormous amount of expense and work. They did that some years But we do - ago. The application for their registration was put in nearly two years ago, and it came up for hearing only the other case: day, with the result that this organization, which has had its plaint before the Court, and which has gone to all ""the trouble and expense of preparing its case, is now cast into the outer darkness so far as the regulation of that industrial matter in a peaceful way is concerned. I wonder Mr W . H . IRVINE - The same thing had been happened in the case of the Timber Workers Association.",85
601,Mr ARTHUR,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"No ; not the same fabrithing. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Practically . advan- Mr ARTHUR - No ; the Timber Workers Association was decided not to be an association at all. In this case an association that sought to take advanJus- tage of peaceful methods for_industrial upon regulation is suddenly cast out because of the merest technical flaw in its constituparticu- tion. Because years ago they applied for Arbitration registration with some little flaw in their rules, the Judge of the Arbitratio n Court decided that that compelled him, although Attorney-Gene- they have since corrected the flaw, to depicting cancel their registration today.",86
602,Mr BURCHELL,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"There is clearly a various pic- necessity for the amendment of the Act . But Mr ARTHUR - It is necessary that the Act should be amended. The present Parliament is apparently very tenacious Acts are of life, and perhaps it is possible that before the dreaded blow falls there may by be yet time and opportunity to amend the Act in this direction, It would take very little time to make the necessary together amendment. It would be a decidedly effective good thing to do, and even the Liberal by law, Government of today should recognise peace. In the benefit which would follow from such an amendment. They have the time and opportunity, and if they take the course I suggest they may correct a day great injustice. Mr Justice Higgins, it in- on one occasion, felt himself compelled cancel the to cancel the registration of an association on the ground of some flaw of the Amal- same kind, and in doing so he said that Australia. the Act compelled him to perpetrate a registration. stupid piece of injustice. Why should we allow an Act to remain unamended which, as it stands, compels the perpetration of stupid injustice? The Act is there to be amended, and, I say, let it be amended. I wish to make a further observation on the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. There are technicalities arising in connection with it sufficient to wreck almost any organization. If they were insisted upon, as they are being insisted upon today in one case, I am certain that no organization registered in this country could withstand the attack. We need to - amend the Act on that account. I do not think there is time in this Parliament to make such an amendment as would be necessary to remedy that defect, but there is time to remedy the defect which has given rise to the crying injustice to which I have referred. The great body of miners throughout Australia are now bitterly disappointed men. They have been disappointed in the promise which the Act held out to them, and in the bitterness of their disappointment - what may they not do? They do not understand technical difficulties. They do not realise the difficulties arising from the interpretation of legislation as we realise them-som e of us more than others. In such circumstances, they say, ""The law is against us."" How can we blame them? We can excuse them if they say, "" The law is against us, and, therefore, we shall be against the law."" We could not blame them for taking up that attitude when we knew that the rank and file do not really understand the legal situation. They say, "" We came under an Act which gave us a promise of the betterment of our conditions by law, and now we are thrown ont by that law."" What they may do we do not know; but we hope they will realise the situation. Wo hope that they will start again after all these years, and this promise of peaceful regulation. We hope they will go through the painful process al] over again, will spend their money and their time, and bring their plaint and their evidence. Then, suppose they do, they may say, "" First of all, our employers, wHb say that they believe in industrial peace, will say, ' Y o u are wrongly registered.' We fight them on that, and beat them. Then we enter the Arbitration Court. We fight there for weeks and months, and get our award. Then they take us to the High Court, and we fight there weeks and months again, and may eventually be thrown out again on the merest tech[89] nicality."" This is not right. If the Liberal Government do believe in industrial peace-and I think that in their hearts most of them do-the y will be prepared to amend the Act. I except the Attorney-General because that honourable gentleman believes in Syndicalism. He believes in the mastiff with the blood dropping from its jaws- "" our ugly brother,"" as the honourable gentleman calls it . The honourable gentleman believes that preference to unionists ig a blot on the statute-book, and as without it there can be no encouragement of organizations, and without organizations there must be direct action, it is clear that the Attorney-General believes in "" the mastiff."" In my opinion, these things must be remedied. The Government have it in their power to provide the remedy. They say that they believe in industrial peace; let them prove it by doing what we ask them to do. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.58 p.m.",86
