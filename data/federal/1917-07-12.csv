4,Mr BRUOE SMITH,Unknown,"I ask the Postmastcr-Gcncral whether, notwithstanding his fever for economy, he can see his way to abolish the'practice of reducing the size of telegrams to the dimensions of 1$ inches by 1 inch, and whether he cannot provide a clean, cheap envelope for enclosing the messages ? My telegrams come to me in a dirty condition out of the pockets of the telegraph boys, where they have, apparently, been in close proximity with string, tops, and other articles of boyish enjoyment. But I have ascertained that very serviceable envelopes can be bought wholesale for about 3s. 6d. a thousand. I ask the Minister whether he can see his way to increase the expenditure of the Department by the use of such envelopes ?",5
5,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I have received se many complimentary references to the introduction of the method' of saving revenue of which the honourable member complains, that I am surprised to find that he objects to it.

8,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"In view of the fact that telegrams are an important part of our public records, the production of which is often called for by Courts of law, years after the message was sent, will the Postmaster-General take means to prevent their mutilation in delivery from the sender to the receiver?",6

11,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The payments made to those in charge of allowance oflices are graded in accordance with the revenue of the office.

When that has been done, I shall be able to deal with the matter. 0 COMMONWEALTH BANK.

23,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I cannot do so on the spur of the moment, but the amount is a fairly large one, because Dr Gilruth has been in Melbourne for the last eight or nine months.

The same opportunities will be given to the State-of Tasmania as are afforded to any other State. In this matter, I do not wish to anticipate what I propose to say later on in regard to shipbuilding. I may add that the Labour organizations of Tasmania should have been represented at a congress which took place recently, and reappoint- sat for several days.

On this occasion, however, so far as the Opposition is concerned, we desire to allow the Government, which was elected as a Win-the-war Government, to bring forward the measures they no doubt have : prepared, so that the people may have an opportunity of judging whether Ministers are able to make good their professions on the public platform. Before resuming m y seat I desire to compliment the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply. We are anxious to get on with the business, and to see the Bills foreshadowed in the Governor General's Speech. Question resolved in the affirmative.",12

82,Mr JH CATTS,MAILSERVICE TO GREA T,Mr i Speaker,13
83,Mr SPEAKER,MAILSERVICE TO GREA T,Is the honourable member objecting?,13
84,Mr JH CATTS,MAILSERVICE TO GREA T,"Yes . I wish to understand the position before the question is put. I desire to know whether, if leave be granted, honourable members will be precluded from making any remarks on the subjects dealt with in the statement of the Prime Minister? The right honourable gentleman had an opportunity to make his statement on the Address-inReply ; and it would appear that he is taking this opportunity, and in such a way, that no other honourable members will be able to discuss the questions he deals with ; and unless we have some opportunity of discussing the matter I object.",13
85,Mr SPEAKER,MAILSERVICE TO GREA T,Is it the pleasure of the House that the Prime Minister have leave to make a statement? Leave granted.,13
86,Mr HUGHES,MAILSERVICE TO GREA T,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [ 3 . 1 0 ] The statement. I wish to make amounts to a .mere capitulation of facts, and will be very brief. I desire first of all to address myself to the sugar question - The Conunonwealth entered into an agreement with the State of Queensland-the main points of which are perfectly well known to this House and the country-uude r which the Commonwealth has to take from Queensland all sugar produced within that State at a price of £ 2 1 per ton, 94 per cent, titre. The agreement is for a term of twelve months, and postulates certain fixed conditions obtaining during its currency. They are that the price shall'be £ 2 1 per ton, that the wages, and conditions of labour shall be as prescribed by the t r i bunal which gave its award before the agreement: was entered into, and that refined sugar shall be sold to the public at 3£d. per l b . The honourable member for Indi mentioned yesterday the effect of the agreement upon manufacturers, especially manufacturers for export. I wish to announce that the Government have - I made an arrangement which will enable manufacturers for export to obtain sugar at the same price as they paid last year; so that their position in that respect'is in no wise altered. Honourable members know that the practice in regard to export has been to grant a rebate equivalent to the amount) of the import duty. That, however, was varied during recent years, the rebate being fixed at an arbitrary amount of £ 4 , which was the mean of the import duties spread over foreign sugar, plus"" home-grown sugar used for export purposes. It is ou this basis tihe preseni arrangement has beeu made. Jam manufacturers therefore will enter upon the forthcoming season in exactly the same position as they occupied last year. I shall explain later precisely how this will affect the Commonwealth in relation to its agreement with Queensland. I desire now to make a statement with regard to the wool clip. As honourable members know, the greater part of last season's wool clip was sold to the British Governmeut at a flat rate of 15£d. per lb., plus 50 per cent, of the profit, if any, on such of the wool as was sold for other than military purposes. Thatt arrangement has been satisfactory, and although I am not in a position now to announce definitely how much money will be returned to the pastoralists, I wish to an- nounce, in order to remove a misapprehension that is in the minds of many .wool-growers, that 10 per cent, will be paid on a day to be fixed next month. In regard to the new season's clip, honourable has members who have given the matter any thought musb have realized that unless we had succeeded in financing the next clip Australia would have been faced with a position of financial chaos, if not disaster, and that the disposal of the clip has been a matter of very serious concern to the Government. I am glad to be able to announce that the Government have now completed arrangements with the British Governmenb under which the latter will take the whole of the Australian merino and cross-bred clip at the same price and upon the same conditions as last'season's clip. I think the pastoralists of the Commonwealth are to be congratulated on that arrangement. There is one other matter of the utmost possible importance to which I wish to refer, and I can deal with it only in the broadest possible outline. I refer to the position of the Commonwealth in regard to the export of its products overseas. Honourable members are aware that Germany is relying for victory in this war upon its submarine campaign, and it is idle to deny tire gravity of the position arising therefrom. The losses of vessels are very great, and are not limited even by the sufficiently startling'returns which we read each week. The campaign has other effects than the sending of vessels to the bottom of the ocean, amongst others, it deters a very large percentage of neutral tonnage from venturing out of port. The effects of the submarine campaign upon this country are most serious. shall mention but one instance, which, if the people will consider it, will bring home to them, perhaps, better than anything else can do, what war means to the economic and industrial welfare of this country. One of the terms of the contract made between the Commonwealth and the British Government was that the latter should move 600,000 tons of wheat per month from Australia. During the month of June, not one bushel of wheat was shipped from this country to Britain. Were I to speak for hours, it would be impossible to conjure up a picture more striking than is limned by this bald statement, viewed in its proper perspective. The need for shipping grows with each passing day. Our products are heaping up here in Australia because of the damming of the channels along* which they formerly found their way to market. Happily, there is a prospect of our being able to ship a not insignificant quantity by way of America. The Government is endeavouring to marshal its resources for the transport of wheat, flour, and such other products as are now permitted to enter Great Britain for shipment to the western - coast of America, to be taken thence overland to the Atlantic, and so to Great Britain. We hope in that way to make much better use of our shipping,' as each vessel will have a shorter mileage to steam per ton of produce carried, and the utility of the fleet at our disposal will be very substantially increased. This, however, will relieve the position only to a relatively small degree, and the realization of the. fact has compelled the, Government to attack the problem of ship[5]-2 building in deadly earnest. We know that even under the most favourable conditions the quantity of shipping that can be constructed in Australia will be but a small part of what is needed to transport our products. But we believe that with the hearty co-operation of labour, and the adoption of those methods by which alone modern industry can succeed, we may within a reasonable time add materially to the tonnage at our disposal. The result of a conference with the representatives of fifty-two branches of organized labour interested in this project has been most gratifying. We have been met in a spirit which leaves nothing to be desired. I The Government asked, as a basis for the establishment of shipbuilding, guarantees for (1) the continuity of industrial operations, (2) the dilution of labour, and (3) the adoption of piece-work under certain conditions. After long discussions, affording ample opportunity for careful consideration of the position, after the remission of questions to the unions, and the making of further explanations, so that each particular rjoint was hammered out in detail, the conferenceyesterday carried the following resolution:That this conference, after hearing the Prime Minister's reply to the reports and decisions of the unions on the questions submitted, and while respecting the unions' decisions thereon, is strongly of the opinion that the best interests of the unions concerned would be served by adopting the proposals of the Government. The conference has now disbanded. The delegates are returning to their unions, determined to recommend the adoption of the proposals of the Government, and in anticipation of their recommendation being accepted, we shall take all steps necessary for the immediate launching of the enterprise. The acceptance by the unions of the proposals of the Government will, however, be a condition precedent, lacking which nothing will be done. The material that will be used in the building of the ships will, with very few exceptions, be produced and manufactured in this country, so that the industry will be purely Australian. I do not wish to create the impression that this is the only or the final solution of the question. The Government realizes that upon the maintenance of a steady stream of products to Great Britain must for many months depend the safety of that country, and will exhaust every means at its disposal to insure an adequate supply of tonnage. The British Ministers, living in the very maelstrom of war, are doing their best, notwithstanding the avalanche of criticism directed against them by men who have not their tremendous responsibilities. They have shown a strong desire to help Australia, and a keen sense of appreciation of our efforts to co-operate with them. By the purchase of our wool clip, our financial and industrial situation has been enormously relieved. The financial position of the Commonwealth would have bordered upon the impossible without the £40,000,000 that has been paid by the British Government for our wool. As far as I can see, however, there is no solution of the difficulty of exporting beef and mutton. There is a solution - thoug h it may not be altogether satisfactory-for the difficulty of the fruit-growers. The local market will consume a fair quantity of the fresh fruit produced, and there is a possibility of preserving the rest. But we can hardly hope to find refrigerated tonnage for our normal quantity of export meat, while our cool storage depots are already full to the brim. The contract that we made with the British Government for the export of rabbits is thus brought, temporarily, at all events, to an end. We cannot put' any more meat into cold storage, and what is now there will be taken out so slowly that the pastoralists must for some time maintain their flocks and herds upon the hoof. The wool having been sold, I do not know that the growers of sheep need be cast down by the prospect, though the situation of the cattle men is, of course, different. Insulated tonnage is scarce at the best of times, and has now become as rare as diamonds. It may be that the compulsory increase of our flocks and herds will prove to be of very great advantage to Australia. There is accumulated in this country cargo sufficient for fifteen refrigerated steamers and 548 general steamers, and the number of vessels available to lift it is to that almost as a mole hill to Mount Everest. These facts illustrate our dependence on the Empire for our economic, financial, and national existence, and, at the same time, go to show better than anything else how Australia can help to win the war. They show, too, Mr Hughes. how helpless Australia is by herself to do anything, even to exist. There are things about which we may not speak, dangers grave beyond the power of words to express, but these things. about which we can speak show clearly what .the war means to us, and how necessary it is that all sorts and conditions of men in Australia, employers and employees, rich and poor alike, should adjust themselves to their present environment, so that each man may do his duty. The honourable member for Corangamite asked me if there is any chance of getting cheese away. My slumbers are disturbed nightly by just such questions as that. Is there any chance for exporting wine, eucalyptus, mutton, and many other things? I can only repeat that while the number'of genera] cargo-carrying steamers is severely limited, the number of those possessing 1 insulated space has come down almost to zero. What I have said is not to be regarded by the pastoralists or others as the final and irrevocable determination of the problem. It is a statement of the present position, which is growing worse every day. America is making heroic efforts, as Great Britain has been doing all along, to meet with construction of shipping the destruction of the Hun. But it requires no specialized knowledge to understand that it is easier to destroy than to build up, and that those engaged in the work of destruction start with a tremendous advantage in their favour. And the situation must grow gradually worse. We can only face the position with resolution, do what is possible to ease it , and pray that on sea and on land our Eorces may soon press home their attack and snatch victory from the palsied hands of the foe. Another matter to which I wish to refer relates to the question of the storage of those products which we are not able to transport oversea. In normal seasons, cargo during the month of July all' the wool stores are empty. The position today is quite different. There are hundreds of thousands of bales of wool now in the stores, and next month the new clip will begin to trickle in, and from then on the new storehouses which we have secured will become full, and more than full, of the new wool. This problem, however, is a comparatively minor one when compared with the problem that faces us with regard to wheat. That is much more urgent and difficult. By next February, unless there is an outlet found other than those we can see now, we shall have 6,000,000.tons of wheat in Australia. Tomorrow I am to meet the State Premiers in order to finally arrange the details of a wheat storage scheme. I hope that the matter will be settled tomorrow, so that a system of silage construction may be begun without delay. It is a matter of extreme urgency, and should not be delayed in any circumstances. I have not had an opportunity of diseussing with the Tasmanian representatives the proposition for drying apples, but the Government have called a conference of fruit-growers, which will meet during this month, with a view to organizing the frui t industry on such a basis as will enable it to dispose of its product to the best possible advantage during 'the coming season. The conference will consider the possibilities of marketing fresh fruit throughout Australia. We shall endeavour by judicious organization to get every fruit-grower the best possible price for his product of fresh fruit by preventing irregular competition between one grower and another and the cutting of one another's throat. An endeavour will also be made to deal with such fruit as cannot be so marketed by drying, canning, and by jam making. In this connection I was very pleased to be able to announce, as I did at the beginning of my speech, that arrangements have been made whereby sugar can be obtained at such a price as will enable the manufacturers in this country to compete with those in other countries in the matter of export trade. Later:",13
87,Mr HUGHES,MAILSERVICE TO GREA T,"As I am to meet the State Premiers tomorrow, I do not wish to have it said that the House did not have an opportunity of considering the matter of silo storage. I , therefore, suggest that it direct its attention to the question, in order that I may be armed with the best advice and counsel when I meet the Premiers, and so that I may get the job settled. If honourable members have anything of a useful nature to say in connection with any of the matters upon which I have touched, I hope they will take this opportunity to say it, so that the Government may have the fullest advice on these matters.",16

101,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Swan-Trea surer) T7.48] - We occupy to night a somewhat extraordinary position, since we are inviting honourable members to agree to the Estimates and pass an appropriation Bill in respect of the financial year which has jusb closed. first experience of the kind, but the course w© ar© proposing must be taken in order to conform to the requirement that an Appropriation Bill covering the Estimates in chief for the whole year shall be approved by Parliament. During the financial year 1916-1917, to which these Estimates relate, we had a number of Supply Bills. Three different Treasurers have asked the House to deal with such measures during the twelve months, and ©very penny of expenditure for which these Estimates provide has already been >voted. That being so, although honourable members may avail themselves of this opportunity to discuss any question of importance relating to these Estimates, I would remind them that they have had such an opportunity on at least four or five different occasions during the financial year, when Supply Rills have been submitted.",17
102,Mr MATHEWS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,How many millions has the Treasurer to readjust!,17
103,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"There ar© no adjustments to make. The whole of the revenue and expenditure has been dealt with, and th© moneys have all been spent with the full authority of Parliament. Interim financial statements having reference to the year just closed were put before honourable members on the 6th March, 14th June, and l l t h inst. The Budget papers have also been presented, and as the end of the financial year was upon us before we passed the last Supnly Bill , information given to honourable members has been much more complete and up-to-date than that relating to any other financial period of which I have any knowledge. In these circumstances, and since we hav© had at various times a good deal of discussion regarding the expenditure for the financial year to which these Estimates relate, I think it would be wise for honourable members to reserve their criticism for future proposals rather than to discuss finances that have already been dealt with. W it h these few observations I believe I shall be doing what is right, and what is in accord with th© wishes of the Committee, by simply movingThat the Estimates be agreed to.",17
104,The CHAIRMAN,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Is it the. wish of the Committee that the Estimates be : taken as a whole ? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",17
105,Mr CHARLTON,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Hunter) [7.52] I desire to enter my protest against the way in which the Estimates are being This is my and have been dealt with by this Parliament for several years past. It seems to me that to bring down the Estimates for the consideration of honourable members after the financial year covered by them has closed, and, as in this case, after the Parliament responsible for them has actually expired, is a very loose way of transacting public business. We are supposed to be the custodians of the public purse.",17
106,Mr RODGERS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,But these are the Estimates of a previous Government.,17
107,Mr CHARLTON,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I am not dealing with any particular Government in this case, but I hold that, as custodians of the public purse, we certainly ought to have some control over the expenditure of the Commonwealth. Under the loose system - which we are following, the Government of the day, and not members of Parliament generally, have complete control over the finances. Private members have very little opportunity to take exception to any proposed expenditure, or to make any proposition in the direction of economy. I am not directing my remarks particularly against the present Administration, since they have only recently come into office, but this objectionlegitimate able practice is becoming more and more pronounced, and I wish to know what we, as representative men, are going to do. Are we going to allow this practice to continue, or do we intend to assert our rights, and to insist upon the Estimates being dealt with at the proper time?",17
108,Mr RILEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Ar c the officers of the partment responsible for the delay?,18
109,Mr CHARLTON,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"No . The Estimates for the year commencing 1st July, 190G, were laid on the table of the House on 31st July of that year. In that case they were submitted in good time. The Estimates for the financial year beginning on 1st July, 1907, were submitted en Sth August, 1907; those for 1908 on the 14th October, 1908; those for 1909 on the 12th August of that year; those for 1910 on the 7th September of that year; those for 3911 on 26th October of that year; and the Estimates for 1912 on 1st August, 1912. The Estimates for the financial year beginning 1st July, 1913, were not dealt with until 2nd October of that year; and those for 3914 were dealt with on 3rd December-whe n practically six months of the year to which they related had expired. The Estimates for the year beginning 1st July, 1915, were dealt with on 9th May, 1916, or only a month before the expiration of the financial year; while the Estimates for 1916-17 are being dealt with to-night, after the financial year to which they relate has actually closed. The whole of the expenditure for which they provide has been made without Parliament being afforded an opportunity to discuss it. It may be said that this delay was in consequence of the war",18
110,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Because of the political situation.,18
111,Mr CHARLTON,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Then there must have been a political situation extending over the last three years.,18
112,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,I shall try to put the matter right. I agree with the honourable member's view.',18
113,Mr CHARLTON,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I believe that the Treasurer will make an effort in the direction I have indicated, but I am going to enter my protest lest he should be tempted to continue this very objectionable practice. Since the outbreak of war in 1914, there might have been some excuse for delay in dealing with the Defence' Estimates. We have been passing through abnormal times, so far as Defence expenditure is concerned; butwill any one say that the war is any justification for the failure of the House to deal with the Estimates of the ordinary Departments ? Such a contention cannot be substantiated. The Finance ComDe- mittee has had before it the evidence of experts in connection with this very matter, and has been told by them that the ideal system would be to deal with the Estimates in the first month of the year to which they relate. Under that system, Supply Bills would be unnecessary. These, experts told us that heads of Departments should be required to supply draft Esti-. mates to the Treasurer not later than April in each year, so as to afford him opportunity to cub down where necessary, and to make whab alterations are required between then and the end of June. If that practice were followed, there would be no need for Supply Bills, which, under the present system, are put before us every two or three months, and serve only to delay the transaction of public business. They also add materially to our printing bill. In these days, when ib is necessary to economize, I know of no place where economy could be practised with better results than in this very House. It is unfair that millions of pounds of public money should be expended without members of Parliament having a chance to make their voices heard as to what reductions should be made, and as to whether or not the votes asked for should be granted. I shall not take up 'the time of the Committee in dealing with this subject further, but I felt that I should be failing in my duty if I permitted these Estimates to be passed as a whole without entering my protest. If the Treasurer does not alter this state of affairs, he may expect to come in for some very severe criticism at the hands of honourable members on both sides. Members are just about tired of having their rights whittled away i this .manner. It is the duty of the Treai t be withdrawn. surer of the day to submit his Estimates within a reasonable time, so that honormember able members may have ample opporas tunity .to decide what is best in the terests of the country, fro m a financial draw it . point of view; and I hope that such a course will henceforth be followed.",18

This afternoon we had a homily from the honourable member for Cook on a variety of things, and the Government were ridiculed for not having any business to put before the House. This was the result of what I shall not call a trick, but a piece of legerdemain, which no doubt honourable members opposite thought very brilliant. The idea was to put the Ministry in a difficulty in consequeuce of their having no legislation to submit; and it was simply a well-conceived piece of very transparent conjuring. The Government very naturally thought that when the Address-in-Reply was before us honourable members opposite would have the courage to say in the House what they had been telling the people outside. However, not one of them has had that courage or stood up to say one word against the Government or their policy; their sole idea was, by this little ruse, to put the Government in a - difficulty before the public. The M in istry was perfectly justified in assuming thab the Labour party would, as it always has done, waste three or four weeks in criticising the Governmenb of the day. Now I suppose honourable members opposite imagine that they will be able to say to the people in the parks on Sunday, . "" See what the Government have done; we have brought them to a pass in which they have no business to put before us."" As a member of some years' standing, I think the Government were justified in assuming that the Labour party were going to waste time, as they have wasted it in previous sessions, over the Addressin-Reply. Last night the Leader of the Opposition took occasion to charge me, as I have been charged for the last fifteen years, with not attending Parliament as regularly as he does himself. There is this distinction between the honourable gentleman and myself-that I live in another State and have occupations of other kinds than Parliament, whereas he has lived at the Seat of Government all his time, has made a profession of politics, and has nothing else to think about. That is my answer to the honourable member. I challenge him to compare my attendance for many years with that of any Labour member from any State but Victoria. It ill-becomes the honourable member, who is supposed to set an example in courtesy as well as in politics, to the members of his own party, to harp on an old song of this sort which has really nothing in it, and only casts. reflection on himself, seeing that he lives within a couple of miles of Parliament House, and has made a business of politics for all these years. I repeat that I consider that the Government would be perfectly justified if they were to move the adjournment of the House for a fortnight. The measures they have intimated their intention to place before us, including one connected wibh shipbuilding, and another with repatriation, represent schemes that require a great deal of thought on the part of Ministers, and are open to much honest and candid criticism in the House. If the Government were to allow themselves to be misled by the transparent ruse attempted this afternoon, and were to bring forward any of their measures in a state so incoherent and unfinished as to lead to . greater trouble than would otherwise have to be met, they would lack political courage.",19
131,Mr TUDOR,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Yarra) [8.10] - Ap parently the honourable member for Parkes is very sore about what I said last night, and has apparently not slept well after the few well merited remarks I made regarding him . If the honourable member really feels very sore, I should not mind apologizing for what I said, but I do not think that he was justified in the remarks he made as to the members of the-Labour party playing billiards and bowls. I think that my record will bear inspection, not only for regular attendance here, but for attendance in the Chamber during the whole of the sittings. Ifc is well known that the honourable member is the worse offender in this regard, and cares more about earning f at fees at the Law Courts than he does about his parliamentary attendance. As a matter of fact, it took the honourable member all his time to win his selection, and he would not have won it but for the aid of the Minister for the Navy and the Ministerial telegrams sent on his behalf. And this is the man who presumes ito lecture fchis House! We all know, however, that he talks with his tongue in his cheek. He has the audacity to talk about my being supposed to teach my followers manners. When it comes to a question of manners, we, of course, look to the honourable member for Parkes. As to bowls and billiards, we know that the honourable member's favourite sport ' is to go fishing in golf stockings. I do not care what I said last night, because I think that be deserves it. true that I was not so fortunate in choosing my parents as was the honourable member, and I did not have the advantage of a university education, but, nevertheless, I think that! my public record will compare with his. If I have made a profession of politics, and, as he says, live on the game, I have given my constituents as good value as has any other member of this Parliament. That, however, is a matter about which I do not! boast, though I must say that it ill-becomes a gentleman, cultured though he claims - co be, tb start sneering at others as the honourable member has done to-night. However, we on this side are anxious to win the war. I should like to know what the honourable member for Parkes is anxious to do. I should say that, instead of being a member of the "" Win-the-war "" party he is really a member of the "" wagthe-jaw"" party. If these Estimates are ready to-night, why were they not ready at a quarter-past. 3 this afternoon? - Is this business night an afterthought on the part of the Government? Ministers were supposed to be ready with win-the-war legislation, and yet they have to fall back on ifchese Estimates, which every on© knows could passed in five minutes, as similar Estiwhen mates have been passed on other occapractically sions. There is, of course, no objection to passing them, because every penny has been spent, and we can do nothing ther with ithem now. Honourable memshould bers have said that this is the first, occaties sion upon which the step proposed night has been taken, but I think similar circumstances have arisen previously. The honourable member for Parkes will member that in 1902 or 1903 we passed Estimates for the year ended the 30th June, 1901. That was on account of the exceptional circumstances arising out the first Tariff debate, the session having lasted sixteen or seventeen months. So tain in any business concern. far as I am concerned, the Treasurer have the Estimates without delay. I do not desire to hamper the Government in Mr Tudor. this respect. I am anxious to see the legislation that they propose for the purpose of winning the war, and when it is introduced I shall deal with it to the best of my ability.",20
132,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Franklin) [8.15] - The suggestion made by the honourable member for Henty last night and It is the honourable member for Hunter tonight is one that should commend itself to the attention of every member of the Committee. 1I have not been in Parliament as long as the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Parkes, but if my memory serves me correctly every Commonwealth Government has .handled the Estimates in precisely the same way. The Estimates are kept back as long as possible, and generally about the last week in the session there is an all-night sitting, and honourable members are told that if they do not pass the Estimates and send them to the Senate before the next day the Senate will adjourn, and the public servants will not be able to get their money. We have an all night sitting, and a few hours are allowed the Senate in which to pass the whole of the Estimates, and then we are invariably met with* the statement, "" What is the good of crying about matters now, when all the money has been spent,"" At this time every pound of expenditure should be carefully weighed. We know that tothere is an economic stress all over the world, and that it is worse than useless to expect to borrow money from England. It is not creditable on the. part of any Premier or Prime Minister to apbe proach England for big loans at a time the Mother Country has to finance the whole of the Allies, and I am sorry to read that one Australian Premier is in England today simply cadging furfor loans. A community like Australia be ashamed to add to the difficulof the financial situation in the Old toLand. However, what is past is gone, and I do hope - that we shall have an opportunity of dealing with the next Estiremates in a proper manner. This is not a matter which concerns any one particular party or member, and I hope that we shall have an adequate' opportunity of of dealing with all proposed expenditure in the same thorough fashion as would obTo-day, can if ever in the history of tihe Commonwealth, all details of expenditure should command 'the attention of honourable mem",21
133,Mr MATHEWS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Melbourne Ports) [ 8 . 2 0 ] - I propose to say a few words about the Estimates for 1916-17, and if I were allowed to do so I should like to refer to those of 1914-15, because they in cluded expenditure that had never been discussed by Parliament. First of all, I wish to reply to the 'flattering remarks made by the honourable member for Parkes. The honourable gentleman charged honourable members with playing billiards and bowls. He ought to have added that sometimes honourable members are seen in the bar. This is the first time that I have ever heard any honourable member speak of his fellow members in that fashion, and the remarks of the honourable member for Parkes reflect no credit upon him. A billiard table has a straight cushion, without any indentation to accommodate big stomachs; that is why he does not play billiards. And he cannot play bowls because he has not seen his feet for years. The remarks of the honourable member were not warranted. always thought that he conducted his politics on a higher plane than such personalities, and I believe that he will apologize for what he has said. The Estimates for 1916-17, like all others, are supposed to be a true reflection of the expenditure by the Government. As a matter of fact, they are not. We were told that the expenditure by the British Government on behalf of the Commonwealth for the maintenance and equipment of our troops at the Front was about £33,000,000, of which we had repaid £8,500,000, leaving £24,000,000 still owing. recently I made a statement that the Commonwealth owed the British Government on this account. £50,000,000 or £60,000,000.",22
134,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,I do not that statement was correct.,22
135,Mr MATHEWS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I tell the right honourable gentleman most emphatically that he cannot prove correct his statement thab the Commonwealth owes only £23,500,000, to the British Government. The position of Australia in. regard to the Forces sent abroad is different from that of Canada. From the moment the Canadian Government places its troops on the transport u n t i l their return, the British Government pays the whole of the expenditure. Australia, on the other hand, enlists, trains, equips, and transports troops to the Old' Country, maintains them there and at. the Front, and for every article used, and every bullet and shell fired, the Australian people have to pay. We have been told that the cost ot maintaining the soldier abroad is approximately 6s. a day. I ask honourable members to cast their minds back to the South African War, in which the British Government maintained in the field about 250,000 men. The whole of the manufacturing resources of the Mother Country were utilized at high pressure to produce commodities for the troops in Africa,- and the greatest mercantile marine in the world was hard pressed, at a time when there were no enemy ships abroad, to transport those commodities. Yet when I asked the Assistant Minister for Defence whafc percentage of the material and equipment used by our troops was manufactured in Australia, he answered, "" A l m o s t the whole of it . "" It is impossible for that I statement to be correct. We have sent from Australia as many men as the British Government had in South Africa during the Boer War. And"" we know that there is not enough khaki manufactured in Australia to keep one division supplied.",22
136,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"How does Great Britain manage to keep 2,000,000 men in France ?",22
137,Mr MATHEWS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Because Great Britain today is one vast; factory producing munitions and equipment for the troops. Not 5 per cent, of the requirements of Australian troops abroad is benearly ing manufactured in Australia. ThereA t a meeting fore, we know that the expenditure by the British Government in connection with Australia's representation at the Front, instead of being only £33,000,000, as we have been told, may have been think nearer £130,000,000.",22
138,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,The Commonwealth pays for all the expenditure.,22
139,Mr MATHEWS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"All the Commonwealth has paid to date is £8,500,000.",22
140,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Yes , but we owe the balance.",22
141,Mr MATHEWS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"How much do we owe ? Sir JOH N FORRES* - About £23,000,000.",22
142,Mr MATHEWS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I say we owe nearer £60,000,000.",22
143,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Why not £100,000,0001",23
144,Mr MATHEWS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I believe that the sum is nearer £100,000,000 £23,000,000, because it is impossible to maintain Australia's A r m y abroad with-' out a huge expenditure by the British Government, and that expenditure is not being met by Australia at the present time. Why are we nob told the facts? When the honourable member for Capricornia was Treasurer, I asked him what was our indebtedness in this respect, and he said about £8,000,000 . That figure rose later to £14,000,000. When the honourable member for Grey was Treasurer, I asked him the same question, and his answer was £18,000,000; later, the figure rose to £22,000,000. I ask the present Treasurer, and he does not know. The people of Australia should know exactly what have been our disbursements on accounb of the war up to the present time. Why do the Government keep the people in a fool's paradise 1 For eight years after the South Africa n War the Australian Governments were still repaying to the Britis h Government money expended in their behalf during that campaign.",23
145,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,We paid little to the British Government in.connection with the South Africa n War. The Imperial Government paid almost everything.,23
146,Mr MATHEWS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I can assure the right honourable gentleman that since I have been in this House money has been voted in Australian Parliaments to recoup Britain for expenditure on troops during the South African War. I mention this matter merely to illustrate my point that we do not get a true ment of the finances. General Anderkeeping son was intrusted by the Commonwealth Government, with the responsibility of which we ask. looking after the interests of Australia in England, and I do not suppose we get more information. could have sent a better man. I do not pretend to be able to assess how much owe on account of the war, but common sense teaches me that the amount stated by the Treasurer does not nearly repreformation. sent the expenditure incurred in our half. If we desire to have a true stateask ment of expenditure, it is the duty of Treasurer to cable to England for partrust ticulars. I am not charging the TreaTreasurer surer or officials with remissness. acknowledge the ability of the Treasury say officials, and the interest that they take in the discharge of their duties, and I admit that the Treasurer possesses vast than experience in financial administration. But he must know that we are not in possession of a statement of the expenditure made by the British Government on our behalf.",23
147,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"We have not got an account from the British Government yet, but I hope that our indebtedness to them, is not so large as the honourable member seems to think it .",23
148,Mr MATHEWS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The people of Australia should know what amount waa spent by the British Government on their behalf up to the end of the last financial year, and I ask the Treasurer to cable fco the Home authorities for an approximate statement of that expenditure. I am aware that we cannot expect to obtain absolute accuracy, but we should be told as nearly as possible what is the amount of our indebtedness.",23
149,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"If c is probable that the British authorities themselves do not know what we owe them; that, for example, they are unable to say yet what the expenditure on items like big-gun ammunition has been. > very Mr MATHEWS - We have had three, if not four, divisions in the trenches, and we know that when ammunition has been fired continuously for twenty-four or forty-eight hours .to demolish the defences of the enemy, an extraordinary expenditure must have been incurred.",23
150,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Honourable members know as much as the Government Australian know in these matters.,23
151,Mr MATHEWS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I am willing to bel i e v e that, but we ought to know more. stateI am not charging the Treasurer with anything back; I say that it is his duty to obtain the information for '",23
152,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,We shall try to,23
153,Mr MATHEWS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Notwithstandin g we the remarks of the honourable member for Parkes, I say that the honourable member for Hunter did right in demanding in An y member, whether a befinancial expert or not, has the right to for information of this kind in the the interests of those whom he represents. I that, within the next fortnight, the will endeavour to obtain from I the British Government as near an account as possible of their expenditure on behalf of our Forces. He will be remiss if he does not do that.",23
154,Mr KELLY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Wentworth) [8.33] - I understand that tomorrow a Conference is to consider the. erection of stores for the protection of wheat, and I ask the Treasurer to realise the desirableness of having this matter handled solely by the Commonwealth Government. afoot, 1 believe, a movement to enable the States to do the work separately and individually, but it would be regrettable if they were left to compete against each other for supplies, and if uniformity of method, which is' desirable, were not attained.",24
155,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,The States are responsible. They borrow the money from the Commonwealth.,24
156,Mr KELLY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The States should not compete with' each other for the advantage of those who have to supply material. The Commonwealth should handle this matter, and, as this Government have formulated a scheme, for the efficiency of which they are responsible to the public of Australia, I hope that they alone will handle it .",24
157,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Hindmarsh) [8.35] - Honourable members have been entertained this evening with complaints against the evil practice of deferring the consideration of Estimates, because this prevents members from devoting the vigilant attention to the Government expenditure which is necessary in the public interest. No doubt, the honourable member for Hunter was perfectly correct in what he said, but so long as I have had a seat in Parliament, here and in South Australia, it has been the practice to make these complaints, and I am tired and sick of hearing them. The delay this yeaT has been due largely to the political circumstances which brought about the last election. It iB often a difficult matter for Ministers to obtain Estimates from the Departments, and the preparation of Estimates is sometimes delayed because - urgent political business is being pushed on by a Government for party purposes.",24
158,Mr BOYD,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Is that a good reason for delay ?,24
159,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I propose to suggest a remedy. Nothing much is to be gained by continual growling. What we need is a way out of the difficulty. Members know that now and again the consideration of Estimates will be held up for perhaps two days, merely to wrin g a promise from a Government, and that after such a "" stone w all "" millions have been voted in a few minutes. What is the use of holding up our hands in holy horror at the delay on the present occasion? Those who support a Government naturally support its Estimates, while an OpThere is position naturally debates every item in them, in order to delay public business. That is part of the political game, which is as old as the hills, and which, I suppose, will be continued in the future. Personally, I cannot see that anything is to be gained by holding up Estimates, except for the purpose of getting information regarding any particular item that may be challenged. This Government is pledged to do all it can to secure economical administration in the interests of the war, and I believe that Ministers in tend to fulfil their promises. I remember an occasion on which a group of members supporting a State Government went to Ministers ancl said, "" Y o u must reduce your Estimates to a certain sum, or we shall not support you."" A Government will take more notice of action like that than of anything else. It is useless to complain about delay in the submission of Estimates if members are not prepared to take any practical step to secure reform. For twenty-five years Mr Joseph Hume, in the House of Comm'ons, did nothing but challenge the Estimates of the Government; but Mr John Bright, who sat beside him, said that it was a useless waste of time. He was of the opinion that it was only by bringing pressure to bear directly on a Government that ref o r m could be secured. It is for those who support a Government to see that the administration of affairs is sound and economical. I do not say that any demonstration is required at the present time. My object is to expose the humbug of the system of complaining ineffectually. In my opinion, the country ^does not suffer much from delay in the consideration of Estimates, though it does suffer when a party pledged to economy does not see that the Government gives effect to its policy. The responsibility is on the Ministerial supporters, rather than on the Government. As a former member of the Labour party, I know that the members of the Caucus never 'worried much, about the Estimates. They were content merely to bark; the consideration of ways and means was with them of the last importance. Another parliamentary humbug is for members to urge a Government to exercise economy in administration, and then to ask for increased expenditure on some particular object which they favour. The inconsistency of such action is obvious. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports stated in his constituency that we owe the British Government something like £60,000,000 on account of war expenditure. In saying that, the honourable member was talking of something about which he had no knowledge, and might as well have named £200,000,000, or any other sum - It is generally believed that we are indebted to the Old Country in this connection for from £28,000,000 to £30,000,000; but it must be a difficult matter for the Home authorities to furnish precise information regarding our indebtedness at any particular time. However, I agree with those who say that we should have information from them on this subject as soon as it can be obtained.",24
160,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Cook) [8.45] - Th country should know that these Estimates belong to the last Parliament, and have been introduced to-night merely for purpose of creating discussion, because on the Government have absolutely no busiwith ness to place before Parliament. They have nothing whatever to do with, this Parliament. They cover the expenditure for the year ending the SOth June, 1917. Every peuny in the schedule pended long ago, even before this Parliament came into being. Ministers have strutted up and down the country with patriotic shibboleths and platitudes, and waving of flags, and have talked of what they weTe going to do in order to win the has war and assist Great Britain and the Allies. They have had two months now since'' the elections, and they have their party meetings, and their CabiSenate, net meetings, yeb they put before Parliament a Governor General's Speech a which the seconder of the motion for the the Senate. adoption of the Address-in-Rer»lv. a supporter of the Government, describes as merely empty phrases; and when they found that the Opposition were not preelaborated pared to waste the time of Parliament for two weeks in discussing a placard of fine words, they had nob a shred of business to put forward, and so these dead Estimates were brought forward in order to fil l in or waste time.",25
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Si t down and see whether that is so.,25
162,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The right honourable gentleman knows that if I sat down dozens of the supporters of the Ministry are ready, to stand up'and talk hour after hour in order to waste time. Why did the honourable member for Parkes get up to-night with his personal diatribes against honourable members of the Opposition, except it was for the express purpose of bringing honourable members on this side to their feet to take up the time of the country. Even then the honourable member had the impudence.to talk about legerdemain, and another honourable member talked about hypocrisy. All this business is make-believe. If the Government had other matters to go on with it would not affect the country to the extent ' of twopence, and it would not give Ministers a moment's consideration if these Estimates never saw Parliament. They e have been brought in simply because they practically run the whole gamut of Government expenditure and administrathe tion, and provide honourable members both sides of the chamber the opportunity to talk about anything under the sun. When the Address-in-Reply was suddenly accepted it was the business of the Government to come forward with their measures has been exfor winning the war. Where is the Bill for the repatriation of our soldiers? We were told that the Government were breathlessly waiting to put forward some great scheme for the repatriation of our soldiers.",25

164,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The-Bil l has to come to this House, and it could be in held troduced here just as well as in the and if it is a measure to provide ways and means, in other words, if it is money Bill , it cannot be introduced in",25
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Le t the honourable member be fair, and place himself in the position of Senator Millen. If he had a scheme of such great length, and at such infinite pains, would he car© to have his Bill introduced into the Parliament by some other person ?",25
166,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The right honourable gentleman now tells us that the dignity of Senator Millen would be impinged if the Bill were introduced by some one else. Apparently the repatriation of our soldiers is a very secondary matter. When the Address-in-Reply was adopted at 3.15 o'clock this afternoon, the Government did not have a single item of business to go on with, but how was th© House adjourned ? Not in a straightforward way by a Minister moving that the House suspend its sitting for three or four hours, but by the Prime Minister going to the Speaker and whispering in his ear, and by the Speaker saying, "" I shall leave the chair until 7.45 p . m . "" That meant a waste of over three hours. Although the Government had no business to proceed with, there was business on the notice-paper; there was a matter dealing with the payments to farmers. Some honourable members on the Government benches profess to be very concerned about the farmers. The honourable mem1 ber for Wimmera is anxious to see that the farmers are paid 4s. per bushel straight out for their wheat when it is handed over to the Government. matter could have been debated during the hours that were wasted this afternoon, but the Prime Minister, with the connivance of honourable members opposite, who wish it to be thought that they represent the farmers, deliberately avoided the discussion of problems which face, the farmers.",26
167,Mr SAMPSON,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Are you wild because your scheme could not be carried out?,26
168,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,My scheme will 'come before this Parliament. There are means of giving lionorable members the opportunity of voting on such matters.,26
169,Mr KELLY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"What is the scheme to which the honourable member refers? Mr J. H . OATTS - The honourable member will see it on the notice-paper. It shows how much interest the honourable member takes in the business ofParliament when he does not know whafc business is on the notice-paper. He is a very accommodating follower of the Government when he does not wish to know what is on the notice-paper, and is willing to follow Ministers, no matter whether they proceed with business or not, or whether they conduct things irregularly or not.",26
170,Mr KELLY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"There are some things in Parliament that are important, and there are some that are unimportant.",26
171,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Then the honourable member is one of those things that are very unimportant. When the Government found themselves with no business to proceed with this afternoon it waa the duty of Mr Speaker to call the next Order of the Day.,26
172,The CHAIRMAN,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,The honourable member cannot discuss any action taken by Mr Speaker. Mr J . H . . CATTS - In passing the salary for Mr Speaker may I not criticise his actions ?,26

175,The CHAIRMAN,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,The honourable member must make no innuendoes. No privileges have been taken away from him.,26
176,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I submit that when the Government have no business fco go on with, the proper procedure is for Mr Speaker to call on the next item of business on the notice-paper, as is proThat vided for in the Standing Orders.",26
177,The CHAIRMAN,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I have asked the honourable member .not to discuss 'thaitj matter. It can be raised in the House, but not in Committee.",26

180,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"This business was not. on the notice-paper. When Mr . Speaker came to the assistance of Ministers this afternoon, and suspended .the sitting, the Government went scurrying round in order to find something on which a discussion could take place, and after digging down into the vaults ithey found these Estimates belonging to the last Parliament, and ascertained thati the Standing Orders would permit them to 'bring them along and allow sixty or seventy honourable members to attempt to flog some life into them.",26
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Does it not strike the honourable member that he is demonstrating to the people outside the trick honourable members of the Opposition tried to play tnis afternoon, and is showing now that there was no sincerity in the step taken by them?",26
182,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The honourable member knows that if I sab down, and no other honourable member of the Opposition said another word on these Estimates the discussion would be carried on by honourable members sitting on the Government benches. Have we not seen honourable gentlemen opposite searching through the pages of these dead Estimates in order to find some item on which they could found speeches? They are ready to come to the assistance of the Government, and talk and talk, in order to make the country believe that business is being done, when really there is no business before us. This so-called "" W in . the - W a r"" Government has no business to bring forward for winning the war, or for helping soldiers and the widows and dependants of . soldiers. The country is absolutely full of grievances from one end to the other. At War Council meetings in Sydney every week we have lists of discharged soldiers of various occupations, for whom no work can be found. These men are walking about the streets in idleness, yeb the Government have no business ready. orable members of the Orjoositdon were prepared to remain silent, and allow the Government the opportunity to bring forward business in order ito test the sincerity of Ministers, and ascertain if they had any measures ready f o help the soldiers, but we are told that it was a trick on our narfc when we did not propose to talk empty nothings for a fortnight.",27

186,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"All that the called '' Win-the-War "" Government have done has been to unset what was done previously. The Labour Government set up a 'Board of Repatriation trustees, and proposed to provide some millions of money for them to go on with.  £250,000.",27
187,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"They proposed to find £10,000,000 immediately from the taxation of war profits, but after the upset over the Conscription issue, and the alteration of parties in this House, the present Government! have held up since the middle of last year the work of the repatriation of Australian soldiers. A Board of trustees to deal with repatriation was set up by the Labour Administration, of which the present Minister for Defence, Senator Pearce; the Prime Minister, Mr Hughes; and the Postmaster-General, . Mr Webster, were members; but, because Senator M ill en wishes to abolish this Board, and to act as the Board himself, nothing has been done for the last six or seven months in connection with the scheme. The Government now confess that they are not ready to do anything with respect to repatriation. To further emphasize the fact that they have no busihess ready for our consideration, I would remind honourable members that the honourable member for Parkes to-night stated that the Government should adjourn - the House for a fortnight. M - BBUCE SMITH - I said nothing of r the kind.",27
188,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,The honourable Hon- member said that the Government would not be blameworthy if they adjourned the Parliament for a fortnight.,27
189,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,That is so.,27
190,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,He admitted that the Government had no business ready to submit to us.,27
191,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I said that "" if "" they had no business ready.",27
192,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The honourable member knows that the fact that the Go-, vernment have invited us to deal with these Estimates, which are thirteen months old, shows that they have not one item of business ready for us, and he suggests that, if that is so, they had better adjourn the Parliament for a fortnight. so- This Parliament, the members of which have been called together from one end of this continent to the other, is to be adjourned for a fortnigh t to enable the Government to prepare some business for its consideration. As a matter of fact, the Government have no proposals for w i nning the war. They have no business ready to meet the urgent conditions that exist; no business ready to provide for the proper treatment of our disabled soldiers, or for the widows and dependants of men who have gone to the Front; nor have they any business ready to provide for reasonable pensions for our soldiers. The Government are paying some of our disabled men the magnificent pension of 7s. 6d. a week. They have nothing ready to remove any of these grievances. They desire honourable members on this side of the House to give them suggestions as to what should be done. They would have us talk for a fortnight in order that the Government might carefully note our suggestions. At the end of that time, this so-called Win-the-War Administration would bring. in their legislation on the lines suggested by the Labour party, the members of which they told the people were Huns and in the pay of Germany. What was the last act performed by the ' Prime Minister this afternoon? When' he found that there was no business to go on with, he said, in. effect, "" I have to meet a Conference tomorrow in regard to fruit. Let us have a discussion. . Let the House give me the benefit of its opinions on the subject, so that I may have something to go on .with when I meet the Conference tomorrow."" Was there ever a more abject confession of the emptiness of the Government's professions than is to be found in the situation which is now before us! The Prime Minister, by leave of the House, made a statement in regard to the sale of wheat, and other questions. He did not read from any paper; but, in his dilemma, it occurred to him that such statements were often read, and that he might move in this case' that the paper be printed. In that way, he thought it would be possible to have a discussion which would extend over a few hours.",27
193,Mr FALKINER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Forc e of habit, resulting from what he did when he was on the other side.",28
194,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The Prime M in ister's ingenuity and resource must be very poor indeed if mere force of habit can alone help him out of such a difficulty. The farmers of Australia should carefully note that the Government had no business to put before the House today; that they suspended the sitting for three [6] or four hours because they had not one shred of business to put before honourable members, and that there was on the business-paper, in the name of a private member, a notice of motion dealing with the immense wastage of wheat which is now going on and the enormous losses being inflicted upon the farmers, as is shown by the Farmers and Settlers Association",28
195,The CHAIRMAN,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Order ! The honourable member is now anticipating a motion on the business-paper.  to the mice.,28
196,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"That interjection shows the mental calibre of the honourable member for Calare. We know that the daily newspapers will not expose the hyprocrisy of the Government's "" winthe-war ' ' policy. They are owned by the capitalists who provided the money for the Government's party campaign at the last elections, and they will shield the Government all the time.' They will hide these facts, and go on excusing the shortcomings of this Administration. They do that day after day. But we have in the galleries some few people who have witnessed the spectacle of this so called "" Win-the-war "" Government meeting the House without an item of business to put before it. I rose only to put this fact pointedly before those members of the public who are able to listen to me and to those who read Hansard. My desire was to let them know that this Government not only refuse to deal with important matters affecting the farmers of this country, but that, after all their talk of winning the war, after all their flapping of the flag and their resort to patriotic shibboleths, they have not one proposition to submit for winning the war or for helping those who are fighting our battles at the Front,.or the dependants they have left behind them.  orable members required any proof of the hollowness of the Opposition cry, they have had it in the speech to which we have just listened. It is evident that the trick which they sought to play this afternoon has been countered to some extent by the' introduction of these Estimates. No one knows better than does the honourable member for Cook that, although the expenditure for which these Estimates provide has been dealt with by way of Supply Bills, it is necessary that the Estimates-in-chief should be passed, and that they should be followed up by an Appropriation Bill. It matters not whether such business be done now or six months hence; the fact remains that it must be done, and the Government are to be commended for introducing these Estimates to occupy our attention while they finalize their proposals. I invite honourable members to consider the hypocrisy of the cry of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. It was only yesterday that the Governor General's Speech outlining the work of the session was submitted to us, and I bave repeatedly known the debate in this House on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to extend over several weeks. The honourable member for Cook had something to say regarding the question of repatriation. I have a very vivid recollection of the honourable member's departure for Canada some time ago. He went away, and left to his mates in the party the work of dealing with repatriation. That being so, the less he says as to his anxiety to transact such business the better. Some question has been raised as to who prepared these Estimates. As a matter of fact, three different Treasurers have had something to do with them. were brought down in the first place by the honourable member for Capricornia. Later on I had a share in the handling of them for three months, and subse* quently the present) Treasurer came into office, and took them over. When I took office as Treasurer I foresaw that there was likely to be a shortage in the returns for the financial year which closed on 30th June last, and that we should not be able to make ends meet, save by the - exercise of rigid economy and the free use of the pruning knife. When a Treasurer leaves office before his Estimates have been dealt with, it is somewhat dimcult for him to ascertain the degree of retrenchment for which he has been responsible. But when I vacated the Treasury I was careful to ask the Secretary, Mr Collins, to furnish me with a return showing the reductions made in the Estimates while I was there. I have all the details of the reductions made by me, but it is sufficient for me to inform the Committee that I reduced the Estimates to the extent of £2,150,000, and this notwithstanding that I increased by £200,000  the amount provided for pensions, and made - provision for an expenditure of £750,000 in connection with repatriation. Shortly put, these Estimates haye been reduced to the extent of something like £3,000,000 since they were originally introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia. I find that, although the financial year nominally closed with a surplus of £1,678,000, there was actually a deficit of over £1,300,000, since we brought forward £3',000,000 from the previous year. Let me now refer to some of the taxation which was imposed while I was in office. The Income Tax Bill, although mutilated to some extent by the Senate, has been responsible for a fair increase in revenue, the returns from that source jumping from £3,900,000 to £5,600,000. Then, again, the revenue from probate duties rose from £626,000 to over £1,000,000 last year. The loss of revenue has occurred chiefly in"" connection with Customs and to a small extent in connection with Excise. The falling-off in Customs revenue during the' financial year was largely attributable to the submarine campaign. If ships cannot come here, there must necessarily be a fallingoff of Customs revenue. Some honourable members have complained that the enThey tertainments tax has not realized as much as was anticipated. The responsibility for that fact, however, rests with the House itself. The schedule to the Bill providing for the tax was ruthlessly cut down by honourable members. They were not even satisfied with the exemption of 3d. and 6d. tickets, but practically extended the exemption up to tickets of Is. each. As the result of their action considerable revenue has been lost, many of the cheaper picture shows having reduced their charge from Is. to 9d. .so as to avoid the tax. It is interesting to note the amount that we have received in taxation, the bulk of which has been imposed for war purposes. The income tax represents - over £5,000,000; the land tax over £2,000,000; the probate duties over £l,000-,000; and the amusement tax over £110,000. This return from the amusement tax is only for a half year, so that iti may be doubled in order to show the total revenue. These figures all taken together represent a total of about £9,025,000. We have now to briefly look at the commitments for the war for last year. In round figures our war loans represent £130,000,000, of £80,000,000 was raised in Australia, and the balance in England. On this indebtedness the interest amounts to £5,850,000, and a 1 per cent, sinking f u n d means another £1,300,000. war pensions for this year will amount to about £1,000,000, and repatriation to £750,000. In these figures we have indebtedness which must be met by taxation, and what I desire to show is that our direct taxation up to the present has met our commitments in connection with the war. The figures I have just mentioned total about £8,900,000, and our direct taxation amounts to £9,025,000.",28
197,Mr SAMPSON,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Are you including whole of the land tax revenue ?  shown that we came out on the wrong side of the ledger by £1,223,000. I had, however, provided for a war profits tax, which, on the best estimates I could obtain, would have produced £1,500,000 in the two years 1914 and 1915. Before the elections I urged the Government to pass a War Profits Taxation Bill , because I felt that otherwise we should come out on the wrong side. Besides, it is nob fair to those who have to pay the tax to delay the measure, for it means that we shall have to come down on them for three years' taxation, which will be all the more difficult for them to meet. I have heard, several people complain of the amount spent on the war, and it was quite common to hear it said during the elections that we had "" done enough."" In this connection, it is interesting to know what is the charge on the people of the Old Country as compared with the charge on the people of Australia. Quite recently it was announced in a speech by Mr Bonar Law that Great Britain is spending £7,000,000 per £213,000,000 per month, and this, with population of 50,000,000, means 2s. 9d. per head for every man, woman and child. In Australia our expenditure is £4,500,000 per month, or £147,942 per day, which, spread over a population of 5,000,000, works out at 7d. per head, as against 2s. 9d. at Home. In other words, England is spending, in order to win. the war, four and three-quarter times as much per head as we are in Australia.",30
198,Mr SAMPSON,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Does that include money lent to the Allies?  which. occasion I referred to our commitments for the'future, which will have to be met by very heavy taxation. Last year, at any rate, the whole of our public works were constructed out of revenue, repreThe senting an amount, of about £4,714,000 up to the 30th June, 1917. In the previous year £2,000,000 was spent on public works out of loan, but last year the whole expenditure was out of revenue. Last year we spent for war purposes out of revenue £8,400,000, so that there is a good margin to work upon if necessary. It is quite evident to me thab it will be impossible to carry on our public works out of revenue, and all works, except those the of the most urgent character, will have to be closed down. There is one phase of the war, and of the financial position in . Australia, that is truly remarkable. Prior to the war in 1914, the accumulated deposits in the savings banks of Australia amounted to something like about £84,000,000, whereas about two months ago, as shown from figures supplied by the Commonwealth Bank, they stood at about £100,000,000, showing an increase of over £16,000,000. Then the deposits in the Associated Banks in 1914 were £163,000,1)00, whereas the latest figures show that they now stand at £183,843,000. These increases amount to about £36,000,000, and show the savings of the people during the period of the war, notwithstanding the fact that we have withdrawn from the savings of the people some £80,000,000 ""on loan. For war purposes defrayed from loan money there is something over £20,000,000 lying to our credit in the Commonwealth Bank, and if I mistake not, there is about £22,000,000 due to the Imperial Government for what they have done for our troops at the Front. In this connection I understand ' that the Treasurer has made an arrangeday, or ment to pay so much per month. I desire, however, to refer to the haphazard methods adopted in the past for arriving at an estimate of our indebtedness to the Imperial Government; and a little in cident that came under my notice throws some light on the matter. When I went to the Treasury, I noticed in my predecessor's statement an item of £1,900,000 which was said to be the amount due to the Imperial Government for moneys expended on our Forces up to the 30th June, 1916. I could not get any data to satisfy me, and I cabled to London, Will the result that I found that the indebtedness, instead of being £1,900,000, was £8,500,000. This, I think, bears out what I say as to the haphazard, lax way of estimating the expenditure on the other side. In my opinion,' there ought to be a bigger effort made to repay this amount to the Imperial Government, who, I am sure, are doing this work very willingly.",30
199,Mr RICHARD EOSTER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The figure quoted represents the accumulations from the beginning of the war.  another accumulation which may place us in a false position. Already the accumulation is estimated at £22,000,000, and there is a further estimated accumulation for deferred pay, which is not referred to in any of the figures given to us by the Treasurer.",31
200,Sir JOHN PORREST,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Oh , yes, it is.  any rate, it will represent a good many more millions. It is well for us to stand exactly what the financial position is, and I suggest that, instead of keeping the £20,000,000 lying in the bank. and earning no interest, it would be much sounder finance to reduce the Imperial, debt. There is much that I should like to say in regard to what England is doing in connection with the war, but I do not wish to occupy further time. I feel confident that there will have to be stringent economy in Australia in regard to public works and other expenditure, and there must also be heavy taxation. The complaints that have been made against the Government this afternoon about ithe non-introduction of legislation are, in my opinion, unreasonable. Much of this legislation is of a very technical character and requires the very closest scrutiny; and I believe that when the measures for repatriation and other purposes are introduced they - will commend themselves to honourable members..",31
201,Mr RILEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"South Sydney) [9.30] In one respect the Government is not doing all that is possible to win the war. It is evident, from the statement made by the Prime Minister today, that Australia is in a serious position in regard to the shipment of frozen meat, rabbits, wheat, butter, and other commodities, and it seems to me that the Government have not done as much as they could have done to utilize some of the large steamers engaged in the coastal trade. We are all anxious to make sacrifices to assist the Old Country and to feed our Allies, but we are allowing to continue on the coast large steameTS such as the Canberra and the Katoomba, some of them of 8,000 and 9,000 tons, when smaller steamers could handle the coastal trade, thus freeing the bigger vessels for the transport of our products to the Old Country.",31
202,Mr CORSER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,There is not enough shipping on the coast today.,31
203,Mr RILEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I know that there is not enough; but if we are to make sacrifices to win the war, surely the shipping companies should make sacrifices too.",31
204,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,There is not enough shipping to carry coal to keep the railways going.,31
205,Mr RILEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I am speaking of large ships that could be utilized to carry comundermodities overseas. Throughout the Commonwealth vast quantities of commodities are stored, waiting for bottoms to transport them to the Old Country.",31
206,Mr KELLY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,I think the honourable member will find that the Department of the Navy has been investigating this matter.,31
207,Mr RILEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I hope the Department will not occupy a year in investigating it. Both the local producer and the consumer abroad are in a bad position, and it is the duty of the Government to make the best possible use of every steamer on the coast.. I understand that New Zealand has almost depleted its coast of shipping by sending all the larger ships overseas with produce. There are at least seven or eight steamers on the Australian coast which could be utilized for that purpose.",31
208,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"We cannot spare another steamer. - Mr Riley - If ' the y had all been sunk we should have to spare them. I know that the withdrawal of these ships from the coastal trade would not be pleasant to the shipping companies or the travelling public, but in these days we must, put up wirth many unpleasant things. W© have to assist the consumer abroad, and also our own primary producers.",31
209,Mr CORSER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,The inter-State trade is very large.,31
210,Mr EILEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"We have r a i l communication between the States, and we must be prepared to tolerate the best communication we can afford in the circumstances. If the Government are in earnest they will compel the shipping companies to utilize their vessels in whichever way is best for the Empire and the Allies. The Australian shipping companies have been immune from war dangers, and have been making extremely large profits.",32

212,Mr EILEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The Prime Minister may have meant the utilization of the Commonwealth line of steamers; but am referring to large ships now trading on the coast, and which, in my opinion, are not being employed in the best posextent sible way. I offer these Temarks in no oarping spirit.",32
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"ParramattaMinister for the N a v y ) [9:35] - As there seems to be a popular misimpression abroad, I think I should explain that the Department of the Navy has nothing to whatever to do with this matter. The control of shipping has heen relegated a Shipping Board, controlled, I believe, by Senator Eussell. '",32
214,Mr KELLY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,An*office r of the honorso able gentleman's Department presides dogmatizing on this matter. over the Board.,32
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I understand that one of my officers is a member of the Board, but further than that I have no - direct connection with it . The Governter ment is looking into the shipping protaining blem very particularly; and I believe w the honourable member for South Sydney that if investigation proves that there are on the coast ships that, could be spared for oversea transport purposes, they should be utilized for the carrying of our produce to Europe. But, whilst one may lay that down as a sound principle to work upon, the practicability of it has be established by an examination of all the factors whioh make up the problem. The main thing is to ascertain how space is being wasted at the present time on and about our coasts. On that point various opinions have been expressed. criticism later, when he had We are told in many authoritative quarters that there is not enough shipping on the coast to keep our own industries going.",32
216,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,That is quite true.,32
217,Mr RILEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,But we have to make v some sacrifice.,32
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"It seems to me that one way of winning the war is to increase the stability of this country as well as other portions of the Empire, and I do not know that we shall increase staying power of the nation by throwits industries out of gear if that can shipping be avoidedI admit that the paramount question at the moment is the feeding of the armies at the Front, and the people of the otlier countries which are allied with' us. Next comes the problem of in I creasing all those agencies which mean resource and staying power in the form of wealth of some kind or other. The to which shipping can be spared is the subject of serious inquiry by the Government, and I hope the honourable member for South Sydney may be proved to be right, and that it may be found on examination that a great deal of the coastal shipping can be utilized in the overseas trade. But there are two sides the question, and I am afraid the honourable member will find that if our own to industrial concerns are to be kept going reasonably, not generously, a great deal of the shipping which he imagines can be readily sent away to other countries will be required on our coast. I am not It is a problem which we should approach with an open mind, and act only after consideration of all the facts concerned. The Shipping Board is investigating the matvery seriously with a view to asceri f it is possible to accomplish the it h objects which the honourable member has in view.",32
219,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Wakefield) [9.40] - I am desired by the Farmers and Settlers Association of South Australia to place before the Committee the views of that body in regard to .the proposals referred to today by the Prime Minister to for the storage and protection of wheat from mice and weather. The Prime M in ister stated that he would like to hear any much statements honourable members had to make before the. meeting of the Conference tomorrow, so as to obviate any done his best,. Three of - the wheat-growing States of the Commonwealth have determined to enter upon the bulk handling of wheat, and in order to protect their wheat in the immediate future they intend to construct silos that will be capable of utilization in connection the new scheme. I have no word to say against bulk handling for those three States which have resolved to adopt that system, but on behalf of the Farmers and Settlers Association of South Australia, and also on behalf of the South Australian farming interests, I assure the Committee that 90 per cent, of the farmers of that State are absolutely opposed to bulk handling. Therefore, if the provision of silos, for the better protection of wheat in the near future, is to be approved by the Conference tomorrow, the South Australian farmers desire to be exempted from such an arrangement. I know that the Vaughan Government included bulk handling in its policy, and that up t ill the time of the last Conference South Australia joined with the other three wheat-growing States in advocating the provision pf silos. But this scheme, supported by the Vaughan Government, was defeated in the South Australian Parliament, and it is the opinion of the Farmers and Settlers Association, after taking voluminous evidence, that 90 per cent, of the South Australian farmers are opposed to bulk handling, and, therefore, to the provision of silos for the protection of their wheat.'",32
220,Mr SAMPSON,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Hav e they taken into consideration the labour difficulties ?,33
221,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"They have considered labour and every other phase of the question, and whilst bulk handling might be appropriate for Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia, in which States the bulk, if not the entire, shipping is done at two or three ports, it is not appropriate for South Australia, which has ports at intervals of 10 or 12 miles all along its coast line. We have no desire to condemn bulk handling, so far as it applies to the other three States. For many reasons the bulk handling of wheat is not desired in South Australia. I therefore ask the Treasurer to putl this proposition before the Prime Minister. Ib is not usual to provide silo accommodation for more than one-third of a normal crop. But if w e ' in South Australia are allowed to erect mice-proof grain sheds instead of silos, we can, for whafc it would cost to provide silos for one-third of the crop, adequately and? effectively protect the whole crop. I hope that consideration will be given to that matter afc the Conference fo-morrow. There is in f h e various station yards of with . the State nearly enough iron to cover the sheds that are needed.",33
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,How would thesheds be made mice-proof ?,33
223,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"B y erecting round them fences of galvanized plaint iron, 2 or 3 feet high. There are a few such sheds now in South Australia in which wheat is in splendid condition, and the amount saved by keeping it in that condition would more than pay the cost of the sheds.",33
224,Mr BLAKELEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Darling) [9.50] - I wish to say something regarding the'position outlined by the Prime Minister this afternoon. He told us that something like548 general cargo steamers are needed f o lift the general cargo now stored in Australia, and about fifteen insulated ships fco take away the vast amount of produce now in cool storage here. During the electoral campaign every Ministeralist promised his constituents to do all in his power to maintain the industries of Australia, and to see that every pound of wealth which it was possible to produce would be obtained, and the same promise is given in the Governor General's Speech. To-morrow a conference is to be held to devise means for saving the wheat crop, * and a huge sum is to be spent to that end. The cosfc of reconditioning - the wheat fchis year, and the loss already sustained, would altogether pay for the erection of sufficient silos to hold the whole of next season's harvest. But while the Government is willing to make provision for the protection of the wheat, it is doing nothing to help those interested in butter, rabbits, and other perishable produce that has to be kept in cool storage. The Prime Minister airily told the pastoralists and graziers that they would be all right, because they could keep their produce on the hoof. But those to whom I referred are not in that position. And the Prime Minister has not said that he will do anything for them. The rabbiting industry is now a very large one. In 1908 about 7.000,000 pairs of rabbits, worth £336,000, were exported; in 1914-15 the exportation was about 10,000,000 pairs, worth £531,000; and in 1915-16, 11,000,000 pairs were exported, worth .£724,000. During two months of this year something like £4.00,000 worth of rabbits and hares were exported. The =rabbit industry is linked with other in dustries which ar© even more important, and these, as well as it , will suffer if more refrigerated space is not provided. I have taken interest in the rabbit industry for 'the last ten years, not from the exporters' or employers' point of view, but from the point of view of the man who catches rabbits.",33
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Does the honourable member know what we have been doing lately ?,34
226,Mr BLAKELEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I obtained some information from the Prime Minister this Combine 1 afternoon in this chamber, and was also - supplied last month with information at his direction. In my opinion, if the vernment is going to make provision the storage of some commodities, ib should do the' same for all other commodities, without discrimination.",34
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"If the honourable member considers the matter fairly compares what has been done for the --storage of rabbits with what has been done for the storage of meat, he will that the rabbit industry has been treated fairly. As a matter of fact, we are carrybine ing about £500,000 worth of rabbits now.",34
228,Mr BLAKELEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"In June last I matter pointed out to the Prime Minister that the rabbiting industry, so far as the prowhole vision of carcasses is concerned, would - practically cease at the end of the month industries. if the Government did not take action, and that other industries were similarly situated. What I foretold has come and £ 1 2 a week ? about. I said that it was necessary that the Government should take steps to provide refrigerated space, leasing buildings in the diffei*ent capitals, if necessary, and installing the proper machinery. On the 21sfc June, I received, by direction of Prime Minister, a letter in which this statement occursThe Prime Minister is now in correspondence with the Imperial Government in regard to the - stocks of frozen rabbits now accumulated in cold storage, and has urged that action taken to relieve the position. It is understood that many of the packing firms have given earnest consideration - question of providing additional refrigerated storage, and, in view of the fact that the tion will be relieved if the Imperial Governing. ment find it possible to provide space for their purchase of rabbits, it is felt that to take building cool chambers at this stage not prove a remunerative undertaking. That statement does not tally with what the Prime Minister said today. We have been told that private firms are taking steps to provide the necessary space, but if that be so, no one knows anything about ib except the Prime Minister. W it h the exception of a small amount of space held by the Rabbit Combine, there is none left in Australia, and no steps are being taken to provide more.",34
229,Mr RODGERS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,The Government of Victoria is extending the accommodation.,34
230,Mr BLAKELEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Yes , but not to any great extent, not enough to keep the rabbit industry going for two months.",34
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Is there a Rabbit,34
232,Mr BLAKELEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Yes ; and whoever is responsible for the machinery which is Gobeing provided to deal with the export for of rabbits does not occupy an enviable position. For six months the leading men in the rabbit business lived in Melbourne, and about two months ago the result of their labours here was made , and known. There is now a combine which absolutely controls the export of rabbits in this country. An y one may pack, but see the export of rabbits is controlled by the combine. I will not say that the comhas worked the Government, but it has so impressed those in charge of this that it has got practically all that it wants. They have got control of the industry, and have cornered the refrigerated space to the detriment of other",34
233,Mr FALKINER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"As the result of this, are not rabbiters getting as much as £ 1 0",34
234,Mr BLAKELEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,That is being said.,34
235,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,It is true that some men have made as much as that.,34
236,Mr BLAKELEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"In one case a man earned as much as £ 1 4 a week from a rethe frigerating depot, but he was employing six of his children in trapping, and they were working from 5 o'clock at night t ill 8 o'clock in the morning.. ,",34

238,Mr BLAKELEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Yes , child slavery. be The refrigerated space in Australia is today bursting with rabbit's, butter, and to the meat, and the Government is not-giving effect to its promise to maintain its in posidustries, and to reduce the cost of livI t refuses to provide more space to underkeep going the industries that need it , might and it has taken no steps to bring about the reduction of prices. Immediately it was returned to power, the cost of butter was increased by something like lb. Although there are thousands of tons of butter in cool storage in Australia, the Government does not intend to tread on the corns of its friends by reducing the price of butter to the people of Australia. The price-fixing machinery in Australia today is a farce.",34
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Is it a farce? Then this is another of your party's f eircss,35
240,Mr BLAKELEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"Y o u have altered the machinery. The price-fixing machinery is so constructed now that the pro: ducer and the consumer do not benefit, but the middleman scores. I figures here in regard to the profits made by the Rabbit Combine. They are as f o l lows :Rates being paid to Packers by the Federal 19s. per box containing 12 pairs, large blues, vernment. firsts, free on boat. 17s. .per box containing 12 pairs, firsts, free on boat. ISs. per box containing 12 pairs, small firsts, free on boat. 17s. per box containing 12 seconds, free on boat. 19s. per box containing 15 pairs, skinners, free on boat. The companies pay first month's storage at city works,- after which the Government pay the.storage until they are shipped. , When shipped, warrant is issued by Export Department. Companies then immediately ceive cash on pack. Cost of Handling (based on Cost of Handling serious consideration. First Large Blues). Companies' cost of handling, Is. 3d. per one month's freezing storage, Is. 3d. per box; labour, 8d. per box; total, 3s. 2d. box. Commission, Freight, Cartage, &c.

Price paid by Government to Packers. First blues, per box, 19s.; profit made packers of first blues per box, 5s. Id. So it will be seen that the middleman doing quite well out of the transaction. We in Australia do not eat good rabbits. Those placed on the Australian market for homo consumption are the rejects, and the torabbits for which the consumer in Melbourne pays 2s. per pair are worth 6d. per to the House:pair to the man who catches them, and something like 3s. per box to the man who handles them. The gross profits of all voted grades of rabbits run out approximately on I d . per the following lines:Gross Profits on all Grades (based on Average of 9s. per Boss for all Grades, Large and Small). Large, first blues, 5s. Id. per box containing 12 pairs. Young kittens, 3s. per box containing 12 pairs. Small, first blues, 5s. per box containing 12 pairs.

241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Is there anything to prevent the rabbiters from combining have some and looking after themselves?,35
242,Mr BLAKELEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"An y one is free to pack rabbits, but the Federal Government have seen that no one but the Rabbit Combine, can operate. Government. Mr CORSER - You refer to the late Go",35
243,Mr BLAKELEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"This has been done young blues, within the last three months.",35
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"But did you operate blues, and export before the Government took pairs, large blues, this step?",35
245,Mr BLAKELEY,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"No ; but some firms graded which were not in the combine were operating, and, not being in the combine today, they have been forced out of business. The loss of the carcasses will be a very serious matter to Australia, esrepecially in war time, when the waste of every pound of meat is - a matter for The position is box; that the trappers are compelled to trap either for the carcasses or for the skins, per and they are at the mercy of the combine. Of what use is it to trap for skins if they cannot get paid for them? It would be box; - a good step for the Federal Governmeut to take, even at this late hour, to fix a price for the man who catches the rabbits, and to provide refrigerating space, which will never be wasted in a growing country by like Australia. Furthermore, the rabbiters should be allowed the same concession is as the Rabbit Combine enjoys, both for carcasses and for skins. Question resolved in the affirmative.

248,Mr HUGHES,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I am prepared, if the honourable gentleman likes, to confine the discussion; but, while some of the measures are controversial, others are only general in character. I suggest that the Opposition allow us to proceed on Wednesday with those which are non-party in character, and that the others should be allowed to stand over until the following day. FOBBEST, Mr TUDOR - If I may be permitted I should like to explain, Mr Speaker, that I am perfectly willing that the Prime Minister should, on Wednesday next, move the second reading of such Bills as are non-controversial in character. If other honourable members do not object, I shall not do so. I fail to see that any good purpose could be served by bringing honourable members here tomorrow merely to advance these measures to the firstreading stage, and then to adjourn. - Mr JH CATTS (Cook) [10.19] - I understand that we are discussing the question of whether leave shall be granted to the Prime Minister to transact certain business in an entirely irregular way.",36

253,Mr SPEAKER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,The Prime Minister has asked the leave of the House to move that he have leave to bring in this measure. The question is that leave be granted.,37
254,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Cook) [10.21] - It would appear that the Prime Minister wishes to obtain leave to submit these motions in order that the business of the House may be suspended tomorrow.,37
255,Mr HUGHES,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,Not at all ; I am quite willing that we should go on tomorrow. .,37
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The member for Cook, who has been making speeches as to the Government having no business to go on with, now desires to block Government business.",37
257,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The Minister for the Navy knows that if the Government were prepared to submit their business in a regular way it would be unnecessary for the Prime Minister to ask for leave to do something which he is not entitled to do under the Standing Orders. That is my answer to his interjection. The Prime Minister said that this business could, by leave, be taken to-night to such a stage as would enable the Government to proceed with it next Wednesday without meeting the House to!-morrow.. I wish to put it to the Government, as I am perfectly entitled to do as a representative of a constituency in this House, that I have given notice of m y intention to submit two motions. The notices of motion are oh\the business-paper. If the business of this House can be arranged in such a way that the Government have nothing to go on with tomorrow, then I should be allowed tomorrow to move those resolutions, which deal with matters of importance to laTge sections of the people.",37
258,Mr BOYD,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,But the honourable member has set them down for a specific date.,37
259,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"No b ati all. They are on the business-paper for consideration today, and should have been reached this afternoon when the Government had no business to put before us. But instead of Orders of the Day being called upon, as provided for under the .Standing Orders, and thereafter notices of motion, the Prime Minister had a few words privately with Mr Speaker, as the result of which he left the chair for three or four hours. That action deprived me of my right to submit the motions, of which I had given notice in the proper way. If the Government are going to deny to honourable members on this side rights to which they are entitled under the Standing Orders, then they need not expect any privileges from us. If the Standing Orders are to be side-stepped and twisted in order to prevent the consideration of business which I have put before the House, as I have a perfect right to do, then I shall do my bestl to see that neither the Prime Minister nor any other honourable member opposite receives at the hands of the Opposition honourable any privileges for which the Standing Orders do not provide.",37
260,Mr HUGHES,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,What are the honourable member's motions. He knows perfectly well that they deal with a.matter covered by a motion of which I have given notice.,37
261,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"My notices of motion, which relate to wheat, are already on the business-paper, whereas the Government have absolutely nothing on the business-paper in regard to that subject. The Prime Minister asks what are the notices of motion standing in my name. The first reads- . That the Commonwealth arrange for payment to the Australian Government Wheat Pool of. the estimated amount of damage sustained by all wheat after its receipt in good order and condition by authorized agents of the Government. The second isThat farmers should, upon delivery of their wheat to Government agents, be paid in full the net amount guaranteed by the Commonwealth; the financing, if necessary, to be provided by a special note issue made legal tender, to be retired as advances or settlements are made by the Imperial Government, or as the result of other sales made by the Commonwealth.",37

263,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"""Who is.the friend of the farmer?"" the Minister asks. They are certainly not those who have so much to say to 'the farmers, but who take advantage of the powerful majority they have in this House, to prevent the discussion of business of importance to the farmers. The Prime Minister is aware that he cannot obtain leave to move these proposals of his to-night, if any objection be raised. I think I am entitled to raise an objection, and to prevent his obtaining a special privilege and using his position to block me, as a member of Parliament, from proceeding with legitimate and imto-day. portant public business properly before Parliament.",38
264,Mr HUGHES,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I rise to a point of order. I was under the impression, Mr Speaker, that you had put the ,first motion that I have leave to bring in a Bill relating to wheat storage, and that it had been proved by the House. That having done, I proposed a second motion relating to a Bill for an A ct to amend the Public Service Act. , The honourable member for Cook has been directing his remarks for some timefcothe question of wheat storage, other Bill . which is not now before the House.",38
265,Mr SPEAKER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"The Prime Minister asked the leave of the House to introraise duce Bills, and that leave granted.

The Bill now referred to by [7]-2 Prime Minister is a Bill to amend the Commonwealth Public Service Act. . Mr JH CATTS - I am under no misapprehension as to the question before the Chair. What I say is that the Prime Minister cannot get leave except by the unanimous consent of the House; if one honourable member objects, leave is not granted. The Prime Minister is asking for a concession at my hands, and 1I have a right to ask for fair treatment ati his hands; he is asking for a concession that he is not prepared to extend fco other people.",38

270,Mr HUGHES,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,So you are.,38
271,Mr JH CATTS,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,That is not so; business is being blocked because the Government had no business on the paper,38
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I rise to a point of order. The position, as I understand it , is that the House has already granted leave to the Prime Minister to give some notice of motion for next silting.",38
273,Mr SPEAKER,DEBTEDNESS OF AUSTRALIA TO GREAT,"I should like to appoint out that the question submitted to been the House was that the Prime Minister have leave to introduce certain Bills which were not specified.

' This only shows how mean and paltry the Prime Minister can be, resorting to personalities when he has no business to place before us. As a matter of fact, when the question of private business raised last night, the Minister for the Navy objected to private members having any lime, whatever; and, although there was an opportunity today to make some arrangement, we have had no announcevance ment on the subject. I submit that before concessions. are granted to the Governagainst ment by this side we ought to know how we are going to be treated in regard business we desire to bring forward. Surely matters are not to be altogether one-sided.
