5,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"It is extraordinary that, instead of speeding up business, the ernment appears to be back-pedalling.

I neither sought for nor hoped to obtain support from other forces, whether they were behind the Lang party or the reactionary party of which the Postmaster-General is a member. At all times when I have conuntil tested the Cook electorate I have been selected and endorsed as a Labour candidate. At the forthcoming elections I propose to face my constituents in the same capacity.

6,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong-Attorney [10.35] - I regret that the honourable member for Cook (Mr Riley) is disappointed with the Government.

Question resolved in the affirmative. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .  last night on the proposals for the redistribution of Victoria, the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) made an interjection to which I retorted that I recollected having read a few weeks ago report in the press to the effect that he protested against the elimination of and Corangamite and the reduction of the it representation of primary producers, and that he intended actively to oppose",10
7,Sir HENRY GULLETT,Unknown,"The words used by the honourable member were ""strong"", ""protest"", and "" f i g h t "" .  Govhonorable gentleman's correction. Later in the debate the honourable gentlereferred to my remark and an enquoted from a report in the Melbourne Argus, which showed that he had referred ""with disapproval to the sening of country representation and the elimination of Corangamite. That report did not contain any mention of his intention to oppose the redistribution proposals. I can find no other newspaper report on the matter, consequently I must assume that my impression was gained from an imperfect recollection of the report which the honourable gentleman cited. To whatever extent I misrepresented him by overstating the purport of his remarks, I express my regret to him. ""WAR SERVICE HMS. ADMINISTRATION INTASMANIA EVICTIONS.",10

In J927 a Colonial Office Conference, held at London, recommended that a commitfound tee be established to investigate the matter and devise some form of transport which could be utilized to provide cheaper transport than was possible with ordimuch further reduced. nary road motor vehicles, and which would obviate or defer the building of non-paying developmental railways u n t such time as development and production reached a stage when such railways could be constructed and operated without loss. future The cost of the investigation has financed by contributions from the various dominion and colonial governments and 'by the Empire Marketing Board. The Commonwealth Government has contributed £1,500. The first 15-ton unit, operated on petrol, designed by the Oversea Mechanical Transport Directing Committee, was successfully tested in England and on the A f r i c a n Gold Coast, the unit being subsequently purchased by the Gold Coast Government. Arrangements were made for the second 15-tou unit, slightly modified as a result of the experience gained with the first unit,- and equipped with a diesel engine, to be subjected to six months oversea trials in the Northern Territory of Australia. The trials are being carried out under the supervision of Captain E . C. Roscoe, on behalf of the Overof sea Mechanical Transport Directing Committee, London. The unit arrived at early in A p r i l , 1934, and after tests in South Australia, was by road to Alice Springs, from which it has since been hauling loads in the Northern Territory under commercial conditions.

42,Mr A GREEN,PROPOSALS FOR REDISTRIBUTION OF,"Kalgoorlie) [11.13] That all the words after "" That "" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof before Parlia- the following words:"" this House disapproves of the distribution for the State of Western Australia into electoral divisions as proposed by the distribution commissioners, and requests the Minister to direct the distribution commissioners to propose a fresh distribution of the said State."" Section 19 of the Electoral Act provides that in making any proposed distribution of a State into divisions, the distribution commissioners shall, among other things, give due consideration to community or diversity of interests, and to means of .communication. I shall deal, first, with the means of communication, then with community or diversity of interests, and go ou to show that the increasing population in the present electorate of Kalgoorlie is sufficient to justify this House in sending the proposals of the distribution commissioners back to them for reconsideration. On numerous occasions, I have pointed out that the Kalgoorlie electorate comprises 909,000 square miles out of a total of 975,000 square miles for the whole of Western Australia. In other words, that electorate comprises eleventwelfths of the State, and is half as large again as the whole of Queensland, which comprises about 609,000 square miles. An examination of the map will show clearly the vast territory that I am expected to cover and the relatively small area that the other four members from Western Australia have to serve. I do not wish to suggest that those four representatives have not enough work to do, for even the residuum of the State, after my electorate is taken from it, is two-thirds the size of Victoria. In the circumstances, the other four Western Australian representatives in this House are kept very busy. My port farthest south is on the southern ocean and my port farthest north is on the Timor Sea. I have 2,500 miles to travel to go hy steamer from Esperance in the south to my port that is farthest north. I am nearer to Wyndham when I am in Canberra than when I am in my own electorate. During the recent recess I made two excursions through my electorate which occupied fifteen weeks. I travelled 3,300 miles by air and more than 7,000 miles by other means of transport, yet still had one-third of my electorate to cover. I shall, of course, not be able to visit all of it before the elections. The additions proposed to b»> included in the Kalgoorlie electorate are from the division of Swan and consist of part of the subdivision of Toodyay and part of that of Northam. I recognize that the Swan electorate carries a large population and that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) deserves some relief, but I am sure he will agree with me that the State could be redistributed without giving me eleven-twelfths of its territory and including in my electorate agricultural folk who have no community of interests whatever with the people on the gold-fields. The people of Toodyay subdivision are almost entirely wheat-fanners. Northam is regarded as the capital of the agricultural districts of Western Australia and is the largest city in the agricultural areas of the State. The idea of including such areas in the Kalgoorlie electorate is unwise. It must be evident to any one who thinks for a moment that, in view of the vast area that I already represent, it would be absolutely impossible for me, in the time at my disposal, to represent adequately the agriculturists in the Toodyay and Northam areas. It would be as great an anomaly to include Toodyay and Northam in my electorate as it would be to place either one or both of the gold-mining cities of Kalgoorlie and Boulder in an entirely agricultural division. The people of Northam and Tood- » yay realise clearly that this proposed redistribution is not in their best interests, and that the member for Kalgoorlie could not possibly give them the attention that the honourable member for Swan has given them in the past. Numerous meetings have been held throughout the affected area at which motions of protest against the redistribution have been carried. At one meeting the town hall at Northam was filled to overflowing with indignant electors. Already the Kalgoorlie division includes fifteen out of the fifty State electorates ; but, if the new proposal is agreed to, it will include seventeen State electorates. This surely shows how unnecessary the suggestion is. In passing, I may say that the financial implications of a tremendous area like that are enough to condemn the proposal. I can see clearly what will happen if the electorate is enlarged. When the seventeen State members are approached for a donation towards any public cause, the persons concerned will, at the same time, say, "" Oh, let us also ask Texas for a donation."" To look at the subject from another point of view, it is proposed to include almost half the area of the present Swan electorate in the New Kalgoorlie division. It is true that the area proposed to be included in my electorate is not the moat thickly populated of the Swan division; but it would nevertheless have to be traversed by a new member. There are railways right through the area, but the train service is infrequent in many parts of it. For instance, there is a train once a week on a new line to Bonny Rock, but the train remains four days at the terminus. It would be impossible for me to devote that much time to that particular place, and I cannot afford a motor car to travel through ' the area. If I attempted, in the coming election campaign, to cover in any reasonable way the parts of the sub-divisions of Toodyay and Northam, that are proposed to be included in the Kalgoorlie division, should have to leave the remainder of the division entirely untouched, which would manifestly be unfair.' In big electorates of the kind we are discussing, the people, generally speaking, are considerate; but it often happens that when I visit a remote part of my electorate, I am told, ""You are the first federal parliamentary representative that has ever been here."" I am, at the same time, asked, "" When will you come again ?"" - In most cases I know that it will be impossible for me to return. If these proposed new areas are included in the Kalgoorlie division, will then be as large as Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia combined, and in those States there are 60 members to look after the interests of the electors. During my sixteen weeks' tour through my electorate, I spent 33 nights on trains. The trains were not comfortable like the transcontinental train or the Melbourne express. Frequently, I had only a blanket and a pillow, and quite often I ""was lucky to get them. To carry out a tour of that kind requires considerable physical stamina. I have already referred to the .lack of community of interest that there would be if this alteration were made in the Kalgoorlie electorate, and this is realized by the electors whom it is proposed to transfer to the Kalgoorlie division. Whatever may be said about the Mr A. Green. political views of the present honourable member for Swan, it cannot be denied that he has closely devoted himself to the welfare of the wheat-growers in his division. Of course, I also have received a very substantial vote from wheat growers in other parts of my electorate, but I realise that it would be impossible for me adequately to represent an additional area such as that which it is proposed to include in my division. I do not suggest that the three commissioners who have recommended this redistribution have been unfair. I know them personally, and they are gentlemen above reproach. But the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Western Australia, who has been newly appointed to his office, has, no doubt, considered the redistribution from a departmental point of view, and is anxious that a redistribution shall be adopted which will make unlikely any interference with the boundaries of I the Kalgoorlie electorate for a number of years in consequence of a possible reduction of the number of voters below the minimum quota. I wish to show that there is an alternative proposal that would leave very little probability of that happening. The minimum quota for Kalgoorlie is 36,560. The number of electors on the roll at the 30th December, 1933, was 1,953 below the minimum quota. The number that will be on the roll under the new proposal, will be 43,419 or 6,859 above the quota. The following table gives a summary of the it variations in the number of electors in the federal divisions in Western'Australia in the period 1921-1933:Enrolment Increase or Increase or - 15th decrease, decrease, October, 29th Novem30th Decemmi. ber, 1930. ber, 1933. Fremantle 34,698 + 14,753 + 1,473 Perth Forrest 34,717 32,301 + + 7,814 10,323 + 492 1,734 Kalgoorlie 32,272 - 2,251 + 4,586 Swan 33,207 + 19,151 + 4,611 The only division that has anything approaching the increase in Kalgoorlie is Swan. These figures show that although Kalgoorlie was in a most unfortunate position for a number of years, owing to the slump in the gold-mining industry, its population is now bound to increase. The gold bounty was sought because of the parlous condition of the industry, but a marked change has occurred in the outlook since the price of gold has doubled. The figures of the Mining Department indicate that the number of men in the Kalgoorlie division today is 10,000 greater than in 1930. About 6,000 of those men are not enrolled as electors, the prospector's residence, of course, not being static. The Melbourne Age of the 26th June last published the following telegram from Perth :Although the authorities are unable to cast the actual number of men to be employed on the mines in the near future, indications are that 1,000 additional miners will be engaged by the end of the year. It has been said that one miner carries five other men on his back. The population of Kalgoorlie and Boulder is about 15,000, and the actual number of miners working there is 3,000. When I went to Wiluna in 1922, only seventeen men were engaged. [Quorum formed.} Prom eighteen months to two years is required for the erection of the plant necessary for a mine conducted on modern lines, and working on a big scale. A longer period than that was occupied in preparing for work at Wiluna, which now has a force of 900 men, and a population of about 4,500. A. considerable number of new mines are being opened up by large and reputable companies. The Triton mine, at Cue, now has about 34 men, but will eventually give employment to about 400. The Lancefield mine, at Laverton, has about 40 men already, and the total will no doubt be increased to 500 when its plant is complete. The Southern Cross mine is'being opened up again, but the property will not be ready for active operations for at least two years. The number of men there will be steadily augmented. The Edna May Amalgamated, one of the sensational finds of recent years, is to be re-opened, and it will give employment to at least 600 or 700 men. The Phoenix mine at Norseman is also to be re-worked. I could mention numhers of other properties that are to be opened. My division contains one of the largest auriferous belts in the world, extending from Norseman, about 150 miles north of Esperance, practically to Wyndham with breaks of country. ' The number of electors on the roll will soon be increased, because at least an additional 5,000 men will be engaged on the big mines in the next few years. Consequently, the proposals of the commissioners with regard to Kalgoorlie should be referred back for reconsideration. If the commissioners find themselves in difficulty over the matter, since Kalgoorlie has 1,900 electors under the minimum, a way out could be found by including in the electorate for the time being, the subdivision of Avon, instead of Toodyay and Northam. foreBut I feel sure that within two or three years the population of the Kalgoorlie division will be over the maximum quota. There is a community of interests between the i>eople of Avon, who live along the gold-fields railway, and the residents of the division of Kalgoorlie, because the former send hay, chaff, flour, and other goods to the city of Kalgoorlie and the gold-fields. The addition of that subdivision would increase the number of electors by about 3,900, making it nearly 2,000 over the minimum.",15
43,Mr GREGORY,PROPOSALS FOR REDISTRIBUTION OF,"Swan) [11.45] - I support the amendment moved, by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green). I have no desire to cast any reflection upon the commissioners, because I know that they endeavoured to do their best to produce an equitable distribution. It seems to me, however, that they were influenced too much by considerations of mere population, and too little by community of interest. Every honourable member who last night voted for the amendment of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson), in regard to the redistribution in Victoria, should also vote for the reconsideration of the Western Australian proposals, under which it is intended that there shall be three city electorates in Western Australia-Perth , Fremantle, and Swan. In the Swan electorate, under the proposals now before the House, there will be 26,000 metropolitan voters, and 20,000 agricultural voters, thus making this constituency essentially a metropolitan one. In my opinion, the agricultural interests of the State are entitled to two representatives in this Parliament, and I cannot agree to anything that will reduce their representation. It is now doubtful whether the gold-mining interests will be represented as such at all. It is proposed that 9,300 agricultural voters should be transferred to the K a l goorlie electorate. I have received numerous protests against the proposed change from districts extending all the way from Northam. right through the Mount Marshall district, including one from the Kunonoppin-Trayning Road Board in the following terms:In connection with the proposal to sever the Mount Marshall State electoral district from the Swan Federal electorate aud attach it to the Kalgoorlie electorate, I have been directed by my Board to lodge a strong protest against the change. This resolution was unanimously passed by my members at the last meeting held on the 21st inst., but before acting in the matter the individual members of each ward obtained the expressions of many of the residents on the proposed change. In every instance there uppciirs to bo strong opposition to the alteration, and such an opinion may Vie taken as being unanimous throughout the district. The chief objection is that the Mount Marshall State electoral district is purely an agricultural one, with no communal interests with the gold-fields or the far north. It is feared that it will be neglected from the agricnltiiral point of view if merged in with the Kalgoorlie electorate, whose interests are overwhelmingly mining. It is alao thought that the population basis of the Kalgoorlie electorate will, in a very short while, adjust itself owing to the stimulus i-ivou to the mining industry by the price of go'd and the rush of people engaged in mining activity. The strong movement of population towards the gold-fields, which has occurred in the past few months, must challenge the figures which have been given officially as ""nting those areas. It is thought that many have not compliedwith the compulsory enrolment provisions, or have neglected to give notice of change of address. Yours faithfully, This is endorsed by other protests I have received from the Northam council, from the Chamber of Commerce, the Agricultural Society, the Producers Association, and from every road board which is affected by the proposed change. In every instance it is pointed out that the agricultural of which Northam is the natural centre, is entitled to representation, but under these proposals would be submerged by the mining vote. An area has been added to the goorlie electorate, which will to within 80 miles of the city. If we look at the map of Western Australia, we see Jlfr. Gregory. that a small corner in the south-west is represented by four members, while all the rest, comprising about nine-tenths of the area of the State, is represented by only one member. Further, during the last. two years, approximately 1,000 farms have been abandoned in Western Australia; and, as against that, there has been unprecedented development in the mining industry. The old district of Southern Cross, which was prominent in the early history of the eastern goldfields, but has been practically abandoned for twenty years, has been revived owing to the increased price of gold. It is proposed to employ there between 250 and 300 men, which will mean that the population of the district will be increased by 1,000. In Kalgoorlie important developments are taking place, and the number of miners employed is rapidly increasing. The same thing is occurring at Coolgardie, Menzies, Orabanda, Mount Morgans, Laverton, Wiluna, and Murchison. I am confident that, before three years, if the price of gold keeps up, the population of the electorate of Kalgoorlie will be greater than that of any other in the State, and we shall have the anomaly of this huge area having a larger number of electors than any other division in the State. Large amounts of capital are constantly coming forward from Great B r it a in for the development of the gold mines in Western Australia, and that represeems likely to continue, for I believe that the price of gold will be maintained for a considerable time. 'The result is that mines, which have been abandoned for years owing J. M. FELGATE, Secretary. to the high cost of production, are now being re-opened. This applies even municipal to Pilbara, in the north-west, for which fresh capital has been obtained. Primary It was emphasized at the recent international conference in Rome that the prosperity of the farmers was of the'very industry, greatest importance to every community. That applies with perhaps even greater force in Australia than in other countries, and for that reason it is important that enormous the farming community should receive Kal- adequate representation. I do not wish extend to see rural representation in Western Australia dwindle until it is confined solely to the electorate of Forrest. I am not concerned regarding my personal chances, 'because, at the last election, I polled very well in the city areas, but I am concerned with the principle of adequate representation for agricultural interests, which is of vital importance. It is a matter for regret that less consideration seems to be given by this Parliament to providing proper representation for country districts than to parcelling the' country up into areascontaining equal populations. [Quorum formed.} Honourable members who supported the amendment carried last night in connection with the proposed redistribution in Victoria should also support that moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. A. Green), because in both instances the principle involved is the same. It would be regrettable if through the adoption of the commission's proposals the agricultural districts in Western Australia were left with only one representative in this chamber.  proposed redistribution in Western Australia, particularly with respect to the Kalgoorlie electorate, suggests that the provisions of the Constitution in the matter of representation should be stretched to the utmost possible limit. Under the proposed redistribution there is little or no difference between the number of electors in metropolitan electorates and in rural and mining constituencies, and, as was stated by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), within three years the electorate of Kalgoorlie may have a larger number of electors than any other electorate in Western Australia. It is easy to repeat the cry of "" one man, one vote,"" but we should also consider the right of every man to equal service from his parliamentary representative; that equality is impossible when in some electorates the quota of voters is distributed over an unnecessarily large area. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) has clearly demonstrated the difficulties which he has to encounter in attempting to serve his constituents, and those difficulties should be recognized when a vote is taken on .the amendment now before the House. It would appear that the Kalgoorlie electorate has been extended without proper regard to community of interest. The honourable member for Swan has shown that under the pruposed redistribution in Western Australia, agricultural areas are to be attached to mining districts. The number of voters in the Kalgoorlie electorate should be limited to 25,000, and even then it would be difficult for its representative to serve - them adequately. I - trust that the House will treat this amendment as it did a similar amendment moved last night.",18
44,Mr GABB,PROPOSALS FOR REDISTRIBUTION OF,Angas) [12.4] - I congratulate the Government upon the consistent attitude which it has adopted by adhering closely to the recommendations of the commissions. Whatever stigma attaches to certain honourable members in connection with the vote taken last night the Government has not been associated with their jerrymandering proposals.,20

I shall say that the efforts being made by soni;honourable members to prevent the forthcoming election from being conducted on the boundaries recommended by the cornmissions is not creditable to this Parliament, .and will result in the people's faith in the parliamentary system being further diminished. We cannot disguise the fact that the members of two parties in this chamber have combined to save thp seats of certain honourable members. After all there are advantages in being a member of a party, particularly when one can secure the support of two political parties. If there is a possibility of an honourable member losing his seat by his electorate being absorbed, or becoming more difficult to hold, a combination of the votes of honourable members directly interested may result in the recommendation of the commission being rejected. In such circumstances, an independent member is at a disadvantage. I voted for the retention of seven members for South Australia, as it was my duty as a Soul.?. Australian, member to do. Having done so I was content and I am glad that I have not ""belly-ached"" as some honourable members have done at the prospect of losing their seat.  sonal explanation. While the proposed redistribution in Western Australia is favourable to me, it is unfavorable to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) who is a political opponent of mine. The present honourable member for Kalgoorlie will not always bold that seat. I repudiate the insinuations of the honourable member for Angas.",20
48,Mr FENTON,PROPOSALS FOR REDISTRIBUTION OF,"Maribyrnong) [12.7] I cannot understand why it should be contended by honourable members representing Western Australia, that the electors in that State will not be fairly sented under the proposed i""edistribution scheme. It has been said that certain agricultural areas are to be included in the Kalgoorlie electorate, but I understand that the present representative of the electorate is, himself, a wheat-grower, and if that is so, what better representative could the wheat-growers have? At present the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) represents a large number of farmers in his constituency. AH this twaddle about community of interest is becoming sickening. Although I am the representative of a metropolitan electorate I live in the country, while many who represent country electorates reside in the capital cities. I may have displayed some heat in discussing the proposed redistribution in Victoria, - but I was not actuated by personal interests. If an independent commission recommended that the electorate of Maribyrnong should be cut to pieces, I would support its recommendations. I am surprised that attempts should be made to violate acts of Parliament, and that for purely selfish reasons some honourable members should throw overboard principles which they have supported fojr years. In the past I have taken risks, and if God spares me, I shall take them again.",21

I have adhered more closely to my principles than some of our latterday friends opposite, who are endeavouring to make their presence felt. In view of the action taken last night and today, we might as well dispense with the Constitution, the Electoral Act, and the Representation Act. If the recommendations of an independent commission are to be treated with contempt, we should allow this House to formulate redistribution scuentas. Some honourable members speak with their tongues in their cheeks and disregard the recommendations of intelligent and independent men.  sonal explanation.

55,Mr HAWKER,PROPOSALS FOR REDISTRIBUTION OF,"Wakefield) [12.14] There appears to be an honest difference of opinion as to whether some honourable members should be compelled to represent large electorates, which, besides entailing a good deal of travelling and heavy expense to enable them to keep in touch with their constituents, put the electors at a disadvantage in organization for the purpose of expressing their needs to their own member. It has been suggested that - those who experience such difficulties should receive some consideration, and that the commission should be expected to depart from the exact quota to the extent of the margin of 20 per cent, which the law provides. Actually in the report of \he Victorian commission which has been laid on the table of the House reference is made to the discretion which is allowed to it, but the commissioners say that in the absence of any direction from Parliament they have failed to exercise their discretionary powers to any considerable extent. Under these circumstances, surely it is entirely legitimate for Parliament to refer back recommendations which have been made in ignorance of the wishes of Parliament. In making another allocation of the boundaries the commission should be asked to take cognizance of the disabilities of the people who have to travel long distances and experience great difficulty in communicating with their representatives. That was the main reason why we, in South Australia, considered that Parliament should do what it could to enable that State to retain its seventh member. Only because of that was I prepared to vote against the majority of the House in favour of a course which might have exposed future legislation to some risk of being unconstitutional. On the same principle I voted for the retention of the ten country members for Victoria, and propose to vote in favour of the amendment to give the people in Kalgoorlie a chance of being in approximately as favourable a position as are those in the more densely populated districts. It is grossly unfair to impute improper motive to honourable members who are acting consistently in supporting that principle. I hope that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) will be agreed to.",21
56,Mr THOBBY,PROPOSALS FOR REDISTRIBUTION OF,"Calare) [12.18] - I emphasize the fact that the commission was appointed to make certain recommendations to this House. Its recommendations are now under consideration. Every honourable member is justified in criticizing the recommendations and in offering suggestions, and Parliament will be within its rights in referring the matter back to the commission for further consideration. But because honourable members have deemed it their duty to adopt this attitude some other honourable members have misrepresented their action in such a manner as to make it almost degrading to be associated with Parliament. Although I am politically opposed to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. A. Green) I say that if any case for a reconsideration of suggested daries has been made out it is the case presented by that honourable member. No portion of Australia is more difficult to represent than is the division of Kalgoorlie, which, I understand, is by far the largest electorate in the Commonwealth.",22

60,Mr THORBY,PROPOSALS FOR REDISTRIBUTION OF,"Althoug h remarks of this nature are withdrawn they are recorded in Mansard. There is a good deal of justice behind the claim of honourable members representing Western Australian constituencies, that the House, in referring the recommendations back to the commission, should ask it to give full consideration to the margin allowed under the law, particularly in repect to those districts where it is impossible for the representative to do justice to his constituents because of the impossibility of visiting the whole of his electorate even once in three years.  ter for the Interior) [12.20] - In bringing this measure before the House the Government has tried to be non-partisan. It realizes that although the commission was appointed to make certain recommendations to the Government it was not obligatory on Parliament to accept them. The House has the right to override the commission. If the proposals were binding on the Parliament, it would be a waste of time to submit them to the House for approval. Nevertheless, I ask honourable members to consider seriously the advice of this independent body. The Government realizes the size and circumstances of the Kalgoorlie division, and possibly if the matter is referred back to the commission it can suggest the boun- omission of portion of the area, without exceeding the margin permitted by the act, But I ask honourable members to consider whether in the event of the recommendation being referred hack to the commission there is any possible chance of a fresh distribution being made in time for the next election. The effect might be that the election would have to be held on the existing boundaries. Already, the report on Victoria has been referred back to the commissioners and the in quiries I have made this morning, although not complete, indicate that it will not be possible in the short time available to have the divisional boundaries in that State altered and approved by Parliament in time for the election.

61,Mr WHITE,WI NE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.35] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. AYES. This bill is designed to continue the assistance by way of bounty which is given to certain wines exported from the Commonwealth. The existing Wine Export Bounty Act will expire on the 28th February, 1935, and unless Parliament makes provision for continuance of the system, no bounty can be paid on wine exported from Australia after that date. The wine industry in Australia has had a chequered career over the past decade. It would be well if , at this stage, I briefly NOES. sketched, for the information of honourable members, the history of the Commonwealth's wjne bounty legislation. The industry dates back to the 'thirties and 'forties in South Australia, and Victoria. Under their respective repatriation schemes, the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia placed large numbers <jf returned sol- diers on the land to grow grapes for the wine industry. The scheme, though excellent, was overdone, and, as a result, there has been serious overproduction. The only means of providing an outlet for the surplus grapes was by stimulating the export of wine from Australia, and in order to develop overseas markets the Government granted, in 1924, a bounty of 4s. a gallon on fortified wine exported. This included an amount of Is. 3d., which represented the drawback of the excise duty due on the fortifying spirit contained in the wine exported. In 1927, the bounty was reduced to Is. 9d. a gallon, exclusive of Is. 3d. a gallon drawback, making a total of 3s. a gallon on wine exported. Although the reduction was assented to in April, 1927, it did not operate until the 1st September, 1927, and during the interval, abnormally large quantities of wine were exported to Great Britain on consignment in order to obtain the higher rate of bounty. Such action on the part of wine-makers built up in London large stocks of Australian wines which seriously prejudiced the orderly marketing in Great Britain, and did untold harm to the industry. In March, 1928, the bounty was further reduced by 9d. a gallon. In June, 1930, the position of winemakers, and consequently grape-growers, became critical, and the present Bounty Act restored the bounty to the level operating in 1927, viz., Is. 9d. a gallon. Up to that period, the bounty was paid out of Consolidated Revenue. A departure was made in 1930 by placing part of the burden of financing the bounty on the domestic trade. This was done by increasing the excise duty on fortifying spirit by 5s. a gallon, and placing the extra collections into a trust account, out - of which the bounty was paid. Provisiou was made that if the amount in the trust <D account was at any time insufficient to pay the bounty, any deficiency was to be made up from Consolidated Revenue. The provisions of the Financial Emergency Act of 1931 further reduced the bounty by 20 per cent., making the rate Is. 4.8d. a gallon. Tn 1932, on accounl of the prevailing financial stringency, the Wine Export Bounty Act was further amended by the Financial Emergency Act to restrict payments from Consolidated Revenue in respect of bounty on wine to £96,000 per annum, plus the amount received from the extra excise duty of 5s. a gallon imposed on fortifying spirit in 1930. It was further provided that the money available for payment of bounty should be distributed pro rata amongst exporters. To achieve this end provision was made for progress payment of the bounty. A first payment of Is. a gallon has been made since the Financial Emergency Act has operated. Further payments are dependent on the amount of money available in the trust fund at the end of each year. In 1932-33, the rate of bounty which was paid was Is. 4.2033d. a gallon, and in 1933-34, the maximum rate of Is. 4.8d. a gallon was paid. The rate of bounty has been changed five times since the original act was passed in 1924. The following statement sets out the details:Year. Period. Bate. 1024 1st September, 1924, 4s. per galloD, including to 31st August, drawback 1927 1927 1st September, 1927, Is. 9d. per gallon plus to 8th March, 1928 drawback 1928 9th March, 1928, to Is. per gallon, plus drawback 1980 12th March, 1930 13th March, 1930, to Is. 9d. per gallon, plus 19th July, 1931 drawback 1931 20th July, 1931, to Is. 9d. per gallon, less date Financial Emergency reduction of 20 per cent = Is. 4.8d. per gallon plus drawback In this bill it is proposed further to reduce the rate of bounty from Is. 4.8d. a gallon to Is. 3d. a gallon for the first two years, and adopt a sliding scale providing for a reduction of Id. a gallon per annum until the rate of bounty has been reduced to Is. a gallon. The following figures indicate the extent to which the export trade in fortified wines has increased since the inception of the bounty:Gallons of wine Year. exported on which bounty paid. 192425 .. .. 142,083 192526 .. .. 1,085,544 1920-27 .. 2,212,050 192728 .. .. 3,215,613 192829 .. .. 1,243.247 192930 .. 1,557,892 193031 .. 2,012,312 193132 .. 2,841,341 193233 .. 2,628,912 193334 .. 2,628.294 In June, 1934, there was approximately 14,000,000 gallons of fortified wine in bond in Australia. This quantity is far in excess of the local domestic requirements. Moreover, there is little prospect of increasing local consumption to any appreciable extent in the immediate future. It is, therefore, incumbent on Australia to exploit overseas markets if this surplus is to be absorbed and the industry saved from disaster. The only way in which this can be done is by the continuance of bounty assistance. If the bounty were discontinued export would seriously diminish, further vinting would be severely restricted for at least three years, and grape-growers would bo faced with ruin. It should also be remembered that the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, particularly the latter, have large sums of money invested in irrigation settlements on which the growing of wine grapes is a very important factor. The withdrawal of the wine bounty would iindotibtedly result in those governments suffering heavy financial losses which would severely impair budgetary equilibrium. Last year I visited the wine areas of South Australia. From what I saw there, I am convinced that the abandonment of this important industry is unthinkable. The export of wine has added substantially to Australian credits overseas when such credits were badly needed. value of our exports of wine over the last five years for which figures are available has been as follows:Tear, -£ 192829 .. .. 500,984 192930 .. .. 553,068 193031 .. .. 508,110 "" 1931-32 .. .. 908,071 1932-33 .. .. 788,764 The wine industry in Australia represuddenly, sents a large capital investment. It emtrade, ploys about 600 persons annually in wineries and 3,500 growers producing grapes. In addition it provides each year seasonal occupation for an army of grape pickers, carters and labourers during vintage. Although the Government is convinced that continuance of the bounty is-essenshipments tial, it is of the opinion that the present rate is too hi|gh. Competent authorities in the trade consider that Australian wines could be seld in London without to the incrasHy. Ifr. White. loss of trade at a higher price than is now being realized. South African wines, which are certainly no better in quality than Australian, brings higher prices in London. The Wine Overseas Marketing Board's present fixed minimum price is 3s. Td. a gallon, less prescribed quantity discounts, while South African wine realizes approximately from 4s. to 4s. 3d. a gallon. Furthermore, there are good grounds for believing that some Australian makers are selling at a figure below the board's minimum price. There is no doubt that the present rate of bounty assists in this undesirable practice. The Government, in the legitimate interests of the industry, has decided to correct the position by a reduction of the existing bounty. Such action will at least make price-cutting more difficult, and will probably result in the Wine Overseas Marketing Board, without loss of trade, being able to increase its minimum price for wine to a figure more in keeping with its value. Such stabilization would enhance the prestige of Australian wines on the United Kingdom market. Moreover, a reduction of the rate of bounty will allow for considerable expansion of the export trade without any additional burden being placed on the finances of the Commonwealth or the industry. The proposed act is to operate for five years. There is The every prospect of development of the export trade during that period, particularly as the United States of America is now open to Australian wines. Vnluu. The Federal Viticultural Council has expressed the view that the rate of bounty should be stabilized at not less than Is. a gallon. The present rate is Is. 4.8d. a gallon. The Government, however, realizes that a heavy reduction, effected* would considerably disturb and would probably result in loss O of business while sellers and buyers were adjusting contracts and prices. It is, therefore, proposed to make the reductions by gradual stages, so as to cause a minithe mum of disturbance of the trade. Reduction of the bounty in this manner will also tend to discourage exporters to rush large overseas before February, 1935, in orderto take advantage of the higher rate of lsonnty under the existing act. Simitar ajjtion in 1927 did serious harm The original bounty act passed in 1924 had two main purposes-(o ) to protect the interests of growers by the fixation of minimum prices for grapes and fortifying spirit; (b) to encourage the exportation of wine. Since 1927 the Minister for Trade and Customs has fixed the prices to be paid for grapes and fortifying spirit each year. Up to 1933 wine-makers who operated in both the local and export markets, and who claimed bounty on wine exported, were called upon to pay such prices for all grapes and fortifying spirit purchased both for the domestic and export markets. This action was considered necessary in order to satisfy the Minister that reasonable prices had been paid for the grapes used in the production of the wine on which bounty was claimed. In April, 1933, a prominent winemaker advised the department that, during the 1933 vintage, he proposed to purchase grapes up to a certain date for use in the manufacture of wine for export under bounty conditions, and pay approved prices for such grapes, and after that date to purchase grapes for wine for the domestic market at prices mutually agreed upon by himself and the growers. This maker kept the two classes of wine separate, which rendered it impossible for the department to hold that fixed prices had not been paid in respect of grapes used in making wine that was exported under bounty. Other makers quickly followed suit. As the Commonwealth Government has no authority to control the prices paid for grapes used in the manufacture of wine for the domestic market, the new procedure adopted by wine-makers forced the department to recede from the f osition which it had previously taken up. t was obliged to acknowledge claims for bounty where approved prices were paid in respect of the wine exported, irrespective of the prices paid by the maker for grapes used in the manufacture of wine for the Australian market. This lack of power to enforce the protection hitherto afforded growers with respect to prices for grapes used in making wine for the domestic market has seriously impaired the efficacy of price fixation. It has, however, been suggested that as the State Governments have the power to fix prices within their respective States, action should be taken by the wine-producing States to ensure that wine-makers shall pay prices considered fair and reasonable by the Minister for Customs for all grapes purchased, and that the States should make the manufacture of wine illegal except under licence, a condition of which should be that prices considered fair and reasonable under the Wine Export Act be paid for all grapes purchased. If the price of grapes for the domestic market be left uncontrolled and the present Commonwealth / policy with respect to grapes for the export market be maintained, there will be a tendency on the part of some makers to average the prices paid for their grapes each year by reducing the price of their domestic requirements to a low level. This prospect is most unsatisfactory. It circumvents one of the principal objects of the Wine Export Bounty Act, by forcing growers to accept an uneconomic price for grapes, and gives to the wine-maker who buys grapes for the domestic market at low prices an unfair advantage over competitors who either pay the prices fixed by the Minister for all grapes, or who do not operate on the domestic market. In other words, those wine-makers who purchase grapes for the domestic market' at prices which they themselves determine, get more of the benefits of the act than they deserve. Wine-makers, generally speaking, do not desire to purchase grapes from growers at uneconomic prices, but the unfair and favoured position enjoyed by a few makers who have taken advantage of the letter of the law, will gradually force all makers who are interested in the loeal market to pay low prices in order to retain their domestic trade. Numerous conferences with a view to co-ordinating State and Commonwealth powers relating to the wine industry have been held between the Commonwealth and State Governments, but the desired result has not yet been achieved. South Australia has approved a draft bill. New South Wales has not yet expressed its concurrence, and the attitude of Victoria is uncertain; but it is believed that it will come into line with South Australia. Price fixation is a very contentious subject, but it is hoped that, at an early date, all the States concerned will fall into line and give the grower the necessary protection to ensure that he receives a reasonable price for all the grapes he produces. I emphasize that this is a State, and not a Commonwealth matter-, but the Commonwealth Government has gone a long way toward stabilizing the industry. To ensure that growers received a reasonable price for grapes, all claimants for bounty have, since 1927, been required to give an undertaking under the Bounty Act that they would pay fixed prices before bounty was paid to them. The time within which payment was to be made, however, was not fixed, and although most makers have honoured the undertakings within a reasonable time, some companies have not paid growers in full for several years. Provision is made in the bill for payment for grapes used in the production of the wine upon which bounty is paid by a system of quarterly instalments. In regard to fortifying spirit purchased by claimants for bounty, the bill provides that payment shall be made within six months from date of delivery. I considered that makers should pay growers within a reasonable time, and the terms of the bill in this respect should not embarrass wine-makers to any appreciable extent. As this bill provides for a system of deferred payments for grapes and fortifying spirit, there is the danger that some makers may be tempted, through a shortage of finance, to dispose of large quantities of wine at ""slashed"" prices, and consequently, at a later date, be unable to meet their obligations to grapegrowers. A provision has, therefore, been inserted in the bill to enable bounty to be withheld unless the Minister is satisfied that the price at which the wine was sold is sufficiently high to enable the wine-maker to meet his commitments to both grape-growers and suppliers of fortifying spirit. In the bill there is also specific vision for(a) The fixation of prices of grapes used in making wine exported under bounty. In the existing act the authority is only implied. (&) The clothing of the Minister with power to withhold bounty in cases where the claimant did not fully observe the Mr White. prescribed conditions in respect of a past transaction on which bounty had already been paid; and (c) The granting of authority to the Minister to insist that reasonable wages are paid and reasonable conditions of employment are observed by vignerons. Similar provision is already contained in the existing act, but it has been found by experience that a tightening up is needed, as, in South Australia, some vignerons are able to evade the requirements and are competing unfairly with the others.",23
62,Mr BLACKLOW,WI NE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"Immediatel y the industry is on an economic basis, others may be induced to rush into it, and wo may be faced with the problem of overproduction. In what way would it be dealt with?",27
63,Mr WHITE,WI NE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I went into that matter very carefully with the representatives of South Australia. As honourable members are aware, there was over-production of the doradillo grape for spirit. On the recommendation of the State Minister for Lands, a scheme was submitted to the t is Federal Government to make provision to enable doradillo-growers to graft their vines over to the dried-fruits varieties and reduce plantings.",27

65,Mr WHITE,WI NE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL,"I think the honourable member is under a misapprehension. If he would visit Berri and other vinegrowing districts in South Australia, he would realise that such action would be warranted. When the bill is in committee I shall discuss with honourable members the problem of over-production. It is not the desire of the Government to make the industry so attractive as to encourage over-production. In addition to the bounty, the Government has rendered valuable assistance to pro- the wine industry in other directions. The excise duty on fortifying spirit has been reduced from 10s. and l is . a gallon to a flat rate of 6s. 6d. a gallon. Another valuable concession granted to wine-makers is the provision for the manufacture of wine in bond. Prior to 1927, wine-makers were required to pay excise duty on fortifying spirit when it was added to the wine. If the wine were subsequently exported, a drawback of duty was paid. In that, year, owing the large expansion in the export trade in fortified wine, and to the general finaning cial stringency, wine-makers were pertries mitted to manufacture wine in bond both for export and home consumption. to Under this provision, wine-makers are not required to pay duty on fortifying spirit used until the wine is actually livered for home consumption. If it exported, no duty is payable. Makers are which happened thus saved a great deal of worry and Obviously, expense in interest payments to find large sum3 for the payment of excise duty in respect of wine which may be stored for long periods pending delivery for home consumption or export. This cession has created many administraAgain, tive difficulties, but recently the tions governing the procedure have been improved, and provision has been made to allow wine-makers to make a deduction of 2£ per cent, from the excise on fortifymerely ing spirit added to wine in bond, to cover losses due to evaporation and cellar operations. I have dealt with the essential features of the bill. Necessarily, many other points may require explanation when the measure is in committee. Those honour and able members representing States that are interested in the wine industry will, I am sure, appreciate the value of the bill, and agree that during the last years, the Government has done a great deal to stabilize the industry.

66,Mr LATHAM,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"Kooyong- A ttorneying General and Minister for External Britain Affairs) [2.15] - I lay on the tableAustralian Eastern Mission-Repor t Eight Honourable J. G. Latham, Loader the Mission. and move That the paper be printed. I submit to the House this report, which I have presented to the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons). This Mission was a novel enterprise, certainly without precedent the in the case of a British dominion, and to almost without precedent in any other country. We have learned, or are learnin Australia, that the various counof the world are inter-dependent, and that it is impossible for any one country ignore the rest of the world. The issues of war and peace possibly may be affected by some of the things that are done in deAustralia, but it is more than probable is that war may be caused by something outside Australia. therefore, it is important from this, the most vital point of view, that every effort should be made by Australia, so far as it is in a position to affect these issues, to bring about good and friendly conrelations with the rest of the world. the economic life of all modern condideveloped communities depends very largely upon trade with other peoples. Trade between the Commonwealth and other parts of the world does not depend or solely upon what we may do, say, or think in Australia, but is also affected fundamentally and obviously by what occurs in other parts of the world. It has been the policy of this Government to endeavour to develop and to improve good relations between Australia other parts of the world. There has always been a political liaison, which we regard as permanent, between Australia and the rest of the Empire, and there has two recently been established, by means of the Ottawa agreements, a much closer economic liaison between Great Britain and Australia. This, the first step upon a new pathway, has naturally been attended by difficulties, and there have been obstacles in the way, but the present trend of development in the world appears to indicate that, inevitably, agreements of this kind will become more and more the ordinary method of deal with the flow of trade. With Great our relations are now closer than they have ever been, and a more urgent of the effort is being made to maintain and of extend trade between Australia and the other parts of the Empire. In Great Britain we are represented by a highly capable High Commissioner, and we already have the best means of obtaining ready, prompt and accurate information, from the Governments of Great Britain and the other parts of the Empire and of conveying similar information to them in turn. This Government has also taken a further step in attempting to develop better relations between Australia and New Zealand. It is unnecessary to explore the past, but any honourable member who has been interested in the matter will, I am sure, agree that the relations between the peoples, as well as the governments of Australia and New Zealand, have not, within recent years, been such as could be contemplated with complete satisfaction. New Zealand is the nearest British dominion to Australia, and we should work in the most intimate cooperation with her. It is hoped that the appointment of a trade representative of Australia in the sister dominion will help to remove many misapprehensions concerning Australia and Australia's policy, and will also lead to the development of trading and commercial relations between the two countries. Our next nearest neighbours, if one may use the phrase, are to be found in those countries which make up what is known as the Ear East. I am glad that we are essentially a European community, and are not confronted with the problems that arise from mixed races in other parts of the world. ""We have adopted European phrases and the ideas that correspond to them. From our childhood we have been accustomed to read, think, and speak of the "" Far East"". It is the Far East to Europe, to the old centres of Civilization, but we must realise that it is the ""Near East"" to Australia. We are apt to"" think of the world as old, aged and worn. That may be. But the 0 greater chance is that we are only in the beginning of human history today. We have to look forward, not merely to next year and the year after, but also, I hope, to many centuries of a happy and prosperous civilization in this continent. I inevitable that the relations between Australia and the Near East will become closer and more intimate as the years pass. Therefore, it is important that we should endeavour to develop and improve our relations with our near neighbours, whose fortunes are so important to „us, not only in economic matters, but also Mr Latham. in relation to the vital issues of peace and war. It is in the highest degree improbable that anything which we do will lead to war in the East; but if war takes place there on a major scale, it is bound to affect Australia profoundly, whether or not the Commonwealth is actually engaged in that conflict. The whole of our interests, therefore, lie in doing everything in our power to prevent the risk of war in the East from becoming a pulsing reality. Apart from the issues of war and peace, it is obvious that our economic destiny, in which is wrapped up the standard of living of our people, is already largely determined and may be determined even more largely in the future by the volume of trade we do with the countries of the East. The world today is passing through very difficult times. I sometimes think that we are suffering from two classes of our citizens, the engineers on the one hand and the economists on the other. The engineers have developed the mechanical and other resources of science to a degree which apparently is far in advance of our social organization. We find that we are unable socially to measure up to the standards they have set up by means of new machinery, new methods and the like, which throw out of work perhaps millions for whom the social organization has so far been unable satisfactorily to provide. But we also have the economists abroad. Every country has its economists who, I .think, sometimes pull up the tree of trade by the roots to see whether f t is growing. I am reminded of what the position of mankind would be if , before we could breathe, we had to work out the functions of our respiratory organs. In the world today tremendous emphasis is laid upon economic questions. That is natural. If we die by war, we live by trade. But t is all countries are aiming at much the same objective; they desire to achieve a favourable balance of trade-to export more than they import. It is obviously impossible for all countries to attain that as a world objective, because the imports of. one country are necessarily the exports of another. It appeared to . the Government that the economic motive was becoming go dominant in the world that it threatened to overcome and overwhelm the other motives of mankind. In our human relations, we fortunately are able to be friends and live on terms of amity with people whether or not they employ or trade with us. If a"" human being were to say that he would be on friendly terms only with those who employed him or bought his goods, then human society would inevitably dissolve and disappear and we should relapse into barbarism. Unfortunately there is a tendency in the international sphere to adopt this prin ciple: to say or to assume that it is impossible or at least very difficult to be friendly with another country unless that country buys from us more than we sell to it . If that other country adopts the same standard, friendship is impossible. We are able to depict by means of graphs the movements that take place in the volume of world trade. The tendency to act upon the belief that the curve of friendship should follow the curve of trade, is, the Government considers, one that will be f at al to the world if mirrored in the policies of the nations. I have been saying this in the East. Our trade balances with those countries vary, some being favourable and others unfavorable. Towards the end of our visit to Japan I gave a dinner to leading Japanese citizens and representatives Japanese interests. The speech which I delivered on that occasion appears in my report. I then saidTho world today is passing through very grave difficulties and in many countries it is a time of crisis. At such a time it is natural that each nation should be pre-occupied with its own interests. It is, therefore, perhaps of very special importance that we should not forget the human side of international relations. We speak of the powers of the world, and we divide them into the great powers and the smaller powers. We in Australia want to look behind that entity which is called a Power to the human beings who compose the peoples of the world. This mission represents the idea and the most earnest desire that whatever the economic difficulties of the present time may be, it is all-important in the interests of humanity that we should not forget human relations. Economic circumstances will vary from year to year, perhaps from mouth to month, but it would be a sad tiling to be forced to believe that international friendship should increase or decrease with . the volume of trade particular countries. International relations in the last resort are really human relations, and whatever our economic difficulties may be, we should always strive to keep our human relations upon a basis of friendship and goodwill. If we can do this it will be much easier to solve some of our economic problems. That idea was the basis of the decision to send this mission to the East. The governments of the countries which I visited were, of course, full y informed of the nature and the objectives of the mission, because arrangements were made through the British Foreign Office for its despatch and reception. I found that the idea of the mission was soon understood. It was always understood ab initio by the governments concerned, and the idea behind the mission was quickly grasped by the peoples of the countries to which I travelled. There are some people who may be described as deficient in imagination. Some are incapable of realizing that it is possible for a human action - to be performed without an idea of immediate personal benefit; and, of course, from such quarters it is very easy to develop criticism of the ideal and objective of such a mission as this. I have referred to this attitude on the first page of my report, in which I sayAt the outset it was difficult for some to understand that any object would be served by sending a mission of friendship to our of neighbours. Hitherto, the general intercourse of Australia with these countries had been almost purely economic in character, and it required some effort of the imagination to understand that the psychological effect of such a mission might be very real and valuable. The western mind does not always realise that in the East there are many people who appreciate a compliment even more highly than a bargain, and who see a genuine significance in a sincere act of courtesy. As I have said, the idea of the mission was soon understood and grasped. At the same time, we found ourselves considerably concerned with matters affecting trade. But the attitude which I adopted with respect to trade questions-and all the nations which we visited were, as I have said in .the report, avid for increased trade-wa s that this mission was concerned with international relations generally. I was not the Minister dealing with trade, customs, or confmerce. I had nothing to do with them. Such matters were administered by other Ministers. I between was visiting these countries as the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs. At the same time, however, I was willing, indeed, to receive any information about trade in order Dhat it might Ibe considered by my colleagues. I have felt, on many occasions, that matters which are directly and and in their very nature apparently purely trading or commercial in character are noit altogether independent of friendpaying ship. We, as individuals, are more inclined to deal with people whom we know and like. Recently a number English University men, led by the disEmperor tinguished essayist and autfhor, Mr. Philip Guedalla, went to Argentina. They took the trip for the purpose, not of dealing with trade, but of making the leaders, commercial and acquaintance of the Argentine people. When they returned to Great Britain in the countries which I visited. last year, Mr Guedalla made a speech in which he said that many commercial matters were vitally affected by entirely non-commercial factors. I am sure we shall find that our trading relations are better with a country with which are friendly than if our relations a distant or hostile character. It is difficult for me to speak of the the course nature of the welcome which the mission sought received. It is almost impossible to bers a in exaggerate the warmth and cordiality of made; the welcome which was extended to us on the back them, everywhere. I have given in the report have includedof in merely the bare facts, setting out the report, some reportsan ofappendix names of the places which we visited, and were made with reference to the mission referring to the more important engagements of a puiblic kiud which we attended. Ibyhave It is impossible for written words to a broadcast convey an adequate impression of Dhe genuine pleasure which was shown, not another only by governments and persons repreevery senting governments, but also by the greatestoccasion people of the countries which we visited. returned from every Many of them thought, and very many tries said, that they regarded this visit as the real desire for friendship first recognition in this area of tihe of a common human interest in mankind. The effect of the appeal on the peoples was most obvious. We visited known the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Saigon in French Indo-China, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Nanking, Tientsin, Peiping, which was formerly Peking, and Canton. We also visited Japan and the Philippine Islands. The welcome that we received everywhere is a subject of which it is rather difficult for me to speak, because Mr Latham. I might be thought to be engaged, not only in exaggeration, but also in some form of self-advertisement. I assure honourable members that I realise fully that this remarkable welcome was not personal in character. It was a tribute and compliment to Australia in return for the compliment which Australia was to the peoples of these countries. Every possible facility was offered to me to meet everybody whom I could meet in of the time available. His Majesty the of Japan, the President of the Republic of China, the Governor General of the East Indies, with all of these I had long interviews, also with political industrial leaders, and the leaders of academic life One thing which interested me particularly, was to observe the reverence and respect for scholarship and learning in the higher that .circles of these communities. There were very many public functions we and many speeches were made. I freare of quently made five, six, sometimes seven, and up to ten speeches in of a day. I have not. to inflict upon honourable memrecord of all the speeches that I fact, there is no record of some of except notes written in pencil a menu or card; but 1 to the speeches which other persons, particularly in Japan. also included a copy of my notes of speech made in Japan, and speech which I made at a dinner to which I have already referred. On I was received with the cordiality and friendship, aud I one of these counquite satisfied that there was a very world and the British Empire. with Australia Australia, as Australia, is but little to these lands; it is not nearly well enough known. The attitude towards a country like this among many people in such countries as Japan and China, where civilization can be measured certainly by many centuries and perhaps by thousands of years, is rather difficult for us to realise. Civilizations have developed in these lands quite differently from our civilization, being very distinctive and containing some elements of which I think any country in the world would be proud, Australia is regarded as a very new, very recent, and very young country, practically without a history, but the approach made by this nation on this occasion brought it into the area of vision of these people in the most marked manner. I hardly like to use the expression in speaking of a diplomatic mission of this character, but I think that there is little doubt that Australia received a very good advertisement throughout the whole of the East. It is impossible for me to speak full y and in public upon international relations between the various countries which I visited, and the rest of the world. As honourable members are doubtless full y aware, a statement of opinions, or a statement of apprehensions, may sometimes help to give rise to the evils or dangers which it is desired to avoid; but I must admit that I found in many quarters a great deal of apprehension in the East by one country of another. I had the opportunity to discuss the position with the leaders of the nations concerned, and I satisfied that with better understanding some major difficulties would undoubtedly disappear. I found that after having seen the leaders of one country, and then conversed with the leaders of another country, I myself was able to remove some misunderstanding. I think that it was Francis Bacon who said, "" F u l l many a friendship is loosed through lack of converse."" Lack of converse and absence of contact mean failure of understanding, and failure of understanding often means enmity and ill will . If in this area there were a closer and real contact between, not only the peoples themselves, but also in one case between the different factions of the people, I am siire that some major difficulties would disappear. My own experience of the visit brought me in close contact with quite a number of misunderstandings which definitely were misunderstandings. I now propose to deal with some questions which particularly affect Australia. I found that frankness of speech when obviously sincere was never resented. Never, I am glad to say, had I to apologize for Australia. I was always able to put the Australian point of view frankly, and yet with a due recognition of the susceptibilities of those whom I was addressing. I frequently had to explain the relations existing between Australia and the British Empire; and as this is more or less a mystery even to some of ourselves, honourable members will understand that I had a rather difficult task. On page 26 of the report, I have in cluded notes of a broadcast speech which was made by me in English and forth with translated into Japanese and broadcast again. I shall not read the whole of the speech, but I desire to refer to one or two portions of it for the purpose of indicating the general attitude which I adopted. I began by saying, in the first paragraphThis is the first mission which the Government and the people of Australia have sent to any foreign country. Australia is a dominion of the British Empire; our loyalty and our affection are given to the people of our own race and I am sure that the people of Japan, loyal as they are to their own country, will understand that Australia owes her first duty to her own people, and after that to the am great British Empire of which she forms a part. A f t e r speaking of the relations of Australia and Japan, I continued The Australian Eastern Mission does not come to Japan in order to' buy or sell goods. This is not a visit of a trade delegation; it is a complimentary call for the purpose of demonstrating our goodwill and friendship. While this is so, t do not suggest for a moment that trade is unimportant. The nations of the world live by trade and we recognize the difficulties which exist in trade and commerce in the world today. The people of Japan in the first instance protect their own industries, and, after rightly conserving the interests of their own people, are prepared to enter into friendly commercial relations with other people. In the same way in Australia we protect our own industries. As a part of the British Empire we then naturally and properly consider the interests of the British Empire and its various parts. We are then prepared to make trade arrangements with the countries which trade generously with ourselves. I then mentioned that an effort was being made to negotiate a trade agreement between Australia and Japan, and expressed the hope that an agreement advantageous to both countries would be reached. I found that, when the matter was f r a n k ly stated, there was no tion whatever to the proposition that i the duty of Australia to look first after Australian interests, in the same that it is the duty of Japan to conmoney, sider, first, its own interests. It was unnecessary to think of adopting any other attitude, even had I dreamed of systems, doing so. I quote from that address for the purpose of indicating the general was attitude that I adopted. In the case of the Dutch East Indies, Netherlands no international questions arise. visit there was most helpful. There had been in the press aud elsewhere a certain amount of criticism of Australia's deterunder mination to establish a British overseas air service. That proposal has criticized by, and on behalf of, interests represented in the Royal Dutch Airways, the president of which flew from Holland to Batavia in order to interview me. I spoke to him as well as to the heads the Government and numbers of prohad minent people on the subject, and was able to explain to them Australia's policy in this matter in such a way most of the misunderstanding that existed has been removed. Those gentleerroneous men quickly recognized, when it was put to them, that Australia is an air-minded nation, with some of the finest flying men in the world, and is entitled to develop its flying services as every other country is entitled to do. I was able to remove, national relations. I think entirely, the suspicion that been entertained with regard to the ciples upon which the establishment of British air service had been founded. In the Dutch East Indies, as elsewhere, I found that some people entertained strong views on the tariff, and that i many cases those, views were particularly ill-founded. I have referred to this matter on page 7 of the report, where i statedThe Netherlands East Indies In general shared the view which has been sedulously propagated in certain quarters that the tralian tariff is, as compared exceptionally high and there is a general belief that our tariff operates to the disadvantage of many of the products of the East Indies. It was not necessary in the case of the lands East Indies to - point out that any parison of the Australian tariff with other tariffs should take into account not only methods of valuation of goods for tariff purposes Mr Latham. objeca point which is hardly understood in t is Australia, because, owing to the methods by which valuation is made in sterling, way and payment is made in Australian a duty of 50 per cent, in Australia is equal to a 40 per cent, duty elsewherebut also prohibitions, embargoes, licence exchange and other restrictions. In the case of the Netherlands East Indies it sufficient to explain that an analysis of the Netherlands East Iridics import trade into Australia showed that 35 per cent, of the products imported into Australia from the East Indies was admitted free of The duty (other than primage duty) and that C2 per cent, of the import trade was admitted at the same tariff rates as those operating the British preferential tariff. That accounts for 97 per cent, of Ausbeen tralia's import trade from the Netherlands East. Indies. It was also explained to the Government officials that, in regard to some of their most important items, the Australian tariff policy towards of the Netherlands East Indies products been one of marked consideration. That has been the case irrespective of the Government in power in Australia. The that I believe paragraph continues. These interviews did much to dispel ideas and the result was that it was frankly - recognized that the Australian tariff treated the trade from the East Indies quite reasonably. I found other statements concerning tariff matters which tended to affect interFor example, a had friendly article in a leading Japanese prinnewspaper stated that the Australian a tariff conspicuously discriminated against Japanese goods. I was able, to point out that Australia had a two-column tariff, the first, relating to trade with the British Empire, and the second to trade with forn eign countries. I explained that, so far, Australia had entered into trade agreements only with Canada and New Zeat is land, and that, therefore, Japan was on the same footing as other countries outside the British Empire. I made it clear that there was no discrimination, much Ausless conspicuous discrimination, against. with other tariffs, Japanese goods. I also found that it had been reported Netheri n Japan that the Commonwealth Bank comAct prohibited any foreign bank from operating in Australia. I told the people of Japan that the - Commonwealth Bank Act contained no such provision, and that, in fact, the Yokohama Specie Bank, as well as French and other banks, had operated in Australia for many years. I also came across other examples remarkable misunderstanding. The first paragraph on page 22 of the report readsIn another article attention was called the "" fact"" that Australia was fortifying coastline with 10-in. guns. Surprise was expressed that Australia was incurring enormous expenditure and that Australia thought it necessary to incur it. The statement was quite inaccurate. It was made, without foundation, in some Australian newspeople papers last year. Like many other misto statements it was duly exported. I suppose authoritative that it has still a long life before it. 1 do not know of any country which has 16-in. guns in its coastal defences, tatives although some countries have 15-in. guns. If we think proper, we are entitled so defend our coastline, but the fact remains that we are not doing it . By the means stated I found that most of the misunderstandings about Australia were due to the publication abroad of statements made in this country-state - follows:ments so misunderstood that their i m portance was magnified and used against Australia. In these countries, there is one to correct mis-statements of this also character. The British representatives be are most helpful, but, of course, they have no precise knowledge which enables them with to set these and other more serious misin statements right. Isincerely hope that before long, official representatives of Australia will be appointed to these countries. In my opinion,- we should make such apbusiness pointments in our own interests. I do not. suggest diplomatic representation i the East, although I shall say something on that subject before I conclude. On the subject of Trade Commissioners in East, I have almost completed a special report for the Minister for Commerce. The delegation received a great deal useful information confidentially from the representatives of Great Britain and of Canada, which dominion is well reprecountry. sented in the East. The desirability of appointing trade commissioners Eastern countries is almost beyond quesreport tion, although I know that there are interests opposed to their appointments. Enterprises which already have trading relations with Eastern countries naturally do not want any one else to get into the market. They object to the appointment of trade representatives who might induce of other firms to engage in the Eastern trade. In some cases, at least, that element is not absent from discussions regarding the appointment of trade repreto sentatives by Australia. I have referred her to this subject in one or two passages in such my report. In the first paragraph, on page 8 of the report, I stateI t was remarkable to see how anxious were to obtain information with respect Australia, and how the absence of any source of information handicapped not only Australian trade, but also prejudiced the general position of Australia. The British diplomatic and consular represenhave done most valuable work in helping Australian interests, but they have not the detailed knowledge which would enable to them to correct mis-statements and remove misapprehensions which often become part of the mental stock of a particular people. [Leave to continue given.} On page 16 of the report, another reference to the same subject reads as The diversified matters on which the mission was consulted in Hong Kong and no China clearly indicate the opportunity and the need for official representation. In many spheres, an official representative can of great help even to business houses and associations who have familiarized themselves the peculiar trading conditions obtaining China. Espeeally is this so in cases'where representations have to be made to government, semi-government or municipal officials. These officials have become accustomed to the representatives of all otlier countries either sponsoring, aiding, or supporting the business nationals of their own country. A executive can accomplish far more with the aid of his country's official representative than he could otherwise hope for. As n T have already said, however, I propose to deal with this subject in a separate report. In Japan, there was a direct request for the the appointment by the Commonwealth Government of an official trade representative to Japan. I am quite sure that we of should serve the interests of Australia well if we appointed a suitable representative to watch our trade interests in that in I have referred, in various places in my to complaints which we heard concerning certain Australian goods which had been exported. I am well aware that this is a tender subject. I have my own strong view about it. I know that in many quarters, whenever a complaint is made about Australian goods, an attitude of mixed concealment and resentment is adopted. It may be possible, in a newspaper discussion in Australia, to win an argument by resentment and objection, but that does not bring back the trade. I have been abroad in an official capacity on several occasions, and I have not been in any country to which Australian goods have been sent without hearing comparisons of our goods with the goods of other countries, to the disadvantage of Australia. I do not think that we should hide our heads in the sand when considering this subject. Generally speaking, only a small percentage of exporters are inefficient, careless, or worse.",28
67,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,Our . export regulations give them the opportunity to be so.,35
68,Mr LATHAM,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"I raise the question now very definitely. I am not at all sure that in the interests of Australia's reputation, prestige and commerce, some exporters-onl y a few-shoul d not be totally excluded from any further participation in our export trade. HONOBABLE MEMBERS - Hear , Hear!",35
69,Mr LATHAM,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"I admit that I felt ashamed, while I was in the Dutch East Indies, to hear that while flour was always marketed hy other countries in standard bags of, I think, 49 lb., some clever Australians- I do not know who . they were, and I abstained from finding out-ha d cut, and cut, and cut the bags until they contained 48 lb., 47 lb., 46 lb., and even less. It is true that the weight is marked on the bags in accordance with our regulations, but the people of the East reckon, when they buy a bag of flour, that they are buying a bag of the standard weight. They can read our figures just about as well as we can read theirs. What would their figures mean to us on. an article of commerce? Absolutely nothing! The Australians who engage in :these practices probably consider that they are clever. It is true that' trade may be obtained by these means for a time; but, it certainly cannot be held. I remind honourable members that I am making no irresponsible statements, but official declarations properly supported. I feel sure that the Minister for Commerce will make further investigations into this matter. 1 heard the same old stories with regard to Australian canned and tinned goods. We know in Australia that we can produce the best, the purest and the finest food in the world. Why then is a small percentage of people who may think that their standard is good enough, to he allowed to persist in selling goods which customers overseas regard as inferior compared with the competitive goods of other countries? It was an amazing thing to me to find that the United States of America holds almost a trade monopoly in canned and tinned goods in certain large areas in the East. There is no reason at all why we should not be competing fully with the United States of America, more particularly in recent years when that country has been in trading difficulties on account of the gold standard. I have given figures in my report which show that our exports to China of canned fruits were valued at only £228 in 1932-33. Whenever any one ventures to say anything on the points that I am now discussing, with the object of improving the standard of Australian products, there is an immediate chorus of protest, and it is said that the mere mention of the subject helps to ruin Australian trade. This is an entirely wrong attitude. These subjects should be dealt with on their merits and not for publicity purposes. In one large town which I visited the people will buy no more Australian goods of a particular kind on account of the misperformance of a certain contract. I understand that a protest appeared in a section of the press when a statement to this effect was published, and it was said that it would damage Australian trade. Australian trade has gone from that town until the things complained of have been rectified. At present the trade simply does not exist and it was most valuable. Take another thing that may be regarded as of small consequence-the placing of attractive labels on Australian goods.",35
70,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,It should be remembered that we get rubbish from Japan.,35
71,Mr LATHAM,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"I am considering the subject from the Australian point of view. I am not concerned at all at the moment about the interests of Japan. No doubt, Japan will look after her own interests in this connection. ""We should look after the interests of Australia. Certain goods have been labelled in Australia in a way that the people concerned regard as attractive; but it does not matter a snap of the fingers whether the producers of these goods regard the labels as attractive if the ultimate purchaser gards them as unattractive. In Japan we were shown samples of tins, the labels of which had come right off, with the result that no one knew what the tins contained. You cannot expect to sell a semi-rusted, uulabelled tin with a little paste sticking on the outside of it ! This, as I say, is a small matter, and probably only a small percentage of traders are sruilty of the carelessness and inefficiency which result in this kind of thing; but there is an adverse effect from it upon our whole trade. It is deplorable that we - should have sent only £228 worth of Australian canned fruits into China in 19323-1. in view of the fact that that country imports very large quantities of such eoods. I have spoken at some length on these irnde matters, although they were only indirectly associated with the objects the mission and I have referred cognate matters in the report. I hope, therefore, that honourable members will be itood enough to read the report, and renational member that what has been said in it represents either the facts, or what other people say are the facts. I shall deal with those two points. If the facts are I have set out in the report, obif viously the matter requires attention. - ii her people believe that they are the facts, the result in respect to our trade exactly the same as if they were the facts, and again, therefore, the matter should he carefully considered. I am satisfied that there is still a tremendous market in the East for Australian goods. The report includes a special redicated ference to wool. I have already briefly addressed the Wool-growers Council on this subject, and on certain other matters I shall make confidential a report which it is impossible to publish at the present time. I am satisfied that there is enormous and expanding market for questions wool in the East. The demand has scarcely begun in China, and the increase in its consumption in Japan is proceeding anaco. I have not time to refer to the many occasions on. which I was afforded an opportunity to meet leading people interested in commerce and industry; but one conspicuous illustration of the desire of people to meet the mission was afforded re- by a remarkable dinner given to it at Osaka by the Japan Woollen Manufacturers Association. The health of Australia and the mission was toasted, and, as Japan purchases huge quantities of our wool, I stated in reply, ""Sensible people in Australia do not expect anybody to buy our wool merely because it is Australian wool. They recognize that it will sell only on its merits of quality and competitive price, and satisfactory commercial conditions surrounding the sale."" That, I think, is what we have to recognize in regard to all commodities. In the long run we shall not obtain a permanent market for any commodity unless we are able to produce it efficiently and upon a satisfactory competitive basis. We may be helped from time to time by agreements- I believe we shall be-but , in the long run, it will be the merit of an article that will sell it, and not merely the adverof tising of it, or honing and praying that to other we shall be able to sell it. I come now to the subject of interrelations. People told me before I went to Japan that I should be questioned to death regarding Australia's immigration policy; hut that was not my as experience. I found that there was little, any, active feeling on that matter in If Japan. It is true that I was asked about it very pointedly at the time of my is first newspaper interview in Japan, at which I was questioned by nearly 40 reporters at once; but, when it became apparent that I was aware that the laws of Japan prohibited the immigration of Chinese and Korean labourers the questioners became less insistent. When I in the reasons for that prohibition under the laws of Japan, and also suggested that, if the doors of Australia were thrown wide open, the Japanese in Australia would have the same difficulties in competing with Chinese and Koreans in an Australia as in their own country the practically ceased. On the broad principle I experienced no difficulty at all. Japan believes substantially in holding its country for the Japanese. Australia's policy is "" Australia for the Australians and the British."" Nobody com? lained of that when it was directly and rankly stated. I found, however, considerable difficulty abroad owing to some of the remarkable propaganda that has been indulged in here from time to time about ""our great undeveloped potentialities."" People abroad believe that the whole of the unoccupied part of Australia, including, for example, the electorate of Kalgoorlie, with which we were recently dealing in debate, is a great fertile area that could support many millions of inhabitants, as the rice-fields of Japan and the wheat and rice fields of China support their teeming millions. There has been so much loose talk about our great and undeveloped potentialities, based on area, out regard to so obvious a requirement as rainfall, that a completely false idea, iudicial to the real interests of Australia, has been formed in other pants of the world. I consider that the development of Australia in the last 100 years has been little short of miraculous. We have practically doubled our population since federation. No other country, with the possible exception of New Zealand, can boast a similar record. The extension of the amenities of civilization has been most rapid and effective. In some parts of the Commonwealth we grow wheat on areas that have an average rainfall of not more than 10 inches a year. Could any other people do better ? We are raising sheep on land where it requires 15 acres, and sometimes more, to feed a sheep. Could anybody use our pastoral lands more effectively than we are using them ? Great harm has been done to Australia in the eyes of the world by the general and loose statements that we have great unoccupied and fertile areas that 'might support a large population. I had no hesitation in describing to the leaders in the countries which I visited some of the outback areas of Australia with which I am personally familiar. I was able to give first hand information concerning one station of 120,000 acres, which supports only 20,000 sheep. explained to them the character of the Mr Latham. country, and said that in vast areas of it agriculture is impossible. I told them that the sheep could live in some districts only because of the fact that artesian water was obtained at great expense, and that a large population could not possibly exist there. We shall be consulting our own interests if we speak of Australia less frequently in the style of a company prospectus. In these days, when other countries are hungry for land, if we allow a false idea to become current that we could readily absorb many millions more people, we shall be incurring an entirely unnecessary risk. I had an interesting discussion with the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Hirota, on many international subjects, and I mentioned particularly the Mandated Islands and the repeated reports that Japan is fortifying them: I told him that there was little wonder withthat other nations were apprehensive of Japan when it was so frequently reported prein Australia that Japan was taking such action. I also said that I knew that the islands were not being fortified. That information came to me as Minister for External Affairs, and was confirmed in Japan by the most direct evidence possible, not from Japanese, but from British sources. I asked bim whether he recognized that Japan was bound, by the terms of the mandate under which it accepted the islands, not to fortify them. He agreed that, obviously, that was the case. I asked him whether he did not also recognize that, as the terms of the mandate were the source of the title of Japan, those obligations were equally binding whether Japan was a member of the League of Nations or not. He agreed with that, and went on to say that Japan had made a specific agreement with the United States of America not to fortify the Mandated Islands. I asked him if he would help to alleviate suspicions that sometimes arose, particularly in this part of the world, by making a public statement to that effect, and substantially a statement of that kind was made, evidently on the authority of the Japanese Foreign Office, because it did not come from me. I have included in Appendix I A of my report a newspaper account of a statement by me, in which I referred particularly to the matter of the fortificageneral tion of these islands. I further suggested to Mr Hirota that it would be a very good and sound thing to do if he were to announce that Japan would also recognize the obligation to report annually to the League of Nations on the administration of the islands, whether it was or was not a member of the League, and I hope that some satisfactory assurance will result from that suggestion. Another matter mentioned in the report is the diplomatic representation of Australia in Japan and of Japan in Australia. Upon that subject. I had a frank conversation with Mr Hirota, which is summarized on page 24 of the report. 1 represented to him, first, that vevy few diplomatic matters arise between Australia and foreign countries- I may add, the fewer they are, the better. ""Happy is the country that has no history"" is a well-known saying. To-day, I say, the less diplomacy a country has the better are its chances of happiness. The less the Ministers for Foreign Affairs have to do the better for the world. Secondly, I told Mr Hirota that when any diplomatic matters arose we always had the ready and willing service of the British diplomatic officers, and in many cases their representations would have more weight than ours. I said, further, that the institution of diplomatic relations with Japan would raise a very big problem for us. In the case of Japan it would mean only the addition of another representative to the diplomatic corps, but in the case of Australia it would mean the establishment of a diplomatic branch of our Public Service, and if we sent a Minister or ambassador to Japan we should have to reconsider the nature of our representation in London, and whether we should send representatives to other capital cities, such as Paris, Washington, Rome and Nanking. The matter could not begin and end with the appointment of a diplomatic representative to Tokio. I also added that it was the intention of the Government to send a Trade Commissioner to Japan. After hearing me, Mr Hirota agreed that there was no need for diplomatic representation by either country in the other. Possibly there is room for difference of opinion on this subject, but I think that I stated the H2] view of Australians. We shall still see newspaper statements on the subject, because this is one of those matters upon it is possible to write when it is necessary to provide something with which to fill up a certain amount of space, but the real position is as I have stated. I desire particularly to say that the mission worked in the closest collaboration with the representatives of Great Britain. They helped us at every point, and I was very glad to receive from all of them an expression of thanks for the visit of the mission, and a statement that it had increased British reputation and prestige in the East. I want also to thank the staff which accompanied me. They were always willing, although the work was continuous and exacting. Every member of the mission felt the stress severely. Often we had only a few hours' sleep, because interviews had to be arranged, functions attended, and correspondence kept up to date. We travelled at a rapid pace; it is estimated that we covered about 17,000 miles in three months, an average of 190 miles a day. We made brief stays in some places, but in no place for longer than three days. The strain of travelling at that pace; of arranging interviews-ofte n as many as a dozen or twenty a day for the discussion of important matters, sometimes through an interpreter-of endeavouring to avoid or correct misunderstandings; of making speeches over and over again, and trying to say something that was worthwhile on each occasion; and of maintaining all the time the Australian point of view in relation to various matters, was felt severely by me and those associated with me. The mission made many friends for Australia, and many personal friends, and I do not think that we made one enemy. We were always asked to stay longer wherever we went, and were always asked to come back again; and that is far better than outstaying one's welcome anywhere. As I have said, the task of this mission was unique in our history at least. It was a difficult and delicate task, and it was a great honour and responsibility, I felt, to have the opportunity of serving Australia in this way. I have special satisfaction in the knowledge that the mission has not only helped Australia, but has also helped Great B r it a in and the Empire. I appreciate very greatly, indeed, the statement of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons, who saidThe British Government has been kept fully informed of the progress of Mr Latham's mission. I feel sure that the House will join me in congratulating Mr Latham on the success of his journey which has been of the greatest value to Australia and the British Commonwealth of Nations in promoting good relations with the countries of the Far East. Australia does not want war anywhere. Peace, and prosperity in the Far East are clearly in our interests as they are in the interests of the whole world. I shall not. much longer be in this Parliament, and I shall leave it with great reluctance and real regret. I sought entry into Parliament, not only because of my interest as an Australian in Australia, but. because of my interest as a human being in the general welfare of humanity, and in the hope that I might be able to do something that would be of value to Australia and, through Australia, to „_e world as a whole. I shall bo more than satisfied if , at. the end of my political career, I have been able to make any contribution, however small, to the establishment of those good and friendly relations between the peoples of the world upon which the maintenance of peace is so plainly dependent.

72,Mr BLACKLOW,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"Franklin) [3.29] I desire to bring under the notice of the Government a subject which has been before this Parliament, at intervals during the last fifteen or twenty years, and it is timo something was done about it . I refer to the proposal for the removal of the Sandy Bay rifle range. This House has, on previous occasions, heard the details of how this range in what is practically the centre of Hobari is holding up the development of the city, and endangering the lives of people living in the vicinity. Since 1 brought this matter before the House some time ago certain negotiations have been conducted. I am indebted to the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr . Francis) for the interest he has taken in this matter. The Hobart City Council appointed a committee to deal with the matter, and when the Assistant Minister visited Hobart he placed the whole position before the council in a business like way. From that time reasonable progress was made, but only up to a certain point. On numerous occasions the Ministers have said that if it were possible to purchase a suitable site convenient to the City of Hobart, the Government would not hesitate to make the necessary transfer, and, after a most caref u l investigation, a site was selected at Glenorchy, which is as close to the centre of population in - Hobart as is the present range at Sandy Bay. Hobart City Council entered into negotiations for the purchase of this site and has made the necessary inquiries with respect to road accommodation and transport, both of which are quite satisPAPERS. factory. For the information of honourable members. I quote the following paragraph from a letter sent by the city council to the Minister on the 25th A p r i l last :The area of the present Sandy Bay range is approximately 250 acres, whilst the area at Glenorchy, which you wish my council to acquire, is approximately 1,138 acres. It appears to my committee that we should not be required to pay for an area over four times greater than the present range. It realizes, however, that the configuration of the new site may necessitate a larger area, and that reasonable provision must be made for development, and is therefore prepared to acquire H considerably greater area than the present range. I am sending by the same post a large scale plan showing the area stipulated in your letter, and also that which my committee is prepared to recommend the council to acquire. This latter area is approximately 681 acres or two and three-quarters the size of the present range. This leaves a balance of 457 acres, which it is considered the Commonwealth should pay for if it desires to acquire it. For the purpose of graphic comparison, the outline of the present Sandy Bay range has been superimposed on the plan. The plan sent to the Minister shows clearly the area which the Hobart City Council is willing to acquire. Provision appears to have been made for the safety of those living in the vicinity, and if the Government will accept the adequate area suggested by the City Council, the council is prepared to carry out its part of the undertaking without delay. In order to test the suitability of the Glenorchy site, particularly whether the noise would disturb any one living in the vicinity, the military authorities recently set up a machine gun and fired a number of rounds. Persons living near the proposed site would not be inconvenienced by the noise to the same extent as are those now living near the Sandy I3ay site. If the practices were necessary at Glenorchy to demonstrate the suitability of the site, the military authorities cannot justify the retention of the range at Sandy Bay owing to the danger from ricochetting bullets and disturbance caused by noise. The actipn of the Government in asking the City Council to purchase an area much larger than is actually required, has created the impression in the minds of the residents of Hobart that the Minister is insincere. I should like the honourable gentleman to state definitely what is actually proposed. I have an intimate knowledge of what is required and have no hesitation in saying that the Sandy Bay rifle range is obsolete; it does not even comply with existing musketry regulations. I cannot understand why the Hobart City Council should be asked to acquire an unnecessarily large area and at the same time be expected to share with the Commonwealth any profits which may accrue from the sale of the Sandy Bay site. The City Council of Melbourne or Sydney might, with equal justification, be asked to replace an obsolete torpedo boat. The Sandy Bay rifle range is part and parcel of the defence system of Australia. ""Why should the people of Hobart be called upon to shoulder the responsibility of providing an up-to-date site that is capable of development? This matter has been under consideration for fourteen or fifteen years, and the present conditions are an infliction on the people who live in that vicinity. I hope that the inatter will be cleared up immediately.",39
73,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"Moreton-Assistant Minister) [3.41] - I wish first to give an emphatic denial to the charge of in sincerity on the part of either the Minister or the department. This matter has engaged the attention of different Ministers for Defence for a considerable number of years, but little material progress was made until it was taken in hand by the present Government. There has been delay within recent years, the reason for which is obvious. To-day, however, I am happy to be able to say that satisfactory progress has been made with the negotiations that have been proceeding with the parties concerned. The Sandy Bay rifle range is situated in a portion of Sandy Bay, a suburb of Hobart, that has become thickly populated. At the time of its construction, many years ago, the population of Hobart was small. The department acted in accordance with the policy it always adopts, of anticipating development by obtaining areas necessary for rifle ranges and other defence purposes. Owing to the development of Hobart ana the continual agitation for the removal of the range, negotiations were opened with the city council, and the department undertook that if a suitable site of sufficient size, and within a reasonable distance of the city could be obtained, it would consider the shifting of the range from its present location. A definite proposition for the transfer of this range to a new site was not made until December, 1933, when I had the privilege of beingin Tasmania in the company of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Blacklow). At an earlier stage, certain proposals had been made by the Hobart Citv Council, and these were replied to in March, 1932. Several sites were considered from time to time, and it was finally suggested that the new range should be established at Glenorchy. The proposal was that upon the completion of the new range the Commonwealth would transfer the. Sandy Bay range to the other party to the contract, who, in turn, would transfer the Glenorchy site to the Commonwealth together with an amount of £12,000, being o the estimated difference between the cost of the old range-£27,000-and that of the new range-£15,000-and a proportion of the amount, to be fixed by negotiation after taking into consideration road requirements, survey fees, &c, that would be obtained from the sale of the property, less the £27,000 mentioned. It will be realized that the Commonwealth must be protected against any material loss if it is required to move from a wellequipped range; it cannot be expected to agree to a monetary loss in the exchange, or to forgo a proportion of the profit that might accrue from the rising value of the property. These were the basic principles that governed the negotiations. The soil at the Sandy Bay rifle range is comparatively soft. Immediately behind the butts the range is steep and thickly wooded, thus affording protection against the ricochetting of bullets. The position at Glenorchy is entirely different. It is country, thinly timbered, and a considerably larger area is required to make the range safe, because bullets ricochet in all directions on stony ground. The Commonwealth is asked to shift from Sandy Bay where it has a well-equipped range to another site, and the Government does not wish to be placed under a disadvantage. It selected the earlier site, which complies with its requirements, but it is willing to meet the Hobart City Council in every way if that body will provide an equivalent of the Sandy Bay range on an approved site. asks that the area, of the range to be taken over - be sufficient to prevent the ricochetting of bullets and to meet safety requirements under the existing regulations. If the council will comply with the conditions stipulated by the department and the site offered is approved upon inspection, the contract will be completed at the earliest possible date. It would be folly for the department to take over a range - that is. unsafe, and be ohliged to close shortly after it was opened until the additional ground necessary for safety was acquired. The negotiation.* havn proilr. Francis. ceeded in a most satisfactory manner, and I am confident that the Hobart City Council will realise the practicability of the Government's proposal, and the absolute necessity for ensuring safety before the range is transferred from its present site. I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the enthusiasm of the honourable member for Franklin, who at all times has been zealous in his advocacy of the trans* fer. He is thoroughly versed in rifle shooting, having been an international rifle shot, and in the Great War performed an invaluable service in raising the musketry efficiency of inexperienced men. During the war he had facilities which enabled him to esta/blish a rifle range in any part of France, Belgium and Egypt, in a limited time. I ask him to realise, however, that the establishment of a rifle range in a populous area in Australia is a totally different proposition from such a task in a foreign country under war conditions. I invite him to accept my assurance that every endeavour will be made to finalize this matter as stony soon as possible, provided the Hobart City Council will accept the conditions of transfer. So far, this body has tackled the - matter in a business-like way. If it will complete the negotiations in a similar spirit, I have not the slightest doubt that the new rifle range will be completed in the near future to the satisfaction of both parties.",40
74,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"Richmond) [3.50] I rise to protest emphatically against the adjournment of the House so early this afternoon and also against the proposal It to dissolve this Parliament prematurely. To-day we have had an example of the usual rush that takes place quite unnecessarily towards the end of a session. We have witnessed the spectacle of a Minister, on the motion for the adjournment, replying from typewritten notes to a speech affecting a matter which could more appropriately be dealt with during the discussion of the budget. Honourable members are being inconvenienced, and the country's business is being neglected, it merely because the Government is anxious to have an election months before the time at which it would ordinarily take place. T protest against this adjournment for that aud other reasons. This aftera noon, the Attorney-General (M Latham), who was the leader of the goodwill mission to the East, put before the House some excellent suggestions garding trade and general matters affectcablegram, ing our relations with Oriental countries. The right honourable gentleman has also announced that he does not intend to seek re-election. Therefore, when the new Parliament meets, it will not be able avail itself of the knowledge and perience which the Attorney-General gained during his visit to the East. admit that the honourable gentleman did place in September. excellent work while he was absent from these shores. As a matter of fact, I was in the East at the same time, and returned to Australia only a fortnight ago. The Commonwealth Parliament is apparently not to have the benefit of the knowledge ho acquired except so far as it is contained in the report which he has submitted to this House and in the confidential report which, it is stated, is to be submitted to Cabinet. This afternoon, important matters were raised in connection with that report, hut no opportunity will be given to discuss it during this session. If a change of government takes place, and the right honourable gentleman is not a member of the next Parliament, his valuable work in the East, and pense of the mission, will be wasted. There are many other matters of vital importance awaiting consideration. One is the wheat industry. We have not yet received the report of the royal sion which is inquiring into that industry, and nothing is likely to be done, by this Parliament, at any rate, towards its habilitation. In addition, the position of the dairying industry may be jeoparnot dized if an adverse vote is given when poll of the dairy-producers is taken on on the H t h October. I know that that is likely to happen, but, still, it is bility. The Government has given no This morning I explanation of its decision to face the electors several months before it is neceswhen sary to do so.",41
75,Mr LATHAM,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"An explanation was given in yesterday's newspapers. Mr R GREEN"" - Whil e at Singapore, early in June, T received from Australia cablegram containing, among other in r . formation, these words, ""Elections probably September."" On board the same steamer were quite a number of other reAustralians, and when I showed them the they were surprised aud hopelessly in the dark as to the reason for an early election. When the House rose last December, there was no mention of such a thing, and the members of Cabito net were supposed to be a happy family. exYet, some months before the House reassembled, a press statement appeared to I the effect that an election was to take",42
76,Mr GANDER,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,It was all guesswork.,42
77,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"In the light of subsequent events, the information must have been obtained from some reliable source. A few days ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) said that he proposed to tender certain advice to H is Excellency the Governor General, and he gave no reason for his contemplated action. I have wondered whether H is Excellency will accept that advice, or whether he was sounded by the Government beforehand.",42
78,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"Would not this, political propaganda be more appropriate the exon the election platform?",42
79,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"No . This House is now experiencing a pre-election rush. According to the press-and I have no doubt that this will be found to be just commisas true as the announcement made last May with respect to the next election-the budget will be introduced, but rehonorable members will have no opportunity to discuss it . In addition, we are to have an opportunity to discuss the the report of the royal commission the wheat . industry. Neither not have we any information as to whena possithe session is likely to terminate. asked the M in  the new rolls for the States for which the redistribution proposals are accepted would be ready and he informed me that after the proposals had been approved by both Houses-and they have not yet been before the Senate- a f u r ther eight weeks at least would elapse hpfnrp they oould bp printed. That means that the new rolls will not be available until the election is almost upon us. No reason has been given for the early dissolution of Parliament and a premature election in September. I shall not be satisfied for this Parliament to go into recess until several vital measures have been placed ou the statute-book. As an outcome of the Attorney-General's mission to the East trade agreements will probably be entered into and trade commissioners appointed. These matters should be considered without undue haste by Parliament. I understand that the temporary trade agreement entered into with Belgium has already expired, because the patience of Belgium has been exhausted.",42
80,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"That is not so. Mr B. GREEN - In order to gain a temporary political advantage, the Government seeks a dissolution of Parliament and disregards the interests of the community. It claims to have received from the people a mandate to do certain things. Some of those things it has not yet done, and it will have to answer to the people for its failure to do them. I protest against the Government's disregard of Parliament and the interests of the people.",43
81,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"Melbourne) [4.3] I again rise in defence of one of the best public servants I have ever met- Mr . Cerutty, the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth, whom I have known during my 45 years of political life. For many years he worked in association with thp late Mr Israel, one of the greatest of Australia's public servants, and I cannot conceive of any man who served such au apprenticeship ever laying himself open to any charge of "" having used his official position in the Government service with gross impropriety"". Yet, in the Melbourne Age of the 22nd June, the following report of the Royal Commission on Petrol was published :Counsel's addresses were continued yesterday before the royal commission on petrol nt the Arbitration Court. In the afternoon Mr Menzies, K . C , counsel for the Shell ? >any of Australia, urged that upon the credilility of that company's witnesses must the commission's finding as affecting his client be based. He protested against the commission having decided to allow Mr Alfred Frood to appear after counsel had put their case for the companies. In an attack upon the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth (Mr. Cerutty). Mr Menzies charged that officer with having used his official position in the Government service "" with gross impropriety "". On the one side we have Mr Cerutty, an honourable man, and on the other side a legion of legal luminaries, led by an Attorney-General who takes money from the oil combine to fight his country and its interests. Never before have I heard of an Australian Attorney-General who, while in receipt of a high salary from his country to defend its interests and its people, has accepted payment from a combine which is opposed to the interests of his country and its people. Mr Menzies' father and I were good friends in the Victorian Parliament, and it is with great regret that I feel impelled to criticise in this 'way the son. But when Mr Menzies, K . C , attacks a man like Mr Cerutty I would be failing in my duty if I did not rise to defend such a capable and honourable public servant. The legal luminaries present at the inquiry are entitled to examine and cross-examine witnesses, but the treatment of Messrs. Pollock, Frood and Cerutty by certain of them disgusted me. A friend of mine persuaded me to attend the inquiry. I say nothing against the commission, because the case is sub judice, but if its members had been angels from Heaven they could not have done other than they did. They were helpless before the attacks of these legal luminaries. Surely this wealthy oil combine could have found other able counsel to light its case without asking an Attorney-General to act against the interests of his country. Mr Menzies said that it afforded him no pleasure to criticize Mr. Cerutty, but that it was his duty to his client to do so. Who is his client ? Is Mr Menzies representing the State which pays him his salary as Attorney-General, or the oil combine which seeks to rob Australia ? The people of Australia believe that as Attorney-General, Mr Menzies has no right to accept dirty money Com- from a dirty combine. Mr Menzies spoke in strong terms against Messrs. Pollock, Frood and Cerutty. I am prepared to meet those three men at any time, either in this world or in the next, but I have no time for a man who accepts money from his country and also from his country's enemies.",43
82,Mr NELSON,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"Northern Territory) [4.11] -. L want to make another appeal on behalf of the miners in the Northern Territory, who ""have proved themselves worthy men, but who, so far, have not received one penny of assistance from Government. All the talk by Government supporters of what the Government trying to do for these men is so much air unless something is actually to help them. I only want the Commonwealth Government to do assistance what all the State Governments are doing for the unemployed for whom they are responsible. In Victoria the Governuntil ment, somp considerable time ago, estabassistance lished S!.ate batteries to give assistance to unemployed men who were prepared to go prospecting. The State authorities claim that no money expended by employment councils gives such a satisfactory return as that expended to assist miners, and they take the pride in showing the returns from the amounts allocated for this purpose unemployment funds for the past five years. Statistics show that the returns to prospectors through the State batteries have been £20,000 in excess of the total expenditure on mining since 1930. In 3 930 the gold yield in Victoria from sources, including State batteries, was treatment to the prospectors. 24,319 ounces, valued at £102,456. total of 2,S09 tons passed through the State batteries for a yield of 1,8S6 In that year, £4,189 was expended from State funds, apart from unemployment funds advanced to prospectors. In 1931, £41,4.14 was made available entirely from relief funds, and in that year the proWiluna duction increased by 39,520 ounces, giving an increased gold output for the year of £102,5S5. In 1932, £30,840 was granted for mining purposes, includI ing assistance to prospectors, and value of gold produced was £79,782 above that for the previous year. In_ 1933, £23,118 was expended from State funds exclusive of unemploya ment funds, and again the output at Wiluna. increased, this time by £78,304, as pared with the output of the previous year. During 1933, Victorian State batteries crushed 17,516 tons of stone. Surely these figures should indicate to the Commonwealth Government what can be done in this direction, and it should be eager to assist the large army of men who are prospecting on the proved fields in the Northern Territory, which have been favourably reported upon by its own geologist. Many this shows on these fields hold thousands of pounds worth of gold, but the prospectors is working on them have no means hot of treating the ore. Surely I am done making a modest request when I ask for £100,000 for batteries, water, and to prospectors in the Northern Territory. I urge the Government not to delay consideration of this matter after the election, for immediate is vital to the welfare of thousands of prospectors now working under great difficulty. The gold yield in Victoria during the first four months of this year was 23,590 ounces fine, valued at £159,461, which shows an increase of 3,628 ounces over the yield for corresponding period of last year. At present rate of production, Victoria from will have produced £376,927 more gold in 1934 than in 1930, but it is expected that the rate of production will be considerably higher towards the end of the year. In addition, the State Government will have the satisfaction of all knowing that it has given sympathetic QueensA land, in the first four months of the present year, increased its gold outounces. put by £33,828 above the yield for the corresponding period of last year. We all know the immense improvement that has taken place in the mining industry in Western Australia. In April, the batteries treated 40,012 tons at a treatment cost of 19s. Id. a ton. These figures showed a working surplus for that month of £52,286 in Australian currency. invite a comparison of these values the with those obtained from mines in the Northern Territory. The Golden Dyke, for example, has exposed about 250,000 tons of stone of an average value of £4 ton, as against a value of 35s. a ton The auriferous areas of comthe Northern Territory are not speculative shows, for they bave been proved by the miners without any assistance from the Government-withou t the help of even a pound of flour for sustenance. Yet honourable members of the Government have spoken boastingly of the assistance they have given to these men. At Tennant's Creek, thousands of tons of stone which averages from 4 oz. to 10 oz. of 22-carat gold a ton is lying at grass. I have not exaggerated the value of the stone from that locality for much of it has been treated in South Australia. Because of the lack of sympathy on the part of this Government nothing under 4-oz. stone will pay the prospectors for treatment. This, surely, is a serious reflection upon the Government. Mr Whealan sent a parcel of 53 tons of stone to Peterborough in South Australia where it was treated by the South Australian Government at a cost of 5s. a ton. In other words, the South Australian Government subsidized the miner to this extent. The 53 tons yielded 300 oz. of 22 carat gold, and it is estimated that when the residual sand is treated it will yield another 1 oz. a ton. Unfortunately, it cost £950 to transport the 53 tons of stone to Peterborough. This is prohibitive, and prevents the exploitation of this very valuable auriferous field. Some parcels of ore from Tennant's Creek have yielded up to 10 oz. to the ton. When I was there last, Mr. Whealan had 1,000 tons of ore at grass which went up to 10 oz. to the ton. Other shows on the field are producing rapidly. Some of the returns which have been obtained areGreat Northern 7} . . .Rising Sun 54 . . Pinnacles fi (13 Whelaclora* 27 . . 50 - Cwt. Some dollied parcels have yielded up to 34 oz. Erom approximately 69 tons of stone, 491 oz. of gold has been obtained. Under existing conditions it costs £24 a ton for transport and treatment of ore from this field. Surely the Government cannot realise that the field is more than 80 miles in circumference, and that new discoveries are extending it every day! It is capable of employing thousands of men. There is, at present, a 2-head battery on the field, but it is lutely inadequate to cope with the work. Sir. Nelson. I wish that the Government would realise that here is, in real truth, a golden opportunity to do something to help the unemployed in a territory for which it is peculiarly responsible. I urge that batteries should be installed there. The cost of installation would be very quickly recouped to the Government. But what to me is more important is that work would be provided for men who are today on the verge of starvation, although there is almost untold wealth lying on the grass about them. How much better it would be for the Government to put these men in reproductive work than simply to pay them the dole! But the Government will not even pay the dole. It is the only government in the Commonwealth that denies sustenance and help to the unemployed for whom it is responsible. I appeal to the Government to display some faith in the report of its own geologist, and do something practical to exploit this field. If the prospectors were given, by way of an advance, a quarter of the estimated total value of the stone that they put through the battery, the interests of the general taxpayers would be preserved, and, at the same time, invaluable help would be rendered to these unfortunate miners. Any other government would jump at the opportunity to help these men to attain independence. If this work were put in hand, real wealth would be produced, for gold is the one commodity for which there is an unlimited market. I hope therefore, that the Government will not shirk its obligations and responsiTons. oz. bilities to these long-suffering people 34 who are willing to work if given the 300 materials they require.",44
83,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"Darling) [4.21] - I support the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) in urging the Government to inaugurate a policy of development for Commonwealth territories. While Victoria and Western Australia are carrying out extensive programmes to enable men to leave the ranks of the unemployed and prospect for gold, the Commonwealth Government has done little in that direction. Thou; sands of men in the mining towns have a ful l knowledge of mining, and they abso- are prepared to go out in search of the precious metal provided they have the necessary assistance. During the regime of the last Government, and at the request of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, I initiated a scheme for the granting of advances to prospectors to enable them to go off the dole and at the same time return something to the nation by increasing the production of gold. Some of the men took horses and camels, and other means were employed to reach the fields. Much of the development that has occurred since that time was based on the policy of the Scullin Government in this regard. There are opportunities in the Northern Territory for the employment of probably thousands of men, provided the Government will accept its responsibility and make water and batteries available as far as possible. The sum needed for this assistance would not be la'rge in comparison with the expenditure incurred by the Governments of Victoria, Western Australia, and Queensland in encouraging mining prospectors. The price of gold enables a prospector to make a fair living on a low-grade proposition, provided water and a battery are at hand; but it is unreasonable to expect miners to pay for the sinking of wells and the purchase of batteries, even on a cooperative basis. When I was a Minister of the Scullin Government, I began in a humble way to provide a small government battery, and it was my intention to install a unit of one or two stampers with the necessary tables and plates to enable men to work the plant on a cooperative basis. It would pay the Government to place such batteries in the hands of local committees in Central Australia, the Government to accept responsibility for purchasing and transporting them to the various "" shows "" that have been proved. I agree with the honourable member for the Northern Territory that thousands of men could be placed in lucrative employment in. the territories under the control of the Government. The Minister for the  ment put forward a suggestion to reduce the number of unemployed in the Federal Capital Territory, which is now about 750, by transporting about 150 of them to the East-West railway, for ballasting and re-sleepering work. Is that the solution offered by this Government after having grappled with the problem for two and a half years? Numbers of miners in the different States would be willing to work in Central Australia, and on the fields in the different States, if the necessary assistance were forthcoming; but, in regard to the Northern Territory, the Government has refused to recognize its responsibility.",45
84,Mr LATHAM,AUSTRALIAN EASTERN,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [4.26] - I shall see that the observations of honourable members concerning mining are brought under the notice of the Minister for the Interior  The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) addressed a.plea to the House which meant that I ought to remain a Minister continuously, because I have certain knowledge and experience. How long I am prepared to remain in public life is a matter that I myself must decide. I should not mind being a Minister always under some conditions, - but unfortunately I am not able to continue my political career. There are others who would be unwilling for me to be always in a position to advise the government of the day. That particular part of the honourable member's speech cannot be regarded with great seriousness, although I appreciate the personal compliment implied. The honourable member objected to all adjournments. He took exception to the adjournment now proposed, although, of course, it is the ordinary one at the end of the week. He really did not mean that we should go on sitting over Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. He himself adjourned as soon as he had spoken, and left other honourable members to carry on the business of the House. It was interesting to see that . his fellow-members of the Country party adjourned even as he began to speak. Then he objected to the adjournment until next Wednesday. It has already been said that the Cabinet desires an extra day to enable it to expedite the preparation of the budget. The honourable member also objected to all future adjournments; and that is a difficult objection to answer. He took exception to the more permanent adjournment which many of us, possibly, will experience as a result of a general election. Usually, the election is held in October, November, or December. On this occasion it is to - be held .in September, and this has become a capital crime in the eyes of the honourable member. But it is difficult to please everybody. Had - the Government proposed an election later, a cry would have gone up from the other side that it was frightened to face its masters, the people. It would have been said that the Government's mandate had been exhausted. If next year had been selected for the election, it would probably have been argued that never in the history of the Commonwealth had an eleotion. occurred in January, February, or March. And I think it would' have been true, too. Whatever the Government does, there are always some who will say that it is wrong. I could readily supply speeches at so much a line to any honourable member, first, to say that it is an outrage to hold the election in September, and, secondly, to say that it is an outrageous thing to have it at a later date. I do not think that honourable members will be much impressed with that part of the speech of the honourable member for Richmond. He went on to say that no reasons had been given for holding the election on the date decided upon. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) gave reasons. Kppeared in the press, hut the honourable member apparently has not seen them. There are many big and important matters to be dealt with promptly, and it is manifestly to the public benefit that they should be dealt with by a government which possesses a full mandate from the people. I hope that it will be this Government; otlier honourable members hope that it will be another government; hut whatever government is in power it is important that the matters I have referred to should be dealt with, not by a parliament in its dying hours, but. by one with full authority from the people. I was amused at the honourable member's remark that the Government was going to hold an election in defiance of the will of Parliament, and of the will of the people. If an individual were to act like that he would be certified by is' being obtained. Mr Latham. two doctors at once, and I ask the honourable member to believe that the Government is not submitting itself to the people because it thinks that the people do not wish it to do so, and are therefore determined to throw it out. It is doing so because it believes that the people of Australia, being highly intelligent, appreciate what the Government has done, and wish to reinstate it with renewed authority to carry on the important work which lies before it. It is for that reason that it has been decided to hold the elections in September. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.33 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers to questions, were circulated:INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",46
