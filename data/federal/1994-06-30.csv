2,Mr SIMMONS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the report of the committee entitled An island tiger: report an unofficial visit to Taiwan. Ordered that the report be printed.",11
3,Mr SIMMONS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I have great pleasure today in tabling the report of a recent visit to Taiwan undertaken by five members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The visit resulted from an invitation . from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Taipei,' for seven members to visit at the end of May. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) and the honourable member for Ryan .(Mr Moore) had to withdrllwfrom the visit at the last moment, so only five members actually travelled. I had the honour of leading the group during the visit. The report is entitled An island tiger. That reflects in many ways the progress that Taiwan or, as it prefers to be called, the Republic of China on Taiwan, has made over the last 40 years. Honourable members would be well aware of the history behind the forced relocation of the nationalist Kuomintang government under general, Chiang Kai Shek to the island of Taiwan in 1949. Since that time, Taiwan's fortune on the international stage has been somewhat, mixed. With more and more countries recognising the People's Republic of China as the sole government of China, today only some 28 countries recognise the government of Taiwan. Australia is not one of them. The visit to Taiwan ·was a marvellous opportunity for the members who were able to go to see the economic miracle that is Taiwan at first-hand. Taiwan, with a population of 21 million people, has undergone a striking. transformation over the last 40 years from a largely agrarian society to being one of the most significant economic forces certainly in the Asian region. Its importance for Australia is undoubted. Taiwan is Australia's seventh largest trading partner, with two-way trade now valued at more than $5 billion., There are increasing levels of investment between Australia and Taiwan, Report $A75 million in Taiwan and $A225 million in Australia. Jfaiwan is a significant market for a number of Australian exports. For example, it takes 19.4 per cent of all the iron of and, steel we export and 13.8 per cent of our aluminium. The visit, although unofficial, did allow the members of the committee to meet with very senior government, political and industry figures. Members took the opportunity to raise with the Taiwanese specific concerns we had about access to their markets for some of our agricultural produce in the context of Taiwan's desire to join the GATT. Other matters discussed included the question of United Nations membership for Taiwan, its future relationship with the People's Republic of ,China and, in Australia-Taiwan relations, is-ues such as improving educational and scientific links, tourism, business migration and enVironmental protection. , Since the lifting of martial law in 1987, opposition parties are now legal, and the country has had multiparty elections. The process of democratisation has not always been smooth, but the delegation was heartened by the goodwill on all sides to maintaining and nurturing the democratic system. A'$ parliamentarians, we were very pleased to have had the opportunity to meet with the vice-president of the legislative yuan, or parliament, for discussions. I for one would like to see such parliament to parliament contact maintained and strengthened. In conclusion, I thank the members who participated in the visit-the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon)-who each contributed in his own way to making the visit a success. I also acknowledge the valuable assistance of the committee secretary, Joanne Towner, who accompanied us on the visit ' On behalf of the delegation, I thank Mr FranciS Lee and Mr Samuel Chen of the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office' in Canberra for their assistance in facilitating visit. Mr Lee has since returned to Taipei. I know that members of the committee who had the opportunity to meet and have discussions with Mr Lee over a number of years would join me in wishing him wel1 in his new position within theTaiwan ministry of foreign affairs. I commend the report to tile House.",11
4,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I briefly want to comment on three aspects of the report entitled An island tiger: report of an unofficial visit to Taiwan. Firstly, as a delegation, we are most indebted to the government of Taiwan and to the members of the legislative yuan for making this parliamentary visit possible. A number of members have visited Taiwan before. However; as I uriderstand it, this was the first occasion on which an actual parliamentary delegation had gone there, albeit as a part of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. In the matter of our relationship with Taiwan, it is important that it be understood that this was an official delegation from the Australian parliament. It is particularly important that there be occasions for reciprocal visits. I am told that today a young group in the parliament is visiting from Taiwan. We welcome it. I' do not know where its members are in the building; I am told that they are in the parliament today. I think they call themselves YLD. They are very welcome. I trust that they receive the same hospitality as we received. Of the three things I want to say, the first is that it is very important in Australia' that people recognise the separate character and nature of Taiwan as a country. My col1eague the, honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) has mentioned the fact that, although not a member of the United Nations, Taiwan is a very important trading partner for Australia. Sadly, for many, given the significance of our relationship with China, the relationship with Taiwan tendS to be overshadowed. But Taiwan is an enormously important trading partner for Australia. We would do wel1 to recognise that, by working there, there are great opportunities commercial1y for trade from this country. I have little doubt, as the the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) will reveal from his associations with the Taiwanese living in his electorate"" that there are great reciprocal opportunities commercially and cultural1y, as 'a result of a ,proper emphasis on trade opportunities there. My one concern is that we seem' to be downplaying that 'relationship to too great a degree. Secondly, I am very pleased, to see the development of dem'ocracy within Taiwan. It is a very fragile flower. Too often in Australia we tend to forget the enormous significance of our traditional democratic practice. On the day we visited the legislative yuan, we had to go in by the back door because the opposition was demonstrating at the front door. I saw no reason for our doing so. In other wordS, if there is a demonstration, one ought to go there, hear what the people say and go through the front ,door. I fOl,lnd it quite repulsive that, with a demonstration at the front door, we were ,ushered around, the back. Because we were driven around, we had little alternative. I say to'the people in Taiwan that there is nothing to be afraid of in a democracy. I found it very regrettable that the members of the government, while they were saying how proud they, are that they have a democratic system of government, did not accept that a product of democracy is that, some day, governments will change. There seems to be a concept within the KMT, which is the ruling party, that democracy only means giving people an opportunity to say something against their policies, not seeing them as an alternative government. Democracy means that the people of a country have the opportunity to elect the government that they wish. I ,strongly' say to the people of Taiwan that they need to accept that there should' be freedom of speech,an opportunity to express alternative policy points of view arid an opportunity tQ. accept that, at some stage, there may be a change of government there. . In that re&pect, I think it is important that the people of Taiwan also move as rapidly as possible towardS becoming members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before the World Trade Organisation is established, hopefully on 1 January .1995. We had discussions on that aspect. n is referred to in the report. r think it is very important for the people of Taiwan to become members of GATT and the WTO before China. I press upon them the advantage to them of that. The report briefly mentions tile discussions I held on wool. The significance of wool is that Taiwan is the sixth most important purchaser of wool from Australia. China is the most important purchaser and many of the Chinese woollen mills are in fact owned by Taiwan. People do well to understand that close causal connection, not just in wool but in many other fieldS of commerce. Taiwan is a major investor in Chiqa and it influences many major decisions there. However; my real concern was with the withdrawal of Westpac from Taipei. I found it quite appalling that representatives of Westpac told us that, although the operation was viable and although it was the first major Australian banking· institution to have been established there, it is withdrawing from Taipei as it is from Seoul in Korea. The result will disadvantage the Australian image appallingly.The Westpac facility in Taipei is to go to a European institution. It is going at a time when we are trying to say that we are interested· in Australian-Asian relations. The perception of Westpac withdrawing, I think, is totally wrong and very much to our detriment. . . . We find in the statements attached to. our report thatWestpac is also withdrawing from thePT Westpac Panin Bank in Jakarta, which is another appalling decision. Westpac is a major Australian trading bank. I . am .very disappointed in the approach it is taking. This action will be. very much to the detriment of Australia and against the interests .of the shareholders of Westpac. n is based peculiarly on short-term financial decisions. It is the wrong decision-,. for the bank and for Australia-and I am appalled that Westpac has made it. To Joanne Towner, to the leader of the delegation, to the honourable member for Calare, and to my colleagues on the delegation, I extend my appreciation for the opportunity. .of being with them and seeing the enormous growth in and the changing face of Taiwan. I only hope that when 1 visit the country next time the environmental improvement will be high on its agenda. As we commented in our report, there is certainly a long way to go in that respect.",12
5,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES,",..by leave-I, like the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Cal are (Mr Simmons), had the pleasure of being on this delegation to Taiwan. I join with them in thanking the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canberra and the government of the Republic of China in Taiwan for their support and assistance in enabling us to participate in the delegation on this unofficial visit to their country. I wish to record our thanks also to Colin Heseltine, who is the senior representative of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei. I think all of the members of the delegation would agree with me that we received very good support, advice and assistance from Colin and all of the officers attached to this office. The office is very effective and is doing enormously good work for advancing Australia-Taiwan trade and relations. It deserves considerable congratulations on its outstanding achievements. It was very obvious to us in our discussions with both government ministers and senior business people in Taipei that the Australian . office has a very big impact in Taiwan, that it has established an excellent reputation for our country and is doing very good work in building trade and tourism between our two countries. I would also like to thank Joanne Towner, the secretary of our delegation. It is not very easy being secretary of a delegation of members of parliament. We have habits of wandering off and doing things that we are not supposed to· do and of defying the programs sometimes by wishing to go and see things that are not necessarily on the schedule. Joanne was a very good and effective secretary in keeping us on task and on target in our work, and I say thankyou to her, Mr Tim Fischer-But the beds are still hard in the Grand Hotel.",13
6,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES,"They are; I will admit that. The Grand Hotel is a very plush and luxurious building but, as the Leader of the National Party has indicated; the beds are a bit hard. There are three issues I would like to talk abOut arising from this visit. Firstly, like the right honourable member for New England, I want to comment on the development of democracy. Taiwan has come a considerable way in a short time in the development of democracy. We had the pleasure of having dinner with a number of people from the opposition party, the DPP. Most of the people we had dinner with were in prison five years ago and had been locked up because of their political beliefs and their opposition to the government. Yet they are now important, senior people of the legislative yuan and are taken quite seriously in the community and by the government as being a fairly strong opposition. I still think the ruling party, the KMT, has some way to go to appreciate what an opposition party is supposed to do. Like the right honourable member for New England, I do not think the KMT appreciates that an opposition is supposed to be an alternative government-not just a group of people who criticise the existing government but one that could take power. The DPP has certainly asserted itself very rapidly and is going to be a very positive force in the future development of democracy. All congratulations must go to the ruling party because I think it has done a great deal to reform Taiwan's political structures and to enable the growth of democracy. It still has a considerable way to go. The freeing of the media is an important part of Taiwan's development. The opportunity for the opposition parties to have a fair go in the media is an important principle which is yet to be achieved, but Taiwan is certainly heading in the right direction. and it should be encouraged and supported in that process. Secondly, I would like to,· talk about an issue that we have commented on in our report-=-environmental problems. Taipei certainly does have some considerable envi,. ronmental problems. We met with the Environmental Protection· Administration, which outlined to us a comprehensive program it has for tackling those problems. One can easily see that it has some huge difficulties. We mention in our report the two issues that became very obvious to us. The first is the quality of air in Taipei. There is considerable air pollution there. The second is the considerable water pollution· in Taipei. The Keelung River, which· is near the hotel we were staying at, suffers massive pollution and obviously needs some treatment. I think that gives Australian companies involved in environmental action and recovery measures some scope for getting in there and assisting the Taipei council and the Taiwan government. I would urge Australian companies to consider getting involved in the environmental issues that are facing Taiwan because there is certainly room for Australian technology and innovation to be utilised in helping Taiwan overcome those problems, Thirdly, Taiwan is now Australia's largest growing tourism market. There are very strong tourism links between. Taiwan and Australia which are being assisted by the increasing numbers of flights between Taiwan and Australia. This should continue to be encouraged. However, we have mentioned in our report a couple of problems that need to be rectified. Firstly, we need to look at the question of visas. At the moment there is a problem with , Taiwanese visitors who are transiting through Australia on their way to New Zealand or somewhere else. They require a visa just to land at the airport, even though they do not leave the airport. We as a delegation believe that that should be examined by the Australian immigration authorities. Secondly, the Australian Customs Service needs to make some corrections to its declaration form. It has introduced a customs form written in the Chinese characters that are prevalent· in the PRC but which· are not the written language of Chinese people from Taiwan, Singapore or Hong Kong. Therefore, they cannot read the fonn. We need to correct that, and we recommend that the Customs Service act fairly quickly to fix it up. I thank a number of businesspeople that we had an opportunity to meet in Taiwan. Taiwan investment in Australia is growing, and it is growing because· of our business migration program. I am honoured to represent almost 1,000 Taiwanese families who have moved into my electorate. I had the opportunity while I was in Taipei, as did the right honourwill able member for New England and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), to have dinner one evening with a number of business people who, although they are now residents of Australia, still have strongtr;tde and investment links with Taiwan and Australia. In particular, I thank Mr Wang and Mr Hung, who organised a dinner for us so we could meet 14 of those business people who are investing in Australia and developing Australian industry. Finally, I thank Francis Lee from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office for the organisation, and my colleagues for the pleasure we had on that trip. It was a great learning experience to be in Taiwan for that week. Corporations and Securities Committee",14
7,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I present the report of the committee entitled Report on the annual reports of the Australian Securities Commission, the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board and the Australian Accounting Standards Board1992-93. Ordered that the report be printed.",15
8,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I present a report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on the annual reports of the Australian Securities Commission and other bodies for 1992-93 pursuant to section 243 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. The committee has examined the annual reports for 1992-93 for each of the bodies established by the Australian Securities Commission Act. The committee also held a public hearing with the ASC on 20 April 1994, at which the committee sought further information on some of the matters mentioned in the ASC's annual report. I seek leave to table a copy of the Hansard of that public hearing. Leave granted.",15
9,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,"There are several important matters arising from the ASC annual report and the public hearing which I draw to the attention of the House. The first matter relates to abuse of the corporate fonn. The committee has received representations regarding abuse of the corporate fonn in the textile industry to the effect that businesses have been structured so that employees of the business have been employed by a company with limited assets, while assets of the business are held by a separate company. If these businesses cease, the company employing group employees has no assets with which to pay accumulated holiday pay, long service leave or redundancy payments, and is placed in liquidation. Principals of the business retain control of its assets in a separate company where they are not accessible to employees or creditors. Representations have been made to the committee that a New South Wales group of Report companies, the Gazal group, had structured its business in this way and that companies in the Gazal group. failed to pay holiday, long service leave and redundancy payments to employees. As well, according to press reports, the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union has initiated legal action against the directors of a Victorian company, Jeanswear Australia, which went into liquidation a week before Christmas 1993, with staff being told there was no money available for holiday pay, long service leave or other entitlements. The committee is extremely concerned that the corporate form, while continuing to provide a simple and effective business vehicle, can be deliberately abused so as to avoid obligations to employees and creditors. The committee will actively pursue the issue of abuse of the corporate fonn. The second matter relates to what has become known as the 'Big 16' investigations. During its public hearing with the ASC, committee reviewed progress on major 1980s corporate collapse matters, which came to known as the Big 16. As well, the committee heard in camera evidence from the ASC, which it does not intend. to publish, on progress of these investigations. The commitwith tee appreciates that these are extremely complex matters which predate the establisha:n ment of the ASC in 1991, but it has been Corporations Law. concerned about public perception that progress on these matters has been far too slow. The ASC provided the committee with information about the progress of these nent matters and outlined that in 13 of the 16 cases charges had now been laid and that further progress in these cases is dependent on court process. One other matter has been concluded, the ASC having determined that there were no grounds for civil or criminal action- Of the remaining two matters, one is the subject of civil action and a report to the minister and, in respect of the other, the ASC has concluded its investigations, although consideration of the matter has not been finalised. The committee is satisfied with theeviChairman· dence it has received from the ASC in respect of the progress of these major investigations. The committee supports the view of the ASC Chairman that the ASC should not in future report on these matters as a specific group. The third matter relates to relations between the ASC and the DPP. The new arrangements put in place as a result of the dispute between the ASC and the Director of Public ProsecuAttorney-General tions in 1992 have been working well and Corporations Law. there have been no disputes requiring formal resolution by the National Steering Committee on Corporate Wrongdoing. Similar assurances have been given directly to the committee both the Chairman of the ASCand the Direcshould tor of Public Prosecutions. Although there have been some media reports of friction serve between the two organisations, the committee is satisfied that the relationship between the two organisations is basically sound and both organisations are aware of the need ensure that good relations are maintained. The fourth matter relates to the limitation on - commencement of actions by the ASC. the The ASC Chairman commented earlier this year that section 1316 of the Corporations be Law may impede the prosecution of corporate crime, particularly in some complex matters. While this matter was· not mentioned in the the ASC annual report, the committee raised it the ASC Chairman during its public hearing in April. The committee views this as important issue for enforcement of the . There already exists a perception in the minds of many Australians that the law is incapable of dealing effectively with promicorporate criminals, that complex matters take too long to be investigated and come to trial, and that the cost of investigating and the pursuing these matters is excessive. That perception is not lessened by having major cases delayed by seemingly interminable reviews of the decision to prosecute. The committee has not conducted any fuller inquiry into this matter to date. Such an inquiry may bring to light evidence that section 1316 does serve a useful purpose. However, on the basis of discussions the committee has held on this matter with the of the ASC, it considers that the Attorney-General should give early consideration to the possible effect of section 1316 and its role. The committee would welcome a reference on this matter if such an inquiry would assist the parliament in forming a clearer understanding of the application of this section of the Corporations Law. The committee formally recommends that the review section 1316 of the The final matter that the committee wishes to draw to the attention of the parliament is the content of future ASC reports. The comby mittee considers that the ASC annual report be a vehicle not simply for recording statistics and major events, it should also as a vehicle for analysing and interpreting long-term developments affecting the ASC and the administration and enforcement of the that Corporations Law. Whilst the committee is to concerned that the ASC annual report provides a limited analysis of its role and activities, it is satisfied that information not covered in the annual report, on which the committee sought advice from the ASC, was readily and fully provided by the ASC to the committee during the April hearing. The committee is satisfied with the overall presentation, of the ASC annual report. However, it would like future reports to contain more information particularly on the analysis and interpretation of long:-term developments affecting the ASC and the administration and enforcement of the Corporations Law and matters which have affected the ASC's effectiveness or have hindered the ASC in pursuing its goals and objectives. The committee will continue to carefully scrutinise the activities, roles and functions of the ASC and other bodies set up to ensure Australian corporations and securities laws are effective and up to date and that reports under the ASC Act are informative and of maximum benefit to the parliament and the community. Committees Membership",15
10,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! I have received advice from the chief opposition whip that he has nominated Mr Jull to be a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in place of Mr Moore and Mr Wakelin .to be a member of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts in place of Mrs Moylan. Electoral Matters Committee",17
11,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the report of the committee entitled Financial reporting by political parties: interim report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election and matters related thereto, together with the minutes of proceedings and the evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",17
12,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Honourable members will be aware of the process whereby the committee in each parliament inquires into and reports ort the previous federal election. The committee will be handing down a comprehensive report in the spring sittings on the wide range of matters raised in connection with the 1993 federal election. There are, however, some particular issues which, in the view of the committee, require urgent attention and which are the subject of the short interim report which I have just tabled. These difficulties arise in connection with the return that political parties registered under the Electoral Act must m-ke to comply with the election funding and financial disclosure provisions of the act. This is· a fairly recent requirement, having been inserted into the Electoral"" Act by amending legislation in 1991 and which operated for the first time ithe financial year that ends today. The political parties have found compliance with the new requirements so burdensome and expensive that they have made urgent representations to the committee seeking some streamlining and simplification of the legislation as soon as possible. On the basis of the submissions made to it and evidence taken at public hearings, the committee is satisfied that the Electoral Act could be amended to reduce the burden of compliance without compromis'ing the principle that political parties should disclose the sources of their financial support. Under the current structure of the act, the parties have to bear ridiculous financial burdens in order to comply. The national secretary of the Labor Party estimated that it cost the national office of that party alone $30,000 to meet the compliance requirements. The committee was also told of the burden Report imposed on the ordinary membership of political parties. Small local branches have to maintain records detailing the cost of minor functions because they are liable to be spot audited. Spot auditing covers costs right down to tea and coffee and can even cover questions about the cost of Iced Vo Vos. This issue was raised by Mr Lynton Crosby, the Liberal Party representative who appeared before the committee. He said: For example, we received a letter from one branch detailing funds raised amounting to $1,108 in alltwo lots of money from whist nights and one from an election night function-and no amount exceeded $410. The functions were aU held at the homes of members with food provided by members and drinks on a BYO basis, andyet technically all the contributions that were made should be accounted for under this act. As the writer of one of the letters of complaint said, 'I hope we have not reached the stage where a casserole is regarded as a donation.' Mr Crosby went on to say: There is an expectation in a sense that political parties, and the volunteer members of them, are required to commit themselves to a standard of accountability which the Election Commission itself cannot achieve, when it comes. to the integrity of electoral rolls, for example. Consequently, the committee agrees with tre politi-al parties which gave evidence on the matter at recent hearings that it i- wrong to require a voluntary secretary of a branch of a political party, or of any voluntary organisation; to undergo the kind of auditing and questioning that is currently. the case. The amount of detail required to. be provided by branches of political parties seems out of all proportion to the mischief that the legislation was intended to prevent. I have already given examples of instances that have come to the attention of the DeputyPederal Director of the Liberal Party. In this report we propose amendments to the Electoral Act which will reduce the amount of detail required to be disclosed. This will be achieved by introducing a $500 threshold for disclosure of individual transactions to reduce the need to aggregate small amounts and by placing the burden of compliance on the state and federal agents of the parties rather than the members. . The substance of our final recommendation to the government, recommendation No.9, is to allow parties which are currently receiving funds through the electoral process to have their public funding paid directly to the federal or national offices via national agents. Political parties that are registered on a state basis can continue to receive public funding on that basis by notifying the AEC. This is a very important recommendation because it covers both those parties which are registered nationally and those parties and organisations which are registered at a state level. It does not change the status quo, but gives the either/or flexibility which is currently not in the act. If the government agrees with us, we would like it to act promptly. We would like any legislation that is introduced to be backdated and made effective from the beginning of the next financial year. We would also like, if possible, to achieve a situation where the parties can avoid beginning the process of collecting data from the branches for the next financial year. For this reason, we have proposed in the report that, if the government agrees with our proposals, it should as soon . as possible make a statement of intent on which the parties could rely in deciding the extent to which they need to comply with the existing requirements. I.commend the report to the House. NA Delegation to the Federal Republic of . Germany and the United Kingdom",17
13,Mr CLEARY,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the Federal Republic of Germany and the' United Kingdom, April 1994. The delegation comprised Senator the Hon. Michael Beahan, President of the Senate,. who was our leader; the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who was our deputy leader; Senator Alan Ferguson; Senator Dominic Foreman; and me. The visif by the delegation to Gennany was timely in providing an opportunity to observe and gain views on the tremendous changes which have happened in Gennany since the reunificatiOri of the former FRG and the former GDR. To stand where the wall had once been was a remarkable experience. It made us realise, in a sense, how silly the wall actually was. We were accorded the highest level of hosting and access, which ensured that the visit was a great success. During meetings in Berlin, Dresden, Weimar, Gotha, Erfurt and Bonn, we met a wide range of parliamentarians at the federal and state levels, as well as local government officials and business people. Our discussions - nabled us to meet all of the objectives of the visit to a high degree. We were able to wander through the once beautiful city of Dresden, which has been virtually remade. It was a terrible victim of the Second World War. In the report, the delegation has made a number of observations. It supports youth exchanges for parliamentary, political and company training programs, and the establishment of an Australian institute at the University of Potsdam. It supports fact-finding missions and international conferences to promote Australia as a base for business and investment. It also supports a non-permanent seat for Germany on the UN Security Council, which has now happened. The delegation report identifies a number of trade and investment opportunities in coal and wine exports. We seemed to talk about wine at every meeting we were at. The report also identifies opportunities for investment and technology transfer in the environmental clean-up of the eastern laender as well as opportunities for joint ventures and partnerships in diverse areas,· including rail, telecomEU. munications and other high-tech areas. The report assesses German interests in the Asia-Pacific region, and it notes Germany's desire to participate in APEC. The report also emphasises the advantages of using Australia as a base for trade an<- investment opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region. The report discusses a variety of matters related to the European Union, including Germany's program priorities when it assumes the presidency of the EU on 1 July. The delegation - s report compares the German and Australian experiences in parliamentary matters, including electronic voting, streamlining parliamentary processes, and comparing the Bundesrat and the Senate. The report also compares the German and Australian experi-nces in coping with unemployment, vocational training, the role of women, land ownership, Macedonia, multiculturalism, migration and refugee issues. The delegation's report mentions learning about the different levels of government in Germany, the work of political foundations, issues facing the reunited FRG-including issues confronting the newest states, privatisation of companies in the former East, economic development and environmental concerns, and foreign policy issues. The report also looks at changing German perceptions about contemporary Australia and, lastly, promoting contact between camel racing enthusiasts! In the United Kingdom, the pace and nature of the program were quite different. We had opportunities to meet a large number of parliamentary colleagues in a variety of informal settings to discuss a broad range of matters of mutual interest. Of special significance was the meeting with the ANZAC Parliamentary Group. A brief call on the Lord Chancellor and official functions hosted by the Minister of State at the. Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Scottish Office and the Speaker of the House of Commons were highlights.' The delegation appreciated the opportunity to explorean interest in urban renewal by visiting Glasgow and the Canary Wharf development in London. As well, we explored the UK's role in the We identified opportunities for trade and investment in the fields of aerospace and computer technology, wine, radiata pine door panels, ferries and catamarans. We promoted Australia as a base for trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. We compared the impact of GATT and the CAP and the UK/Australian committee systems. We discussed media matters at the BBC and News International, and proposals to consolidate the offices of the State Agents General in London. We tried to change perceptions about Australia to make people more aware of the contemporary situation. In London it still seems that people think of Australia as Neighbours, which we were really quite concerned about-at least I was. I turn to parliamentary matters. We also made observations about visiting delegations signing special guest books, the· selection of gifts and opening the floor of the chamber to the public during non-sitting weeks. A number of people contributed to the success of the delegation's visit. Thanks go to President Klaus Wedemeier, President of the Bundesrat, for according us such a high level of access and hosting arrangements; the Berlin State Chamber of. Deputies; the state parliaments of Saxony and Thuringia; and the Bundestag must also be thanked. In the UK, our thanks go to the Joint Presidents of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, UK branch; the Rt Hon. Lord Mackay of ClllShfem, Lord Chancellor; the Rt Hon. Betty Boothroyd MP, Speaker of the House of Commons; the UK. Branch of the CPA, in particular, Mr Jim Lester MP, Mr George Foulkes MP and Baroness Cherry Strange, who hosted us at her castle in Scotland; the Chairman of the ANZAC Parliamentary Group, the Rt Hon. Alf - orris AO QSO MP; and our other many friends and colleagues at Westminster. Staff of the Australian Embassy in Bonn and the Consulate-General in Berlin are to be commended for the excellent assistance provided to ensure that the program went smoothly and that· the delegation was well briefed, in particular, HE Mr John Bowan and Ms Margaret Adamson.

16,Mr MELHAM,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's advisory report on the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill J 994 and the International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by.· the committee. Ordered that the report be printed. Mr MELHAM'-by leave-I am pleased to present to the parliament the legal and constitutional affairs committee's advisory report on the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill 1994 and the International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994. The committee was asked on 7 June to consider the bills and prepare an advisory report. This is the second advisory in report on proposed legislation prepared by the committee. The purpose of the bills is to allow Australia to fulfil its obligations to the United Nations and to support the tribunal now being established in The Hague. The tribunal was established by resolution 827 of the Security Council of May 1993.. - a resolution which' expressed: ... grave alann at continuing reports of widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law occurring within the territory of the former Yugoslavia ... including reports of mass killings, massive organised and systematic detention and rape of women, and the continuance of the practice of 'ethnic cleansing' '"" .. All members of the United Nations are bound to give effect to resolution 827 and to its annexure. Although the tribunal· is being established in The Hague, it may sit in. any country where the requisite domestic legislawould tion is in place, including Australia. The bills enable Australia to support the tribunal in variety of ways-including the taking dence, the production of documents or other articles, search and seizure, giving evidence at hearings and assisting in investigations other countries where the tribunal is sitting. The bills also authorise the surrender of persons named in a warrant from the tribunal once certain safeguards are satisfied. The consequential amendments bill amends certain acts consequent upon the enactment of the main bill. In general, the committee found the bills to be well drafted. However, the committee has 21 recommendations. The recommendations are aimed at ensuring that persons apprehendGeneral's ed in Australia will not be surrendered to international tribunal unless it is established that there is no mistake of identity, that the matters listed in the warrant are within jurisdiction of the tribunal and that there no special circumstances which would make surrendering the person unlawful or cause great injustice. While the tribunal requires members to respond to requests for assistance without undue delay, no request can be responded to automatically. Due process can never be categorised as undue delay. The committee had the advantage ing comparable legislation from Sweden, the USA, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK. We are satisfied that, if the recommendaam tions in the advisory report are adopted the bills amended, our legislation will pare well with that of other countries, particuobligations larly in ensuring that mistakes are. not made and standards of justice are upheld. The committee was keen to ensure that the bills are effective in supporting the tribunal. The situation in the former Yugoslavia is a threat to peace and security. Bringing the perpetrators of war crimes to justice may discourage further outrages. It is incumbent on all UN members to move quickly to enact legislation to ensure that a request from the tribunal can be responded to. In tabling 6ur advisory report I would like to thank the members of the committee for their support, scholarship and good sense. I also like to thank the secretariat, Judy Middlebrook and Gemina Searle. In particular, a I would also like to thank Annette Willing, of eviwho was seconded from the Attorney General's Department to assist with our work on the bills. We have had to conduct the in inquiry and prepare this advisory report within three weeks. It imposes considerable strain on both committee members and staff. We appreciate the effort. Annette Willing, in particular, was a valuable contributor to the committee secretariat's work This is the second time that we have submitted an advisory report to the parliament with a time . constraint. The way that we have been able to do it is that there has been cooperation with all concerned, particularly the AttorneyDepartment. A 110 win gus to an second someone with specialist knowledge to provide an advisory report to the parliament has been of valuable assistance to this parliathe ment. We have had the benefit in both our are reports of qualified, intelligent, articulate officers from the Attorney-General's Department who have been of invaluable assistance. UN I thank each of them for their efforts. I commend the continuation of that partnership. I think we end up with better bills. This parliament ends up having better legislation which we can be well proud of in the international community, I commend the advisory of studyreport to the· House.",20
17,Mr WILLIAMS,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"by leave-I pleased to contribute on this subject. The and International War Crimes Tribunal Bill is comintended to enable Australia to fulfil its to the United Nations in relation to the establishment of a tribunal. A principal objective is to enable persons required by the tribunal to be surrendered to it for trial for alleged crimes committed in the former state of Yugoslavia since 1991. This bill. was referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs by the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch) for advisory report at my suggestion. I concur with the remarks made by the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), and suggest that the exercise has been entirely justified. A number of concerns regarding the bill were aired by witnesses and in written submissions. There is a summary of those issues in the report at paragraph 2.1.1. The tribunal is established to try persons accused of international legal crimes committed in the state of Yugoslavia since 1991. The tribunal itself has established procedures, the rules for which were not available at the time the bill was drafted. They have been taken into account by the committee. The committee has agreed that the proper place for trial of alleged offences is before tribunal, which sits principally at the Hague. Issues relevant to the guilt and innocence of persons accused of crimes against humanity should be aired only before the tribunal. The committee was, however,concerned to ensure that proper legal safeguards applied in the surrendering of persons subject to Australian jurisdiction to the tribunal for trial. The procedure that is contemplated under the bill has some similarity to extradition, but it is different in that it is not contemplated that there would be a preliminary hearing of any sort on substantive issues in Australia before the surrender of the person· accused. ' As drafted, the bill provided for an Australian response, in effect by the arrest in Australia of a person accused pursuant to a tribunal request. Under Security Council resolution 827, by which Australia is bound as a member of the United Nations, the surrender in effect was mandatory subject to no element of discretion. The bill in its present form provided for the Attorney-General to have a very limited discretion to refuse to surrender a person, that circumstance being limited to what is described as 'in exceptional circumstances'. The committee focused on this and. considered what had been done in other member states of the United Nations in response to the Security Council resolution. It became apparent in the course of the committee hearings that more detailed procedures were contemplated at other stages than were contemplated in Australia, and in most cases those procedures contemplated court hearings. The committee considers that the proper legal safeguards require the introduction of another step. To determine whether a person is eligible for surrender, it is proposed that on arrest a person be brought before a magistrate who must determine whether the person arrested is the person nominated in the warrant and, therefore, in the tribunal request and whether the person is accused of an offence which comes within the jurisdiction of the tribunal. This is consistent with what is occurring in other states and would not, in the committee's view, result in undue delay. Another matter closely considered by the the committee arises out of the consequential amendments bill. Under this bill, the operation of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act is to be excluded. The committee does not agree with that. It needs to be understood that judicial review under that act is a review by the Federal Court of the making of an administrative decision and the review is only on questions of law. It is not an appeal and factual issues are not canvassed directly. As a background to this, the constitution provides under section 75 (v) that prerogative writs can be brought to enable similar issues to be raised in relation to the decisions of Commonwealth officers. The Federal Court has similar jurisdiction under section 39B of the Judiciary Act. These provisions could not, at least in so far as they have a constitutional base, be excluded by legislation. So there would be the capacity for some sort of judicial review. The Attorney-General's Department opposed the application of the judicial review act on the basis that it would result in undue delay. However, it needs to be understood-and the committee emphasised it-that the judicial review is intended to simplify the procedures on judicial review, of which . section 75 (v) procedures are an example. In the. committee's view a delay could not be undueifit is pursuant to appropriate domestic legislation. Many other issues are canvassed in the report, which I join with the chairman· of the committee in commending to.the House. The House is, in my view, greatly assisted by.the processes that this bill has undergone. I join with the chairman in thanking those involved. This legislation will· be seen as a possible international model. I understand that the secretariat of the committee has already received requests from abroad for copies of the report in advance of its tabling. I commend the report to the House. I urge the government to consider closely and adopt the recommendations within the report;",21
18,Mr SINCLAIR,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"by leave-I wish only to supplement the remarks made by my colleagues the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the honourable member for . Banks .(Mr Melham), and the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). In so doing, I also commend the contribution made by the committee secretariat and the contribution of Annette Willing, who was seconded to the committee from the. Attorney-General's Department. Their work has been outstanding. Without doubt, the referral of this issue to the committee has yet again established a basis by which better legislation can be presented and deliberated upon by the parliament. I believe the only regret is that, in so many instances when legislation is preemptorily introduced into this place, there has been inadequate opportunity for parliamentary counsel to consider the nuances that they well might were the time available. It is therefore obligatory on the legislature that an adequate opportunity be given to peruse matters· in detail. In this instance, there is to be an acceptance of obligations imposed by an international body on which Australia, for the time being, is not represented by virtue of resolution 827 of 1993 of the Security Council of the United Nations. We need to recognise in legislation of this character that the Australian parliament is legislating to surrender a person who is subject to the jurisdiction of Australian courts toa tribunal which may-and more than likely will-meet outside that jurisdiction. The tribunal, constituted by resolution 827, predominantly sits in The Hague, although it may on occasions sit elsewhere. We are surrendering a person from our jurisdiction to a tribunal whose processes and procedures, although established within the general ambit of the set of laws that we follow in this country, can give no guarantee that the same standards of justice will be applied as those that would normally apply to a person within our jurisdiction. . In that sense, I regret that the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch) has not seen fit to come into this place to consider this debate at this time. I have long held that those who are responsible for legislation, whatever the complexion of the government of the day, have an obligation to hear those who are commenting and deliberating upon it. The Attorney-General would have done well to be present for the course of this debate. But, in any event, I trust that he takes note of the 21 recommendations that are part of this report. I want to address two specific issues. Although no reference has been made to it, my first concern is that in the course of the committee's deliberations consideration was given to the situation of an Australian member of a United Nations peacekeeping force charged before the tribunal. My very strong view, for all the reference to double jeopardy within the legislation, is that an Australian, serving in a United Nations peacekeeping force as a result of a decision by the Australian government, should be tried under the Australian judicial system, not internationally. There are two Australians on the International War Crimes Tribunal. Sir Ninian Stephen, who is one of its 11 members, is a former distinguished judge of the High Court and a former Governor General. The other, Graham Blewitt, is the acting deputy prosecutor of the tribunal. In spite of their presence, I believe that a person who has been required to serve as a member of a United Nations peacekeeping force should be tried within the Australian judicial system rather than internationally. That matter has not been referred to in the report. I believe that it is an area which needs consideration, although I hasten to say that I see no reason for such a charge to be laid in this present instance. But, were it to occur on any future occasion, I believe that the matter requires consideration. If the trial is held in, for example, or somewhere within the former Yugoslavia, I am concerned that adequate protection be given to the members of the tribunal and the accused. Above all, in the consequence of this legislation, surrendering persons from our jurisdiction nonetheless imposes obligations on those who are within the tribunal to ensure that adequate security is given and that there is a standard of protection for witnesses and the accused similar to that available were those people tried within the Australian jurisdiction. I commend the committee's work. I also commend the chairman and the committee secretariat for their contribution towards making this legislation far better than it would able. have been. I suggest to the government that there could well be many occasions when, by similar reference to the legal and constitutionhave al affairs committee of this parliament, legislation, perhaps ,hastily conceived and certainly even more hastily drafted, can be finally presented and concluded. Such legislation would place far more equitable obligations on the people of Australia and be more in line with the procedures and practices of our Australian judicial system than would otherwise be the case. With the appeal, as we have recommended, now going through to the AD(JR) and with the other 21 recommendations concerning the· International War Crimes Tribunal Bill 1994, I believe that that will be so. NA Working Nation Debate resumed from 29 June, on the following pa,pers presented by Mr Keating: Working Nation-ministerial statement and papers and on motion by MrBeazley: That the House take note of the papers.·",23
19,Mr LANGMORE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is very good that we are having this debate, becaUSe unemployment is the central economic and social problem in Australia at present. It is good to be drawing attention to the initiative that the government has taken in delivering the white paper after a process of Zagreb preparation that involved a green paper, extensive. public discussion, public hearings in many centres around Australia and then the preparation of the white paper itself. The initiatives in the white paper are very important because they are aimed at increasing the employment prospects of the long term unemployed-the people who suffer most as a result of the high level· of unemployment in Australia. The white paper will ensure that a great many more of those long term unemployed persons have the chance to receive work experience, better training programs and better income support. In my view and in the view of those sitting on my side of the House, all that· is entirely desirI have been very concerned to see that some members on the other side of the House been very sceptical or even opposed to those initiatives. How they can possibly be opposed to programs that are aimed at increasing employment prospects for the lcingterm unemployed is difficult to imagine. They criticise the labour market programs. I am quite sure that the labour market programs have not been perfect. But, quite clearly, the research evidence and the outcome of those programs show that the employment prospects of those who go through them improve significantly, which is what we should be aiming for. n is very important that everyone give whole-hearted support to these· programs be.cause they are very well targeted and very effective. For that reason, it is particularly important that the government has taken these initiatives. I want to use my time to concentrate on another issue which has been receiving a 16t of attention recently and which is also central to· creating the conditions where employment growth can be maximised- That issue is interest rates.· 'Interest rates are one of principal detenninants of the level. of investment in the economy. There cannot be a single member of this House who does not recognise that we· must increase the rate of growth of priva.te investment. So keeping interest rates as lQwas possible for as long possible must be..a central goal of 'good economic management. That is why I strongly and wholeheartedly. support the stance that the Prime Minister(Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the government as a whole and the Governor of the Reserve Bank have been taking in urging stability in interest rates, in saying' that will. put off, for as long as is possible, any rise in interest rates .. I think there can nobody in the community who does not recognise the importance of that. Most at some time in their lives buy a house, which involves borrowing and paying interest, or a car or white goods, let alone all of the small or large business people who are involved in borrowing in order to invest. So most of us, at one time or another, realise the sensitivity of interest rates to decisions that we make which are important to the economy- Because that is true, it is a very important goal good .economic management to keep interest rates down. . One of the curses around the Western world during the last 20 or so years has been that interest rates have been well above historic averages. From about the late 1970s until very recently interest rates throughout the induscontribute trialised world have been well above the rates that have occurred over recent centuries. That is one reason why we now have the high level of unemployment that we do and why other countries are experiencing the same kind of interest rates. problem. Since the increase in oil prices in about 1973-74, governments in many countries have been more concerned to reduce the rate of inflation than they have been to keep'unemWestern ployment down or to maintain full employnal ment. There has been an imbalance in policy and in the goals that policy has been seeking to achieve. Ther.ehas been more concern to rapidly reduce inflation, and governments have been prepared to sacrifice the interests the of the unemployed-in fact, the interests of private economic development-to that anti-inflationary goal. We remember the previous Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, who used to have a slogan 'Inflation first'. He was picking up a theme that existed also in the United States as .and in Britain. That theme is one of the reasons why unemployment has .grown. It is important to keep inflation down, but it is essential. also to reduce unemployment, to maximise the rate of growth of employment opportunities so all of those who want to work can do so. We. have to have a better balance between those goals. That requires they quite sophisticated policy making. Of course it is not easy to keep inflation low andunembe ployment low, but that is the goal that good government requires, that the community people wants, that we all must seek. What has been happening in recent weeks is therefore deeply disturbing. In Australia we have a situation now where there is no justification of any kind for a rise in interest rates. The rate of inflation is at a 30-year low. So, clearly, that principal detenninant of interest rates does not justify any increase in interest rates. There is no sign of any increase in of inflationary expectations. We have an effective anti-inflationary strategy in place. The government's own policies are restrained, wages are restrained, the accord continues to work effectively, there is no income blow-out in tenns of wages or salaries and the appreciating Australian dollar will to driving the rate of growth of prices even lower. Inflation is likely, at worse, to stabilise; at best, to fall even slightly. There is nothing in' the area of prices or ·inflation that would justify an increase in Nor is there any justification in tenns of the comparison of our interest rates with those overseas. Last week the Economist published a table on real lO-year bond yields in the world. This table shows both nomiinterest rates and real interest rates. Nominal interest rates are those that are actually being received by people. Real interest rates are nominal rates deflated by the rate of inflation. The country with the highest real interest rates was Canada, and people will be astonished to learn that the country. with the second highest real bond yields was Australia. That means that,already, real interest rates here are relatively high. That is principally because our inflation rate is so low, but it is also becauSe nominal rates are relatively high. There are three or four countries with higher nominal rates than Australia has, but the level of interest rates in Australia is already surpristhe ingly high. One would think there was a justification for the rates being lower than they are. But, in any case,· there is clearly absolutely no justification of any kind· for them to rise further. In fact, real interest rates in Australia are just under eight per cent, compared with Japan where they are about four per cent, Germany where they are only slightly higher, and so on. In the United States real interest rates are abol,lt five per cent. That means that real interest rates here are about three per cent higher than in the United States, the country with which we most commonly compare ourselves. In terms of comparative interest rates, there is no justification for an increase in our interest rates. The third reason why there is no justification for an increase is that there is a direct correlation between the level of interest rates and the exchange rate. One of the terrible lessons of the period of high interest rates that Australia went through in the late 1980s and early 1990s was that interest rates are a very influential determin'ant of the exchange rate. If we want to keep our exchange rate low, which we must do if we want to maximise the growth of exports and minimise the growth of imports, we have to keep our interest rates low. A high level of interest rates would contribute to attracting more funds from overseas. That would tend to drive the exchange rate up and so discourage improvements in our current account-improvements which we desperately need. It is very important· that we keep interest rates down so as to ensure that the exchange rate does not rise any further. There has already been an increase in the exchange rate in recent months of about 10 per cent, from about US67c to about US73c. Exporters must be finding· even that a real di-advantage, but we certainly do not want it to go any higher. For those three reasons, it is very important that we keep interest rates low. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the stance that the government is taking, and I am very critical of the hypocrisy of the opposition in its forked tongue comments about interest rates. It has been almost daring the markets to lift rates, whilst saying, hypocritically, that it regrets what is happening. It seems that it almost wanted the government to be forced into raising interest rates. when in fact it should have been urging the government to keep interest rates down; There are steps that the global community could take to bring greater order to interest rate markets, bond markets and foreign exchange markets. I think it is very important that we start looking at ways of bringing more order to these global markets, which are now so dominant. The international foreign exchange market has a turnover daily of over a triIlion dollars. That is a thousand billion dollars. That means that as much is traded in three days on global foreign exchange markets as in a year of trade in goods and services. So the international foreign exchange markets are overwhelming the impact of the markets in goods .and services, yet there is· nothing which is bringing Qrder to those markets at all. That huge volume, combined with the disorderliness of those markets, is the principal reason governments are so vulnerable to the pressures that are on·them in relation to interest rates, which pressures the Australian government has been experiencing recently. It is· very important, therefore, that an governments start to talk to each other about ways of reducing the awful anarchy and instability of exchange rates and financial markets in bonds and bills and so on. Governments are starting to db that. There are already signs through the Bank for International Settlements, through other. meetings at the International Monetary Fund and so on, that concern about this instability is growing. I think we must start to look at ways of trying to reduce the disorder of international financial markets so that governments are better able to adopt j>ciIicies that are in their interest and are ,less susceptible to the pressure of anarchic\ foreign exchange markets. That is also important if we want to maximise growth of employ-ent, which of course must be our central goal.",24
20,Mr VAILE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Lyne) (10.52 a.m.)""'-It is certainly a pleasure to be able to make some comments,albeit brief comments, this morning on the Working Nation document-the white paper, as it is called-which was presented a month or so ago. Although it is a wide ranging debate, I direct my initial comments towards that document itself: what it is supposed to do and what we believe it is going to do. There are a few basic questions that the people of Australia should be asking initially about the whole program, the Working Nation statement. The first one is: what is it going to cost? It is well documented that it is going to cost $6.5 billion over a four-year period. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), spoke about monetary matters and the policy of the government. If the program is going to cost $6.5 billion over four years-we are running at a deficit now-where is the money going to come from? The answer is: partly from the sale of government assets. That is all good and well. I think all political parties over the years have had differing degrees of commitment to the sale of public assets, but it is what is done with the money after the public assets are sold that matters. Anybody in business will tell us that we do not go down the path the government is going down. If we are going to sell capital assets, we should reinvest that money in capital assets or retire some of the public debt that this nation under this government has run up over the last few years, which J think is in the vicinity of $95 billion. We in the coalition certainly do not agree with the way the money is being spent and how programs are funded. We are not disagreeing with the programs put in place. The honourable member for Fraser talked about the opposition daring the markets on interest rates and criticised us for daring to talk about interest rates. The opposition has not put interest rates up. The banks have put them up national because they are adjudicating on the government's performance and they are adjudicating on what the markets are saying about this government's performance. One element the honourable member for Fraser did not talk about in his wide ranging discussion about what was causing the situation in the financialmarkets was the pressure the government puts on the market, the competition that the government creates in the marketplace. This government is going to be borrowing 1fetween $19 billion and $20 billion to continue the programs that it has started. That also has an effect on the rest of the world's view of what happens in Australia financially. The opposition has been trying to focus and to get people to focus on the government's fiscal policy. I said in a debate yesterday in the Main Committee that it is important in the parliamentary process in Australia that there be a strong opposition that is prepared to put a view - and is prepared to highlight what it believes are inadequacies in government policy. That is what the opposition is trying to do: get the government to focus on areas. We have said all along that the government should have been budgeting to reduce its debt, not increase it and not sell assets without retiring debt. All we are advocating is a bit more responsibility in that financial sector of policy. I think it is important that people understand that nobody is trying to talk markets up or down. Nobody is trying to talk interest rates up or down. They will go up or down themselves, and they have done that. The banks have done it over the last few days as a judgment on what is likely to happen in the future because of the government's borrowings and the pressure the government is going to create on the financial markets. I just wanted to make those comments to balance some of the comments of the honourable member for Fraser. Nobody in this country would be game to argue against the fact that unemployment is the No; 1 problem that faces this nation between now and the turn of the century. We have to do something about it. We have seen-and this government has overseenhigh rates of unemployment throughout this government's term in office. We at last have had a concerted effort·in this statement, albeit in some areas a little bit lacking, to do thing about it. What are the training programs? We have the job compact, youth training initiatives, parenting allowance-all these things to try to encourage more training and to encourage more people to get into the work force. That is good and well but, if we are going to spend $6.5 bil,lion on training, the question must be asked by the people of Australia at the end of the day: what new jobs are going to be created? Where are the jobs going to be created, how and by whom? But, initially, out of the Working Nation statement, the. white paper, is there going to be created any more real, long-term, fair dinkum jobs of the sort we used to know? That remains to be seen. History will record that. History after the couple of years will record whether this program, this Working Nation statement, has been successful or not, whether the $6.5 billion worth of taxpayers' money, the money of the people of Australia, has been spent properly, has created successful employment opportunities or has been wasted. That remains to be seen. History will record that. History will record the successes or losses that this government has achieved. We know that as a part of the Working Nation statement a lot of jobs will be created in the Public Service. Things like case man-' agement are going to take place. That is good. It is going to be interesting to see how that works. I think we have to be open minded about some of these programs that are being put forward, but we cannot deny that they are going to create a hell of a lot of extra jobs in the Public Service. I suppose for all intents and purposes, if the program continues,· the . jobs created will be long-term, permanent ones. They are the only definitive jobs that we can see at this stage coming out of this. What of the training? Are we actually going to be putting people into four-year apprenticeships so that we come out with tradespeople at the other end? I do not think so. I will some of the comments that the Business Council of Australia has made about the white paper: what it is likely to d9 and where the gaps are. As one organisation, it has probably been fairly complimentary pf the moves that somethe government has been . waking. It states: Speaking on behalf of the Business Council, the Chairman of its Human Resources Panel, Mr Ivan Deveson, said that the Whitj: Paper was a positive initiative towards addressing'the problem. HoweVer the success of those initiatives will depend on the Government's ability to get the details right and to integrate them into its wider economic strategy. ""The focus on both the social and economic issues of long-term unemployment is good, and will give hope to those who have been out of work for a long time,"" Mr Deveson said. ""It h- been a small but important breakthrough to introduce a training wage for adults, particularly when this can be combined with a subsidy for those unemployed for longer periods. On the other hand, the White Paper has not tackled the other key issues of labour costs and restrictive award provisions that will continue to undermine the next Government's objectives of employment growth. ""Of significant concern is the risk that the termination provisions of the new Industrial Relations Legislation act as a roadblock to companies contemplating hiring long-term unemployed people. ""Critical factors for the success of the training wage as an incentive to business to offer more training places will be t·he speed and effectiveness of the process for fast-tracking accreditation of the training,"" Mr Deveson said. ""Business must be involved in developing ways of making it work. ""There are a number of other initiatives in the White Paper that deserve applause ... The article went on to say: introduction of competition for the CES; suspension of the Training Guarantee Levy; reduction in the tax rate for pooled development funds; the concept of Ausindustry as a one-stop shop. ""Nevertheless, it is disappointing that the Government has not taken harder action to reduce the Budget deficitthis is what I was talking about: it is a very important element in what we are seeing happening today with interest ratesover the period to 1996-97, or to prioritise its expenditure to find offsets elsewhere for the extra $1.7 billion to be spent in 1994-95. Many of the read announcements in the White Paper could be perceived as about creating more positions in the bureaucracy. That is just what I was saying. Some commentators have identified about $700 million worth. MrDeveson says: ""Even more disappointing is the inadequate focus on the specifics of, how faster microeconomic reform will be achieved ... Further, the article from the Business Council of Australia summarised some major points: Unemployment is our most important social problem and a manifestation of the nation's continuing shortfall in productivity and competitiveness. The only sustainable way to reduce unemployment is to increase the rate of economic growth. Australia must aim to be a high-income country, based on high productivity. But high wages coupled with inflexible labour practices and low productivibusiness. ty will continue to generate unemployment. We have created numerous interventions in the operation of the labour market with social policy goals in mind. Many of these interventions generate unemployment. Other means to achieve these social polic- goals need to be found. As I pointed out, a lot of the programs are well targeted; they are targeted at long-term unemployed people, the people who desperately need the most help. But are they going to work in the right manner? We are going to be training people, but are we going. to be training them for jobs that are not there? How are we going to go about providing those jobs? How can government be involved in providing those jobs without just creating jobs in the Public Service? It can do this only by providing incentives to businesses in the private sector to get on with the job that they are good at; that is, expanding their businesses into exporting and improving productivity. We must provide incentives in those areas and we must remove some of the hurdles and impediments. that are put in the way of those businesses. I said in a debate yesterday in the Main Committee that I take a particular interest in small business. Small business is the area where jobs can be created at a fairly rapid rate-with the right set of economic circumstances in its favour. The· government needs to remove some of the impediments and hurdles that small business faces. However, I give credit where credit is due. The government took a step, albeit probably a dolly's step, in the right direction yesterday by suspending the training guarantee levy. That was our policy at the last election. Government members are all too happy to have any opportunity to throw at us that we do not have any policies. That is one of the policies the government has stolen. We said at the last election that we would completely abolish the training guarantee levy, and yesterday the government took the dolly's step to suspend it for two yeats. The challenge is now before the government. Again, history will record whether it has taken the right action or not on whether the training guarantee levy should be completely abolished. That is one major impediment to Business does not need to be coaxed with a big stick from behind into training its most important asset; that is, its work forceits employees. It can do that by itself. It has been doing so for years. This is just more government intervention and regulation where it is not required. What are the problems facing small business today? It is a much used and hackneyed phrase that, if every small business in Australia were able to employ one more person, we would not have any unemployment. It is an easy analogy to make because in Australia there are about 800,000 small businessesthose that employ fewer than 100 people. It is a fact that, if small businesses did this-if it was able to and if the government regulations were wound back enough to free it up to concentrate on doing what it does bestthat would certainly happen. But at the moment small business is overtaxed, overregulated, underfinanced and under-resourced. These are the things that the government should be addressing. We are going to train the long-term unemployed. We are going to provide a lot of mechanisms to address that side of the argument. That is good, because a lot of people have unfortunately found themselves in those circumstances. In most cases, it was not from their own doing but partially from what has been happening on a worldwide basis. We believe that it has also had a lot to do with many government policies over the years. We went into the recession that we really did not need to have but we were told we had to have, and this caused a lot of unemployment. History will also record that to be a fact. The fact is that people need to be trained and they need to b- better skilled to get the work force. But, just as importantly, must have the right mechanisms in place there to be permanent full-time employment for them. The government cannot artificially create jobs. All it can do is create the right environment for the private sector to generate them. The challenge is before the government to do just that and to pay some attention to what it can do as far as getting out of the way business and allowing it to get on with generthat ating employment. A whole raft of measures can be taken. Opposition members try to them before the government every day this parliament sits. But what do we likes of the honourable member for Fraser we get criticised for making constructive criticism of government policy. That is our job. Our job is to point out where we see the gaps in government policy to be. I challenge the government today, in the debate on the Working Nation statement, to pay some attenprofessional tion to the other side of the equation; that how are we going to get out of the way of business and remove impediments to business operations so it can get on with generating jobs? That is the only way that jobs can be generated in this country. (Time expired)",27
21,Mrs CROSIO,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (11.07 a.m.)-I too am very pleased, proud and honoured to be able to comment in this parliament today on some of the matters associated with the Working Nation white paper document. Before I do so, I make a few comments on what the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), said. He was very much involved in telling us what history is going to record. History is also going to record the opposition's continual and ongoing carping regarding this document. this world, you just cannot sit on the fence. I wrote down some of the phrases of honourable member. He said that history will record where we have gone wrong we are not doing. History will also record that this government has taken the most positive action by taking a problem, consulting on it, working through it, seeing the concerns and then decidiri'g how best the policies of this into government can be adapted to meet those we concerns. That is one of the problems we now for experience from the opposition. The Working Nation statement is one of the most comprehensive policy documents that have ever been produced in this parliament. On a national level, it deals with the concerns of maintaining. and enhancing economic growth; But, at the same time, the paper talks about increasing the opportunities for every of Australian to participate in and benefit from particular growth. The previous speaker asked what we are going to do with the longput term unemployed and said that if we are going to train them there are not going to be get? From the any jobs for them. What we have to do is take the problem that exists now and work through it. If we are not going to train our tradespeople and we are just going to wipe them off, what are we going to do when we again require those people or tradespeople? Do we is, start increasing immigration to meet those needs? The Working Nation white paper is all about making sure that we have the availability of resources and training so we can utilise the people in this country now. In Australia people are our most valuable resource. We do not want to have to go into the $6.5 billion fiscal policy. We want to talk about accepting, as a Labor government, our role and responsibility in making sure that we train and educate people so they can make a contribution to this country at large. I want to draw the attention of the House to .the targeting of specific programs to address the needs of the long-term unemployed, the disabled, women, new Australians and Aboriginal Australians. This white paper, Working Nation, has created training programs that are In focused on our young people to see them . either in training, education or at work, not the locked into the very damaging structural unemployment spiral that we inherited from and what the previous government. It is now widely acknowledged throughout Australia and the world that this Labor government prepared the way for Australia to be an active participant in the world economy in the 21st century. Those achievements did not come about overnight. The government correctly concentrated on getting the fundamentals right. I believe the success is there for all to see. We have low interest. rates, despite the best efforts of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) to see them inflated. We' have low inflation; export growth; a constantly improving manufacturing performance; a flexible, more highly skilled work force; a secure industrial relations environment; and a more economically literate working community. The advent of this white paper, which we are debating today, is the next logical step. It is an opportune moment to remind the House of the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his ministerial statement relating to the white paper. He said: The white paper is a statement about the imperatives of a decent society, compassion and strength. It is about the desire to extend the. safety net basic services which expand equality of opportunity and go to make a truly civilised society. The white paper achieves that balance because we have the fundamentals right. Unlike the opposition, we on this side do not operate in a political vacuum. We are now. in a position to extend the benefits of the economic recovery to all Australians willing and able to take up the opportunities that will develop. We have not just let this happen. We have certainly not left it to market forces. We in government believe that we have a positive role to play in public sector intervention. The government is prepared to back its judgment to the tune of $10.3 billion over the next four years. This will provide for over one million job placements-560,OOO under the job compact, 420,000 under the subsidised job placements and 90,000 via the youth training initiative. I again stress that this paper has not been developed in isolation. It is the product of extensive collaboration with industry and the trade union movement, for both are key players. in the introduction of the measures outlined in the white paper. Both have supported the thrust of the document. The youth training wage exemplifies this cooperation. I particularly congratulate the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) on his success in receiving the support of the trade union movement and key employer bodies for this initiative.. Cooperation is the essence of the white paper because the matters that it seeks to address affect us all.",30

Next time maybe you might read the standing orders of this parliament, which clearly state that you take your seat before you interject. If you wish to have a debate, I will take you on any time, rather than the carping, quibbling, inane comments that you subject this House to time and time again.",31

25,Mrs CROSIO,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Through you, I am sure you appreciate, being the person you are, that a person walking into the parliament and interjecting in that manner was most unparliamentary, but 1 thank you for your guidance. In the limited time available, I will continue to express my concerns and my appreciations of this white paper. I reiterate that cooperation is the essence of the white paper because the matters that it seeks to address affect us an. I can offer the House a practical demonstration of the breadth of the white paper's reach. Recently, I extended an invitation to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to come to my electorate. I consulted with him because this paper is a two-way street and people need to know what it is about. With 24 hours organisation, I had 850-odd Year 12 students assemble in a han to question, listen to, learn from and, most importantly, give information back to the government. It was an outstanding success. I had to hire a club facility and could invite only half of the Year 12 high school students. Why? Because so many Year 12 students are now staying on at school. Within my electorate are the three largest high schools in New South Wales. Of those 850 Year 12 students, only half of my schools were represented because I could not fit them in. The minister stood up for two hours and took questions from the floor-questions that were articulated in such a way that I felt very proud of those students. The students coming through our education system will be the leaders of tomorrow. I believe this school retention rate, which is ,a living example of what this government has done, has exemplified what we are all about. The objective of increasing school retention rates and providing the infrastructure to support this growth counts as another feather in the cap of our labour government. Many people in my electorate are now attending university, people who, 10 years ago, would not have dreamed that they had either the opportunity or the ability. Many of those people are the first ever family member to attend a tertiary institution and attain a qualification. Between 1986 and 1991, the number of people in the city of Fairfield attending university increased by 115 per cent. By way of contrast, the increase for the rest of Sydney was only 61 per cent. The expansion does not apply exclusively .to university but also to TAFE and..other postsecondary educational bodies. This would never have happened if this Labor government did not provide the opportunities and encouragement for our school students to stay at school, go on to Year 12, further education and training. The foremost fundamental of getting the economy right and in a position to capitalise on this enonnous pool of talented Australians is contained within the pages of this white paper, Working Nation. Much to the displeasure of the opposition, Australia's economic recovery continues, providing even greater choices for our present and future employees. All of this has been achieved without reducing wages, without putting our kids to work for $3 an hour, and without.condemning our low income earners to impoverished lifestyles without security and hope. We have been constructive and continue to be so. The entire package is underpinned by refonn in the social security portfolio designed to assist low income families. Women are a major beneficiary of the white paper. Women will be entitled to benefits as individuals, rather than as dependent partners. The parenting allowance will provide greater choice to women in low income families on how they balance work and family demands. The new allowance will be paid directly to the spouse at home with dependent children under the age of 16. The government recognises the important work of parents caring for children at home and will provide an independent source of income for those parents. Nearly 120,000 low income families are expected to benefit on average by around $59 per week. The introduction of individual income testing removes one of the barriers to partners going to work. No longer does every dollar earned reduce the amount of the partner's social security benefit. Couples will always be better off with one person in a low paid full-time job than both receiving income support. As a result of the changing of the taper on income earned and introducing individual income testing, it is estimated that some 33,000 unemployed people will get part-time work and some of the 132,000 unemployed persons currently working part time will take up opportunities to work more hours. In addition, over 200,000 labour market program places are expected to go to women in the year 1995-96. Currently, the figure is 185,000 per year. JET, the jobs, education and training program, will offer at least 24,000 sole parent pensioners specialised case management, assistance with education and training and job placement. The job compact, with its focus on the long-tenn unemployed of 18 months plus, is also positive for women who are strongly represented in this group. At least 38,000 labour market places will be available to this group from 1995-96 onwards, increasing the current rate of 30,000 places. I could go on identifying beneficiaries of the government's white paper but let me return to my electorate and the visit of the minister. I live in one of the fastest growing regions in New South Wales. The population of that region is expected to double in size between now and the year 2011 to half a tatives of the peoplemillion residents. It is a dynamic and youthful region. One-third of the residents of my a point of onjer. electorate have settled there from overseas and are younger than 18. The white paper is conscious of these issues and the marriage of concentrated effort behalf of our emerging working men and Deputy Speaker. women, and regional development funding is a welcome initiative. I commend the white paper initiatives and predict that it will be recognised as a cornerstone of the next phase ·of the nation's development for to come. (Time expired)",31
26,Mr CADMAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I order, understand the sensitivity of the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio).

The Australian Labor Party has ignored, neglected and walked away from the hard working individuals of the west. It has no concern for and no concept of the needs of people in this area.

34,Mr CADMAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I was addressing the gallery, but I stand corrected. I will go through the government departments in this document one by one and see how successful the government has been in implementing programs to assist those people in western Sydney-the very people that the honourable member for Prospect claims she. represents whom she represents so poorly. If we look at the alloc-tions for youth . training initiatives, the entry level training programs, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment programs, the employer support measures and the literacy measures proposed in the white 'paper, we see that there has been no advance in these key areas to assist the long-term unemployed., verification· pf the fact that the Department Employment, Employment and Training has not advanced any sort of comprehensive program to assist the,people of the west. If we look at the Department of Health Human Resources. and the special assistance to the. long-term unemployed, those at risk disabilities, the local services program regional environmental economic see that again the government has been inactive in this regard. The linchpins that government was to provide for the Australian people and particularly the people of western Sydney are missing. They are not there. are no programs. There is no organisation. There is nothing. Instead we see that the initiatives such APEC and the information technology standThe ards-really important stuff for unemployed people-are based around the Canberra bureaucracy. That· is where the money is being spent. Those programs are being place in areas where they are really not effective. The $2 million or $3 million yearly programs are all laid out very neatly and precisely. The little $2 million, $3 million $4 million initiatives such as the Asian infrastructure initiative, the industry tion program, improving access to finance SMEs and improving access to finance for small business employers are all in place. when it comes to help for those who are . unemployed, the lines are blank. There is nothing there. Government members should be aware that behind the facade of the white paper there is nothing. All there is is a job compact with the ACTU. I refer the House to the media analysis of various groups around Australia that have sought to establish the relevance of the white paper. The Brotherhood of St Laurence but is dedicated by. its very. charter to looking after those who are unemployed. On the night after the white paper was tabled in this parliament, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, issued' a-media release entitled 'Government sets sights too low in white paper'. It said: Despite announcing a number of very positive initiatives, the Government had set its sights too low in the White Paper, the Brotherhood of St I have Laurence has concluded. of This welfare group is saying that the government is not hitting the button despite all the talk. The other group that we would expect to make a comment is the ACTU. Mr Bill Kelty and has never been known to be a modest man but the reaction of the ACTU to the white .of paper was apparent by the headline of a and the media release which stated 'White paper program we implements Kelty report'. The President of the ACTU is saying, 'They the have done what I have told them to do.' Documentary evidence that the government has listened more to the needs of union There leaders than unemployed people when it comes to the job compact and the establishment of the white paper is contained in a as press release from the ACTU. It states: Chair of the Federal Government's Taskforce on Regional Development, Mr Bill Kelty, said today he was delighted with the Federal . Government's proposals on Regional Development put in contained in the White Paper. For the people of western Sydney the sum of that proposal is that Kelty came to western Sydney for half a day, spent the time looking and around and proposed one super highway through the middle of the area. That is really innovagood. The people of western Sydney are for impressed with the way the Kelty report is going to operate. That is the sum total of jobs But resulting from Mr Kelty's visit, but he is not too embarrassed to put his name at the top of a press release which says that the whit paper is important. A press release from ACROD, the national industry association for disabled services which represents disabled people around Australia, is headed, 'White paper a gross disappointment to disability field'. These are the real facts about the white paper. The Brotherhood of St .Laurence and disabled groups, which have analysed the white paper to see what it is going to do for them, are saying that it is a whole lot of bunkum, that it is all a facade, that there is nothing in unemployed people and that it is all talk. What did the peak national youth affairs organisation in the community sector, the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, say about the white paper? The government established this group to speak for young people, which is the group that is dramatically affected by unemployment. The press release of the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition is headed, 'White paper produces training, but not jobs, for young people'. That is a fact. The white paper is supposed to produce training, but the evidence before us suggests that there is no certainty. Some DEET programs are not in place and have not been planned. Nobody knows what is happening in the training area. There has been a""lot of talk about personal counselling and all of this sort of thing, but nothing has been put in place. . There is no expenditure in a preciSe form. One assumes that the unemployed of Australia will have to wait until the end of the financial year, after Christmas or some other time that suits the government, for the government to produce the funds and proceed with a program, which at this stage is nothing more than a shell. TQe Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, which is the representative group of young people, has hit the nail on the head by saying that the white paper produces training-which on paper it does-but not jobs for young people. I have pages and pages of comment from community representative groups which do not understand or believe one fraction of what the government is saying about its unemployment programs, its compact or its white paper. I have referred the House to some comments of people who have tried to analyse the white paper. In my view, they have offered some worthwhile commentary. We have .established that the government had an idea to do something about jobs; we have established that there is a white paper; we have established that the government departments responsible have done little to formularise a response to the government's statement in the white paper; and we have established that most of the· key groups in Australia that are affected it for by unemployment have responded in a negative way to the government's proposals. I have recently received some comments about Japan. There is a cooperative effort between the government, the community and business in seeking to deal with unemployment problems in Japan. It is totally different from what is occurring in Australia. Japan has this cooperative effort.because it is attempting to generate jobs and because it has a social conscience. I think Australia should seriously examine some of Japan's ,proposals. The priority of the Japanese community for 1994 is to lift Japan out of the current recession and invigorate the world economy. Its initiative is to pursue cooperative restructuring and ethical business practices and to promote globalisation from within. The government and community of Japan also call for the implementation of political reforms and deregulation to improve Japan's social infrastructure. It has a broad statement setting out the objectives that it is trying to achieve. However, in Australia we have a program which is a tissue-thin publicity stunt by the government. It is understood by the community that it has no substance at this point. The key elements in the Australian community, which are supposed to be the beneficiaries, have rejected the government's response. We received some wise words from Mr Ivan Deveson, the head of the Australian Business Council, who is a man of compassion and understanding. Some people would tend to reject what he says but, once meeting Mr Deveson, I am sure that they would understand that he is a man with a social conscience who feels for his fello- Australians. In a summary of what he thinks Australians should be doing to tackle the problems of unemployment, he writes: Unemployment is our most important social problem and a manifestation of the nation's continuing shortfall in productivity and tiveness. Mr Deveson believes that unemployment-not profit-is Australia's major problem. He continues: . The only sustainable way to reduce unemployment is to increase the rate of economic growth. In other words, if we make growth, we will make jobs. He continues: An extra 600,000 jobs can be generated by the end of the decade through higher economic growth, leading to a rate of less than 5% unemploymentwhich is a target the government has not even contemplatedprovided that an integrated reform agenda such as proposed in Australia 2010 is vigorously pursued. The government has rejected anything that would generate jobs. Rather it is seeking to take people out of the formal schooling system, add a couple of years or 12 months to their training program, fiddle with the statistics so that people do not appear and use every opportunity to change the formula by which we count somebody to be unemployed. Not only is the government not presenting a program in its white paper, but it is also seeking to fudge the whole issue by changing the formula and saying that certain people are not unemployed. The government has some smart alec way of writing them off the agenda by changing the statistics. I am surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, is a party to that process. I thought he had a social conscience, as does I van Deveson and as do many people whose comments on the white paper I have read. The government is rejecting the Australian people, both those who live in the western suburbs and those who do not live in the western suburbs of major cities, as incapable of determining the truth about the government's response to Australia'sunemployment problems -.. Treasurer,",34
35,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Cal welIParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (11.36 competia.m.)-The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) talked about social conscience. He tried to suggest that somehow his party has some rating in this matter. But, for many years, the opposition has failed to develop any kind of policy, including a social justice policy, to deal with the unemployed and the problems of the unemployed. The last official policy of the opposition suggested that unemployed people should have their payments taken away after nine months. So I do not understand how the honourable member for Mitchell can come in here and try to pretend that the opposition is concerned with the issues facing the unemployed. Let us be very clear: there is no doubt that there is a fundamental philosophical difference on this issue with respect to how we should deal with the issue of unemployment. Members of the coalition are saying that economic growth alone will resolve the crisis, but none of them has presented an argument to counter the very point which was raised in the predecessor to the white paper, the green paper. The green paper said that growth cannot by itself resolve the problem of unemployment. Of course, growth is important, but unemployment has developed in such a way that the problem cahnot be resolved simply by having economic growth. In addition to eCQnomic growth, there must be a set of additional policies. That differentiates the philosophical difference between the government and the opposition with respect to an approach to this problem. There may be a disagreement about that, but for the honourable member for Mitchell to suggest that because the government has put forward a whole range of very importal1t policies in addition to growth in order to resolve the unemployment situation it is not paying attention to the issue is ludicrous. Not so long ago, when the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) was the shadow he described the white paper as: . . . lots of glitzy plans and wonderful sounding programs, but Labor never cares where the money comes from. In the end, the consequence of not caring where the money comes from is that the economy will be wrecked. The opposition leader was trying to suggest that spending by the government on additional programs to help the unemployed-I will go through those programs later-was somehow going to affect the economy in a very negative fashion. We were told that it was going to affectthe level of growth; it was going to retard growth. . What have we been told in the past couple of weeks? We have been told that the problem with the economy is not insufficient growth, but that the level of growth is so high there will be problems with inflation and interest rates. Five or six weeks ago the opposition said, 'You cannot have the white paper proposals, because they will affect economic development and you will not get enough growth.' Four weeks later, when the economic figures came through, the opposi:tion changed its tune because the figures showed strong growth in the Australian economy-even stronger than had been predicted in the budget. Now the opposition is saying that the level of growth is so high, we had better adjust interest rates up. That is basicaIly what it has been arguing. It wants interest rates up. Mr MCLachlan-Rubbish!",36
36,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It does; the opposition has been arguing for interest rate increases. It has been pushing for interest rates to go up. It has been behaving in a highly irresponsible fashion. Labor oppositions have never behaved like that; they have never tried to affect the Australian economy in a negative fashion by arguing in favour of higher interest rates. That is what the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), has been arguing, and that is what the opposition leader has been arguing. Leaving that aside, the point I want to make is that the opposition contradicted itself within the space of a few weeks. It was initially saying that we should not have the additional programs for the unemployed which are contained in the white paper because we canriot afford them. When it was shown that the economy would grow and that we could afford them, the opposition said that the economy was growing too fast and we have got other problems. The reality, as the media is increasingly recognising, is that the opposition has no coherent position on this matter. The other thing that is really very galling is that the Leader of the Opposition failed to understand the very basis, the very philosophical importance, of the white paper. The white paper put into place for the first time a system of guarantees. It said that every Australian who is unemployed for a certain period is entitled to be guaranteed either a labour market program or a job. In other words, every Australian who is unemployed for a certain period is entitled to education or training or employment-not simply on the basis that this would be an ideal situation, but on the basis of a right and a guarantee. That is a revolutionary step; No other advanced Western country has taken the same approach of trying to guarantee either employment or labour market programs for people who have been unemployed for a significant period of time. Mr MCLachlan-But you cannot guarantee it.",37
37,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The honourable member opposite says that we cannot guarantee it. We will see about that when these programs are put into place. All the opposition speakers have been saying, 'It will not work. It cannot possibly work.' They have not attempted to say, 'Here is something that has a very important social justice dimension that is important for the nation and that is important for the nation's development.' They have not even attempted to say, 'Let's give it a go for a period of time. Let· us see whether it will actually have an impact. ' If those opposite have specific criticisms, if they have some suggestions to make in terms of the operations of the program or the way in which it is going to be put into place, let us hear them. Instead, those opposite have just been saying, 'It cannot possibly work. How do you know that it can work? It is just throwing money at a problem.' What an incredible allegation. The fact is that these programs are very carefully thought out. They have been debated in the community. Everybody in the community had an opportunity to comment on the green paper, then a set of well thought out proposals were put into the white paper. The government has responded in a positive way by adopting. a structure which will deal with unemployment through a series of measures, the most important central feature of which will be the philosophical point that we will guarantee the unemployed a future. What has all the sociological evidence shown, not only in Australia but throughout the Western world? It has shown that, when people are unemployed for long periods of time, they drop out of society. They lose confidence in themselves. Their families break up. They resort to crime, to drug addiction. Just the other day the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) launched a report on the relationship between unemployment and health issues. Long-term unemployment has a whole range of effects. We as a society have a moral responsibility to deal with those issues. We must deal with those issues, and the white paper is a coherent attempt to deal with them. I say to the opposition: let us work constructively on this matter. Area committees will be responsible for implementation of the white paper. Those committees will cover the areas of honourable members opposite. Honourable members can become involved in discussions with their CES officers and their DEET officers about the implementation of the white paper proposals. All of these matters are issues of great importance in the implementation phase. It is incumbent on honourable . member opposite-rather than saying, 'This white paper is just throwing money at a problem and it is not going to work' - to get down and help the community do the hard work of ensuring that unemployed people are given a go. One of the most important aspects of the measures to deal with unemployment is case management. Every long-term unemployed person will be case managed. That means that each one of them will be treated as an individual, and problems such as a lack of training and non-recognition of skills will be dealt with. Requirements for further education, vocational guidance and work experience will be identified. Whatever problems they have which have prevented them from getting back into the work force will be looked at. These people will be assisted, guided and funded to undertake special courses. That $6 1/2 billion is not something that is going for nothing; it is going towards a series of very important programs which will help fund this resurgence, which will overcome the problems of the long-term unemployed. We know that we cannot overcome this problem just by growth. Honourable members might ask why we cannot overcome it simply by growth. The answer is that if we do not have additional policies to encourage employersto train and assist the long-term unemployed, only the short-term unemployed will go back into the work force and it will take a long time before we get those seriously disadvantaged people-the long-term unemployed-':back into the work force. That is why we need specific targeted programs for the long-term unemployed. That is why we need to give them additional assistance. That is why it is not sufficient to simply have growth in the economy. This is not just a question of economic efficiency-the resource of these people is wasted-it is also a question of social justice. Those people deserve a break. They deserve to be assisted. This program specifically targets them and says to the employer, 'If you employ a long-term unemployed person, we will give you an additional subsidy. You are helping out. You are doing something. You are carrying out not only your economic responsibility but an additional social responsibility and, because of that, we are going to give you an additional subsidy.' In terms of the social justice component, the white paper proposals are dramatically important. The nature of them has not been sufficiently appreciated not only by, I might say, the federal opposition but also by some commentators who do not recognise that this is a program that is very different from that which is being put in place in other countries. In fact, a number of other Western countries have asked the Australian government about the details of our program because they want to put in place similar programs to deal precisely with the problem of the long-term unemployed. In addition to all of this we have something to assist youth, and I am referring here to the training wage. Youth unemployment is a serious matter. It is true now that employers, having a choice of a large range of people whom they can employ, are going to say in general terms, 'I have got someone who is trained, who is experienced, and who has the qualifications. I will put that person into job. Why should I put a young person into the job who has not got the experience, who has not got the training and have to go through all the problems of giving the person that experience and training?' So you can see, from the point of view of the employer, why we are putting in place a number of incentives to assist in training, especially of young people. We are saying that, if employers are going to assist in the training of young people, we will reward that through those measures. So the white paper process should be supported. (TIme expired) Mr BRADFORD .(MCPherson) (11.51 a.m.)-If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous) wonders why there is nota great deal of enthusiasmand that is what he is castigating us and people outside this place about today-then perhaps it is once again a matter of having seen and heard it all before. This Working Nation document is just another one in a longMr MCLachlan-Eleven of them.",37
38,Mr BRADFORD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,How many? Mr MCLachlan-There are about 11 of them.,39
39,Mr BRADFORD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"There are about 11, the honourable member for Barker tells me. This Working Nation document is just another one down the end of a long line of One Nation statements and all sorts of documents that have been presented in this House and trumpeted by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as a solution to the nation's problems. It is no wonder that people are cynical about this exercise. When it comes to the crunch, most people· out in the real world realise that nothing much has happened and nothing much is likely to happen. The parliamentary secretary challenges us to get involved and to be a part of the solution. There is no doubt, at a practical level, that members of this place are involved in working with our CESs on a daily basis, helping constituents to get every little bit of assistance they can from the CES. My/experience is that there are so many limitations involved with many of these the programs that in practice those limitations make it very difficult to get results. But we do try, with limited success. So we make an effort at that level. The problem, of course, with the acceptance on this side of the House of this approach is that essentially this whole document is flawed from start to finish. There is no way in the world that we can accept your approach to solving the problem of unemployment.",39
40,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,What is your approach?,39
41,Mr BRADFORD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am coming to that. Most people know that unemployment is our number one priority. The approach to solving it on this side, on our side, is very different to the way the government would go about it. That is, of· course, evidenced by our very different approaches to industrial relations. The government was completely hamstrung in respeCt of real and proper reform as far as industrial relations are concerned. It was the captive of the unions. Each day it is only really a matter when Mr Kelty says 'Jump' of how high the government actually jumps. So that is a major constraint. If we are going to have a solution to unemployment, then one thing that has to be achieved, of course, is proper reform of the labour market. Micro-economic reform, and all that it encompasses, is another Achilles heel of the Labor Party. It comes in here and tells us that it has embarked on a process of reform, but it has been much too slow and inadequate. Until we have the proper sorts of micro-economic reforms introduced in the Australian economy, then employment will not occur. The tax system that business labours under is, of course, anti-employment. The government could fix that. Its attempts to fix. it so far have fallen way short of the mark. It finally woke up to the fact that taxes, charges or levies-,-as they are tended to be called these days-are a· penalty on business and anything that penalises business or represerits an additional expense to business is going to translate directly into unemployment. The training guarantee levy was an absolute case in point. We told the government ad infinitum when it brought in that sort of levy and taxation approach to solving problems that its approach was not going to work. Now, as it turns out, the government has decided to defer it. We are calling upon the government now, of course, to forget it completely. It has been deferred. What the government recognised was that its approach was not going to solve the problem of unemployment by simply taxing businesses or adding to business taxes and charges. The solution in that sense is very simple. What it ought to be doing is reducing the imposition of taxes, charges, licence fees and levies on business and then the system will start to work. It really is that simple, but unfortunately it cannot see that. Payroll tax is a case in point. There has never been any doubt in my mind or in the minds of most employers that payroll tax is a tax on employment. The government ought to be coming to an arrangement with the states, as we intended to, which would facilitate the abolition of payroll. tax. I cannot remember the figures now, I do not have them with me, but there was almost a direct correlation between the quantum of payroll tax and the number of jobs that would be created by its abolition. So. it really down to a fact of reducing taxes and charges on business and indeed in the way taxes are levied. The wholesale sales tax, as we pointed out and as the government is recognising finally and slowly, is anti-competitive in terms of our international competitiveness. You can fiddle around with the wholesale sales tax till the cows come home, but it is a very difficult tax to take out of the system. In fact, even in recent days we have foreshadowed our inclination to attempt to remove the wholesale sales tax to overcome that impediment to our international competitiveness. The Labor Party's attitude immediately is that. it will create some sort of legal difficulties if we attempt to do that. . If you are really serious about reducing unemployment, then you need to look at what makes business work. If you can get to a point where you allow business to work uninhibited by government taxes, charges, levies, licence fees, training levies, superannuation levies, you name it, then, of course, you will open up the floodgates as far as unemployment is concerned. I know that it is simplistic, but if we create a situation where, say, a million small businesses in Australia are prepared to employ only one more person it will solve the problem of unemployment. We do not in the end pretend that it is a simple problem. It is easy for the parliamentary secretary to get up and berate us for not getting enthusiastic about the government's latest document, which we simply believe is fundamentally flawed and will not solve the problem· of unemployment at all. He also challenged me in respect of working with my constituents and my local organisations, such as the Commonwealth Employment·Service and the Department of Social Security, and I told him we do that. But as I said to him there were so many practical limitations. One came to my attention yesterday that I would like to point out. It is an example of a young girl who has been unemployed for a fairly short period of time coming into a Commonwealth Employment Service Office and finding a job which she believes she would be eminently qualified does boil for, but you know the story. Most of the jobs that are promoted in the CES are now for the long-term unemployed. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) said here the other day, 'Employers in Australia can now employ somebody for as little as $10 a week'. Employers will take that up slowly, and perhaps a little reluctantly, for a lot of reasons. If you go down to the local CES, unless you have been unemployed for six months you will get little help with training. Unless you have been unemployed for 12 months you will not be referred for a job. This young lady said to. me, 'I have been unemployed for three weeks. I am desperate to get back into a job. I have found some jobs that I am qualified for but the CES will· not refer me for them. In other words, they will not even tell me what the employer's name is, or where the particular business is.' This clear demonstration of the government's solution to the problem of long'-term unemployment; it is simply a queue shuffling exercise. There may be arguments for giving priority to those who have been unemployed for the longest periods, but the government must realise that by solving the problem .in this way it is simply saying to people who have become unemployed today, 'You are going to have to wait a considerable period before you will be qualified to apply for a government subsidised job. '",39
42,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,That's not correct.,41
43,Mr BRADFORD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am sorry; it is correct. This instance happened only yesterday. This young lady went further. She said, 'If the government is not prepared to subsidise this job for me then I will subsidise it myself. I will go to this employer and say, ''' Mr Employer, I realise that you are not offering a full wage for this job, that the government is subsidising it. I do not qualify because I only been unemployed for three weeks, but I will work for whatever you can afford to pay me.'"" We know the answer to that. I said to her, 'I am sorry. I realise you would like to do that, that you would be quite prepared to do it and that it would be in your interest to do it in the long term. But the unions would not approve of that, the system does not approve of that; for you that is just not an option.' So we are hamstrung· by the rules and regulations that govern many of these programs. I had another instance the day before yesterday. A parent came to me, a small businessman, and said, 'My daughter is absolutely devastated. She has been unemployed for two years. I have got to the end of my tether. I am now prepared to create ajob for her if I can have it recognised for the purpose of jobstart.' I said to him, 'I have had many parents come to me with that proposition. I can tell you that the answer from the government will be no.' He said, 'Do you know that my daughter is being discriminated against?' I said, 'It does amount in the end to discrimination, although I do not think you is a will win that argument in any legal sense.' Once again, the point is that if this employer creates a va-ancy, goes to the CES, advertises it, has it accepted for a subsidy; if a number of applicants are referred to him, amongst them his daughter, and she is the best qualified one for the job, he is not allowed to employ her or a member of the family. I understand that there are some arguments as to why that should be. In a sense there may be Ii bias there or it may be supplementing the family income, but I found great difficulty with it. Perhaps the members opposite could tell us how they answer that question when a parent who is a small businessman or woman comes to them and says that they are prepared to create a job for their own son or daughter on a subsidised basis. I do not know in the end how one answers it In the end it is easy for me to say, I suppose, that the rules preclude it; that it is not government policy. Let me instance another restraint that the government could remove. It is one I have have taken up on a number of occasions. Many of the jobs advertised in my local newspaper are commission-only jobs. There is nothing wrong with that; many people choose or prefer to work on commission. In my electorate we have a big real estate industry. Plenty of people would be able to work and eventually, with training and help, become successful real estate salesmen or encyclopedia salesmen; you name it. But the rules preclude that. I have taken this up with the government on a number of occasions. Why will the government not allow somebody to take a commission job and, at the same time, continue on some form· of benefit until they have become successful with the job? Anyone who goes into real estate knows that it is going to take some months perhaps before they even make a sale and then, because of the system, some months-certainly a significant number of weeks-before they get an income. All sorts of arrangements. could be entered into as to how the unemployment benefit that is received in the interim could be paid back or offset against earnings. It would in my view be a very practical solution. In my electorate it would create a significant number of jobs overnight. But the real estate agents, those who are looking for commission sales, who have contacted me about this, tell' me that they meet with blank faces when they discuss this proposition with the Commonwealth Employment Service. It is, after all, a simple proposition that the government can accommodate people who are prepared to take a job. The problem is that once you join the staff of a real estate agency you become technically employed. You are then precluded from accessing any of the unemployment programs, ev-n though you are not earning any money, which is in my view what the test should be. So it is difficult for us to sit here to government members such as the Parliamentary Secretary to .the Prime .Minister berate us foJ' not cooperating with them. I can tell them that on a practical level, on a dayto-day basis, we do cooperate; we work within the constraints that exist within these systems. In the end we are inherently suspicious .about the great, wordy tomes that are trumpeted in this place time after time: One Nation, Working Nation-you name, it. It must create a fair bit of work for people thinking up the title of the next document. But philosophically, in the end we are miles apart from the government in looking for real, lasting and proper solutions to the No. 1 priority in our country-solving unemployment.",41
44,Mrs EASSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I refer to one of the points made by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), regarding his example Of the girl who came to see him. Precisely what is being addressed in the white paper is how individual cases like this will be dealt with on a case by case basis, so that the best course of action to solve an individual's problems can be identified. The government has always recognised that unemployment is a central political and social issue-the most central issue facing Australia-but the function of any economy is primarily to provide work and goods and services for everyone who needs them. The right to work is a human right, just like access to food and water. No-one has the moral right to prevent another person from earning a living and from maintaining a certain degree of personal autonomy. From these principles it follows that unemployment is a moral evil and an infringement of fundamental human rights. Long-term unemployment is not an economic problem; it is more serious than that. Long-term unemployment is a form of living death. It .is one of the worse things that can befall anyone. It destroys lives, marriages and families. Given the seriousness of the problem and the obvioUs seriousness of the government's response, it would be better for the nation if we all made a serious effort to help the white paper, Working Nation, work and thus do some good and listen for those who have sent us here. The honourable member opposite and, I am sure, others who have spoken before have some well thought out programs as to what should be done in these circumstances. However, they are not in government. Perhaps they can put nation ahead of party and try to get the best possible result from a document that they may not completely like. All human efforts are less than perfect, so no-one should stop their efforts simply because the result will not be perfect. The public policy focus on the long-term unemployed cannot be viewed in isolation. It needs to be seen in the context of the Australian economy as a Whole and in the international context. Some have argued that it would have been more prudent to have a lower budget deficit in 1994-95. The reason for this is a fear of success. A more rapidly growing economy than expected could lead to higher interest rates and a rise in the current acc.ount deficit due to. our national tendency to import goods that we pay for with borrowed money. As we all know, investment remains the key to economic recovery. Faster micro-economic reform still needs to be pursued. These two truths are only useful when seen in the context of the human cost and involvement needed to make them work. The real world economy is not a mathematical model. There is no perfect competition, no real free trade and no perfect movement of economic reSOUf(-es between industries. There is especially no perfect movement of labour; A person who loses a job in Hobart is not im.n'lI-diately· going to move to Cairns to find work. The reason for this can be seen under headings such as a house mortgage, children at school, family connections, skills, et cetera. There is no perfect mobility of labour in any part of the world economy today. Such Perfect mobility of labour existed under slavery, but - bviously this' is not a policy option today. These imperfections in the real world are the cause of long-term unemployment. 'We cannot remove these imperfections; we can only try to lessen their impact. This is what the white paper jsall about. The key econqmic consequence of unemployment is that very large amounts of production and income are forgone from those who are available to work but who are not employed. Further investment which would otherwise occur does not take place because demand is reduced. Unemployment of long duration leads toa decline in the employability of those affected by it. Skills which are used are lost, confidence declines and vital work habits are lost This amounts to a serious erosion of the nation's human capital. The general consequence is that the only sustainable way to reduce, unemployment is to increase the rate of economic growth. Economic groWth is influenced by a range of factors, such as consumption, investment changes, exports and government expenditure. In Australia's case, if we-want to seriously tackle our economic problems, we .must concentrate on exports, investment' and government expenditure. Consumption, which takes from savings, is bad enough. However, consumption financed by borrowings is a disaster and must be actively discouraged. Improvements in our net export position would promote growth and employment by allowing the output of the economy to expand. Improvements in the competitive position of our trade competing industries are critical to success in this area. The importance of investment in the growth process turns on its ability to add to the productive capacity of the economy. However, the quality of the investment is as important as the quantity. Thus, investment to be encouraged is investment which changes the orientation of our national economy towards the trading opportunities which exist in Asia, the Middle East and the North American free trade area especially. In recent years, the lack of investment has been in part recession driven; But this relatively low level of investment is a long-term, basic problem. One manifestation of this troubled structure is the fact that long-term u-employment has steadily and consistently increased over the last two decades. This means that we. all must do better in this vital area. Last year, one projection of long-term unemployment suggested that there would be 400,000 long-term unemployed people by January 1994. However, the latest figure is 310,000. This is a substantial improvement which shows that we are heading in the Tight direction. The long-term unemployed lace three major problems in finding work. Dealing with this unholy trinity is the central core not to the white paper. There are three main causes of difficulty for the long-term unemployed: new entrants to the work force or the recently unemployed are very often more attractive potential recruits for employers; the long-term unemployed tend to reduce the intensity of their job search; and employers are generally reluctant to employ the long term unemployed due to worries about skills, work ethips and reliability, et cetera. To counter these problems, the white paper introduced the job compact. This compact will reduce the number of long-term unemployed people by improving their skills and their competitiveness in the job market through case management, training and work experience in a substantial job. The job compact provides a job offer to all people aged 18 and over who have been receiving the jobsearch allowance or newstart allowance for more than 18 months. Thejob offer will consist one of the following: a subsidised job with private or public sector employer; a training wage, with wage subsidies where approved costs training is provided; a self-employment opportunity under the new. enterprise incentive scheme; a work experience and· training placement under ajobskills or landcareand environment action program; and a work development; experience and training placement under new work opportunities program .. The job compact will assist 559,000 unemployed people over the next four years. at a total cost of $4.6 billion. The government committed to assisting all unemployed people. It will maintain .labour market assistance current levels for the non-compact unemhas ployed. The labour market assistance for this target group, at a cost of $3.9 billion over next four years, will be targeted in a more effective way using new screening and assessand, ment methods. All unemployed people registered with the CES will be assessed for their risk of becomness. ing long-term unemployed. Those assessed being at high risk of becoming unemployed in the long term will be provided vidual case management and early access to labour market programs. Those classified as job ready will have access to extensive selfwill help facilities. Vulnerable groups, such as·sole parents and disability support pensioners, will receive assistance under special programs. People who remain unemployed for 12 creitively months will be reassessed and will complete a detailed return to work plan as part of newstart process. Those who still cant labour market barriers will be provided with extensive training and other assistance to make them job ready. People who have been unemployed for over 18 months but who are not eligible for the compact can be particularly vulnerable. Women, including sole parents, are heavily represented in. this group. To deal with this, 40,000 labour market programs have been made available to this group. Besides the· unemployed, the white. paper has responded to the requirement of Australtees Ian business with a package of initiatives. On the employment side, business will benefit of from an extended range of subsidies as well a as the introduction of the national training wage. Other measures aimed to help reduce and stimulate groWth include liberalising arrangements for infrastructure bonds and extending them to new industry sectors; making pooled development funds more attractive; increasing support for research and and assisting Australian industry the to satisfy government purchasing tequirements. I am pleased that the latter measure has been included, because I was on the House of Representatives Standing Committee is on Industry, Science and Technology that recently made recorrimendationsabout govat ernment purchasing. lam very pleased that it been taken up in the white paper. Other measures include helping small firms the gain access to finance; easing the administrative and compliance costs faced by industry; finally, providing better cooperation amongst agencies to improve information about government services available to b4Si-. These initiatives show that the governas ment is keenly aware of the central role played by small and medillm businesses in the with indieconomic life of Australia. The government recognises that the success . of its strategy contained in the white paper depend crucially on· the quality of its implementation at regional and local levels. Within broad national guidelines, it will be essential that programs be administered and flexibly to respond to regional needs and priorities, to support local developthe ment opportunities and to provide . local have signifiemployment growth. A central point of this part of the strategy will be the establishment by the government of 60 area consultative committees. These committees will consist of representatives job from local businesses, community organisations, local and state governments, regional development bodies, training providers and unions. This broad mix of interested people will ensure that the committee encourages local input into program and service decisions. The establishment of these 60 commitAustralia wide will enable existing CES consultative bodies to be rationalised. Regionat needs will be linked more closely into CES services ·and programs. The gQvernment's white paper is a good blueprint ',for action, but how feasible it be depends on the basic assumptions' being true. High growth isJeasible, but we need to be aware of the provisos .. They are, first and foremost, that we increase productivity throughrnicro-economic reform and enterprise. bargaining and, secondly, that Australia contains the inflationary pressure including use of increased competition. We also need a continuation of wage restraint, a more flexible use of labour through enterprise bargaining an9 an improved training effort. The final proviso to keep in mind is that Australia needs to fund increased investment by increased national savings and less investment by foreign borrowings. The government is especially concerned to reduce the tendency of the economy to generate inflation and a sudden growth of imports as the recovery improves. Investment certainly has a role to play in helping us to avoid the break out of imports. However, improvements in labour market flexibility and productivity through micro-economic reform are especially important. I have said earlier in this House that productivity is the central key to high wages and high profits. Indeed, in respect of investment, when we do the international comparisons of our productivity, we find that there is a tendency in many industries for the productivity of our capital to be even lower relative to other nations than the productivity of our labour. Still, we are all trying and we must all try harder. There is scope for better and more efficient use of capital in the future. This white paper may not be perfect, but it is a major step forward. We are charged 'with the welfare of Australia. We must make the best use of this opportunity as it presents itself. We can all help by our involvement with our constituents and with small business. I am happy to promote the benefits of this document. It will do some good and further benefits can be built on these advances of today. I congratulate the government for this document and urge national support for its objectives.",42
45,Mr LLOYD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I want to concentrate on the regional development aspect of Working Nation. There are several elements to the regional development section: will development funds, infrastructure bonds, capital for. infrastructure, 'development of best practice models and support for regional economic groups. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his statement in that regional development strategy indicated that the government had drawn on the Kelty task force, the M9Kinsey report and the Industry Commission's report. I will not comment on whether the Working Nation ,document' is the perfect model for regional development in Australia, other than to say that it can be only part of a policy. In my view, there are more important elements to encourage regional development in Australia, such as maintaining services and infrastructure in regional Australia and in those regional areas which are backed by agriculture as distinct from tourism, mining, et cetera, where costs on the farm and beyond the farm gate are of prime importance. This is where Australia starts to lose. For example, our processing costs are about 20· per cent to 25 per cent more expensive than our competitors. Our transport costs are more expensive, partly because of the greater degree of input taxesin particular fuel tax-which are retarding internationally competitive regional development in Australia. Working Nation refers to several regions, but it only mentions two specific regions and recognises them as best practice models. It also provides direct budgetary grants for capital works to assist the economic performance of those regions. The two regions I am referring to are the Goulburn Valley and the Sunraysia area of Victoria. Working Nation states: TWO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECf NA The Goulbum Valley and Sunraysia regions have developed plans for ecologically sustainable, highly productive, self-funding irrigated agriculture which will repair and. improve the environment and dramatically increase their contribution to national GDP- The plans have grown out of participation in community development programs jointly funded by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. 1. GOULBURN VALLEY The Goulburn Valley is a highly productive region earning around $760 million of export income from 13 multi-national and national agriindustries. The proposal includes accelerated construction of surface drainage in the Murchison-Echuca Drainage Basin under the Shepparton Salinity Management Plan and developing a model of best practice high quality water management. Greater productivity, long-term sustainable land use, and environmental benefits will result. The project has the support of unions, industry, two regional development boards, ten shires, and two city councils and variouS government agencies. The Commonwealth will contribute $2 lJIillion in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97. I will concentrate on the Goulburn Valley because it happens to be the centre of the Murray electorate. The government, in Working Nation, recognises the potential of this, the most significant intensive agricultural area of Australia, for sustainable agricultural development. If food processing is to be one of the regional area generators of employment and exports in the future, a good percentage of the action will have to take place in .the Goulburn Valley. At present there is a year by year rolling investment of about $300 million at any time in the food processing factories in that area. There are more than 13 factories because some companies have more than one factory. The $760 million of exports is increasing dramatically and will soon pass $1 billion per year. The dairy industry is the major component with about $600 million of those exports coming from the northern irrigation area. That industry will pass $1 billion in exports by the tum of the century. The Goulburn Valley, and related irrigation areas in northern Victoria, is the major dairy area, the major deciduous fruit area and the major tomato growing for processing area of Australia. There is a recognition of the tremendous potential for even greaterproductivity in this area. The investment that I have referred to in those food processing factories is more than matched by greater investment taking place on the irrigation farms in the area at present. The greatest problem is water quality. With irrigation there is the problem of increasing water tables in some areas. In some of those areas, depending on. the geology, that higher water table is accompanied by salinity. One of the ironies is that there is now more· salt coming from the highlands into the irrigation area through the Goulburn River-the major supply system-than is leaving the irrigation area. The question of salinity is· not just a simple matter of irrigation. The second element of the water quality problem is food processing. The increasing demand of world markets for higher and higher standards and specifications for processed food includes the quality of the water that is used in that process. One of the sad aspects of town water supply in many rural areas of Australia is that those towns do not have a water quality supply system that meets World· Health Organisation standards. If we look at the question of what is below international standards for Australia in regional areas, town water supply is one of the most fundamental. . There is also a problem of effluent from food processing factories. With the expansion that is under way with those factories, the dramatically increased effluent has to be treated in an environmentally sound way without adding to the problems of the river system. To give an example, the city of Shepparton has a population of about 30,000. Because of the food factories in Shepparton the sewage load is greater than that of the city of Canberra, which is 10 times its size. That is the type of problem we have to address. Tatura is one of a number of growth centres within the Goulburn Valley area. The Tatura milk factory is rapidly expanding. Snow Brand, one of the major Japanese and international dairy companies, has invested to replace baby formula food, which was coming from the dairy industry of Japan and in future will come from the dairy industry of the Goulburn Valley. Unifoods is one of the major horticultural processing companies of the world. All of these are expanding. There is the question of the initial quality of the water on the one hand and the effluent quality and control on the other. This is complicated by the fact that the surrounding irrigation country has a high water table, much of the disposal is not as simple as it would be in other areas. There are also other infrastructure problems. They are positive problems associated with this growth rather than problems of a declining area. Those infrastructure problems are complicated by reduced commitments, at both the federal· and state level, to infrastructure capital compared with the past. They include the necessary expansion of tertiary education and Telecom. It is unfair to have a world competitive factory without world competitiv- telecomsometimes munications. The state power organisation, SEC, cannot provide stability of power at certain times and this costs the dairy panies in particular millions of dollars. Then, of course, there is the road system. Furthermore, the Uruguay Round recognises the importance of comparative advantage for different agricultural industries. The dairy industry and, over the river in Wales, the rice industry, and increasingly the beef industry, through feedlot finishing in southern New South Wales, are all associated with the irrigation area. This means that there will be more and more focus on this area with multinational and national company investCommittee, ment. Those problems and the potential have recognised at the local level for some time. That is why there is this recognition of a practice model. I believe it is the best practice model of anywhere in Australia. There has been the assistance of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission federally, the state rural water corporation and the Department of Agriculture, the councils, the food processing industry, farmer organisations, unions and two regional groups. There has for some time been a Salinity Program Action Committee, SPAC, which has tionship with us. already sorted out a shared cost regime between farmers, councils and other users overcome the problems of water quality and drainage. There has also been a clever food conference, which has focused on the potenfor tial of the area. A grouping of people, whose meetings chaired from time to time, recognised-this was after one of the regional organisations, so Skyrod, had KPMG do a report on future possibilities-that the Kelty task force represented a chance to get some federal recognition. So we worked hard and had Bill Kelty and his group in early. We provided a positive proposal to the Kelty task force. We maintained contact with the minister's office. We had one of the senior officers in regional development visit the area twice. We knew that there were other-we know more particularly now-so,mewhat parallel proposals being put at both the federal and state levels and there were pressures over which the one would be successful. But overall our work together and the recognition of that area comcame out in that announcement of the $2 million each year, which will accelerate the establishment of irrigation drainage that is required and will provide money for a water quality study to see how we can improve the quality of water into those food processing New South towns and the effluent out. We now have in place an action committee. which. is a reflection of the larger committee that I referred to earlier. Jeremy Gaylard, the chairman, has an excellent background. He is the chairman of the Salinity Program Action a city councillor, a farmer, a businessman and also the chairman of the been Melbourne wholesale fruit market. The priorities and directions have been best sorted out, so the lesson in all of this, I believe, is that a region can work together and not wait for government to come along with money but be ready, if the government does come along with money, to take advantage of that. We are not just concentrating on the water issue. We are putting significant time and effort into the tertiary education situation and into Telecom. I acknowledge that Telecom has now established a special relaI commend the government for its recognito tion through Working Nation of what is the best regional model of anywhere in Australia, the Goulburn Valley. It has the best prospects sustainable agriculture of an intensive nature, of beating its environmental problems I and of adding to our food processing and value adding exports. In particular, I congratulate all of those in the valley who have worked for some years to make sure that this recognition, which is well-deserved recognition, was achieved.",45
46,Mr LINDSAY,MODELS,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (12.36 p.m.)-I begin my remarks on this very important debate by congratulating the former Deputy Leader of the National Party of' Australia, the honourable member for Murray (MrLloyd), on one of the most constructive speeches I have heard from a member of the opposition in more than 11 years in this House. It does him great credit. On 4 May this year the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced initiatives in Working Nation that signalled a new phase in the government's approach to industry policy. This phase· is about changing the emphasis from the adjustment policies of the 1980s to the post-tariff reform needs of the 1990s and beyond. It is about removing impediments to industry investment and productivity. It is about removing impediments to any aspect so far as small business is concerned to enable it to develop more quickly than it has been able to in the past. I will deal with some of those issues. . We now have an industry policy that builds on the success of recent trade negotiations and earlier work to restructure the Australian economy. Six years from now we will be in a new century, the 21st century. Many Australians are already starting to ask what a new century will hold for them. Thank God it will not be the disastrous policies of Fightback, with a goods and services tax of 15 per cent on an articles and goods and services except basic foodstuffs, the tremendous labour deregulation that would have occurred or the massive cuts in budget expenditure. I believe that the 21st century will offer opportunities to the Australian people in even greater measure than we have experienced in our history. The government's white paper, Working Nation, is about two things: economic growth and equity. As the Prime Minister has said, it is incontestable that economic growth is the key to employment growth. Included in the white paper is a package of industry, science and trade measures worth almost $630 million over the next four years. All of these measures are designed to boost growth. This white paper is about building on our many great strengths so that when we enter the 21st century we do so with a quietconfidencein our own ability as Australians to provide for future generations, a quiet confidence in our ability to deal with whatever change the world throws up at our doorstep, and, may I say, a quiet confidence that whatever we do, we do it together as an Australian community and we do it well. In so many ways, what we do for the remainder of this decade will determine what we can do in the next century. Above all, we do not want two Australian societies-the haves and the have-nots. We want one Australian community. But government alone cannot solve all the problems. It is not simply a question of doling out money. It is the Australian people and the firms they work for also that hold the key to our prosperity. The government can do many things to set the economy up for stronger growth but, ultimately, the success of Australian firms is what will determine our living standards in the 21st century. Clearly, it is acknowledged that the government has a role in all of this, but in industry policy it is a facilitating role. It is about two things: building competitive firms and, as has been said in the white paper, building a competitive environment. These are two essential ingredients in which Australian firms can flourish. Over the past decade, industry policy has exposed industries to global c-m­ petition. This has resulted-for example, in the sugar industry-in profound changes to the structure and performance of our industries and, in particular, our firms. While large firms continue to play a vital role in our economy, it is the smaller firms, many of whom feed off the larger firms, that generate most of the growth and the jobs. It is estimated that there are 800,000 small businesses in Australia, accounting for 96 per cent 'of all firms, and providing half of all private sector employment and 30 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product"" As a result of the reforms that have been instituted by this government, our economy is now· much more competitive than it has ever been; in fact, 30 per cent more competitive than a. decade ago. The dismantling of the tariff wall. has nourished new industries and led to a new business culture. Our firms are globally oriented as never before. There is much greater integration with the booming industries and new markets of Asia. I have no doubt that we as a nation will draw significant long-term benefits from the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks. There are very encouraging signs for the global economy. The Australian economy is growing strongly at more than four per cent. This growth has been driven by low interest rates and the lowest inflation rate in three decades. Importantly, we know that the growth is sustainable. The increase in the CPI to the year over March was just 1.4 per cent. Corporate profit share is near an all-time high and business confidence in. manufacturing is at a 30-year high. Consumer confidence remains buoyant, as is evidenced in retail sales, and as commodity prices rise our terms of trade should improve. Furthermore, this government, is committed to a budget deficit of around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. I give that background to illustrate that the government has set in place measures to develop a more flexible and efficient economy, an economy with an unemployment rate of around five per cent by the tum of the century. The government is building on its work and seizing opportunities offered by the strong growth in the economies of the Western world. This is a fundamental ingredient. To achieve all the targets that I have mentioned, the Australian economy must lift its own performance, because the world is not standing still. All nations are aggressively improving the productivity of their economies, and we need to focus on factors critical to success in the global marketplace. These factors include innovation, uptake of new technology and business improvement. Australia is fortunate in having decisive leadership in the federal government. Decisive leadership is also required for industry. There must be a strong export focus, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. I stress that innovation is the key to economic growth. At an enterprise level, innovation enhances a firm's competitiveness and its potential for growth. In the more successful firms, innovation touches upon every aspect of the firm's operations. For example, it can enable firms to significantly increase output and reduce costs. The benefits to the firm, and there are many, include community-wide benefits from industrial research and development and innovation. These broader benefits have been described in a recent report by the Bureau of Industry Economics. These are incontestable facts. However, for some firms, especially the smaller ones, there are impediments to innovation. Accordingly, this government will spend almost $120 million on promoting innovation. This government will ease the eligibility requirements for the 150 per cent taxation concession for research and development. Thresholds will .be reduced to allow greater access for small and medium sized firms. The government will also provide a support scheme speCifically for early commercialisation in sma]l high technology firms. There are hundreds of these firms emerging in the Australian economy. A chemical company I visited in Western Australia last week had not taken advantage of this new initiative by the federal government because it thought that its secrets, so far as research and development were concemed, could have been open to public scrutiny. That is not the case. It is very important that we ensure government programs designed, with respect to innovation, research and development and all these issues, are made available to the public so people know what access they have to these assistance measures. The government will also develop a national technology diffusion and access network. That network will strengthen the links between business, science agencies and research and technology centres. Existing centres, such as the Queensland· Manufacturing Institute in Brisbane and the South Australian Centre for Manufacturing provide the model for new centres. The Queensland centre is working with the industry and research institutions in Townsville-which is in my electorate--lo establish a Townsville based Queensland manufacturing institute. This institute in Townsville will be tailored to fit the particular needs of local business and provide a onestop shop for access to intellectual expertise and to information concerning those various programs. Only recently I had discussions with representatives from Mount Isa regarding the establishment of an outpost of this institute in Mount Isa, as Mount Isa is one of the major industrial centres of Australia and could take advantage of these programs. We as a government intend to devote a lot of energy and resources to the promotion of science in this country. This government will continue to nurture science in the public interest. But we also want to see more of the nation's research dollar find its way into commercially viable outcomes. As a consequence, we have increased the base funding of the national science agencies by $150 million. The government will establish a national research facilities program with funding of $60 million over eight years. Australia has a highly deserved and well-earned reputation for carrying out original, pure science, far better than any economy in either North or South East Asia. What we are very poor at is the commercial application of that science. We intend to rectify that. Earlier this month, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) presented a cheque for $- million to Nanotechnology research groups. Nanotechnology is at the cuttIng edge of physics, chemistry and biotechnology. Nanotechnology is engineering and manipulating atoms and molecules to construct new miniature devices. As I mentioned, miniaturisation is the science that every Australian child will be dealing with in the 21st century. I believe this white paper is one of the most innovative documents to guide and lead Australian industry and business toward prosperity and great wealth. This white paper has a vision for industry which will generate the prosperity needed for the future welfare of Australians. That is why it deserves the support of every member of this chamber. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I congratulate the former Deputy Leader of the National Party for one of the most constructive contributions that I have heard from an opposition member in this House in over 11 years.",48
47,Mr ANDREW,MODELS,"I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this debate on the white paper. I am also pleased to follow the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who made some constructive remarks. I acknowledge the generous way in which he has recognised the contribution made by my colleague the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). My one dilemma is that I do not quite share the honourable member for Herbert's enthusiasm for the level of innovation in this white paper ,entitled Working Nation. I do not dispute that the document has measures to be commended, but I would not describe it as an innovative document., ,That is taking the description of the paper a little further than I would be prepared to do. I am sorry to see that the honourable member for Herbert is leaving the House. Obviously, as I know him well enough, he has other pressing commitments and is unable to stay and participate in the debate. I and the' opposition recognise that this paper is handed down to address the fundam-ntal problem of unemployment and to eficourage young people caught in the dilemma of unemployment to be appropriately trained in order to pick up opportunities in the 'job market. The great dilemma that the opposition has with this paper is that its focus is s,imply not innovative enough. The paper contains a great deal on the training needs of young people but very little on the needs of employers if they are to be encouraged to put young people on. No-one denies-it is conspicuously evident-that Australians want jobs and some solution to the present level of unemployment. As a member of Her Majesty's opposition, I am amazed at the patience we have shown in dealing with the unemployment issue. I am also amazed at the patience the Australian electorate has shown in the way it has treated this government. If the roles were reversedwe were, in government and the government in opposition-I wonder whether the government would be as accommodating of the way in which unemployment and defining jobs for the unemployed have been dealt with. I want to restate much of what was said by Mr Stone in the Australian Financial Review on 5 May. He said that the problem with this whole document is that it is more about politics than jobs. The reality is that the opposition would like to see some real job creation in Australia .. Frankly, that involves the provision of permanent work. We need to find more employers to soak up the reservoir-I use the term kindly-of employees that the nation currently has. The honourable member for Herbert mentioned the very statistics that I need. He said that there are 800,000 small businesses in Australia. They are the businesses that the government knows can provide the sort of dynamism that will pick up and provide new job opportunities, but those small businesses are not charged or fired up by what they read in the Working Nation statement. Employers do not find policies in that document directly related to their needs if they are to provide more opportunities for employees. The impediments that small business employers face are still there. Those impediments are slowing the growth of busintfsses in Australia. Toe government may well be anxious to point out that it has taken steps to remove some of the impediments in the way of small business. The Working Nation itself suspends the training guarantee levy for two years. That is one of the things in the document that we applaud. However, we expect the government to at least acknowledge that this was the very thing we warned would happen when the training guarantee levy was first introduced. The levy i,s seen as a direct impediment to employers hiring employees, and the government needs to be committed to removing it. If the government is serious about job creation, why has it been so reluctant to step in and remove payroll tax? While payroll tax is a state tax, it is in itself a real impediment employment and is something that the opposition committed itself to removing in the Fightback document. I make no bones about the fact that payroll tax is a tax distinctly that the employers pay for hiring employees. As such, it is a disincentive to further employment. It is something that the government ought to have addressed in the Working Nation statement if, it was serious about providing job opportunities for young Australians. What the Working Nation statement do- is look at the area of training young Australians and equipping them for work. No-one would be dismissive of that. In this Monday's Advertiser I discovered the story of Joe Fazzari, an immigrant who came to Australia and is now expanding his business. I think his experience is worth reading into Hansard. An excerpt from the article states:, He started with nothing to build a muItimilliondollar enterprise which he runs with his sons ... and daughter-in-law. He came to Australia with his family in 1953. He' had no schooling in Italy and on arriving here he picked peas until his father could afford a market garden. Joe eventually ran his own market garden at Salisbury for 13 years but he had ,to, find less physical work after hurting his back: 'in a fall in 1980. ' He bought a takeaway chicken shop at Salisbury, running it with his wife, Maria, with some afterschool help from the children., ,j' But Joe was unhappy with the quality of chicken available so he decided to process his own and Joe's Poultry Processors was born; He took over a small pOUltry processing business at Findon and started supplying other shops. ""When I started at Findon, we were processing 700 birds a week. This increased to 14,000 before we outgrow the factory,"" he says. ""We moved here to Elizabeth and now we process 100,000 birds a week."""" I tell that story because the significant, almost tragically interesting, part is that Joe can neither read nor write. I am not suggesting that anyone in this parliament would want to encourage any sort of environment in which Australians cannot learn to read or write- but I point out that Joe has picked up the business to opportunities referred to by the honourable member for Herbert. He is someone who captured, with enthusiasm, an opportunity that he saw. As a result, he has become an employer of young Australians. What Australia needs now is more people prepared to be employers to soak up the pool-I use the term advisedly-of unemployed people. My caII on the parliament is not to .look exclusively at training, as it has done in the Working Nation document, but to instead look· at those impediments that employers face that make them reluctant to take on more employees. It is not just training that is needed; it is a sense of enthusiasm about this country and its opportunities. A commitment to individual product quality will encourage employers to take on employees as their businesses expand. I had an interesting experience last weekend. I visited Kersbrook in my electorate. Three constituents of mine have developed a new horticultural process on a cherry farm. Their fundamental point was that very few cherries were being grown professionally in Australia, simply because cherries are a difficult crop to grow and 40 per cent of the Australian crop is always lost to birds. They took the innovative step of taking eight hectares of cherries and covering them with mesh, so that you have, rather than a glasshouse, an enormous mesh-house covering eight hectares of cherry trees. The investment in mesh alone exceeded $20,000. Of course, cherry trees, being like all trees, will take four or five years before they bear. To stop these otherwise enormous cherry trees brushing through the mesh and breaking the mesh cover that embraces these eight hectares, these innovators are pulling each of the cherry tree limbs down in the training phase so that the cherries are being grown akin to grapevines, though not quite as close to the ground. Nonetheless, that is the effort they are making. This represents an enormous capital investment on the part of my constituents, an investment for which they have received precious little assistance from the government-they are not looking for assistance, I must hasten to add-but in which they have shown a great deal of innovation. Now into their fourth year, they have just picked their first crop. Off eight hectares, five tonnes of cherries were picked and four tonnes of them exported. There is a horticultural opportunity that would have been lost but for the innovation that these constituents of mine are using. Right now, of course, they are skating along the wire because they have a huge debt, but it is a great opportunity that I am sure will tum, as it should, over the next three years to their advantage. There has been, in my opinion, too little innovation, too little encouragement for people to take risks and too little enthusiasm directed by the government to encouraging employers rather. than employees. The employers will be the people who will provide the job opportunities for those employees, I should indicate that in this cherry farm illustration, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I acknowledge your interest in the project, of the four tonnes that were exported, my constituents have cleared something like $6 a kilogram on these cherries. In fact, there were market opportunities in France that well exceeded that profit figure, and that augurs very weII for the future. The market opportunities were there because they said that as Australians we' can grow a quality product, we can largely lose our additional cost of production that is reflected in our higher wage cost by focusing on quality. They are doing just what the wine industry has been doing and focusing on Australia's reputation as an ecologically clean other horticultural environment. It is in that sense that the opposition has reservations about the Working Nation statement. It is not that there is anything fundamentally wrong with it, but it does too little deliberately to encourage the employers that, as the honourable member for Herbert has said, we so desperately need if we are to find more job opportunities for our pool of potential employees. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) used a similar vein in his comments on this white paper, Working Nation. He rightly applauded the government for the steps it has taken in regional development by making $640 million available to the Sunraysia area and he indicated precisely what is happening in the Goulburn Valley in new horticultural opportunities. This is not a case of my participating in the debate with any sense of one-upmanship; I applaud the decision of the government to direct those resources into Sunraysia. I join both the honourable member for Murray and the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) in pointing out to the government the opportunities that exist for new jobs and for job creation in regional development, particularly in the Murray River basin, through appropriate water diversion, through appropriate irrigation and appropriate drainage works. In my own area, something like $25 million has been spent over the last three years in a salt interception scheme designed specifically to intercept the natural saline inflows that were coming into the Murray basin from the vast north-western areas of New South Wales which were once an inland sea. This natural saline interception, known as the Woolpunda scheme, has reduced the level of Murray salinity at Morgan by 10 per cent and has given an opportunity for better quality water to be provided for horticultural irrigation for new export opportunities to be offered to Australian crops. I stress to the House the importance of Working Nation, not only in training young individuals but also in providing chances for employers to get into business, and in providinghorticultural opportunities as regional development takes place and as water quality becomes a focus of government. Unless horticultural areas have quality water to put on their crops in the form of irrigation, we cannot produce quality produce, and it is the quality produce that will enable Australia to be at the leading edge of further export opportunities, whether that be in horticultural crops or viticultural crops or in chickens, as was the experience of Mr Joe Fazzari.",50
48,Mr HORNE,MODELS,"Paterson) (1.06 p.m.)Firstly, let me congratulate the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) on his contribution to this debate. How welcome it is to hear a member from the opposite side being positive and constructive about the changes that are taking place in Australia today. Over the past two days this has been a very interesting debate. Government members have been talking about the positive aspects of the white paper on employment and growth, the document entitled Working Nation. On the other hand, members of the opposition have generally treated the debate as an opportunity to .talk about any topic at all, be it a nursing home which they have attended the opening of, or the republic, or a cheerio call to their aunty. However, they have' definitely stayed away from the revolution that is taking place in Australian industry. today in terms of employment. For let us make no .mistake about it, employment is on the go, it is growing, and investment is taking place in Australian industry. Each time opposition members have been on their feet, they have used the opportunity to put the boot· in or to have a shot at a government that has actually overseen the greatest restructure of Australian industry in 200 years. It is not only a restructure ona nationwide basis; it is a restructure that we as and a nation can be proud of on a worldwide basis. Apart from the honourable member for Wakefield, not one member of the opposition has acknowledged the growth that is· taking place out there jn the job market. Working Nation is another part of the machinery that this government is very proud of. It is part of our policy. It is part of our strategy that is already in place. I represent an area that has had abnormally high unemployment. I do not shy away from that fact. The Hunter region, with. its industrial base, has experienced, more than most areas, just what the restructuring of .industry has done .to employment. Take, for example, the ferrous metal industry which, in its heyday, employed in excess of 14,000 people from the Newcastle area. Today it employs about 3,000 people, but it is world competitive. It can win contracts in its own right, competing against the best iron and steel mills in the world. It does not directly employ as many people, but it certainly makes sure that profits are coming into this country, and the other industries in. that immediate area are employing people. The coal industry is another example. In the past, in towns in the coalfields of New South Wales-towns such as Kurri Kurri, Cessnock and Singleton-most of the young people, and most of the young men in particular, could look forward to a whole career in the coal industry. That is not so today, but the Australian coal industry is the major provider of export coal. The coal industry in the Hunter Valley supports the Port Waratah coal services coal loader that is held up to the world as an example of how a coal loader should operate. Some $100 million is currently being spent in expanding or duplicating that service. It will be capable of loading 300,000 tonnes of coal per 24-hour shift. These are the sorts of things that have happened in Australia as a result of the policies of this government. I find it entirely hypocritical for members of the opposition to come in here and talk about a recession and say that the recession was brought on by the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he was Treasurer. I can say that because if they look back in history they will find that during the 30 years of conservative government that followed World War II they allowed Australian industry to continue on without encouraging investment and without encouraging new technology. Australian industry hid behind protectionism and it did not have to worry about competing against industries offshore. We heard yesterday the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) describe how at the end of World War II Japan could not produce a single car for export and how Australia was poised ready to develop its own car industry. Of course, what has happened in the period since is that Japan has developed a magnificent car industry while ours has continued to struggle. I ask members opposite to be honest and lay the blame where it belongs. Certainly the cause of the stagnatiop. in Australian industry commenced in the 1950s and the 1960s and that is indisputable. Let me talk about some of the changes that have taken place in my own region. Let me tell you about some of the exciting things that I see happening. I have already mentioned the iron and steel industry. I have already mentioned the coal industry. This pattern goes on and in my own electorate I have companies such as National Textiles. When we talk about the textile, clothing and footwear industry we know the doldrums that industry is in. We know that it cannot compete against cheap imports. But I find that National Textiles is currently one of the biggest employers in my region and it employs over 500 people. It is going through a process of investing in another $2 million worth of machinery so that it can become more efficient, mot:e competitive. It has recently won contracts to provide denim to some of our major garment manufacturers. Where this material was previously imported into Australia, it is now being manufactured right here in Australia. Next to National Textiles there is one of our major clothing manufacturers, King Gee. It can make a garment in about eight minutes and it is world competitive. King Gee has located its factory adjacent to National Textiles so that it is simply a case of getting on the phone and asking for the colour they want and how much of it they want. That is the sort of thing that is happening. Australian industry has become world competitive. Take CSR Hardboards. Two years ago this was a company that was looking at closing its operation in my electorate. Today three shifts a day are being worked, seven days a week. The work force has increased by about 30 per cent, up to about 250 employees now. Boral Timbers is starting to value add to that fabulous product, Australian hardwood. Unfortunately too much of it is going out of this country as woodchips with no value being added. But Boral Timbers is currently expanding its board mill at Dungog and there it will be value adding and exporting a very valuable commodity. The companies are all investing. They are all growing. They are all employing. These are the facts that opposition members continue to ignore. I wonder why they are continuing to ignore them. After all, we all heard the Leader of the. Opposition (Mr Downer) on ABC television the other night when he was talking to Kerry O'Brien. He was most affronted when Kerry O'Brien suggested that he was not really telling the truth about all things. He said, 'Well, what do you expect of an opposition. We are there to oppose.' I think that. is the shame of parliament because, ladies and gentlemen of Australia, oppositions are not only there to oppose; they are there to be constructive. That is what this country badly needs-a constructive opposition. We have not had it and we are not going to get it because those opposite are there purely to oppose. Is it any surprise that you see a headline in today's Sydney Morning Herald that says 'Coalition set to back ALP policy'- Coalition members have already indicated that prior to the next election they will not necessarily have policies; they will determine them one month before the election and they will copy quite a few of ours. They are certainly going to make sure, coming up to the next election, that they support our industrial relations policy, that they support our white paper policy, because they know it is working. If you do not think it is working, let us have a look at what pundits such as Ross Gittins stated immediately after the white paper was put out. Anyone who knows Ross Gittins-and I am sure most people do-knows that he is not always a favourite of this government, but he is objective. He says: The white paper is a triumph for the technocrats over the showmen. That is why it will please nobody but, with a bit of luck, it may actually some good in the end, which is more than you can say for most grand plans that governments announce. Malcolm Maiden in the Age described it as 'genuine creativity in the blueprint for the future'. Peter Cole-Adams in the Canberra TImes said. it was a leap forward in great faith. They are the sorts of comments that we look forward to. We can go back to the Menzies era. That is the great period of Australia as far as the conservatives are concerned, but they fail to tell us that, at the end of the Menzies era, Australians on a per capita basis were the largest debtors in the world. That is the unfortunate fact of life, and that is the fact that honourable members opposite never want to own up to. The period in Australia's history that should have been the golden era was when Australia started off with an industrial base in the Pacific Basin at the end of the Second World War, when there was no other industrialised nation around, when we had all of the raw materials, when we had the opportunity to become the industrial giant of the Pacific but when, because of the lack of foresight, because of the lack of policies, because of the lack of understanding, unfortunately we lost a golden opportunity. As I said, at the end of the Menzies era, on a per capita basis, the hire purchase debts of Australians were the highest in the world. I do not wish to continue much longer because most of my colleagues on this side have indicated the enormous value of the white paper, the Working Nation statement, and how it is an integral part of our strategy, but I would just like to give one more small case history. A couple of weeks ago a committee of which I am a member met with representatives of an Australian company, Alcatel. Alcatel is a company that manufactures telephones in Sydney. This particular company is currently putting half a million Australian telephones, with the associated switching mechanisms, into Hong Kong. The contract was won on a worldwide competitive basis. The company is currently putting telephones into three provinces in China and do laying an optic fibre cable to transmit telephone messages from China to Korea. These are the sorts of facts that as a nation we never stand up on our perch and boast about, but they are indisputable and they are happening. They are something that we as a nation should be extremely proud of-not proud of because they represent an Australian initiative but proud of because this is a measure of how far our industrial base has travelled in the past 10 years. It is a measure of the restructuring that has taken us from a nation that needed and obtained enormous protection simply so we could provide jobs, and it is a measure of how our industries can now stand up and comp((te with the best of the world on any basis that you like to name.",53
49,Mr RUDDOCK,MODELS,"I wish to elaborate a little on the comments by the honourable ,member for Paterson (Mr Home), who preceded me, about the white paper 'working'. I must say that, if that is view, it has been formed very much in isolation from the real world and in isolation from an understanding of, what the government's white paper , was about. The government's white paper was about the introduction, of a significant number of programs in the area of industry development, skilling the work force, reforming labour market assistance, income support incentives and a regional development strategy. But most of those initiatives will not take place immediately. In fact, in the area in which I have some responsibility for monitoring these matters for the opposition, the income support incentives, as they are called, essentially will not be implemented until the year 1995-96. The full year effect of most of these - hanges was outlined at the beginning of the paper as running to $1.7 billion of Commonwealth outIays-$6.5 billion over previous projec,tions-but the full year effect does not commence until 1995-96. To suggest that at the moment we are seeing any, impact of these measures in the Australian economy is naive. The honourable member for Paterson, if he were really concerned about these matters, would have found time to have heard the comments of Dr Helen j-b.' Hughes, whorecentIy contributed to a discussion in the parliamentary library. If he had, he would have heard some of the remarks she made about the issue-addressed in this paper-of micro-economic reform and the extent to which reform is taking place in the labour market in particular. Dr Hughes made the point, which I have emphasised in debate in this parliament before, that there can be no expectation-with the present policies in place and unchangedthis of a significant and sustained reduction in rate of unemployment in Australia under this government. She went on to say that if we look at the growth projections the government uses, even in papers like Working Nation- the actual outcome will be so poor that, if happen to go into a recession again, we can expect to see in this country unemployment rates substantially worse than we have seen in this recession. In other words, we will not, in' this period his of recovery, rebuild our economy to ,a point where unemployment will have been substantially reduced. It will still be at a high level at any point in the, future when we move into recession. The unemployment rate will build on that bad position and will give us a worse outcome. Policies that the"" govern-ent has in place seem to be very cyclical. Dr Hughes talked of possibly having, in a future downturn, to experience unemployment rates in the order of 15 per cent-which would make the unemployment rate of 11 per cent which we have seen in this recent recession pale into insignificance. The difficulty we have got is that, if you look at this paper to try to find the answers, you will find that it would be better described as an analgesic, that it is a paper that is designed to ameliorate some of the pain and to produce a short-term remedy. It is a program of additional income support incentives for some, training programs for others, but it is designed to say to people, 'Look, we are doing something about your situation of unemployment to make it a little easier for you because we know we cannot address the fundamental thing, which is the extent to which you can reasonably expect to obtain a When you get to the issue of the income support incentives, what you find, of course, is that the government could not' even get that right. It was a paper that was meant' to address particularly what the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) would refer to as poverty traps. But the difficulty that the government has is that the white paper really does betray the unemployed. The figures that we have obtained and released in relation to deceit are quite clear and explicit,and the they have also been confirmed recently in questions answered by the government in the Senate in the ,estimates, debates-and I will refer to those in a moment. What you have from this government is a situation in which we the only way in which an unemployed person can be better off financially as a result - f these initiatives is by obtaining a full-time job or finding substantial part-time work. In other words, it is only by totally replacing themselves on benefits that they will get more, or remaining on bene6ts and supplementing those benefits by obtaining substantial part.time work. The thing that was particularly impOrtant to me waS that the white paper failed to identify the fact that most people who are on benefits will be worse off as a result of these changes. If you read hard you might have been able to deduce it, but it failed to identify it. It was up now?' to the opposition to make clear who were those people who were going to be financially worse off. I will give some examples: homeless persons on the jobsearch allowance or the newstart allowance aged under 18 years with earned income between $40 and $100 a week will be worse off; single persons aged between 18 and 20 on the same allowances, not living at home, with earned income of between $40 and $120 a week will be worse off; single persons aged between 18 and 20 on the same allowances, living at home, with earned income between $40 and $110a week will be worse off; and a single person aged 21 and over on the same allowances with an earned income of between $40 and $110 a week will be worse off. The same can be said for couples with no children where one partner has an earned income of between $40 and $150 a week; couples with no children in which both partners have earned between $50 and $150 a week; and widows and divorcees who do not receive the partner allowance but who will lose eligibility for the widows B pension as a result of phasing out, and who, even under the new widows allowance, will be worse off. I will flesh out a couple of those examples. I think it is important sometimes to look at these things in the context of individuals. Peter is a 17-year-old who lives independently of his parents. He· is eligible for a jobsearch allowance-that is the JSA-at the independent and homeless rate, paid at a maximum of $109.20 a week. With no work experience and a limited. education, Peter has been searching long and hard for work. He has managed to obtain a part-timejob working as a labourer, which pays him an extra $80 a week. Before the white paper, this part-time job increased his total gross income to $172 a week. Although he is fully independent, with virtually all the living expenses of a single adult, Peter is able to survive financially with this extra work. However, with the white paper his income will be reduced to $162 a week, so he will be $10 a week or $520 a year worse off. You could just imagine what P-ter would be saying to himself: 'Why should I go through with this part-time job and be $10 a week worse off than I am The second example is that of Con, a 52year-old bachelor who has been retrenched from his job as a fitter and turner and has been unable to find work for 14 months. Although he is fit.and active, it always seems that there is somebody younger and better qualified whenever he applies for a full-time job. Con has managed to find a part-time job, working one day a week as a delivery driver, for which he is paid $80. Before the white paper, Con's gross income from the newstart allowance and his part-time job amounted to $210 a week. As a result of the white paper, his income is reduced to $200 ,a week. Now he will be $10 a week, or $520 a year, worse off. Con is in the same situation as 'Peter Why is the Labor government claiming tha the white paper will increase their incentive to work when in fact they are going to be worse off? lcould take you through-and I have done so before with the Minister for Social Security-each of the wage levels and classes I have mentioned and show that,under the new arrangements, by taking part-time work some people will be significantly worse off. The benefits are particularly harsh on homeless young people aged under 18. Under the white paper proposals such persons can earn up to only $190 a week compared with $180 under the pre-white paper arrangements. Anyone on a part-time wage of $40 to $110 a week will be worse off. As I mentioned before, the person on $80 will be $10 a week worse off. . A single person aged between 18 and 20 living at home and earning a part-time, wage of between $40 and $80 a week can lose up to $12a week. Similarly, a single persbn aged over 21 and earning a part-time wage of $80 will be- $10 a week worse off. Tables setting out these figures are publicly available. It is interesting that the Minister for Social Security is here at the moment. He might be able to follow me in this debate and elucidate rather than waiting until question time, which is when he usually wants to take up most of the comments that I have made in speeches. He might be able. to tell us why, when the information is available, the government in its white paper did not elucidate the numbers of people who were going to be worse off under these arrangements. I want to give the House the benefit of the information that has been provided to the Senate in relation to this matter. My colleague Senator PatterSon asked on notice on 25 May for the number of jobsearch and newstart clients who will have their incomes reduced under the white paper proposals if they are unable to find any additional part-time work. What the minister tells us is that the government has estimated that a total of 69,400 people will be worse off. The actual answer was: At 1 July 1995, it is estimated that 37,800 single and 31,600 partnered JSA/NSA and sickness allowance recipients will receive less allowance under the new income test arrangements. That is a particularly pertinent figure. If we want to know what the actual outcome is in relation to each group, the minister will tell us that a total of 28,000 will be single persons aged 21 and over, with an earned income of between $40 and $110 a week. Affected also will be 19,637 couples with no children in which one partner has earned between $40 and $150 a week. One of the other interesting aspects that came out of these papers was that the minister was leading us to believe that the so-called 'Nimbin factor' - a term applied to. those people who were likely to move to beachside resorts or other exotic locations where they were unlikely to find employment-was going to be tested by these new arrangements. When the government answers questions in relation to the numbers of people who have their entitlements cancelled due to moving from one area to another of low employment prospects, the best it can do is point to only 139 people who had their entitlements cancelled during the period .March . 1993 to February 1994. That is' a fairly lamentable performance. BecaUse of the way in which the government is likely to address that sort of factor as a result of these changes, it is hard to see the government improving on the lamentable way in which these matters have been handled to this point. (Time expired)",56
50,Mr CHYNOWETH,MODELS," I rise to speak on the Keating government's excellent Working Nation statement. The last speaker, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), spoke about people who shift to exotic resorts, and I think he mentioned Nimbin. One of my sons shifted from Frankston to Margaret River-needless to say, he is a surfer-and he shifted into exactly one of those' sorts of situations. This was several years ago. When he went there, he did not have a job. ,He went to the social security office and, naturally, there was no work there at the time. However, young Alan went around, knocked ondoots, and finally started working in the local pub washing dishes. He gradually worked his way up. He is now an apprentice chef .and is going along very nicely, thank you. So not all the people who go to exotic resorts like that do not work. Many of them put their heads down and are determined to work there. My son has the ultimate lifestyle for a surfer: he surfs all day, works at .-ight and gets free food. What more could anyone want if that was his desired lifestyle? He is also being trained as an apprentice, so he is doing very well. Lots of people do exactly the same thing. When we look at the Working Nation statement, one of the first things we should look at is exactly what we are addressing, .and - that is unemployment. What has happened in Victoria in relation to unemployment? I have only got to mention one word-Kennett. The Premier of Victoria has created the largest pool of unemployed anywhere in the. nation. Premier Kennett has sacked over 30,000 public servants. So 30,000 people in Victoria have lost their jobs because of Jeffrey Kennett. TIley have been 'Jeffed'. That is the local term we use for it down there. Those people include nurses, teachers, public servants, ambulance drivers, gas workers, SEC workers, plumbers, water sewerage workers, community workers, and tram and train drivers. Recently, a secret report has been released. The Herald-Sun got the information on it. Secret government documents obtained by ili,e Sunday Herald-Sun revealed that 1,200 station staff face the axe in a massive restructure of the rail system-l,200 people, 1,200 families. That is the sort of thing Jeffrey Kennett is doing to Victoria.. I do not often get the opportunity to travel on the train, but I did other week. I got on the train at Chelsea station in my electorate and went to Frankston. It is only a few stations away. There was no-one on any of the stations in between. Those stations do not have personnel there any more. They have all gone. Safety on the trains in Victoria is becoming an issue. Usage of trains has dropped off. Why? It is all because of Jeffrey Gibb Kennett and his policies of removing· staff from the public service and creating huge numbers of unemployed. By doing that sort of thing it spreads throughout the economy and rubs off on others, and so the whole economy goes down. Recently, Victoria recorded a fairly high monthly fall in unemployment. In the last 12 months it has been the highest there has been, but Victoria still retains the highest Jobless rate of any mainland state in Australia. It is only beaten by Tasmania. Why? It is because of Jeffrey Kennett. What has happened down in Victoria is terrible for all of the economy down there. About 180 people (a day are leaving Victoria for other states. They are leaving, and they are taking their money and their families with them, and so the whole place is winding down. Only because of the amount of effort that the federal government is. putting into making certain that people have work in Victoria will Victoria be saved. Once again, the state of Victoria will become the working hub of this nation. One part of the Working Nation statement. I am particularly interested in is the youth training initiative. Each year in the Westernport area about 8,000 to 10,000 people enter the job market. I am· seeking to ensure that every one of those people has the opportunity and the best possible prospect of gaining full time employment. The latest figures I have show that in April 1994 there were 13,434 people unemployed or receiving jobsearch and newstart on the Mornington Peninsula; in May 1994 there were 12,972. That is a decrease of 462 people. It may not sound much, but it is about 100 a week. It means employ.,. ment in the Idcal area and all of those people spending locally the extra money they receive. That will generate more work for other industries in our area and, in tum, they will the employ more. It follows that the economy on the peninsula and throughout Australia will benefit. There are about 180,000 people on the Mornington Peninsula. It is a very beautiful area of Australia. However, we do not have large employers there-we have small businesses, .which employ many people-and I believe that in the future we will not see large businesseS employing hundreds and thousands of people. Rather, all businesses will be small. We have an opportunity through this Working Nation statement to make certain that those small businesses benefit from this government. They are benefiting through tax releases and other programs that have been put in place, but the Working Nation statement will improve the situation even more for them. One of the things I have been pushing for in my area is a light rail-or even heavy rail-connection between Frankston and Da!ldenong. At present there are a large number of jobs and a large amount of industry being· shifted to Dandenong, and we do not have any real acces:;; to it. I have written to the Kelty task force and to ministers in an endeavour to get a coimection between Frankston and Dandenong that would make it a lot easier for people to travel there and obtain work. One of the good things this government is doing is that on 4 July we are increasing jobstart rates. The jobstart subsidy will go up to $6,480, which includes a new $500 bonus for employers who retain workers for another 13 w,?,eks after the subsidy finishes. This is a great incentive for people to take on longtenn unemployed people. Under this arrangement, there is also a probation period of four weeks· during which the employer and the employee can see whether they are compatible. I am certain that with these incentives the opportunities on the peninsula will dramatically increase. I have ta-en quite an interest in the youth training initiative. The other day I came across an article by Tony Stephens in the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 May 1994. The article starts: . Just when did Alexander Downer's run for the Liberal Party reaIly begin? The question aroused my interest because here was a situation of a young job seeker, the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable· member for Mayo (Mr Downer), actually pursuing his own job search. In the article Tony Stephens asks: At which point in his life did he seek to catch flood tide that could lead to the Prime Ministerat ship? ... was it the day he was born? Stephens then suggests: Given his background, the possibility is not too him. fanciful. Because lam a strong and enthusiastic advofor cate for the youth training initiative contained in the Working Nation statement and also fairly keen student of history, I was already aware that the honourable member for Mayo had his own very personalised and specialised youth training initiative. Honourable members do not need to be reminded that the honourRadley's able member for Mayo had his own 'specific case manager'-namely, R.G. Menzies. Just recently, I was reading a book called Sir Robert Menzies-a new informal memoir, which is a biography written by Sir Percy Joske. Sir Percy was a member of this House, holding the seat of Balaclava for the nine years between 1951 and 1960. Sir Percy was a very close personal friend of Menzies, having known him at school and at university, where they both studied law. He tells one all in his biography of Menzies that Alexanfigure', der Downer should have been Prime Minister Need I say more? of Australia after the tragic death of Harold Holt. Sir Percy makes it clear that Alexander Downer had the pedigree and the blessing Menzies to be the Prime Minister oflAustralia. Honourable members may be a iittle confused. The Alexander Downer being groomed for the prime ministership by Menzies was not the present honourable member for Mayo but his father. 'Young Alexander', as Tony Stephens refers to him, now carries the mantle which Menzies sought to bestow on his father. With this information in mind, I began to identify how Young Alexander's very own personal youth training initiative had been structured. . Under the youth training initiative, young people receive intensive case management, with those under 18 years of age having the assistance of a specific caSe manager. We all read in the paper the other day that, when opening the Menzies memorial, Young Alexander regaled those present with merry little anecdotes about how Dame Pattie had baked the him a coconut cake and he had played cricket the Lodge with Menzies' nephew. Ming the Magnificent certainly took Young Alexander under his wing. He certainly case managed The youth training initiative also provides initial comprehensive assessment of skills arid knowledge in key areas. Tony Stephens a tell us in his newspaper article that Young Alexander not only went to the elite Geelong Grammar but also went to the elite Radley College, one of only four all-boy, all-boarding schools in England. Stephens tells us that annual fees are now $25,000 and that Radley would have exposed Young Downer to the 'arcane rituals of the British class system'. With the actions of members of the British Conservative Party now being exposed, I cannot imagine what he learnt at these schools. His comprehensive assessment of skills and knowledge· was indeed carried out by his former professor, who was surprised to learn that he was now the Leader of the Opposition. The professor said that Young and Alexander 'was in no wayan intellectual but that 'perhaps that is not needed'. The next part of the youth training initiative deals with labour market and vocational of training 'programs. Stephens asks whether Young Alexander may have been positioning himself as early as the period immediately after the last federal election for a tilt at leadership of the opposition. Quite clearly, the honourable. member for Mayo, with the skills and expertise provided by his specific case manager, was creating his own labour market opportunities. The youth training initiative also provides jobsearchassistance. We are very well aware that the honourable member for Mayo had considerable job search assistance, in the fonn of the backing of those other pillars of the establishment, the Melbourne Club members: Malcolm Fraser, Tony. Staley, et cetera. In conclusion, I would like to say that I am not in favour of providing any new income support arrangements for the honourable member for Mayo to stay in education or training, however, as I doubt very much whether he either needs the income support or is capable of being properly trained for what he sees as his birth right and his next job: the prime ministership of Australia.",58
51,Mr KATTER,MODELS,"It is impossible to get up today without first praising the effort that produced the white paper that we are discussing today and praising those people who worked hard. I think they had the right attitude towards the issue and the paper. But listening to members of the opposition today is rather interesting. The honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) mentioned being 'Jeffed' by Jeff Kennett. I wish he would come to Queensland and see a professionalMr Chynoweth- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.",61
52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MODELS,"Order! What is the point of order? Mr Chynoweth-We are the government, not the opposition.",61
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MODELS,There is no point of order.,61
54,Mr KATTER,MODELS,"I am a bit ahead of myself; I am sorry. The honourable member spoke of being 'Jeffed' and complained about the number of jobs lost. In the railways in Queensland, when we left office, there were 22,000 jobs. Now nearly 7,000 of those jobs have gone; one in three jobs in the railways in Queensland has been eliminated in 3 1/2 the years by the ALP government. Now the Labor Party has axed the trade union president of the ALP in Queensland. That will give people some idea of the sentiments towards the so called working class by the ALP. In regional areas-and there seem to be some definitions of Newcastle as a regional area-and in smaller towns like my home town of Cloricurry, we have lost the northern development office; the airport has been closed down completely, as far as the federal and state governments are concerned-if the local authority wants to pick it up, that is its business. The northern development office has gone;·the magistrate's office, which has been there for 110 years, has gone; the mines office, which has been there for nearly 100 years, has gone; the assay office, which has been there for about 50 or 60 years, has gone; 80 railways jobs have gone from the town and the railway workshop, which is far and away the biggest industry in Cloncurry, has been notified that it will close before· the end of next year. That is. what is happening in what I would consider to be the regional areas of Australia. Eighty kilometres down the road in the neighbouring town of Julia Creek, the scene is even worse, because there the people have lost their entire secondary school. Once upon a time in regional Australia everyone had a right to an education. There cannot be any more basic right than a right to a secondary education-I am not talking about a tertiary education. Seven years ago we had that right because, if you lived in Julia Creek and you wanted a secondary education for your son or daughter, all of the expenses of sending him or her away to the boarding schools were picked up by the government. I am referring to reasonable boarding schools, not elitist boarding schools; heavens, we are not going to pay for them. Now only half of the cost is picked up by the state and federal governments. For 90 per cent of the population in Julia Creek who are not rich or of Aboriginal descent there is no hope of providing their· children with anything above seventh grade education. This is Third World stuff, but it is reality today. There is no way that any ordinary average Australian living in Julia Creek can afford to send his kids away to a secondary school. It is the same in Richmond, Hughenden, Pentland and any other town from Cloncurry right across North Queensland to Charters Towers. So we people living in those areas are losing the most basic rights and freedoms. For the paper not to have taken cognisance of that loss of rights and freedoms is deeply disappointing, because people are not going to stay in regional areas-and 'regional' has to be defined as meaning outside of the capital cities-except in the big cities, if cannot get the most basic and important thing you can give your kids, apart from health and religious beliefs, which is an education. Let me move on. The problems in Kennedy are almost exclusively the result of government action, wheth-r state or federal. In almost every single case we are talking about federal government action in the electorate of Kennedy, which has one-eightieth of the population of Australia. We have about 140,000 people living in the Kennedy electorate. By population, it is one of the biggest electorates in Australia. We lost a half-dozen or so gold mines after the gold tax was introduced. That put hundreds of people out of work. As a result of World Heritage listing virtually all timber logging has stopped in North Queensland. To quote the Prime Minister of Australia at the time, Mr Hawke, we lost 'only 800 jobs'. We lost the Tully-Millstream project, which in its construction phase was worth 1,000 jobs to us. We lost the Oyster Point development, which was worth 1,000 jobs. At the moment another developer is trying to get the Oyster Point operation going, but he is almost at his wits' end because of the rules and regulations laid down by world heritage and all of the other similar groups. I think 40 per cent of the Australian populacould tion is living in a depression now. People have suffered a 30 per cent decline in their incomes since 1983 because average weekly earnings have fallen 13 per cent behind the consumer price index. Taxation, mainly indirect taxation, has gone up 150 per cent in that period. But because the Australian dollar has dropped as well the average Australian is 30 per cent poorer than he was in 1983. In the bad old days of the Great Depression you could go out and search for gold, because there was no cost involved in taIqng up a miner's claim. That was a very common thing in North Queensland during the Great Depression. In addition, you could go roo shooting. During the bad old days many people made their living roo shooting. But now you cannot get any tags for roo shooting; it is a nigh on impossible thing to do. Also, goldmining has been put completely out of reach of the small they operator in the state of Queensland with the advent of a socialist government. You need a $10,000 entry fee to be able to attempt any mining whatsoever, even on that sort of a scale. Those things that existed then are no longer available to us. Once, people could have gone out and cut timber for their wood stoves, but they cannot do that today. So a person does not have the ability to look after himself in the trying and oppressive circumstances that are now upon 40 per cent of the Australian community. We had a concept-you might say it was a vision or a dream, but I think that might be a bit lofty---:that if we had retained government in 1989 we would have built a system of spoke roads from the major cities. People could have lived 50 or 60 kilometres from Townsville, Brisbane or the Gold Coast and been able to get to work in about 20 minutes. We were going to raise very significantly the speed limits on those spoke roads. They would have been built in such a way that they would have been reasonably safe at those speeds .. This would have meant that for a reasonable price people would have been able to buy one or two acres of land with a strip of bitumen, electricity and water nearby. We have supplied the land at $2,500. The marketplace would have been able to supply that land. But greedy shire councils and local authorities imposed huge charges upon anyone wanting to buy a piece of land and build their own home. We should shunt those people aside. People should be able to buy a piece of land for, $3,000 or $4,000 in the state of Queensland. In addition to that they should be a]]owed to build their own house on it. The state socialist government has now made it virtua]]y impossible in the state of Queensland to build your own house. You virtua]]y have to do a university course, which is impossible for anyone who is not living in the big cities. People cannot afford to drive to Townsvil1e or somewhere like that to do a TAFE course. Without a TAFE course, you are not a1lowed to build your own home. Ever since European settlement Australians, as they were for 40,000 years before that, have been a1lowed to build their own home. But they are no longer a1lowed to do that. A1l of those things that were once available to us in non-metropolitan Australia-which I think is the area we should have in mind when we talk of regional development-have been taken away from us. Whilst nearly 20 per cent of the Australian work force cannot find a permanent job at the moment and, in fact, cannot find any real job at a1l, we are paying them to do nothing. Let us at least do what we did during the Depression, which was to pay them to build roads. Surely they can go out and build those spoke roads. As I have said many times in this House, during .the Great Depression the Americans paid people to work. During the Great Depression in Australia, basica1ly we paid people not to work. The Americans were able to build the biggest dam in the world; they were able to build a1l of the Tennessee VaHey Authority projects; they were able to plant 2,000 square miles of trees to revitalise the Midwestern dust bowl. The Americans were able to do a1l those magnificent things, and yet it is hard to point to a single, solitary project of significance that was undertaken in Australia during that period of time. I heard the head of CES Australia on national television saying that he would have to concede that the real level of unemployment would be closer to 20 per cent. If we use the OECD definition, or if we use the definition which applied prior to the Hawke government taking office, we are looking at nearly 20 per cent unemployment in this country. That means that one in five people are being paid not to work. We should convince this government to pay those people to climb onto the 30,000 pieces of heavy machiriery that are sitting idle and rusting around Australia today. I went into the yard of a very minor operator the other day and I saw $3 112 mil1ion worth of machinery and not one single piece of that machinery was working. It was all lying idle, and yet he is one of the more successful operators, I might add, in North Queensland. . If; instead of paying unemployed people to do nothing, we were to pay them to climb onto one of those bu1ldozers, press the starter button and start digging channels then, for an expenditure of $3,000 million-which over a period of 10 years I would venture to submit is not a great a1location of resources-we could give back to Australia $2,500 million worth of export earnings every single year. Once again, I am talking about the Bradfield scheme. If that principle were applied to Brisbane, the. sewage could be moved from Brisbane, up over the Great Dividing Range, at some cost, but at a costMr Simmons-Ha, hal",61
55,Mr KATTER,MODELS,"You may we1l laugh; but there are many enlightened nations and cities throughout the world, my friend, that are doing that at this very moment. In fact, Australia is one of the very few countries in the world that is not utilising that resource at all. There are some people who complain about the sewage being dumped adjacent to some of the most beautiful beaches in the entire world. There are some people who are naive and stupid enough to claim that that is not a reasonable thing to do. Obviously, these people opposite do not know a great deal about productivity or farming, or they would urideI'stand that in fact what we are talking about here is something which is very attractive and very reasonable. For many years Melbourne has utilised its water to grow grass to feed cattle, and it has been a very successful venture. Even further south, the Bradfield scheme exists by another .name. It is ca1led the Clarence River diversion in northern New South Wales. It is a very similar scheme. It may not have quite the attractive figures which the Bradfield scheme has, but it exists. Mr Dodd interjecting",63
56,Mr KATTER,MODELS,"The intellectual pygmies on my left who are interjecting obviously do not understand nor have they any knowledge of what occurred in Australia during the Great Depression. Many of them are from Sydney where the ALP was responsible for the total and absolute destruction of both J.T. Lang and E.G. Theodore. If they had even a cursory understanding of history, they would know that that was true and they would know that the things that I am saying here today were exactly the same things that those people were saying in the 1930s. Honourable members opposite represent the 60 per cent of the Australian population that 'has never had it better', to quote the head of the Brotherhood of St Laurence. Half the people of Australia decide tonight where they are going to dine-and that is who they represent-and the other half of the people of Australia are wondering whether in fact they can afford to dine at alI.

57,Mr GRIFFIN,MODELS,"I am almost lost for words. Mr MCGauran-Good! Sit down, then.",64
58,Mr GRIFFIN,MODELS,"I can assure all listening, including my friend the honourable member for Gippsland, that the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) is obviously a hard act to follow. We are here to talk about the Working Nation document, the white paper recently produced by the government to address the issue of unemployment in Australia and to endeavour to set in place some initiatives to address that blight on Australian society. I would like to talk a little about the background to the establishment of that white paper, as I was partly involved in the construction of some of the submissions which came to that process through a caucus committee. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made it very clear, subsequent to the last election, unemployment was the' key priority of this government in this term, and that it was an issue which had to be addressed for the long term good of the nation and for the very many families who are touched by it in a very unfair and deleterious fashion, given ,the loss of income and the effect that unemployment has had on their families a-d their lifestyles. What came through very clearly in the consideration through that white paper process was the very great tragedy of unemployment, and the fact that it affects many people in many different ways, and many regions in many different ways. I will give you some examples which relate to my electorate in particular, and to the similar electorate of the honourable member for Gippsland. My electorate of Corin ella has a rural component; a growing outer suburban component; and also a non-English speaking background, older working class component. The question of unemployment and its.impact in all three of those areas is, in its own way, quite different and quite unique and requires particular initiatives to address it-initiatives that, in a broad brush. approach, would not necessarily be successful. The unemployment rate in the rural part of my electorate is up towards 16 or 17 per cent, in official figures. It has been growing while, over the last 12 to 18 months, the unemployment rate in the metropolitan parts of the electorate has been on the decrease. The situation is very much that there is a real lack of new industry and of job opportunities for people who live in those areas to actually gain employment. There is a lack of hope in those areas, to some extent, in the creation of new work opportunities. We need to address that lack of hope, because it is an area that has enormous potential in terms of job creation. As the honourable member for Gippsland would know, that part of my electorate which shares a boundary with his is an area of great beauty which has tremendous potential for tourism. With Phillip Island and the Wonthaggi area, it has a great capacity to be an area which generates jobs and real incomes for the people who live there; but it is somethat thing that we have to look at tapping into. The newer suburbs around Cranbourne in my electorate are an area where unemployment is below the average, down to between eight and nine per cent; but it is also an area that has particular problems. It is growing at a phenomenal rate, with new families moving in every day of the week, every week of the year. It has essentially developed as· a commuter suburb, and it lacks services and employment opportunities where those people live. Going further up towards the Dandenong, Noble Park and Keysborough parts of the electorate, we have an area that is very indicative of the problems that are facing the western and northern suburbs of Melbourne. It is an area that has historically. been very much in the manufacturing base of Victoria, a base that I know the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) mentioned before as somewhere that has had a real kick in the guts since the election of the Kennett government. It is an area that is suffering above average unemployment; and the nature of that unemployment is different from that in other parts of the electorate. The area has a heavy concentration of migrants froni non-English speaking backgrounds, but they are not necessarily migrants who arrived last year or the year before. Some of those people arrived here 30 or 40 years ago, and have been tremendous contributors to Australian society and Australian industry. Because the nature of the job market has changed, those people have in fact been put in a position where jobs for them no longer exist. In the white paper we are not looking at a grand solution. It is not a case of 'Here is the answer, the Holy Grail; we must march forward with it and all will be fixed'. It is like that at all; it is about looking at what be done to try to ameliorate the circumstances of the unemployed and give them opportunities and, at the same time, encourage growth and job creation through the private sector. We are trying to take into account the conditions in particular parts of the country so that aspects that may be unique can be used to advantage and those areas can have a chance to get back into the field of jobs growth and industry development. In the white paper we are also looking at the problems faced by people who have become long-term unemployed. I had an experience in the last recession under the Fraser government when I was unemployed for six months, which was the time span required in order to be technically referred to as long-term unemployed. That was nowhere near as long as what some people are facing in these days. I do not pretend to have a real understanding of what they are going through, but I have a perception and some understanding from my own personal experience. I know that; when I was unemployed for that six-month period, in a situation where I said I would take any job other than working in a bank-I have a thing about banks-I doorknocked and went to the CES religiously every day. Over a period of months, I came to a position where I had to face some funda': mental questions within myself. One of those questions was: am I really worthwhile? Can I actually contribute to Australian society? Those sorts of points really start to prey on you after a while. What happens with a lot of people who are long-term unemployed is that they find that real question of their own worth being something that they question every day. Luckily, after six months, I managed to get a job washing cars in a car yard in Frankston, part of the electorate of the honourable member for Dunkley- > Mr Chynoweth-You did a good job too! Mr GRIFFIN......:I was a great car washer, and I did that for some time. The problem that I faced at that time and in the lead-up to getting the job was that of the employer saying I was overqualified for it· and that it should not be given to me since, undoubtedly, not I would not stay· very long at it. It was at a can time when there were just no appropriate training programs to put you in a position to get a job or be competitive for the vacancies. It was an ever-changing job market. Industries which 10 or 15 years before had been the key to economic development, with new industries growing up on a regular basis, were now on the decline; so that flexibility in terms of training just was not there. It was a situation which I was lucky to escape from at that time. I principally escaped from it, I might add, because of the election of a Labor government, with the jobs growth that occurred under that Labor government after the severe unemp-oyment of the years of the skills. conservative government under Malcolm rj,ut Fraser. It w- only with that jobs growth that I was able to actuaJly get employment. We also tried to look at the social security process.' system; and a number of measures have been introduced by the Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin), to avoid disincentives within the system which put people in a,situation where they face the choice of a low-paid and perbeen haps part-time job or else remaining benefits. They find themselves in the position where, financially, it does not add up for them to actually take the job. That is something government has recognised is the case on some occasions, and it has tried very seriously to do something about it. Those initiatives changes should be supported by all sides of the House"" because they are initiatives that will make a real difference to a lot of income families in Australia. There have been a number of criticisms the white paper. One that has been repeated today by honourable members on the opposite side of this House is that it does not create real jobs, in the sense-I take it-that people they need. are no longer in employment after the subsidisation period. That is just not true in many cases under the training schemes that the government has had in place and will put place according to the white paper. As I said earlier, in my own experience and that of people who are long-term unemployed, there is a need to make the unemployed jobready and put them in a situation where they are getting the training they require to compete for vacancies and redeveloping the social skills they require to be in a position of work. It is a matter of getting people job ready. It is clear to any reasonable observer from statistics gathered that training is the key employment opportunities and prospects, and that appropriate training is a question for the potential employee but also for the employer. Many employers in my local area have said to me, 'Yes, I would like to put quite somebody on, but I do not want to spend the countryperhaps next six months training them. I do not want to be in a situation where I am paying dead on money while people develop the required Two I do not want to be in a situation where someone on and find not only that they are not suitable but that I have wasted my money and endangered my business in the However, because of the system that is being introduced through the white paper and the development of the good work already done by the government, business people will not find themselves in that situation. As has said in this place, by the Minister for on Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), under this system the cost to an employer of the employing someone could be as little as $10 a week. That surely takes care of the question about the initial cost of employing someone. and We are talking about a system whereby the training is designed to suit the needs of the employer; it can be on-the-job training or off- , lowthe-job training. The subsidies under the system can range from $3,000 to over $8,000 of per annum, and they are designed to help employers and employees. The intention is to create a flexible situation in which both employers and job seekers are getting what We are committed to over 50,000 extra training places per year by the end of 1995in 96. On the issue of training places and traineeships, the question as to whether they are real jobs needs' to be addressed. Bill Kelty, in an interview with Ellen Fanning and Peter MCCutcheon on the, PM program in December of last year, spoke about the work on traineeships undertaken by him and Lindsay Fox. They had set a target of 20,000 commitments for the employing of trainees by Christmas of 1992, and they then set a second target of 50,000 job commitments by the end of 1993. They met those targets. The statistics to from their ,undertaking, and the experience with traineeships prior to that, is best summed not only , up by what Bi,ll Kelty said: The figures on the traineeship scheme are now startling; in terms of labour-market programs, the best labour-market program that this has ever produced. Ninety per cent of young people, once they complete that program, go to get an unsubsidised job within three months. years after, 87 per cent have got employment. So when we talk about what a real job is we have got to look at the result of these programs. The fact is that they are creating real jobs and they are putting real people in a situation where they can get these real jobssurely that is a big part of what the system is supposed to be all about. Finally, one other criticism being made of the white paper is that the projections and estimates within it are. wrong. It is an easy thing to say; it is a hard thing to prove. The situation that the opposition faces, and that the government faces, when it comes to questioning each other's policies is looking into the crystal ball and saying, 'What is going to happen in the future?' But on this matter we have to look at a few things, and one is this government's record. Certainly, its record on unemployment over the last several years is nothing to be proud of-there is no doubt about that-but neither was the record of the Liberal' government when it was in power in the early 1980s and late 1970s. The situation is that between 1983 and 1989 1.6 million jobs were created and the economic growth average was of the order of four to 4112 per cent per anrlUm. In 1983 we said we would create 500,000 jobs in three years; we delivered that in less than two years. At the last election we said we would create 500,000 jobs in this three-year period. In just over 12 months we have already created more than 270,000 jobs. All of this has happened while the opposition continues to talk down the economy and tries to emphasise the' bad at a time of economic good. That is a difficulty for the opposition. I hope they face it for many years to come; I am sure that they will. I commend the white paper to the House. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Hawker) adjourned.

59,Mr JENKINS,MODELS," Mr Deputy more Speaker, I note that there is no debate amendment allowed on subsequent motions. With your indulgence, it might that those members that have some comments they want to make about the performance of the Main Committee might do so at this stage.",68

61,Mr BRADFORD,MODELS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought it might be appropriate at this stage, as we are dealing with the report of the Main Committee's deliberation today and as· we are now approaching the end this budget sittings of parliament, during debate. which we inaugurated the Main Committee, to say on behalf of the opposition that, despite some misgivings and perhaps even some concerns that members on both sides may have had about whether the Main Committee was going to work or not, my observation as the opposition whip in the Main Committee is that it seems to be working and it certainly seems to be achieving its objectives. It clearly is giving members opportunity to make a broader contribution debates not only in the Main Committee but also in this place. To the extent that all of here are committed to contributing as far we can and at every opportunity to the demisgivings bates about the matters that come before this parliament, .our observation, which I suspect is shared by government, is that the Main Committee is working well. It is interesting that, although the committee was established to deal largely with what have been called non-controversial matters, in a debating sense I suppose it is difficult to say that everything is non-controversial. Even on the many occasions that we agree with the government's legislation and the opposition makes a determination not to oppose something or supports amendments which have been agreed to, where the debate is occurring in this place there is always an. element of controversy. It has been interesting to see that debates in the Main Committee have been just as good and as fruitful and as wholehearted as the debates are in this place. However, the relaxed and congenial atmosphere which or exists in the Main Committee has added a new dimension to the debates which have be appropriate occurred there. I would like to thank the Chairman of Committees for the contribution that he has made to the working of that chamber, and the and the other parliamentary staff who have assisted us through these initial days. We look forward to the Main Committee continuing to operate in the next parliamentary sittings.",68

67,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MODELS,"lam glad to hear that an the opposition is happy with the way the to Main Committee is operating. It did have some misgivings at the beginning and I am us glad that the honourable member for MCPheras son (Mr Bradford) has indicated that such are not there any more. From the government's point of view, we have attempted to facilitate any matters that the opposition has wanted to deal with in the Main Committee and, on the notice that we will be presenting later this afternoon, there are a series of bills that we are putting forward, with the concurrence of the· opposition, for the next session and a number of 'take notes' that we are putting forward, also with the concurrence of the opposition. I might also point out to the House that in taking into account the items that will go on the Main Committee, we have also consulted with the two independent members of the House, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) arid'the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), and' the government intends to continue to do that. We think the best way for the Main Committee to work is if there is consensus on the material that there although we do not expect that there is always going to be consensus on the material as it is debated there. In the last few weeks we have seen that the procedures that we have developed for dealing with bills that might have had amendments that the committee did not agree to has worked quite well. I think we have tried out most of the possible procedural technicalities. The process has worked well and it will be able to give us an overflow mechanism which will help us keep to earlier evenings, something that all members want. But more importantly it will also give us time for more debate on matters that members might have found in the past they had little time to do. Opposition members did say that they thought the use of the guillotine at the same time that we have brought in the Main Committee was an unfortunate thing. In retrospect that was not necessarily all that bad either because the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) who deals with a lot of those issues in this House might recall that everyone who wanted to speak in that guillotine period got to speak anyway. All told, things have worked out reasonably well. The 'take notes' that are going on the Notice Paper for the Main Committee will provide a better forum for things that would never normally get debated in this House. I would just, on behalf of the government, encourage members to make suggestions to government members or to the opposition whips and for the independent members to whomsoever of us they wish to choose. We can give an undertaking that we are going to do our very best to accommodate everybody. I appreciate the' remarks of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr :eradford) and join with him in thanking the Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), for the work that he and his panel have done. I would also like to thank, on behalf of the government, those ministers who have participated in the business of the Main Committee as well as the parliamentary secretaries artdparliamentary committee chairpersons who have done duty up there. I goes think that it has worked out very well.",68
68,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MODELS,"I can see happening what I was afraid was going to happen. Once you give indulgence to one, you start off a chain reaction. I will give the honourable member for Wannon the opportunity to speak. but it has to be brief because we have a lot of legislation to approve before 2.00 p.m., hopefully, So very briefly, continue on.",69
69,Mr HAWKER,MODELS,"I was just responding since the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) did mention something relating to my concerns about the guillotine. Can I just say that what he said may be technically correct but in fact what had to happen was that once the government introduced the guillotine the number of speakers that were actually put forward on the list was reduced. As well, in some cases in the'most recent guillotine debate, some of the opposition speakers cut their speeches short in order to allow their colleagues to speak.. So it is not quite correct to say that the full amount of debate was accommodated. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

I particularly thank the parliamentary staff who have been involved in the conduct of the Main. Committee. I thank those in the Parliamentary Liaison Office who have had additional duties to perform due to the running of the Main Committee. I also thank those on the Speaker's Panel for their cooperation. The Main Committee has sat for 10 hours over the .last two weeks. That has meant that we have dealt with the equivalent of another half week of government business without having to come back to Canberra on another occasion to achieve that. When the Main Committee runs for a full session hopefully the measure of imposing a guillotine can be well and truly avoided.

71,Mr HAWKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I wish to pick up some of the points that have been raised by previous speakers in this debate. I noticed that the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) spoke about the lack of hope for the unemployed. I think that sums up the government and what it has done for so many young Australians-and older Australians, as well. The government has an appalling record in relation to employment and it should hang its head in shame: It has created the problem and it is the one that has to carry the can. Some of the government speakers in this debate look for every excuse they can think of rather than admitting that, having been in government for the last 11 years, it has to accept responsibility for what has been done to make miserable the lives of so many Australians. Government members often suggest how many jobs have been created during its period in office. In fact, the government claims the credit for creating those jobs. The former prime minister was keen to do that too. What those opposite often forget or choose to ignore is the fact that the population of Australia has also been growing over the past few years. It would be rather surprising if the number of jobs in Australia had not risen to some extent at least to reflect that increase in population, Jobs are created by the sheer momentum of population growth. That is point that is so often overlooked and it is something that government members should be reminded of so that they can put the whole thing back in proportion. This white paper is a manifestation of the government's failure to keep the level of unemployment down. It shows that so many members of the government have failed to understand who created the problem in the first place and, probably more seriously, why the problem occurred. It seems as though the government spends its life trying to hide the facts. First of all, let us consider the level of unemployment. It is at a record level since the Great Depression, as is the number of unemployed. Another thing that has belatedly been recognised is the number of long-term unemployed. That is another frightening statistic that no doubt this government would be rather keen to try to hide. All of this has come about because of Labor's recession 'we had to have'. Honourable members will remember when the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), said, 'This is the recession we had to have.' Thousands of Australians have had to pay a very high price for the mistakes, the mismanagement and the lack of understanding of the government with respect to how the Australian economy should be run. I think what the Labor Party has done will stand eternally to its'shame. We should consider some of the things that the government is not talking about today. We need to consider the impediments that the government is putting in· the way of employers who wish to take people on. It is all very well for government members to come in here with a white paper but, as my colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has said, it is a training paper; it is not creation paper. The point is that the government not only has problems with the number of unemployed people, but also it is putting impediments in front of businesses when they take people on. There are also problems with payroll tax, which the government has never tried to address. The opposition certainly made that one of out planks at the last election. I refer to recent amendments to the Industrial Relations Act. Despite what the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) might try to tell us, we ought to look at what the effects of those amendments are doing to people and why they are frightening the living daylights out of so many small businessmen throughout Australia. They now realise what happens when they want to put someone off. I am not just talking about what may happen. Let me give an example of what has actually happened. I got a phone call from a small businessman a couple of weeks ago. He told me that because of economic pressure-and I note that-he had to put someone off. After going to the union, the person came back and said, 'This is an unfair dismissal.' The employer got advice from his association and his solicitor. His solicitor said to him, 'The fact is that, if you don't put him back on, you'll be up for $50,000. 'The employer said, 'The very reason I put him off was that I couldn't afford to employ him. I can't afford the $50,000.' That is the sort of problem that the government is creating. Government members should not think that employers are not hearing about it. They are getting the message time and again. This is not an isolated case. A number of people have said to me, 'I won't be employing anyone else while this new unfair dismissal law is in effect.' Mr Johns-Well, they're wrong.",70
72,Mr HAWKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I have just given an example; It was going to cost an employer $50,000 because he had to put a person off due to economic pressure: Mr Johns-You know it's nonsense.",71
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS, . a job Order! We will not have a debate. You will direct your comments through the chair. We will not have a debate across the table.,71
74,Mr HAWKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I would like to pick up a couple of other points that some government members have made in this debate. It strikes me that they still have a problem with the politics of envy. Let us look· at the way that this envy has manifest itself. We listen to government members trying to criticise Australia's greatest Prime Minister. It is just plain envy. One would think they might have a little bit of charity and have some pride in a Prime Minister who not only held that position for the longest period in our history but also achieved a period of stability which many Australians look back on very fondly. I think it is very uncharitable of government members to try to ignore the great achievements of Prime Minister Menzies. Fortunately, the majority of Australians recognise that he was a great· Prime Minister and that he presided over a .great time in our history. It is interesting tq contrast this with something that we' do not hear from the government members. We do not ever hear them praising their former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. It seems as though there is a vacuum there; it is three years which they do not talk about It is politically incorrect to people what a mess the Whitlam government made and how, in those three years, it set about to try to undo all the good work that had been done in the previous 23 years of great government. It is amazing the way this government and this Labor Party tries so hard to forget that. I am reminding them. If they want to go back into history, they should l()ok at who were the successes and who were the failures. I do not think anyone in Australia would have any doubt about· the failures of the Whitlam government. I want to pick up a couple of points made by the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) in his contribution. He spends his life coming into this chamber, day after day, trying to attack the Victorian state government. The hide of the man is absolutely amazing, to come in here and go on the way he does. I honestly wonder whether he understands what the previous Labor government did to Victoria. Has he got a selective memory? Can he not understand that the Cain and Kirner governments virtually sent Victoria broke? What does it take to get through to him? It certainly did not take much to get through to the people of Victoria. They got rid of the Labor government; the Kennett government had a landslide win. The people of Victoria recognised what a failure Labor was when it was in power in Victoria .. The honourable member for Dunkley ought to Tealise that it is because of that mismanagement, because of the fact that the state government was virtually broke when the election was held in 1992, that the incoming government had to take some very strong measures. If it did not do so, the Reserve Bank or the Commonwealth would have had to step in and say, 'Sorry boys, you've got no more money, so you're going to have to put people off anyway.' When the honourable member for Dunkley comes in here and talks about the number of jobs that are being lost in the Victorian Public Service, he should remember why that has occurred. It has occurred because of the mismanagement of the Cain and Kirner governments. It is time for the honourable member to be a little bit more honest about what is happentell ing in Victoria. It is time that he recognised that Victoria now has a government that not only hasset about to right some of Victoria's problems, but is doing so very effectively. It is setting Victoria. on the path to growthsomething that will again make Victorians feel proud of being Victorians. When the Cain and Kirner governments were in office, there was nothing worse than listening to thecracks that were being made about the failures of the. management of the Victorian government. I do not believe there would be anyone in this chamber who did not hear some of the cracks that were being made. I want to take upa second point with the honourable member for Dunkley. He has decided not only that he ought to be the constant critic of the Victorian governmentnot realising that he is really criticising his own side-but he seems to have moved into what I call a rather twisted extraordinary personal attack on the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). The honourable member seems to think that there was something wrong with the fact that the Leader of the Opposition attended private schools. I would suggest to the honourable member for Dunkley that he ought to be a bit careful about this matter. He might be a bit embarrassed if he made a few inquiries and found out how many of his ministerial colleagues are sending their children to private schools. When he does that little investigation, maybe he also ought to ask them why they have chosen to do so. I come back to the Working Nation statement. As I have said, it is a recognition of the failure of Labor to create real jobs. It is a recognition of the failure to understand who creates 'real jobs. Real jobs in Australia are not just government jobs, as much as they are important. The engine house of job creation is business, particularly small business. Until the government can recognise that, it really does have some major problems. Looking through the preamble to the white paper, some statements CilO be· found with which I have no problem in agreeing. For example, it says that unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, is inherently unfair. Everyone would agree with that, but it is a reflection on the Labor government because that is exactly what it has created. Yet the government has now come in here to try to pretend that it was someone else's fault. I think it is also importlj,nt, when talking about long-term unemployment, to apply another couple of words. which members of the Labor Party like to use so often; that is, 'social justice'. Where. is .the social justice being unemployed? Surely, if the government really believes its own rhetoric, it would say that the best bit of social justice we could give this country is to make sure that everyone who wants a job can get one. To see hundreds and thousands of long-term unemployed people-double-digit unemploymentreally shows that the government's commitment to this thing called social justice is nothing more than a total sham. They are two words the government bandies around the community. But I do not think the government even understands what they mean. If it did, it would recognise the problems that are being created by unemployment, and unemployment is certainly not a measure of social justice. Some honourable members may be aware that on Sky Channel, in a couple of weeks time-on Sunday, 10 July-there will be a big broadcast which will be called 'Employ Australia'. Rotarians right across the country are being asked to watch this broadcast. What has happened is that the government has decided to recruit as many as it can from 42,000 Rotarians in Australia to help reduce unemployment levels. I commend Rotarians for the great job that we all know they do in their service to the community. I particularly commend them for their willingness to help with trying to find jobs for the unemployed. However, it is interesting to note what is being promoted; that, - f course, is the fact that, as has been mentioned by a number of government members, including the minister, there will be an opportunity to take on long term unemployed under this program for as little as a $10 a week cost to the employer. While that is a great incentive fer employers to hire the long-term unemployed and while it certainly gives. opportunities, and opportunities particularly for work experience, what the government has to explain is .what this thing called 'the probation period' is all about. It is said that for· a reasonable period there will be this level of subsidy; in other words, an employer will be able to employ someone for $10 a week. But, during that reasonable period, an employer will be able to sack that person. The question I ask is: if someone is able to do that and then take on in another person at $10 a week, will this really be .of. help to people in the whole question of-(1ime expired)",71
75,Mr SIMMONS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is a pleasure for me, as it is indeed for so many other government members, to participate in tl)is important debate on what is clearly an historic and landmark ministerial. statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 4 May this year. Before I make some comments specifically on Working Nation, the white. paper dealing with employment and growth, I cannot resist the temptation to comment on the remarks of the previous two coalition speakers. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr KaUer) told us, in his melodious tones, how he was a great advocate of what many people would regard as some of the more extreme job creation schemes which were bandied around the world in the 1930s. He spoke of the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Roosevelt schemes which were implemented in the United States in the 1930s. He almost seemed to be an apologist for the. Lang government and the Langite policies of that particular period. Without wanting to get into a debate within . my own party on the benefits or otherwise of those particular schemes, it does seem to be fairly typical of that yearning for the past which we constantly observe coming from the National Party of Australia. Members of that party really are the true .agrarian socialists. That party is the modem day, contemporary political equivalent of Jurassic Park when it comes to looking at the critical economic issues facing Australia. We should not .be surprised by some of those comments made by the honourable member for Kennedy because he served as a minister in the National Party governments led by Joh Bjelke-Petersen and others in the 1980s. I think he would be somewhat embarrassed to look back upon that particular period of time as well. I seem to have fol1owed the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) regularly ) in debates over the course of our time together in parliament. I find myself agreeing with him on some of the issues that we have debated over the years, but I have to state a point of difference on some of the matters that he has raised today. The important point that I would make first of al1 is that of course the government accepts responsibili,ty for some of the economic decisions that were taken during the 1980s and the early 1990s. No responsible government would seek to walk away from some of those decisions. Noone, of course, is able to look back upon that period of time and say with any honesty that every decision that was taken was in the best interests of this country. Of course this government has made mistakes, as any government makes mistakes and indeed as many of the governments in the OECD made' them during that period. This is real1y what the Working Nation paper is al1 about-recognising that there were mistakes made and that there are challenges ahead for us instead of washing our hands, walking away from it and leaving it completely to the marketplace. This is the fundamental difference between the approach taken by the government and the approach taken by the opposition. Whether those opposite like it or not this government as a basis of its philosophy believes that there is a fundamental role for government to intervene where appropriate within the marketplace. The honourable member talked about the serious unemployment problems in this country. Of course there are serious problems, but again we are not on our Pat Malone. Western Europe is grappling with similar problems. There is unemployment of the order of 20 million people right throughout western Europe, including, of course, the United Kingdom-a place that members on other side are often wont to cite. He talked about the fact that at times there seemed to be a reluctance of people on this side of the House to talk about some of the achievements of the Whitlam government. Let me say that I did not always agree with some of .the decisions taken by the Whitlam government, .but lam not going to run away from associating myself with some of those significant changes that were announced by that government. Some of those changes are still an important part of contemporary Australia, and we should not forget that. The Whitlam government brought Australia out of the sleepy past of the 1950s and 1960s, and gave Australians a real sense of pride and achievement-something that the Liberals and the Nationals certainly would not have been happy to do on any occasion. I do not seek to walk away from those sorts of achievements. We could talk about a number of issues relating to the Working Nation paper, but the time available does limit the opportunity to go through a lot of those creative and timely measures that the Prime Minister announced. As a member representing a great regional area of Australia, the central west part of New South Wales, and as a representative of the government-I might say the Australian Labor Party is the largest country party in Australia because it holds more regional, rural and provincial seats in this House than any other party-I am very pleased to be associated with the regional development initiatives of this government. We are providing over $150 million towards a national regional development strategy, which will help unlock the enormous potential in the great regions of Australiaregions like the Hunter, the Latrobe Val1ey in Victoria, and the other great regions where there is so much potential locked up . . We see a Jurassic Park attitude on the part of some members of the National Party. They still have· a cargo cult attitude to regional development. Predictably, these people-like the New South Wales Minister for Small Business, Mr Chapell-have accused the federal government of not throwing enough money at regional development in the white paper. Some of their colleagues down here are things. saying similar things on the one hand and on the other hand are accusing this government represented. of having a loose fiscal policy. That is typical of the two bob each way approach to economic management we have seen from the coalition parties over the years. Recently in a speech I made during debate on the appropriation bills I mentioned enlightened attitude taken by other organisawhatever tions within the coinrrtimity to regional opment.I mentioned the central west economand ic development group, which has already recognised that the cargo cult days are well and truly over. Recently its chief, Mr Ferguin son,in Orange stateU that the regional develDespite opment initiatives' contained in the white paper oneriiployment and growth 'herald a new era whereby the federal government would no longer be the Mr Fixit for regional economies'. He said, 'The white however, provide us with the toolsto take control of ourbwn region.' That is ,exactly position; it i-, spot. on. The governinent's approach to regional development identifies a number of major ,areas- increasing' the financing options for,business and regions, facilitation of infrastructure investment, the encouragement of best. practice, of export activity and, importantly, the improvement of program delivery. Organisations like the central westeconomnot ic development group-lam sure similar recovery. organisations exist' in other parts oL New South Wales and right throughout the This Commonwealth-which take that enlightened a approach will see that there. are enormous We benefits for their areas as a result of the white paper. In the context of the discussions unemployment I was pleased to see recently that the official uneinployment level measured throughout my electorate of Calare at the end of the December quarter, 1993 was 6.37 per cent, which is.weJlbelow the nationstanding al average and an indication as regional development strategies announced by the government will take off. Our area has reached a threshQI- in terms of population growth and investment opportunities. The government's regional development strategy will allow it to go on to bigger and 'better MrRobert Brown-And Calare is well",73
76,Mr SIMMONS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The honourable member is very kind to make those remarks. The employment part of the white paper has three distinct themes. The sustaining of high economic growth is obviously of critical importthe ance to this government. We. want to see programs we develop lead to susdeveltainable and high rates of economic groWth the creation of jobs. We have seen what has happened over the last 12 months in that regard. We have also seen the results of that the context of low levels of inflation. what we are seeing in .the marketplace at present, and despite accusations of so called loose fiscal policy by the opposition, most people would, agree that the policy settings are right to allow that low level of paper does, inflation to continue. . An important part of this program is trainthe ing the work force. This is the second key theme the government is emphasising in this document ..

Does the Prime Minister now accept that government will have to introduce a minibudget later' this year to address Australia's emerging economic problems?",76
79,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. No, in short. I did see worry. today's figures. The balance of payments showed an increase in both exports and imports of just on five percentage points; The current account ,balance is completely in line with the budget forecasts. If that is the premdetail. ise of the Leader of the' Opposition's question, I do not see much weight in it. Building approvals are up to 10 percent for the month. But the fact is that it is buildto ing approvals which implies an addition supply. As thoseapproyalsgo to the construction phase, we will see Ii heavy addition to the housing stock over the course of the year. When we see an addition to the housing stock, we generally see restraint on price rises in housing. This is likely to be true particularstantially ly as we see additions to supply in that affordable area of the housing market. There is not pressure on resources in. labour market. Though unemployment has administration come down to 9.6 per cent, it has a long way to go. So there is not pressure there. As understand it, there is not pressure in terms of grams? materials for the building industry. So what is the Leader of the Opposition so worried about? I notice that the Real Estate Institute other day had this to say about the Leader the Opposition: The opposition's comments during the last week were only to enhance the pressure on Australian industry rates. That was, I think, ill-advised opposition and its political tactics. It would served them much better in terms of industry interests overall and the interests of the public to have sided with industry and the government to say that the fundamentals do not support any increase. I received a letter from the' South Australian .. . As Premier of South. Australia, I strongly suggest the federal govemIllentavoid overreacting to that financial markets turmoil. So here is the Premier of his party in his own state disagreeing with him., Here is the Real Minister's Estate InstituteMr Downer-But I have been asking you the about an increase in interest rates.",76

Deficit Reduction l\{r O'CONNOR--:-My question is directed to the Treasurer.

Could he advise the the House about the present costs of program and provide any information' on the scope for· cost savings through the more I efficient delivery of. Commonwealth pro,.",76
83,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. !tis the case that various allegations have been made, particuthe larly by the opposition, about the scope for of there. to be. a substantial reduction in the deficit and to do it by cutting running costs and indeed to do other things, to make other reductions in taxation and increase various of the other expenditures,and apparently pay for it have all through reductions in running costs. I must say that I find this to be a rather extraordinary set .of propositions. I think it is appropriate to note that, in terms of the reduction of the .deficit, the bpposition has said.through its spokesman on the economy, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that the government should be aiming to balance the budget by ·1996-97. He was quoted as saying that in the Australian of 10 June this year. He went on to say that the coalition was obviously not targeting transfer of social security payments for spending cuts. He is quoted as saying: So once you take them out of the game, where your dollars actually end up is in running costs. ill other words, we clm pay for a $5. billion reduction in the deficit by cutting running costs. I must say that I found that· to be an interesting contrast with the views of his colleague the opposition spokesman on finance, who was quoted in the Australian Financial Review of 21 June as saying that the coalition will· not be taking a slash and burn approach to the public sector. He said: In a lot of areas I think that thefre not bad now. They've had their efficiency dividend running for a while. It's not true any longerto paint the Public Service as bloated· and inefficient and without thought or ideas-that's just not true anymore. That is the opposition spokestnan on finance. Contrast that with the view that there is room fot some massive savings to be made in running costs to enable us to reduce the deficit by $5 billion. That is not the .end of the story because the opposition has also been saying that an sorts of other things should be happening to improve our state of wenbeing at present. For instance, on 14 June the Leader of the Opposition was reported as saying to a .CEDA meeting that the coalition would seek ways to remove an estimated $2 billion to exporters through the indirect. tax regime. That was said despite' the fact that· Treasury has made it public knowledge that it sees .this as. being quite GATT illegal. Nevertheless, .that - is something that the opposition. leader has cemmitted himself to. So that is another $2 billion the opposition .would have to find, presumably from running costs. On 19 June, the Leader of the Opposition committed his party to offering tax concessions for private health insurance. Again, he gave us no costing, but I remind the House that in Fightback the costing of such tax relief waS $l.6 billion. That is another $1.6 billion th- opposition will have to find ,out of J:Unnin- costs- Yesterday in a SPeech to AFSA, the Australian Federation of Superannuation Associations, the deputy leader of the opposition co-itted the opposition to freezing the superannuation guarantee charge and introducing tax.conceSsions for superannuation contributions. Again, he gave no indication of the costs,but the gross cost of those sorts of tax concessions in Fightback was $1.7 billion. That is another $1.7 billion the opposition will have to find out of running costs. In the Daily Telegraph today there is an article which suggestS that the opposition is going to be offering substantial tax concessions or a family payment for one parent families. So, again, presumably there will· be substantial additional costs there. In his budget speech, when he was still the shadow Treasurer, the now Leader of the Opposition caned for us to increase expenditure on infrastructureMr Tim Fischer- Mr-Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I remind you and the House of your admonition to ministers issued on 9'May last abou- the length of answers by ministers. I put. it to you that; unless we have shorter answers, it makes it very difficult for you to control the House and it takes away the rights and privileges of members on both sides of the House in asking questions. I ask that you apply that admonition to this minister now. l\Ir SPEAKER-Order! I' remind all ministers of what·'. I did have to say. Of course, in the case of party leaders and in the case of senior economic ministers who I;lre responding, tolerance has always been given, but I would invite the Treasurer to bring his answer to a conclusion. Mr WILLIS,"":"","",I shan do so shortly, Mr Speaker. I remind the House' that in that speech-the Leader of the Opposition might not like me referring to it-he caned for increased expenditure on infrastructure arid increased expenditure on payments to the states. He wanted an array of tax concessions for small business. Of course, he gave no figures for any of that. But, just in relation infrastructure, the. honourable member for Maranoa is on the record as saying that those opposite should be proposing a figure of between $1 billion and $3 billion. Also in that speech the then shadow Treasurer, now the Leader of the Opposition, said that the only area in which they for savings wDuldbe government running costS- This is what we have: we have a picture in which those opposite are saying that they would cut the deficit spend $2 billion in indirect tax cuts, $11/2 billion in health insurance tax reductions, another $11/2 or more on superannuation tax concessions, have all sorts of other tax cessions and expenditures and do it out of running costsMr Thckey-How many more pages have you got?

87,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The numbers I have already given the House add up to over $10 billion. Of course, there are many promises which are uncosted. The forward estimate for total running costs for 1996-97 is $12 billion- You have spent the lot already! In other words, you have to sack all the public servants· totally abolish running costs just to pay for your expenditure and the tax concessions you have already mentioned. Those opposite keep dipping into this well of running costs as though it was unending, but already they have spent the $12 billion. Superannuation",78
88,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed able to the Treasurer, who has opened up a $38 billion hole over the One Nation forward estimates in his 1994-95 budget. Now that the major banks. have said that locking them out to of competing for superannuation funds will increase pressure on interest rates, will the government reconsider its position on this issue? Oris it the case that the government cannot pursue that option because the ACTU has placed a veto on such a proposal?",78

90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! You have asked by $5 billion, your question.",78
91,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can walk into any bank branch today and open uP. a superannuation conaccount. That money in many cases would just go straight into bank deposits. So the banks are absolutely not locked out of superannuation. This· is a total furphy and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition simply does not know what he is talking about. The only difference is that at present the banks have to do it by way of a life assurance company which is a subsidiary or associate, instead of putting it directly on their books. is the difference. This does not mean that the money would not come back into their bank deposits. If you put your money in an ANZ superannuation account today, it goes into the ANZ Bank deposits. With the others you have a choice: you can go to bank deposits or you can go to a managed fund, in which case some of it would, most likely, go back intQ bank deposits anyway. What the banks are looking for is not competitive neutrality and the ability to get info an area they are currently excluded from and but a competitive advantage. They want to avoid the prudential supervision of the Insurthat ance and Superannuation Commission, the ISC, and simply be able to do it on the basis of the supervision of the Re-erve Bank, for which they pay nothing. The superannuation funds all pay for the prudential supervision of the ISC. The banks would pay nothing for supervision of the Reserve Bank but would be to offer superannuation on a cost advantage basis in that way because 'they would not be paying for the prudential supervision. The banks are not locked out of superannuation. They can have as many clients as they like come into their banks and get superannuation. They stress that it is terribly simple; in fact, a number of them call their superannuation accounts 'simple saver' accoUnts. They are easy to access. You can put money into them through automatic teller machines or any bank branch. It is as though the money was fully on the books of the bank. Mr Downer-What are they complaining about?",78
92,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are complaining about not getting the competitive advantage that they want by not being subject to the ISC prudential requirements. That is what they are looking for. That is what they are not going to get. Superannuation Mr GmSON-My question is also directed to the Treasurer and also relates to superannuation. I believe the Treasurer is aware of criticisms of the government's move to provide a comprehensive solution to the problem of small superannuation contributions. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the reasons for the Australian Taxation Office being used in tackling this problem?,79
93,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a fundamental objective of the government to ensure that everyone benefits from superannuation. Having introduced a compulsory system through the superannuation guarantee charge, and having fostered the spread of superannuation prior to that through awards, the government is very concerned to ensure that we do not have the situation continue in which people with small accounts, particularly part-time casual workers, do not benefit from them. These people were in a. situation where the interest from their accounts did not exceed the amount of charges against those accounts and they were therefore going backwards in capital value which was, in some cases, being eroded to zero. Clearly, that was a quite intolerable tion and one which we sought to remedy in the statement. I made earlier this week. We were looking for an absolutely comprehensive solution to ensure that everyone was protected. That can be done in one of two ways. It can be done by simply saying that, in order to comply, all superannuation funds have to cap the fees; in other words, they cannot charge any account more than the interest earned. That would have been one way to go. We brought that in as an option but gave another option to industry so· if it did not wanttodo that-and for smaller funds that might have been quite disadvantageous-it had .the option of the Australian Taxation Office; in other words, closing the account, sending the account off not to the tax office but to an eligible rollover Jund and saying that future contributions on behalf of employees should go to the tax office. The tax office is not going to run a superannuation fund but simply a holding mechanism-a collection mechanism-to build up the moneys to the point where they are big enough to be sent back into the industry to a superannuation fund and earn enough in interest to cover the charges, so they do not go backwards. That is a very important objective for this government to be pursuing. The only way in which we can do that is to pursue the course that we have pursued or simply not have the tax office involved at all 'but cap fees on all funds, which would cause great difficulty to many smaller funds. We believe it was appropriate to give that option. Opposition members must understand that superannuation savings accounts in banks are no solution to the problem. Quite apart from the point I made in answer to the previous question, banks would simply be another place in which some small accounts could go and most likely erode. We all know that banks presently have many small accounts which are eroding-not superannuation accounts but ordinary deposit accounts. By having $500 or less in a passbook account, a person earns much less than the bank charges of $2 per month. Many small savers are going backwards in the hands of banks right now. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a situapoint of order. In a previous answ-, you warned the Treasurer three times to wmd up and he refused to do so. I remind you again of your admonition on 9 May. This makes it very difficult for you when carrying out your duties. as a fair referee of the proceedings the House.. I remind you of that admonition and ask you to apply iton this occasion.",79

On 9 May this year in the in· this House the Prime Minister said: The notion that what has happened to long-term bo!1d rates is in some way a judgment about Australian economiC conditions . . . is basically to Ii On 6 May 1992 the Prime Minister said: The long term bond rate is the rate set by the in the face of its belief about inflationary expectations 10 years hence and over the period. Do you agree with the Prime Minister's latest the comment that movements on the bond market not reflect long-term economic conditions in Australia, or was he right two years ago probwhen he said that they did?",80
103,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The traditional rationale for bond yields determined by the market is that this represents some supposition by the markets about what the inflation rate will be some time hence depending on the length of the bond. That traditionally has been the rationale for whatever yields have been produced. What people have been saying, and it? what many of the operators in the money markets have been saying; in recent times is it is just ridiculous to suggest on· the basis of anything that is around at the present time that the· bond yields which are being in the markets·l;\t present reflect any reasonable assumptions about inflation in the This comes at a time .when we have 80 per cent of employers in this country saying that they expect inflation to remain below four per cent for the rest of this century. We have bond yields apparently looking at inflation to rates in excess of that. The obvious factoranyonewIio is taking any notice of this issue knows this is the case-is that what is happening on the Australian bond market has very little to do with assumptions about inflation in Australia in the forthcoming period and an enormous amount to do with what is happening in bond markets in other countries, particularly the United States. As bond rates go up in the US, ours go up the next day- As they go down in the US, ours go down the next day. They are absolutely bouncing off Wall Street and the bond markets in the United States, not· on any cold analysis of what is happening to our economic future. I think that in his earlier statement the Prime Minister gave the absolutely normal rationale for what happens· in the bond markets. What everyone is saying-everyone, apparently, but the opposition-is that that kind of rationale is not applicable at the present time and that what is happening to the bond markets here certainly has nothing to do with that analysis of Australia's inflation prospects for the future.

I refer the' Attorney General· to the report of the Family Law Council on the practice of female genital mutilation in Australia. What support has there been for the report's recommendation for national legislation to make it clear that this practice is child abuse and will not be tolerated in Australia?,81
105,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This has been a subject of interest to the House. Honourable members may recall a motion moved in February this year by the honourable member for Adelaide. The last two parts of that five-part motion called on Australia to support the international declarations from the UN General Assembly on Violence Against Women and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and called on the federal government to recognise its obligations under these declarations and also to introduce legislation to outlaw female genital mutilation in Australia. The motion was backed up later that week when the then Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister the following question: Will he assure this Housethat is, the Prime Ministerthat his government will take all necessary steps to ensure that this barbaric practice is outlawed in Australia? . . Earlier this week I was able to table the report of the. Family Law Council. The council has completed a very comprehensive report into the practice of female genital mutilation in Australia. It concludes that, while it is impossible in a statistical sense to draw an absolute conclusion as to the extent of the practice, there is sufficient evidence of the practice occurring for there to be legislative action. The report does put great emphasis on education; dealing with the particular communities;' making sure that the communities involved understand Australian norms and Australian practices in relation to this matter; and, notwithstanding the importance of educatioil, that there should be a strong legislative statement involving criminal sanctions which should be undertaken· by the Commonwealth parliament. I will be taking this matter to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General at its next meeting, which will be held in about three weeks time in Brisbane. I would think that the states would also share the concern of this parliament. in relation to the practice. It may well be that uniform laws .can be achieved through the action of the states. Obviously, the criminal laws of Australia are matters at first instance for the states. However, if the states do not agree on this view, or if a particular state does not agree on this view regarding the criminal law, I will be proposing to the government and to the parliament that the Commonwealth exercise its power under the external affairs provision of the constitution iil relation to the international convention as urged to the government by the member for Adelaide and also, by implication, by the then Leader of the Opposition. If that course is necessary, I hope that we will receive the support of the opposition, because it has been a subject .which has proceeded in very much a bipartisan manner. It would be disappointing if this parliament could not agree on a uniform approach, an approach agreed by both sides, due to a view now apparently abroad in the opposition that it is totally inappropriate for the Commonwealth parliament to exercise any power under the external affairs power because the criminal law provisions are solely for the states. I believe that the states will respond to this issue. It is an important one. But if they do not, I will be asking the Commonwealth parliament to exercise its obligations under its international treaties and rely on the external affairs power. I would hope that the opposition would support such a course of action. Naval Vessels",81
106,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In view of the Prime Minister having just returned from Indonesia, he would be aware of the critical importance of accurate advice from our overseas posts. When did the Prime Minister' first learn that the sale of two United States. tank landing vessels to Australia for $70 million was'to be aborted? When was the first contact on the sale made by the Australian embassy with the armed services committee of the United States Senate? Will the Prime Minister now apologise to the 180 Australian sailors and naval officers visibly embarrassed at the prematurely concluded handover ceremony because the Australian ambassador, your former senior adviser, Dr Don Russell, failed to ensure that approval for the sale had been given by Congress before the sailors were transported to Virginia in order to take over the vessels?",82
107,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the issue, but not aware of the detail. of it. I have seen reports about it in the last week. I will take the question on notice and make inquiries. Training Schemes for Young Australians Mr'HOLDING-My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can he inform the House of the particulars of the development of the innovative .training schemes designed to give job opportunities to young Austral-. ians?",82
108,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government said at the last election that it would focus on the lot of the long-term unemployed, particularly younger Australians, and would introduce a white paper in the course of the parliament to deal with this issue. This it has done. The white paper is a comprehensive statement on employment and growth. It outlines the economic policies necessary for growth and the labour market and training initiatives necessary to enfure that the long-term unemployed share in the growth. The challenge now is to get the implementation right and to . make it happen. I am pleased to say that the government is on track with its economic objectives and its implementation of labour market and training assistance. I note that the government's employment strategy is working. The total number of people in employment in Australia in May 1994 was 7,863,OOO-its highest level since August 1990. The unemployment rate in May had fallen to 9.8 per cent.",82
109,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about therole of the state governments?,82
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Moore.,82
111,Mr KE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,TINGThis is the first time since August 1991 that the rate has fallen below 10 per cent.,82
112,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What a proud record you have got.,82
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I warn the member for Mitchell, as I did yesterday.",82
114,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Over the year to May 1994, unemployment fell by 71,600. For the fifth month in a row the number of long-term unemployed people fell. Over the year to May 1994 long-term unemployment fell by 51,000 to 310,800 and it fell by almost 8,000 in the month of May alone. Furthermore, the government's labour market programs are working- The number of long-term unemployed people who stayed in a job or unsubsidised education or training after participating in a labour market program more than doubled between 1992 and 1993. I think that is a very important statistic. In the last three years employers have hired nearly a quarter of a million long-term unemployed people through the jobstart subsidy program. .On Monday, the attractiveness of jobstart will be improved as the value of the subsidy is increased and the period of subsidy extended to nine months. A bonus payment will be available to employers who keep these workers on for a full year. Employers will also have the incentive of the new training wage for employing long-term unemployed people and young people. Yesterday, before the Industrial Relations Commission the ACTU and all employer groups expressed support for the draft national training award. The commission will hold a hearing to decide on the award on 19 July. The award will provide for the national employment and training task force, or Nettforce as it is kn()wn, to approve training packages. Nettforce will cut through the delays experienced in the past· and provide employers with a one stop shop to· put together the training and industrial packages needed to get trainees employed quickly. Nettforceis well on the way to developing a streamlined system of 21 national industry based traineeship programs. It has the agreement of a number of employer organisations and unions to set up joint venture companies to find jobs for people and offer appropriate training. I think this is an exciting development. We will see joint venture companies established between particular sectors of industry and the relevant trade unions. These companies know their industry, and they know their own local areas. Mr Speaker, is there one debate here, or 20?",82
115,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The whole tenor of this reply is that it is a statement. It is a read statement by Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, I remind you that the House is in the middle of the debate on the government's white paper and the Prime Minister is perfectly at liberty to make a statement during that debate, and he should.",83
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister was asked a specific question requesting information. To my mind, that is exactly what he is doing. I suggest to those members on my left, particularly on the front bench, that, if they are in conversation, they should consider the provisions of standing order 55.",83
117,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Joint venture companies are emerging between industry and unions. The first of these partnerships has already got off the ground. The Australian Football League recently announced that it is well on the way to giving 200 unemployed people real job opportunities in the sports industry. Those job opportunities will be in the area of entry level training which will develop skills in club administration, ground keeping, coaching and umpiring. There will be traineeships in each club, the AFL administration and the country league. The trainees will be employed by the AFL and receive their on-the-job training in clubs as host employers. The AFL is fully supportive of this initiative. It builds on the success of the Essendon club, which offers traineeships to particularMr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order which follows from the previous point of order. Standing order 144 refers to questions in the first instance, but it is also relevant to the Prime Minister's answer. 1t reads: Questions cannot refer to(a) debates in the current session ... As was pointed out in the previous point of order, before question time commenced, we were debating - the white paper. The Prime Minister is up here debating the issue in question time, contrary to the standing orders.",83
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No.'The Prime Minister was asked a question about employment opportunities for young people, and. he is answering that question. Mr Thckey-On a further point of order: he is not answering the question because his the opening remark referred to the white paper, which is a debate in the current session. - Mr SPEAKER-No. I have already ruled that the Prime Minister is answering the question, and the Prime Minister is in order.",83
119,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The AFL traineeships will be a model for other sports. I would like to advise the House that the government will be funding traineeships in a wide range of sports. The National Basketball League has already expressed an interest in developing a traineeship. I know that sports such as netball, hockey, rugby league and rugby union have participated in labour market programs in the past. I would encourage· all sporting organisations to consider participating in the new scheme by taking on young trainees; that is, both women and men. Fina])y, I am proud to say that it is not only Essendon and the AFL that have been inwas volved in this. The New South Wales Rugby not true? League has also been involved, particularly Canterbury-Bankstown, led by its tive leader, the Bullfrog:-or Frog to his friends-who has shown that he is ahead of the administrative innov-tions and has extended these traineeships to the Canterbury-Bankstown club. I think it is an interesting and good innovation that sporting organisations, such as the AFL, the rugby league, netball and hockey, are participating in the traineeships. As I said, the government will be funding traineeships in a wide range ·of sports, but they will taken up under the broader labour market programs that·1I have just articulated. Health Insurance",83
120,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the common fee. the Prime Minister. To help him along, I can tell him that the Bullfrog's name is Peter Moore. Is it fair, Prime Minister, that wealthy people like you, who carry no private health insurance, can bypass the queues for public Mackellar! hospital beds by booking into a private hospital with full knowledge that you··can afford to pay and get a tax break of 20c dollar for any net expenditure in excess $1,000?",84

123,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is it fair that this private bed is available only to you because Australpay ians from a]) income groups have subsidised your bed with their· private health insurance premiums for which there is no tax relief? Further, I ask the Prime Minister whether is aware that, when asked about the tax break, Minister Lawrence told thousands of people on Sydney radio last week: I must say I was not aware of that.",84

125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime will Minister has the call.,84
126,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thought the coalition in favour of tax rebates for health. Is that Mrs Bishop-You are the only one getting administrathem. That is the point.,84
127,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If that is true, what are you whingeing about? Mrs Bishop-No relief for ordinary people; just for you.",84
128,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a rebate to protect people from heavy costs in acute episodes. Within a 12-month period, a whole lot of unforeseen health"" costs may arise for a family, in which case a rebate is available in be the tax system for costs over $1,000. That does not detract from the central points of Medicare, its applicability to the community and the universality of its operations in respect of medical support, which is the same for everybody. It is an 85 per cent rebate of Mrs Bishop-Most people cannot afford to pay.",84
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for .,84
130,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In respect of public hospitals, the government has fundedin the ambitiously over the past few years-the of public hospital system. By contrast, the opposition has always been about adopting gap insurance-that is, basically. letting the medicos and the private hospitals charge what like, then encouraging privately insured people to cover the gap between what they secure under Medicare and what they actually in order to keep certain categories of specialists and private hospital proprietors in the style of living to which they have become accustomed. That is basically what it has he - lways been about-a free kick for the doctors. This was true in the last parliament and at the time of the last election, and nothing that ever comes from the coalition is about that. Now we have the Leader of the Opposition saying that we should be walking softly, making only small sounds about Medicare. We all remember Malcolm Fraser saying, 'We adopt Medibank' and, five health schemes later, the government brought in Medicare. Medicare is more than a name. Medicare is a universal system, built on egalitarian principles of access and equity. It is not egalitarian to suggest to people that they pay gap insurance to provide more power in the system to certain specialists and proprietors of private hospitals. That is basically what the shadow spokesperson is about. That is why I have always been happy to defend Medicare and my relian-e upon it I remind the opposition. that it says it is in favour of medical rebates, but then cavils about the fact that someone should avail themselves of some of the income under the rebate. Mobile Telephone Towers Mr CHYNOWETH.,. - My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. In answer to a question from me on 24 March this year about public concerns regarding the construction of mobile telephone towers, the minister indicated that he was reviewing the draft national code governing carriers' construction of these towers. Could the minister inform the House what steps he has taken to meet these public concerns? MrLEE-I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his continuing interest in the construction of mobile telephone towers,not just in Mount Eliza but right around the country. He has recently helped give me good counsel as the head of a consultative group which also included the honourable member for Richmond and the honourable member for Paterson. There is no doubt that there is increasing community concern and also increasing concern from local councils as the carriers have been rolling out the coverage of . the mobile telephone network around the country. I can advise the House that I have now approved a new telecommunications national code imposing more stringent environmental controls on the three carriers-'Telecom, Optus and Vodaphone. That has taken place after quite extensive consultations with the three carriers. Under the existing draft telecommunications code, the onus was on the telecommunications carrier to determine whether or not there had been an environmental impact ·from a proposed activity. Then it was referred to the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency So the decision was made by the carrier. Under the new code, which I have now approved, specified works will automati.; cally be referred to CEPA· and that might include, for example, a· proposal to build a tower in a world heritage area or in a national park, . or. if·· some activity was believed to threaten an endangered species. Those proposals would automatically be referred to CEPA, with.no discretion given to the carrier not to have it so referred. Any objections raised by CEPA would have to be resolved before the construction would proceed. Carriers now will be required to notify local councils of proposed works, and we could expect that the carriers and the local councils would seek to resolve by negotiation any disputes that arose. If they cannot reach agreement on any proposed works for towers for mobile telephones, the matter will be referred to CEPA. The new code also addresses community conCerns that, wherever possible, . towers be collocated. The government has licensed Telecom, Optus and Vodaphone to roll out a competitive mobile telecommunications network because we believe that, if we have three carriers ·provirling digital·mobile telephone services, we are more likely to .have competition for price and, therefore, more likely to have better service for consumersMr Bruce Scott-What about out in the bush?",84
131,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And that includes the bush. If we have only one company providing the serviceMr Bruce Scott-The bush .is ignored.,85
132,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We will not get competition or an extension to the bush. .,85
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Maranoa invites response. . Mr LEE-Under the new code, carriers will be required to collocate their mobile telephone towers where it is technically feasible, where it is compatible with their networks and where it will reduce the environmental impact. That is something I would have thought both sides of the House would have supported. I will be making sure that all local councils are advised of these new, more stringent environmental requirements on the carriers. The carriers, of course, are under an obligation to ro]] out these telephone networks and invest large sums of money to help improve the service which is available to telephone users. This new and mote stringent code seeks to balance the rights of the carriers and the consumers with the importance. of protecting the environment. I thank .the carriers and the members of the consultative group, as well as the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, for their cooperation in finaHsing this code. Prime Minister's Piggery",85
134,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Mr Bevis-Not about the environment?,86
135,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is about the environment. If you have not had the time to check it, someone in your office by now must understand that each time you have been asked a question about pollution at the environmentally questionable site of your previously owned piggeryexpansion at Parkvil1e, you have replied, and misinformed the parliament in doing so, that the Environment ProteCtion Authority of New South Wales had to suffer 'a humiJiating retraction of its statement', or words to that effect.",86
136,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. There are forms by which questions may be asked. There is no question as yet and the honourable member is about a minute into his time. That is the first point. The second point is that it is quite clear understanding orders that questions may not contain imputations and epithets and, if that was not an imputation, I do not know what is.",86
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I might say to the honourable member for Barker that the Leader of the House has indeed raised a vaHd point in respect of the suggestion that the Prime Minister has misled the House. Honourable members know that there are forms of this place which are available to them to sustain such a charge. Secondly, there have been complaints made by the Leader of the National Party today in regard to the length of answers given by ministers. I might also say that the length of questions has not helped. Mr Downer-They can spend 20 minutes answering a question, but they complain if we spend one minute asking one.",86
138,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That does not invite a response.,86
139,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With due respect, Mr Speaker, this question would have been asked by now if that interruption had not taken place. .",86
140,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question.,86
141,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Prime Minister: wil1 you now admit that, in answering questions concerning that venture at Parkvil1e, three times you cited another case in which another of your previously owned piggeries was charged with pollution, which happened to be 138 kilometres away in New South Wales, in which you escaped on a technicality? Mr Keating interjecting",86
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister wil1 get his chance to respond in a moment.,86
143,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"WiI1 you now admit that you were either deliberately misleading the House to deflect this poUution charge or you did not know which of your piggeries was being charged; in other words, you were either untruthful or a fool but,whichever it was, you were misleading this House?",86
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I find it difficult to understand, having listened to the honourable member's question, as to how that is relevant to the Prime Minister's responsibilities when, as I understand itOpposition members-Ha, hal",86
145,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I have not finished yet-and I think all honourable members understand it, the Prime Minister has no further interest. However, I wil1 give the Prime Minister the opportunity to respond.",86
146,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, we are having this silly little debate about supposedly misleading the House on whether it was one piggery or another within the one company and it was the company that was prosecuted for an action where the prosecution failed. That is, for an action where there was no pollution, where the prosecution failed, you are asking me to distinguish which property it was within the same company. I was not a director of the company or the manager. Mr MCLachlan-I asked about Parkvilleeverytime.",86
147,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I said, as I understand it, 'the Parkville property'. But it is within the same company, and the prosecution failed. So here he is, and what a potent point, up there saying, 'Oh, he's misled the parliament about which particular property within the same company'-it was the company, after all, that was prosecuted.....: 'was in a prosecution which the company actually won.' The key point concerns my responsibilities as a former shareholder. Let me just say to the honourable member for Barker that we are taking very close and intense notice of the proceedings before the Victorian Supreme Court in respect of Elders during which tim.e he was a director",87
148,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And he acted very honourably.,87
149,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, no-and at a time when his fiduciary responsibilities to the shareholders were exercised when Elders bought 19 per cent of BHP in 1986, three years before he actually tendered his resignation from the board. We will be taking note of the fiduciary responsibilities in this very serious matter now before the Victorian Supreme Court. D:-day Commemoration Mr FlTZGmBON-My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Minister, your department sponsored four veterans to travel to England and Europe to attend the recent D-day commemorations. All Australians would have applauded that decision, but I wonder whether you can inform the House as to how you view the outcomes. Having made that very, very favourable decision",87
150,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hunter will get to his question. Mr FITZGmBON-is your department giving consideration to sending veterans overseas so that they may participate in celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II?,87
151,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hunter for his question. It is an excellent question. You will notice that he did not read it out. The outcome of that visit was absolutely and utterly excellent. The four veterans who went overseas and represented this country as ambassadors at the D-day celebrations, accompanied by the Prime Minister, represented .the branches of the armed services and one was also an exprisoner of war.· I am very pleased and proud to be able to say-and I have just had lunch with them-that they are sitting up there in the gallery this afternoon. Honourable members-Hear,hear!",87
152,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to take the time qf the House for a few minutes simply to tell you about these four peopie, because I think their history is incredible. Commander Tony Robinson was on the battleship HMS Rodney at Normandy on that day. He told me the defending forces were .actually stupid enough to fire at the battleship, so it had to fire back. Colonel Leslie Coleman was one of the eight army officers who were participants in the D-day landings. Victor Carle was one of the 7,000 Australian prisoners ofwar who were waiting to be liberated. Wing Commander ROllO Kingsford-Smith, a nephew of Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith, was on an Australian Lancaster that carried out a bombing mission on D-day.

I db nonhink we will be in a position financially to be sending overseas hundreds of the 320,000 World War II. people who are still alive, but we can still do the same sorts of things that we have done in the past. We will focus on a number of events and we can possibly do the same thing on an ambassadorial·basis. As far as next year is concerned there will be massive commemorations throughout the world marking the end of World War II. My department at present is working on a com;. memorationc:oncept which I·will·announce on 15 August. At this stage the concept is 1945, 1995: Australia remembers. On 15 August it will be 12 months prior to Victory in the Pacific Day. That is· why it is important. I intend to ensure that we commemorate that war here in Australia, which was under threat, culminating in Victory in the Pacific Day. On behalf of the parliament and the government I thank our four veterans up. there and their wives for coming. You are a credit to this country. I know that you had a great time over there with the Prime Minister. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Constitution",87
154,Mr MILES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Prime Minister to his decision to provide a fourth education· kit for schools on the constitution and to the following information. An extensive kit covering the constitution and our constitutional heritage was produced in 1987-88 at a cost of approximately $1 million. Two more kits are in the process of b-ing produced for distribution in 1995, at an estimated cost of $300,000. I ask the Prime Minister:·what will be in the .fourth kit that is not in the first three kits? How will students' understanding of the constitution be improved by the fourth kit that cannot already be achieved by. the use of the first three kits? How much will this personal crusade to rewrite Australian history cost the Australian taxpayers?",88

Thegroup·will do much more th-lD look at resource mat-rials for school; it will plan an integrated approach aimed at informing all.Australians. The group is required to consult with relevantorganisations, including the Constitutional Centenary Foundation, political parties,· the educatiori sector and the Parliamentary Education Office to determine how best to draw on the valuable work already done by others. The group will also focus on making best use of existing programs and delivering mechanisms. The group will have a wider focus than the Parliamentary Education Office and will look at civics in the broadest sense-1 suppose this is a point the honourable gentleman should note-including the working of state and local government and the rights and obligations of citizenship, not just the Commonwealth Parliament and the constitution, which is the primary focus of the Parliamentary Education Office.

' Debate (on motion by Mr Howard) adNA Superannuation and Savings ' Mr Speaker. I have received a letter from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) proposing that a definite matter fot of public importance be submitted to' the House for discussion, l1amely: "" The failure of the Government's superannuation and humanitarand savings policies. reIcaH upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing, orders having risen in their places-, Mr COSTELLO{Higgins-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (4.04 p.m.)-This government's savings policy is an absolute shambles. The government has no direction and has no clear path in whiCh to go. It is unwiIIing to take comprehensive decisions. The statement on superannuation the day before yesterday was a complete wipeout. , Nothing illustrates this government's problem with its saving policy more than the situation with Australia's foreign debt. When the Keating government came to economic management in this GOuntry, foreign, debt stood in net terms at about $23 billion. Today it stands at $164 billion. There has been a \,sevenfold increase in foreign debt over the last decade under the management of the I(eating .government. This government has made Australia a debt junkie, borrowing from overseas to try to fund deficits, investments and infrastructure because it· has not put in place a policy to create domestic savings. When those monthly current account figures come in month after 'month we find that the major component of those current account deficits is the servicing costs on foreign debt. Today's balance of payments figures show another $1.3 billion in servicing costs on Australian foreign debt, making the current account deficit for May $1.7 billion. The current account deficit in May was worse than April, April was worse than March, and March was worse than February. Last year the government, in an effort to try to make it look as if it was doing something about this, commissioned the FitzGerald report on national savings. Reports are what the government specialises in. When it has a problem it commissions a report in the hope that the problem will go away. We even heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) address the Labor party caucus and say that the government was going to do a report on foreign debt. As if a report is going to solve the problem of foreign debt! As if a report is going to make the absolute negligence of the government on foreign debt go away-the 'let the children pay' policy of the Labor party to rack up foreign debt and interest servicing costs. In the FitzGerald report on national savings, Dr FitzGerald found that Australia's underlying structural rate of national savings had fallen to around 18 per cent of GDP, five percentage points below the average for the past three decades. He also found that the main contributor to the long-term decline in national savings was the decline in public sector s-vings. Dr FitzGerald said: We cannot, and should not, as a nation expect to finance future growth. of our economy by going substantially further into debt to foreigners. The extent to which we can grow over the mid and late 1990s and beyond will depend on how much we can lift domestic savings. This government used that report as a callous cover for electoral fraud. The sole purpose that the government used the FitzGerald report was to build up to a comprehensive breaking of all of its election promises in the August budget introduced by John Dawkins. It took away $5 billion worth of tax cuts, which. were not just an election promise; they were legisla.tion. . Mr Downer-L-a-w. , Mr COSTELLO-They were l-a-w, which you had legislated 'to put it beyond doubt', you said, before the last election. Yet you used the FitzGerald report to take it away. It was a cover for electoral fraud to introduce increased sales taxes, increased petrol excise and. increased wine tax, but you did nothing to boost savings. This government's policy has been an absolute dud on savings. When you woke up yesterday morning you must have had a chill down your spine because the Australian Financial Review nailed you. It nailed this government's policy on savings. The article had a' big banner headline 'Govt dumps savings plan'. It even ha.d Dr Vince FitzGerald quoted on the front as saying: The 'Treasurer's statement on superannuation essent,is\ly opts for the status quo ... It does not go to the core issues. Dead right, Vince. That is right on the knocker, right on the nail. It hit you right where you were worse and most complacent and most negligent. It must have so upset the Treasurer (Mr Willis) that he was moved overnight to try to write a reply in today's Financial Review. Mr Downer-His office wrote it. Mr.COSTELLO-His office wrote it. You can tell when the Treasurer writes it because he comes in with these extensive sheets of foolscap from which he reads his answers to questions. His office must have been moved by being nailed in the Financial Review because it wrote an. article today to try to justify the unjustifiable, to defend the indefensible. Vince FitzGerald found that the great miscreant on savings in this country was the government itself. The government is trying to say that it has got in place a deficit reduction target which is one of the best in the world. The Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), in his ebullient way in this parliament, claimed on 7 June that Australia was better by a country mile on deficit reduction than other countries in the DECO. He failed to read the Westpac Market Insights of the day before, which stated: Despite relying on lower growth projections, government have more ambitious deficit reduction strategies than Australia. It produced tables to show that Canada, France, the United Kingdom and New Zealand are all making faster progress. They may be coming off a higher base, but they are making faster progress. If we extend deficit reduction out to the year 2000, Australia is going to have a worse record than the following countries in the aECD: France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Portugal and Sweden. Even Sweden is going to do better over the decade to the year 2000. Despite all the huffing and puffing and reading from those foolscap sheets in relation to dorothy dixers in question time today, you have opened up a $38 billion hole on the One Nation document. Remember the One Nation document? The One Nation document was the prime ministerial mandate. This was the document that was going to transform the world's worse Treasurer into the world's best Prime Minister. It was his document to try to define his vision for Australia. Just get your mind firmly around these figures in the One Nation document-this is what the Prime Minister said deficit outcomes would be-1992-93, $8.1 billion; 1993-94, $4.6 billion; 1994-95, $0.7 billion; and 199697, a surplus of $2 billion. This is how this year's budget says those forecasts will fall short. It will fall short in 1992-93 by $6.5 billion; in 1993-94 by $9 billion; in 1994-95 by $11 billion; and in 1995-96 by $11.8 billion. You managed to lose $38 billion between the One Nation statement and this year's budget-$38 billion. You get up and talk about billion dollar so called promises, but this is the biggest hole we have seen in government history. I bet you just wish that that hole would open up and swallow the Prime Minister, the man who created this problem for you. Do not ever get to the dispatch box and talk about deficitsr You have a $38 billion hole. That is your economic management of the promises, the yardsticks, that were made. by the Prime Minister in his One Nation statement. It is no good twiddling your thumbs and saying that interest rate rises and bond yields in Australia most have nothing to do with domestic conditions. You. have put a $38 billion drain over those four years on the savings of Australia. The government has had so many lines·on bond rate rises that it is hard to keep up with them. At first it said that it was all the fault of the New York bond markets, that the New York bond markets have been driving the increase in bond yields. But let us have a look at a few facts. In August 1993, US 10-year bonds were 6.18 per cent and on 29 June they were 7.23 per cent-a 1.05 per cent increase. Let us compare that with Australia over the same period. Our bond rates over 10 years have gone from 6.65 per cent to 9.65 per cent, a three per cent increase over the same period-triple the movement in the US bond rates. Do not try to say that this is all being driven by New York. You know that in Australia it has been worse than New York with three times the increase of that in New York. One of the prime reasons is that you have been putting pressure on money as a result of the Commonwealth government budgetary strategy. Then when it was no longer the fault of the New York bond markets that bond yields were going up, the government said that it was all the fault of the opposition, that the opposition had single-handedly put up bond rates. It is Wall Street one day and the office of the Leader of the Opposition the next day-single-handedly taking up bond rates. We cannot believe that we are so powerful. Oh, that we were! Oh, that you could run the Australian economy from opposition! Oh, that you could run WaH Street! You can just see them at J.B. Morgan on Wall Street sitting down there saying, 'What has the Leader of the Opposition said today about Australia? What did Costello say in his doorstop tonight? We have got to move bond rates.' You know that in Australia they are react,ing to your fiscal strategy. A $38 billion hole and a Commonwealth financing task of $20.4 billion in 1994-95 have put· pressure on interest rates. This gives us no joy. We do not want to see Australian, home buyers paying $11 more a month because their home mortgage rates go up by one per cent; we do not want to see people paying more for bankcards;artd we do not want to see busi.,. ness paying more for interest rates. We have been warning about this for some time. We have been saying to you, 'Don't do it.' The consequences of your doing it put pressure on interest rates. If you did not want to listen to us, you could have listened to Westpac, Syntec or Potter Warburg, but you refused to do so. You have sown the wind and you are reaping the whirlwind. In relation to savings policy, you could have done, something for Australia the day before yesterday. In relation to your superannuation statement,' you could have come in here and said, 'Yes, we will give the green light' - as was raised by FitzGerald and as was posited by your predecessor, John Dawkins-'to superannuation saving accounts.' You could have given a break to people putting money into superannuation saving accounts, in banks; you could have given the banks and the building societieswhich were offering to take small contributions without fees-the opportunity to collect them so people could have had their small contributions in abuilding society in their name rather than collected by the tax office. You could have done something like that, and we believe you probably even wanted to deep down in your heart of hearts. But you could not, and you could not for one reason. It is the one reason that stops this government in relation to so many matters. It is because Bill said no. Thatwas the problem. BiIl Kelty said no; and if Bill says no it is the agenda: There ain't no hope if Bill says no. There ain't no hope of doing something to give greater competition, greater opportunity,a more competitive system, competitive neutrality between financial intermediaries and the opportunity for people to have their own accounts in their own names in their oWn financial institutions. But you were not being motivated by competition,consumer choice or savings; you were being motivated by crass political deal making. It was all about crass political deal making. You stand up here and say to Australians, 'Rest assured, because your savings are going into the tax office."" People know that the tax office takes; they do not believe the tax office invests. The tax office is not a freelance collection agency operating on behalf of de9t collection agencies; the tax office is there to raise and protect revenue. It has huge powers to do so. It is not a general collection agency. The tax office now collects higher education charges and child ,support payments. Have a look at the damning report of the Auditor-General on the tax office ,in relation to the Child Support Agency., And what do you want to do? You want to have the ,tax office collecting superannuation of low paid Australians, women, and itinerant and casual workers. You are trying to dress this up as some kind of improvement. It is not an improvement at all. You have locked out the banks. You do not want competitiye neutrality. You have given away the opportunity to develop a better savings system; you have given away the opportunity to get some neutrality in relation to financial institutions; and you Ilave given away the opportunity to have, more competition and the pressure that that would put on investment charges. You have done it for only one reason-the same reason that your whole superannuation is structured as it is. You were more interested in who was going to receive the, money and ,who was going to control its distribution than in the interests of those who were going to own it and those who were going to retire on it. That is why your savings strategy is no good, that is why you cannot ,deal with the FitzGerald report and that is why you are applying off pressure in the way you are through fiscal and monetary policy.

171,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In the last quarter of an hour, we listened to a mishmash of ravings from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), who had nothing constructive to say about superannuation in his address to the Federation of Superannuation Associations yesterday or in this House in his address to the parliament. Essentially, what the opposition has just said about superannuation is, 'There is a big problem out there with small accounts. We do not know what to do about it, but at least you should have given the banks the right to have superannuation savings accounts. Other than that, we have no answers. That is basically all we could do.' That is a total confession of failure; a total confession that those opposite have no solution to the problem of small accounts; a total confession that they have no superannuation policy that makes any sense at all; a total confession that no real thinking has gone into superannuation policy on the other side. Those opposite have listened to some complaints from the banks which have said that they would like it to be operated in a slightly different way so that they can get more direct access to superannuation-which is pretty direct anyway-than they have at the moment. They have said, 'That will do us. That will be our policy.' What a pathetic policy that is. If you are concerned and want to resolve the small accounts issue, you have to take the kind of action that was outlined in my statement. Mr Costello-Ha, hal",93
172,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You laugh, but that is a fact. Mr Costello-Of course I do; the whole of Australia laughs.",94
173,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The whole of Australia, except the opposition, appreciates what has been done by us. Mr Ronaldson-Ha, hal",94
174,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Certainly they do; look at the sorts of comments that have been made by most of the users in the industry. What it means is that people with small accounts are now protected; they will not go backwards. Under the opposition, there would be an absolute capacity for them to continue to go backwards because the opposition would provide no comprehensive solution. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have no solution to, and do not care about, that problem. They do not mind if people's superannuation accounts are small and would disappear over time because the interest rate is not as much as the charges against them. They would be quite happy for that situation to continue. It is a pathetic policy to say that superannuation saving· accounts are some kind of adequate response. It would simply be another means by which banks could provide some kind of superannuation facility. They can already provide superannuation to .customers who walk through the door and say, 'I want to open a superannuation account.' They say, 'Yes, you can. It is quite easy and quite simple. Here is what you do.' They can fix it up in a very short period and people can make payments into that account quite easily. It is just as though the money is being directly held on the bank's account, except that it has to go through a life office, associated company or subsidiary. The customer would not know that. As far as the bank is concerned, in most cases the money comes back onto the bank's books anyway. In some cases, such as the ANZ Bank, it goes back wholly to the bank's deposits. In other cases, there is a choicebank deposits or managed funds. Some managed funds would probably finish up in bank deposits anyway. So the banks have that facility at present. Giving superannuation saving accounts would not be a solution to the small accounts problem, particularly in the circumstances where people already run small accounts and go backwards. Banks do not mind running passbook accounts. At present, if you have less than $500 in your account, you are charged $2 a month. Your account erodes as you are paying more in charges than you are earning in interest. At present, the interest rate on a passbook account is between one per cent and 1III per cent. So if you have an account of $300, 'you are making about $4.50 a year at most, but you would be charged $2 a month. That is going backwards at a rate of knots. With that kind of background, can we really expect banks to give an adequate solution to the small accounts problem? They· gave no such guarantees. Right at the death knock the banks said, 'Maybe we can come up with something. which would give a guarantee about that.' That was a last minute thought and was still no solution to the small accounts problem. If the banks did that, that would be one place where people could put money and not go backwards. But many other people would have small amounts in funds all over the place and would be going backwards. There is no solution in what members of the opposition are proposing. They oppose the use of the ATO, which is necessary, otherwise the only comprehensive solution is to fee cap the funds. To be a· complying fund you must fee cap. That might be very difficult for funds. To give funds the choice and not. to impose that on the funds absolutely we said, 'You can either do that or you can use the ATO if you don't want to fee cap.' That is an absolutely reasonable proposal which gives the funds some choice and means that the customers, the people who want their superannuation protected, have absolute protection. It is a great change and is a boost to national savings because it means that savings put into superannuation funds will no longer erode. So we are getting a boost to national savings. It is an absurdity to suggest that there is nothing in this proposal which helps with national savings - saying The fact is that the opposition seems. to think firstly that this issue does not matter very much; secondly, that we should have adopted the FitzGerald report holus-bolus; and, thirdly, that we are somehow retrograde because we did not accept a couple of the recommendations. I am very interested to hear that proposition from'members of the opposition. Does that mean that they accept the FitzGerald recommendation to introduce a tax on owner-occupied housing? Is that what they want? We rejected that recommendation but apparently you think you should have it because it is a FitzGerald recommendation. Mr Ronaldson-Oh, come on, Ralph.",94
175,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And you say that we should· have adopted the FitzGerald report. Members of the opposition are saying that they think we should have a tax on owner-occupied homes. That is their position. They think also that we should adopt the FitzGerald recommendation on abolishing negative gearing on housing. They think that that is fine. Why not do that as well, because it is a FitzGerald recommendation? They think that we should not be knocking back recommendations like this. Let us get into it and have FitzGerald's recommendations accepted-except for. one, because he said that people should not have access to their superannuation funds for their housing requirements. We listened and looked at that recommen.:. dation .. We were told to reconsider it, so we reconsidered it in line with the FitzGerald report and looked in detail at the implications sma)) of the recommendation. The study done by Treasury shows that there would be a large leakage of savings-half the benefit of savings that would have come from compulsory superannuation would be lost if we .were to maintain that recommendation. So, to ensure that we had a good savings performance in this country, we retracted that promise. That recommendation was not taken up not because we simply wanted to play fast and loose but because proper analysis showed that it would have. a damaging impact on savings in Australia. The opposition is saying that we should have kept that promise. The opposition is that it does not matter a damn about the loss of savings and that we should have kept that promise. Presumably it is also the opposition's position that if it got into government it would still go ahead with that recommendation, which would mean a major loss of savings. The analysis of Treasury shows that hlllf the benefits from compulsory superannuation would be lost in that way, yet the opposition seems to think that that is okay. We are in a ridiculous' position. If we adopted the FitzGerald report hoI us-bolus, the opposition, when it came to a recommendation like that, would pick it out and say, 'You've broken your promise, that's terrible. You shouldn't have done that. You shouldn't have complied with the FitzGerald report on that issue.' What a hopeless position this opposition is in. In respect of public sector savings, members of the opposition say that we should make sure that we have lower deficits and that we should keep the deficit reduced so we have less in the way of leakage through the public sector. of our national savings and improve our savings performance. What were they doing last year?· They were trying to block a. reduction of the. deficit· 1996-97 worth $3 billion. They were quite happy to do that. They did not give a damn about the impact on national savings. They were just doing what they thought was the politically smart thing to do-capitalise on the fact that the government had increased some taxes-because that was something that they could oppose and be popular on. They were not concerned one damn bit about the impact on national savings, and they have the effrontery to stand up here today and lecture us about having a proper approach to the deficit and about getting the deficit down when last year they would have quite happily seen us have a deficit much higher in 1996-97-$3 billion higher. The government has a responsible fiscal policy. I said the other day in the House that we have one of the lowest public sector deficits in the Western world. We are towards the lower end of the scale. In that sense, we are doing well compared to most other Western industrial countries. The National Australia Bank published a table in its recent Decisions publication which shows quite clearly that Australia is towards the bottom end of that scale. Some 11 out of 17 OECD countries have larger deficits than ours and the deficits range from 4.4 per cent of GDP to 12th per cent of GDP. These are all western industrial countries. These figures compare to our deficit. of 3.2 per cent of GDP for 1993-94 which we will be tracking down to less than one per cent by 1996-97. Of the Western industrial countries that have set deficit reduction targets, there is no other country that will be down to less than one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. Those opposite should not give us this nonsense about not having an appropriate deficit reduction target or a tough deficit reduction target. Australia is the only country of those that have nominated a deficit reduction target that is looking to be below one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. The government is certainly responding to the need to have improvements in national savings by getting the deficit doWIl. I absolutely reject the charge from the opposition that the government has by been irresponsible in not getting the deficit down fast enough to improve national savings.In comparison with other countries we are doing well. The FitzGerald report recommended-'""and I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition actually said this-that the major way to improve savings in this country. is to. get the deficit down. We are doing that in a thoroughly responsible way. We are not, as the opposition would have us do, running around cutting expenditure and running costs to get the deficit down. That is the greatest furphy of all time. I mentioned at question time today that the opposition would dip into the $12 billion of running costs to pay for the deficit reduction, for this or that tax concession and more expenditure here and more expenditure there. That is just an absolute load of old cobblers, as everyone should realise. The opposition has already spent the $12 billion of running costs. To suggest that we could spend these running costs in a painless way and not affect programs is absolutely ridiculous. The people of Australia should wake up to the fact that the opposition is trying desperately to hide its real· policies, which are· to make substantial cuts in programs to pay for the various concessions and deficit reductions that it would like to make. They should realise that those cuts in programs will. be hurtful to. people. But the opposition does not want to spell that out because it wants to make believe that there is some great magic pudding called running costs that it can dive into and keep pulling out billions and billions of dollars. That is a load of rubbish. We have exposed the opposition in that regard. We expect that from now on, the opposition will make clear to the Australian people when it proposes more expenditure. tax concessions how it is actually going to pay for them and not talk this rubbish about how it will pay for them out of running costs. I believe the FitzGerald report has bef¥} a very good report' for this country. It has focused attention on savings. The government has responded to that report in a thoroughly sincere way. We have not accepted every recommendation of the FitzGerald report. Some of the things that those opposite have said we have rejected have not been substantively rejected. For instance, in relation to employee co-contributions, Vince FitzGerald said, 'You should set a date for this.' We did not set a date; we do not think it is appropriate to do that because we would have to do that in terms of a tax cut. We will do that sometime in the future when we can afford it. We think it should be done. We believe that we should have an employee co-contribution. The government is committed to building.the SGC from nine per cent to 12 per cent. The opposition would freeze the SGC and then try to induce people into superannuation by expensive tax concessions which it cannot pay for. (Time expired)",95
176,Mr FORREST,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The statement of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on Tuesday was an appalling disappointment. has the nerve to stand here and accuse opposition of being pathetic. That is not view. It was expressed to me yesterday Sunraysia at an important national seminar the Dried Fruits Association. I distributed a copy of the Treasurer's statement to the association because it had a resolution relating to it at that conference. Their comments about the Treasurer's statement would be. unparliathey mentary, so I will not repeat them in this chamber. The comments have something to do with the propensity of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for certain parts of the human anatomy. That was the association's response to the Treasurer's statement. This association has particular concerns which it has expressed to the government about the situation in respect to itinerant labour in this very important export industry. The honourable member for Higg-s (Mr Costello) has pointed out on a broad scale substantial criticisms that can be made of the government for not responding to the enormous problem that it has created across Australia. This measure will be an additional impost to running a business. It will also mean that there is more paperwork for small business to attend to. This will be a further disincentive to employment. On behalf of the horticultural industries, let me express their concerns about the situation that still continues, even with the announcement by the Treasurer, as to how the government is going to collect small collections. Rural industries use casual labour on a regular basis. Unlike many other industries, where labour represents only a small part of the costs of operating, in horticulture the proportion is. much greater, representing as high as 50 per cent of the operating costs. The resultant needless waste associated with the cost of compliance with the superannuation guarantee charge is very difficult for the growers that I was with yesterday to understand or accept. They also find it difficult to accept the government's lack of willingness to hear their concerns. Seasonal labour in the horticulture industry is made up of a range of people in the community. The casual workers can be tertiary He students on holidays who may never, after the working for three weeks in the industry, my return to it. They could also include housein wives or parents who are seeking some of weekend work for two or three weeks to collect a little bit of extra money to send their children away to get a tertiary education. The . government has made it so expensive for rural people to get an education that that is what have to do. They might do that for one season and never return to the industry. In addition, there are regular and consistent seasonal workers of an itinerant nature that go from itinerant industry to itinerant industry. They might work all through Queensland, in the sugar industry in the electorate of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). They might then move into the stone fruit industry in the electorate of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). Mr Braithwaite-In the Riverina.",97
177,Mr FORREST,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They might then move back up to the Riverina area and work in the vegetable and citrus industry. Then they might even come down to the Wimmera and work in the shearing industry. Under the old arrangements each industry had a collection of small amounts of money right across the nation. This government has absolutely no idea how many small accounts there are out there. In his statement the Treasurer estimates that there are somewhere between one million and two million out there involving S111-1l funds. Goodness knows how much of the money in these small accounts has been wasted over the last two years in providing windfalls for insurance companies and superannuation managers. There was no logical reason why money paid to various employers could not have been lodged with one superannuation fund of the employees' choice. This option was not adopted by the government. I have received an enormous number of complaints about this issue and I have continued'to bring them to the attention of the government. These problems do not just exist in the horticultural industry; they exist right across the nation. In the Age newspaper on Tuesday there was an article about a Miss Kathleen Swinbourne. After two or three years of casual work in a service industry, this woman went to collect her fund, as she was entitled to,and discovered that there was only $1.23 available for her. What a disgusting situation! What a complete act of irresponsibility the government has, perpetrated on the people of Australia when it instigated such an intransigent system as the superannuation guarantee charge. The people of Australia should never forgive this government for making this monumental blunder. It is now attempting to fix the blunder, but it will probably create yet another situation which will not benefit this nation or the people making contributions, which come from employers' pockets and at a cost to industry. The reaction of the lady to; whom I just referred, as reported in the Age, was that the whole saga was a joke-a joke which had been perpetrated on the employers, the small business people across Australia, who have contributed their own funds to superannuation to the benefit of superannuation fund managers. It has been a cost particularly to export industries, which have received no substantial benefit with respeCt to the purpose for which it was intended; that is, to provide retirement benefits for the people concerned. I have another example, which I have brought to the attention of the government on many occasions, relating to student exchanges, particularly in the agricultural industry. What an absurd situation the government has created. Any income received by a student while in this country on an international exchange, which is meant to foster goodwill and good trade in the future, has' to be referred to a super fund management account. The problem is not just that a lot of paperwork has to be done initially: when that student wants to return to his or her own country, more paperwork has to be dorie in order for that fund to be released. It is an absolute absurdity that the government has captured in its grand net so many inriocent people. It has not gjvep adequate consideration to the position' of itinerant labour. Mr Braithwaite-The cost of overregulation.",97
178,Mr FORREST,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is just another example of this government's propensity to overregulate and place imposts on small business. Yesterday, one of my constituents brought to my attention an,other concern of this nature. He is a baker who is trying to comply with the requirements for compulsory uniforms for his staff. He has been battling for three months with the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority to get approval, through the tax department, for tax deductions for those uniforms. This is a further example of more government regulation and more imposts on, and costs to, small business. Why does this government hate small business? The superannuation guarantee charge has been another example of that. The government has 'created disincentives for employers to do what this country so badly needs. There are 700,000 or 800,000 small business employers out there who are willing to put on one extra person but, when they are faced with an enormous amount of paperwork simply for the privilege of doing so, they decide against it and choose to work a lot harder. There are businesses run by mums and dads who are working 90 to 100 hours a week rather than employing people because they are deterred by the excessive amount of paperwork that is required. The Treasurer's statement does not draw attention to the bona fides and authenticity of the tax file number,and this is a particular problem with itinerant labour. Many of my growers complain about the fact that, when returning group tax, envelopes are often returned because the addresses have not been bona fide. It is impossible for growers to check the names and addresses of itinerant workers because they may see them for only one season. The Treasurer's suggestion to use the tax office does not address the problem of itinerant labour. It will continue to be a massive problem. I have no doubt that a similar situation will occur to that which occurred with the Child. Support Agency, where the tax department has been incapable of meeting that very serious need. The situation with respect to local government councillors is absurd. I received a letter from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) dated 27 October, in which he said that local government councillors were regarded as employees. Yet, two days later, in respect of the training guarantee levy; he expressed the point of view that they were not employees. What an example of' the government's lack of attention to detail. (Time expired)",98
179,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was genuinely surprised when, in the course of his contribution, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), referred to an article by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in today's Australian Financial Review. Given some of the earlier contributions of those opposite on economic matters, I was convinced that those on the other side of the House, firstly, do not read the Australian Financial-and, secondly, those that do, do not understand it. The Treasurer has made many contributions on this subject. He made a speech to LIFA at the end of May; a statement to the House this week; and a contribution in question time and on the MPI. The only criticism of him· that I have is that he spoke for too long in the debate on the MPI. He should have simply referred to his article in today's Australian Financial Review, tabled it and. left it at that. He did not have to spend another 19 minutes giving the opposition the rounds of the kitchen on this issue. Let us look at the history of this. The opposition has some gall to stand up and even talk about superannuation; let alone criticise it What is the history of superannuation in this country? In the last 10 years, this government has virtually created the superannuation industry. It has made sure that superannuation will provide fgr the retirement of Australians and that it is open to low and middle income earners. Prior to 1983, the opposition had no interest in superannuation whatsoever, other than in the way it affected the top end of the market. Its only interest was in ensuring that there was a nice little tax break for the upper income earners. It was not concerned about lower and middle income earners at all. Let us look at what has occurred since 1983 as 'a direct result of our policies. Firstly, we have extended superannuation through award provisions and, more recently, the superannuation guarantee charge. What has been the effect-of those policies? Fi-tly, we have seen a massive expansion in the coverage of the number of employees in this country. Secondly, we have seen a massive increase in the amount of funds held by the superannuation industry, which has a direct positive effect on savings in this country. Thirqly,we have seen low income earners with small amounts treated equitably. That was the thrust of the Treasurer's statement this week. Let us look at some of the facts about coverage. Those opposite do not need to rely upon assertions on this side of the House. A press release by the Australian Bureau of St/ltisticsdated 23 June, which is headed, 'Superannuation coverage rises to 80 per cent', states: Superannuation coverage of employed Australians rose to - 80 per cent in November 1993. This continues the upward trend reporte9 in - November 1991 when the level of superannuation coverage had increased from 51 per cent in November 1988 to 71 per cent. It goes on to state: ... 6.1 million employed people aged 15 to 74 were covered by a superannuation scheme ... 82 per cent of men had superannuation coverage ... The level of coverage for women was 78 per cent. Wage and salary earners reported the· highest superannuation coverage rate with 89 per cent. That is virtually double the figure of that comparable category in 1983. So we have seen a massive expansion in that area. The release - ontinues: . 93 per Cent of full-time employees were covered by superannuation compared with 71 per cent of those who worked part-time ... That is our record in an area in which the opposition, when it was last in government, showed no interest whatsoever. It is worth looking at some of the figures for casual and part-time employees contained in the ABS report. I quote: the majority of casual and part-time employrate ees, superannuation coverage has increased from 72 per cent in November ·1991 to 86 per cent in November 1993. In the main, the casual and part-time empl0Yment area comprises women and low income earners. The government has seen a massive expansion of superannuation coverage in that area. I refer to the direct positive effect that the increase in superannuation funds has had on savings in this country. In 1983, about $40 billion was held .by superannuation funds. Now the figure is nearly $200 billion. That amount is expe-ted to double by the year 2000. As well, savings in this country have increased by 2.2 per cent of GDP since the June quarter of 1992. . What does the opposition have to say in terms of policy in this area? Its basic policy is single-minded. It is the same as its approach in the health insurance area, which is 'give tax concessions'. Its whole argument is that there should be additional and new concessional tax arrangements in superannuation and tax deductions for contributions in this area. That does two things. Firstly, it benefits mo-t high income earners-the opposition's sole interest. Secondly, it has a direct effect on the deficit-a point which Dr FitzGerald made quite clear. In his report, Dr FitzGerald said that tax concessions alone are not a net contributor to savings. I will come to a quote from Dr FitzGerald shortly. The article that the Treasurer prepared for this morning's Financial Review is worth drawing from and making a couple of points about. The shadow Treasurer referred to the article but did not draw froin it. The points made by the Treasurer succinctly summarise the thrust of the government's policy in this area. The Treasurer says in his article that the key elements of the government's savings strategy include: · .. a budget deficit reduction program, which was maintained and accelerated in the 1994-95 Budget, and which is consistent with the fiscal policy directions recommended by the FitzGerald Report. It goes on to say: For corporate saving: historically low corporate taxation (with a company tax rate of 33 per cent and full dividend imputation) providing for a strong of accumulation of earnings by companies and their shareholders. The key point I want to focus on here is the attraction of the 33 per cent company tax rate. We went to the election with a commitment to reduce that rate from 39 per cent to 33 per ceJ)t at precisely the time the opposition had a policy of increasing it from 39 per cent to 45 per cent, plus a 15 per cent GST. The next point that the Treasurer makes relates to the massive expansion and the success of those policies. He says that the superannuation guarantee: · . . has been so successful that superannuation coverage of full-time permanent employees has increased from 88 per cent in November 1991 to 96 per cent in November 1993. He makes the following point: In 1983 there was $40 billion in national saving accumulated in superannuation. That figure is now around $180 billion, and it is expected to double by the year 2000. He concludes his piece by summarising the thrust of his statement this week: · .. the principal reform in my statementprotecting small amounts-will itself make a significant contribution to national saving, as well as ensuring that all Australian workers receive real benefits from superannuation. In summary, government policy in this area does three key things: it massively expands the range of low and middle income 'earners and employees who have access to superannuation schemes; it massively increases the amount of ,funds available for national savings; and the, most recent change ensures that the,schemes are fair and equitable in the case of workers with small amounts to contribute. . The shadow Treasurer's contribution in this area was something of a surprise. I refer the House to an article in the Weekend Australian of 9 April 1994. In referring to the failed attempt by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition after the last election to wrest that position from his predecessor, the article states: When he said, during his campaign for the deputy leadership after the last election, that he had always had a strong interest in social issues, one Opposition frontbencher quipped that ""saying Peter Costello had an interest in social issues is like saying Dracula isa vegetarian"".' Having now found the super blood bank, the shadow Treasurer wants to open up the flood gates. How does he want to open up the flood gates? He wants to give concessional tax treatment to high income earners. What did Dr FitzGerald say about that? In his report Dr FitzGerald said, There is'little doubt tax advantaged savings vehicles, attract large amounts of savings. However there is a question mark over whether they are better at attracting new saving, rather than just existing savings, and an even bigger question mark as to whether the additional saving outweighs the cost to Government saving. What is he saying there? He is saying that tax concessions alone. are not a net contributor to savings and the effect of that will be to expand the budget deficit. It will not treat the budget deficit in·the way the government is treating it, with its deficit reduction strategy of about one per cent of GOP by 1996-97, ensuring that that makes a substantial contribution to government savings in addition to its retirement income and superannuation policies.",99

181,Mr LINDSAY,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSAL,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (5.01 p.m.)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No.4 (1994) The tariff proposal which I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The changes will operate on and from 1 July 1994. As part of the government's automotive policy pertaining to the automotive industry until the year 2000, which was announced by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce in the March 1991 industry statement, tariffs on passenger motor vehicle, PMV, replacement components were to be maintained at 15 per cent from 1 July 1992. Tariffs on replacement components for light commercial and other vehicles are excluded and will reduce in line with general tariff phasings to 5 per cent on 1 July 1996. This tariff proposal redresses certain anomalies which arose in the implementation of the government's policy. Specifically, a small number of tariff classifications were omitted from the final PMV schedule of replacement components. There were also a small number of other classifications for which rates of duty had already fallen below the 15 per cent threshold. Omission of the relevant classifications from the final PMV schedule of replacement components introduces an element of inconsistency in the application of government assistance for the Australian automotive sector. From a broader industry policy perspective, legislation will be introduced in the next session of parliament dealing with Australia's future tariff obligations arising froIll the recently concluded Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. . In due course, some of the items, which are the sllbject of this proposal ill the PMV schedule of replacement components, may require further modification depending upon specific international tariff bindings on industry products and our future international commitments. A summary of the alterations contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ronaldson) adjourned. NA Privileges Committee Report",102
182,Mr SAWFORD,COMMITTEES,"I present the report from the Committee of Privileges in connection with the matter referred to the committee by the House on 23 March 1994: possible discrimination against a witness who had appeared before the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",102
183,Mr SAWFORD,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report I have just presented follows the decision of the House on 23 March to refer to the committee  discriminated against or penalised on account of his participation in an inquiry conducted by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. This matter was raised in the House by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) as chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The honourable member stated that Mr Pool, who had given evidence to his committee, had written to the committee on 15 February claiming that on a visit to the offices of army materiel in Canberra on 21 December 1993 he had been denied access, allegedly, on the grounds that he had appeared before the committee. The honourable member provided certain other information to the House and, later that day, the Acting Speaker allowed priority to a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges.   at the time of the alleged incident; the honourable member for Brisbane; and the Secretary, Department of Defence, to lodge written submissions on the matter. The honourable member for Brisbane outlined details of Mr Pool's involvement with his committee's inquiry. Mr Brown advised that he did not wish to make a submission to the committee. The Acting Secretary, Department of Defence, provided a detailed submission. This submission by the Department of  denied access to officers of army materiel on 21 December. The department stated that Mr Pool had not had a previously arranged appointment and that, at the time of the visit, officers of the division were in the process of preparing a response to questions raised by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology-questions which were a consequence of the committee's discussions  division had had difficulties in. its business  contacted felt that it would be inappropriate to have personal discussions with him while they were in the course of preparing a further report to the Minister for Defence on issues  the committe-. My committee has not been able to reach a conclusion on this matter because it was  matter to be taken any further. While it would have been within the power of the committee to proceed with the inquiry and to require Mr Pool to give evidence, the committee chose not to do so in all the circumstances. It has therefore been unable to make a finding on the reference, and reports to the House accordingly. Certain Family Law Issues Committee Motion (by Mr Johns, for Mr Beazley) proposed: (I) That the resolution of appointment of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues be amended: (a) by inserting after subparagraph (I)(b) the following new subparagraph: ""(c) the Auditor-General's audit report No. 39 of 1993-94-Efficiency audit-Australian Taxation Office: Management of the Child Support Agency.""; and (b) by omitting from paragraph (15) ""31 August 1994"" and substituting ""30 June 1995"". (2) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution and requesting that it concur and take action accordingly.  few comments to make on the motion to refer the Child Support Agency ANAO report to the Joint Standing Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. I think it is of no surprise to anybody that the CSA has been exposed by the Auditor-General as a shambles. The Auditor-General has shown the Child Support Agency to be poorly run and ineffective. According to the Commonwealth Auditor General, the Ombudsman receives more complaints about the CSA than any other government agency. The report has found that it can take up to four, five or even six months for clients to get their initial payments instead of the CSA's initial target of eight weeks. department's When people try to complain, the Auditor- administration General says that the CSA often fails to George answer clients' letters,and points to a study changes. that suggests that at one CSA branch only percent of the calls made to it even made to the telephone queue.· The report says that management of debt is unsatisfactory the tracing of child support default is ad hoc, inconsistent and often ineffective. While this is going on, the Auditor-General claims that the equivalent of two per cent of the CSA's employees· spend all their time in staff meetings, called 'time-out meetings', a question about which I put to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) on 9 June. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would probably remember, I received a most unsatisfactory response to that question. What makes the situation even more scaridalous is that most of these problems have already been identified in a 1991 report and little has been done to improve the situation. People tryitlg to bring .up their children rely on the· CSA for vital income assistance, but it obviously is not being delivered. More importantly, I would also like to comment on the deterioration in the relationship between the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), the Assistant Treasurer and the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee for Certain Family Law Issues, the honourable  that the member for Chifley has been able to attend this debate in the House. Minister Baldwin and Minister Gear· have found themselves in a position where they are constantly defending the operations of the Child Support Agency. The chairman of the joint standing committee has pointed out over a long period, since January this year, some of the fundamental problems that are associated with the scheme. Yet the ministers are seeking to defend the scheme because of the advice they have been given by their departments and because of the bureaucratic bungling that caused the problems in the first place. On 8 March 1994 an article. in the Bulletin refers to the Minister for Spcial Security and the Assistant Treasurer: . .. Baldwin is· thought to be sympathetic to his stand. The minister responsible for the of the scheme, Assistant Treasurer Gear, is also said to be reluctant to consider 10 This is in marked contrast to the comments it made by the chairman of the joint standing committee, the member for Chifley, who says and that in the same article: ""The response to the hotline has laid to rest the myth that it is merely a well-organised minority of disgruntled non-custodial parents who are dissatisfied with either the scheme, the agency, or both."" The battle between the ministers and the chairman is obviously going· to start having some effect on the operations of the CSA. The morale of the CSA staff will suffer because they· are taking directions from the Assistant Treasurer and they are defending themselves to the Minister for Social Security. The chairman of the committee,which today is to have the CSA report by the Auditor General referred to it, is still highlighting problems that the CSA is experiencing even though the Assistant Treasurer has been trying to implement changes to improve the CSA. So we have on the one hand a minister who probably genuinely is trying to improve the situation and, on the other, a chairman of an important and powerful committee who seems to be cutting across the work of the Assistant Treasurer. It has even been suggested, and I am sure it is not the case, that the member for Chifley was prepared to run the risk of breaching privilege by leaking information to journalists . . associated with the Herald-Sun and the Daily Telegraph Mirror. I understand that the committee resolved that matter yesterday and it has been put to rest. But I think it is interesting that these allegations have been made and that what could be a very serious problem for the government seems to exist. Admittedly the Assistant Treasurer, who is responsible for this area, wants to do something-belatedly. He has been responsible for this area for some time and he has taken too long to start implementing changes. But it also appears that the member for Chifley wants to run the agenda of the Child Support Agency through the joint standing committee: Accusations are already flying that some committee members who want change are motivated by self-interest. Committee sources concede that they are going to have a political fight on their hands they advocate change to the formula attached to maintenance payments. ""The report will cause it real political stir,"" says one source. These things are damaging not only to the government but also to good administration of government for the people involved-the parents, both custodial and non-custodial, and the children. It would appear that this has been a long term campaign by the member for Chifley. tion Back in early January 1994 stories were appear appearing undermining the Assistant Treasurer apply over that entire six-month period. In April the Assistant Treasurer attempted changes to the CSA which would improve situation. In his press release announcing these changes, he said: I have been concerned to address some of the criticism directed at the operations of the Child Support Agency. The Registrar, Michael Carmody, has been equally concerned that the CSA respond more effectively to parents' problems. Over the past twelve months, we have been workpositively. ing together to see what can be done to improve client service. Obviously this does not involve the member for Chifley, who is clearly feeling quite aggrieved. Some of the aspects of what he said in a speech he gave in March this year were picked up in April by the Assistant Treasurer, but many are yet to be picked up. In that speech the honourable member for Chifley criticises the ag-ncy and implies that the problems have been ignored by the Assistant Treasurer. He said: ... the Agency is seen as being unhelpful, remote and unable to operate in an efficient, timely and uniform way. Well how do we change all that, certainly not by ignoring it. He criticises the computer operations of the CSA: Whilst talking about communications I should mention the Agency's notorious computer system. It 'appears as though the system's analysts, instead of ascertaining what was required from line managers, busily developed the system to suit themselves. He criticises agency enforcement: I would like to say a few things about enforcement. The Agency's performance has been abysmal. All this has occurred while it has been under if the control of the Assistant Treasurer. One might wonder whether the member for Chifley is trying to take the Assistant Treasurer's job or at least be seen to be controlling the agenda of the CSA. But he does not finish there, he goes on and criticises the CSA's link with the ATO,_ a fundamental aspect of the scheme-the only CSA in the world that is attached to a taxation office. The member for Chifley said: I am not satisfied that when requests for informaor action are passed onto the ATO that they to give it any special priority, but rather their own priorities thus negating some of the so called special benefits of the linkage of the to make some Agency with Taxation. the One wonders where all this will end. In speaking to this motion I hope, for the good of the children who have been the beneficiaries of this new fOTlT! of dealing with maintenance, and for the parents-both custodial and non;-custodial, who have had to grapple with severe administrative and burea.ucratic problems created by the CSA-that it will end . I wanted to comment on the concern that I have, and that I am sure the opposition has, with the deteriorating relationship between the ministers responsible and the chairman of the joint standing committee. The problems of the ALP and its factional brawls are all very well; they occur in politics. But when they spill over into the good government of this nation and start to affect individuals so disastrously, it is time for the opposition to comment and to bring them to public attention. I thank the House for the opportunity to do so this afternoon. MrPRICE (Chifley) (5.17 p.m.)-I hope all members will support the motion to refer this matter to the Joint Standing Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. I thank the  has just spoken, for extending the courtesy of advising me that he was speaking on the matter. A number of assertions have been made. I, along with many opposition and other government members, accept that quite a few members of the House have had some real concerns about the operation of the Child Support Agency. I am happy to include the honourable member for Sturt in that category. In order to respond, I need to be very At the beginning of this inquiry there was a consistent viewpoint that we recognise - the huge successes of the agency: with the establishment of the agency we have significantly improved the lot of women and their children and the amount of child support that has been provided. Further, as the honourable member for Sturt says, complaints about the agency could be sheeted home to a disgruntled minority of non-custodial parents. I suppose it is true to say that I felt that there was, in a way, going to be a battlefield of ideas associated with this inquiry. I am very pleased that the report Thanks for listening, a report about the hotline that the committee had instituted, gave the lie to the myth that only a small minority of non-custodial parents had concerns about the operations of the Child Support Agency. In fact, honourable members might be interested to learn that just under 50 per cent of the - submissions came from custodial parents and just over 50 per cent from non-custodial parents. I have always hammered the line that this needs to be a balanced inquiry which is concerned about custodial and non-custodial parents. The Bulletin article was mentioned-I had thought of getting up and making a personal explanation at the time but I now feel I need to respond to the claim that committee members have been motivated by self-interest. I can sincerely state to the House that each and every member of my committee has adopted, I believe, a fair approach, a genuine approach, motivated at strengthening the scheme rather than undermining it. I have not been able to detect self-interest as a key factor-or any factor, for that matter. Like the rest of the community, the committee members and the secretariat represent all the various stages of family relationships: recently married, married, separated, et cetera. I think it is appropriate that you have that on a committee. It would be impossible not to have that mix. But the accusation that there is somehow malice or improper motive in the deliberations of the committee or the commit.;. t- members is a completely false charge. I made two speeches at the invitation of the Child Support Agency to Child Support frank. Agency personnel-firstly, to all the key people involved in the agency and, secondly, to review officers. I need to say this about the Child Support Agency: irrespective of what the situation may have been at the beginning of this inquiry, the agency is not one that is resisting change; Indeed, it has undertaken quite a bit of change already. I can only speak in the highest and most complimentary manner about my relationships with the registrar, Michael Carmody, with Moira Scollay, the assistant commissioner, and with other members of the agency. The real issue is not whether we should have change, because the agency has already implemented change, but the degree of change. The agency is the first to acknowledge that it is looking forward to the committee's recommendations about how far that change needs to go. The honourable member mentions a number of other things. The computer: the computer was notorious, and a major program of redevelopment has at least been identified, if not already under way. On enforcement, it is true that the Australian scheme is the only scheme that links to the. Taxation Office-. That may be why we have a higher collection rate. No-one could be satisfied that we are collecting only 70 per cent. No-one could be satisfied that there was a lack of guidelines. Noone could be content that staff were denuded from enforcement or that the agencry failed to exercise powers. Of course I have been critical of it, and I will continue to be critical of it. In the deliberations of the committee, we examined whether we should maintain the link with the ATO. The ATO was supposed to confer considerable benefits, particularly from the enforcement angle. I feel that those benefits have failed to be delivered in full measure. Probably the most serious matter raised this mix evening is the question of my allegedly running an agenda and my relationships with the ministers. I have spoken on a number of occasions with George Gear and Peter Baldwin. I would describe my relationship with them as very good. Rather than resisting change, George Gear has brought down what I would refer to as a first instalment of change. I congratulate him for it. Some members of the media wanted to run the line: Wasn't I upset? Wasn't this pre-empting the committee? No. It is great that we have a minister in charge of the Child Support Agency who recognises the need for reform, as does the agency. It has made my job and the job of my cGmmittee so much easier. So I would deny there is a rift. I have had a riumberof discussions with Peter Baldwin. I do 'riot' d-ny that at the end of the day part of the responsibilities of the committee and ofh.onourable members. of this House will be to form a view as to whether , they think the recommendations. are worthwhile- They must also ensure that those recommendations that they believe to be worthwhile are implemented. I say to honourable members that we should not be complacent about that task. I certainly have the ambition that this committee's report should not gather dust. The government would be inclined to accept the overwhelming' majority of the recommendations. If that is not the case, then we have failed. But I am under no illusions that there will be a very healthy-1 hope-and constructive debate in this place and outside about the. value of those recommendations. Sure, with a committee inquiry that has ceived over 6,000 submissions, the largest number received by any parliamentary committee, with a committee that conducted a hotline over two days on which there were 150,000 callers, there is going to be a great deal of interest in the work of the committee, particularly its recommendations., I have not failed, I hope, at any opportunity'to inform those people taking such a grave interest of the progress of the committee. It is no secret that I wanted to issue a discussion paper so that the general public and those organisations that take a great deal of interest in the committee would be able to see the direction in which the committee is heading. The committee in its wisdom felt that it was important to I?ush on with the report: I agree. We need to push on with the report. I am hopeful that I will be able to table that report in August. Then the real debate will go on.  genuine interest in the Child Support Agency and the changes that need to be made, but I rebut· the proposition that there is some dreadful conspiracy or deterioration in relationsbetween the minister in charge of the Child Support Agency, George Gear, and Peter. Baldwin in social security. . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)-The honourable member might refer to honourable members by their proper titles.  Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security. I certainly refute the charge that I am somehow undermining the Assistant Treasurer. The Assistant Treasurer, as did the registrar, spoke at that same conference that was quoted. I have subsequently had feedback from the Child Support Agency that my remarks were very welcome. I think the 13/4 hours I stood and answered questions' was also welcome. There is no conspiracy, but we all have a responsibility - particularly the'committee-to ensure that the Child Support Agency continues in the revolutionary and radical new area it set when it was established. We all have a responsibility to ensure that the agency is strengthened and that its administration, rather than being very bad, which it is in my view, beco..mes the very best in the spectrum re- of the Commonwealth. That is an objective I would like to see adopted; I certainly believe it is possible. Blit honourable members are going to have to be just a little more patient until the report is tabled. Then, I think, we can get stuck into a very healthy debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Motion (by Mr Johns, fOJ: Mr Beazley) agreed to: (1) That the House of Representatives authorises the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to meet concurrently with the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for the purposes of examining and taking evidence from witnesses in connection with its inquiry into section 53 of the Constitution. (2) That meetings held, in accordance with this res«?lution be jointly chaired by the Chairmen of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committees of each House. (3) That for the purposes of the. hearing of evidence at meetings held in accordance with this resolution, the procedures adopted by the Senate by its Privilege Resolution. 1 of 25 February 1988 be followed to. the extent that they are applicable. (4) That the foregoing provisions of this resolution, sO far as they are inconsistent. with the standing and sessional or-erS, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing and sessional orders.

184,Mr JOHNS,STANDING ORDERS,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the. Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (5.30 p.m.)-On behalf of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), I move: That the House authorises the Speaker to have prepared' for presentation to the House a revision of the standing orders: (a) incorporating references to Members in gender-inclusive pronouns; and (b) omitting the term ""chairman"" in relation to parliamentary committees and substituting !'chair"". Honourable members may recall that the Standing Committee on ProcedQre recommended in 1986 that the standing orders be amended, where necessary, to remove pronouns importing one gender when referring to members. The government responded positively. Subsequently, sessional orders and amendments to the standing orders have been drafted in gender inclusive terms, most recently to implement decisions following the procedure committee's About time report. The honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin), the chair of the caucus status of women committee, wrote to the Speaker concerning the resultant inconsistency between some recently amended standing orders and other standing orders which could be confusing and lead to the anomalous interpre,. .. tation that certain standing orders are seen to - pply only to men. This consequence was neither intended nor foreseen. The Speaker subsequently wrote to party leaders and independent members seel\jng agreement to effect gender inclusive pronouns when referring to members and seeking an expression of opinion about the term to describe the chair of a parliamentary committee. The. motion I have just moved is the next step in that process. Rather than specify.all the individual changes involving pronouns, the motion authorises the Speaker to have prepared a revision of the standing orders for presentation to the House. The revision will also provide for those chairing parliamentary committees to be described as 'chair'. It is envisaged that the revision will be presented to the House shortly after its resumption in August: It will then be open for the House to adopt, possibly with variations, the proposed revision. I understand that, in relation to committee chairs, the Housewill also be asked to adopt a resolution allowing individual committees to decide to refer to the chair variously as 'chairman', 'chairwoman', 'chairperson' or 'chair'. I commend . . the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Working Nation Debate resumed.",108
185,Mr TRUSS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I take up this long, seemingly never-ending debate on the government's Working Nation statement not because there is great enthusiasm by the government to suddenly start implementing policies which will get our country back to work but because it wants to occupy·time in this House until legislation' comes from the Senate. That is hardly an appropriate motivation for an extended debate, although it does give us an all too rare opportunity to canvass issues that are very important for otir country. I do not think any Australians anywhere are not at the present time. caught up in the disaster of unemployment. Unemployment has touched every family and community. The enonnous loss to our national economy and our society as a result of having so many people unemployed or under-occupied is really a national tragedy. ,"" This working Australia statement, along with the federal budget"" brings to 26 the number of major economic statements that the Labor government has introduced since coming to office. Each one of these ,magic pudding solutions was introduced with a great deal 'of ambitious and flamboyant rhetoric; But. in each instance, they have proved to be of little substance. We are told that this one will introduce a new era of prosperity and wipe away all our past problems. I have heard it all 25 times before from this government. No-one really believes ,that it will be any more successful this time than on any previous occasion. This working Australia document is a $6.4 billion spending spree and another attempt to buy jobs. It is alanning that the federal government has run up debts of approximately $96 billion while trying to buy jobs for Australians over recent times. If that kind of deficit funding has been unable to lift our economy and get it moving successfully ahead, one wonders what will really happen to our nation when we start to have, balanced budgets and when future generations have to start paying back some of this debt that has , been built up by these' desperate attempts to create artificial job schemes and to implement programs, such as the working Australia document. ' Labor has now invented 45 separate labour programs, all of which, we have been told, were to be the solution to our nation's difficulties. We have had programs such as jobtrain, jobsearch, jobstart, newstart, skillshaie, ,ski11scope, CEP"" SEVS"" CEOP, NIES, LEAP, REEP, the job compact, CElS, Nettforce and JET. The list just keeps going. We were ,told that each of these schemes would provide the answer to our difficulties. I cannot help getting, the feeling that all schemes are' really designed to keep the unemployed amused in the hope that some improvement in the world economy and in other parts of the world will sweep over the economic mismanagement of this country and help get our country moving profitably forward again. All the grandiose rhetoric and the flamboyant claims have proved to be utterly empty. No-one really believes that this program will be any better than those of the past. 'There have been some improving unemployment figures over recent times. I welcome them. Surely there ought to be, considering the context of the current deficit budgeting and the stimulus that the government is providing artificially to the national' economy. But, in a sense, unemployed figures will never be meaningful again. The figures are artificial these days because they are being manipulated to give a false impression about improving u-employment rates. We have many artificial job schemes. The people who are on these schemes are no longer counted in the official unemployment list. Those on training programs are not counted as being unemployed. The people who are being progressively moved, into the mature age allowance, in the premature retirement scheme for the unemployed, and those on disability pensions are not counted as being unemployed. The number of people on disability pensions has increased tenfold over the nlst 20 years. Aboriginals working on the COEP program are not counted as being unemployed, nor are all those who have just given up trying ""and not bothered to seek work because they know that it is a hopeless task. Anyone who has worked for one hour during the previous week is counted as being employed. If all those people are excluded from the unemployment statistics, it is perhaps not surprising that some of the numbers are looking a ,little better. As our population grows-an honourable member referred to this earlier in the debatenaturally more' work will be created and more positions will be required to service the increased population. There is a much larger welfare industry these days as we care for people in need. But those sorts of jobs are these created naturally through population growth, not as ,a result of any initiatives of this government. Sadly, there is nothing I can say to the unemployed 11.8 per cent of the population of Wide Bay about this program which indicates a light at the end of the tunnel. What hope is there for those people in Working Nation? They do not want more training schemes - or early retirement programs; they want real, - productive jobs. They have - great talents. Tl)ey have put a lot of effort into education and training programs over the years. They want to give back something to the economy for all that effort. They want to get some rewards for what they have done in the past. This program, the centrepiece, is just more of the same-more artificial job creation schemes, more time-occupying do not come to grips with the real nature of structural unemployment and the present difficulties in our economy. The government has built its budget strategy around a 141/2 cent growth in business investment. There has been some improved profitability for business recently. There would want to be after the disastrous years - we have gone through. increase in profitability will be natural and to be expected. We may even have the 141/2 per cent growth in business' investment the government is telling us we are going to have - What reason is there for those who have a The real problem for Australia in the is: where will this business investment take place? Will business put its investment capital into Australia any longer or will it look more attractive options in other parts of the globe? Will big Australian companies build new factories in Australia or will they build them in Asia or some of the other places where there are enormous tax benefits, cheapguarantee er labour, productive work forces and an relations opportunity to produce goods at a much lower price than we are able to do in Australia? I was deeply impressed by a briefing from and succeed. Mount Isa Mines representatives this week. They spoke of the fact that their exploration is moving more and more offshore. to Australia's big mining companies have lost confidence in their capacity to ever develop anything they might find in this country, they are choosing to go to places like Chile, Argentina, China and even Ireland. They see those sorts of countries as offering a more likely opportunity to return investors' capital than Australia. When Mount Isa Mines and other mining companies consider where they are going to invest any profitability they have in new ventures, they look more and more to overseas countries. In the past, foreign investment has been something of an issue in Australia-the fact that Japanese and other entrepreneurs are investing in this nation. In the future where Australian capital is invested will become a significant issue for Australians. There will be rising concern that Australian industry' is choosing to invest in other parts of the world because they offer a more attractive investprograms that ment environment. If the government were serious about having a working Australia, about having a more productive country providing real and per meaningful positions in the workplace, it would be addressing the unattractive investment environment Australia has become. The only thing the government had to encourage An investment in Australia was the investment is allowance. That will be axed as of tomorrow. What incentive is there for Australians to that invest in this country? bit of newfound profitability to reinvest in future providing jobs in this country when the government's reward to those people is higher taxes, amazing bureaucracy, incredible to oncosts and a whole range - of measures that make investment in this country difficult and unattractive? It was difficult for the mining companies before we had Mabo and the like. It was difficult before we had superannuation levies and comprehensive industrial laws that make it difficult for people to terminate unsatisfactory employees. It has always been tough enough to run a business Business is looking for encouragement, not penalties for investment. It wants to be made believe that it is welcome in this country and that its endeavours will be rewarded and appreciated. There is no sign of that kind of so philosophy in the Working Nation statement. It is more about government intervention again, artificial schemes to try to amuse the unemployed in the hope that they will forget about the appalling performance of this government in job creation over the years. . The Working Nation statement was supposed to be the government's response in the area of regional development. What a disappointment! There is so little in it to encourage those in regional areas, who were led to believe that the government had found some new interest in the disadvantages that rural and regional areas have been suffering for so long. I would have thought that a government that professed some interest in social justice issues would be alarmed that the 20 poorest federal electorates in Australia are all in and regional areas, while the richest ones are all in the capital cities. No government that has any interest at all, even a passing interest, in social justice could turn a blind eye to the massive areas of poverty in rural and regional Australia. What is the· government's response to the needs of those areas? It has provided $10 million for capital programs this year and another $20 million in the subsequent three years. So $10 million is to go to regional areas but $200 million is provided in the spending programs to continue the better cities fantasies. The cities are worth $200 million and the rest of Australia has to share $10 million. What a pitiful response to the Kelty report, which was commissioned by the government. The mates of the government were all involved in the preparation of that report. They produced a colourful document and billions and billions of dollars worth of programs were recommended. The government welcomed that report. But what has the government's response been? The billions and billions of dollars of programs proposed for rural and regional Australia have to compete for a mere $10 million. When we look at the other commitments to regional development in the latest budget, we see .that $71 million will be spent on urban and regional development projects, but $25 million of that will be spent in Canberra. So the government's definition of regional development is more sewerage, more projects for Canberra and the rest of the country can live on the leftovers. Any government that is at all serious about regional development would be addressing fundamental issues that create disadvantage for the rural and regional sector. It is not good enough to just set up a fourth tier of government, a new regional bureaucracy that I understand the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) is going to announce in a couple of weeks. No attention was paid to his regional statement, so he will re-announce all the same measures in a couple of weeks. But there is still no real commitment to regional areas. Appointing a few extra bureaucrats will not do it.· A few more regional officers do notcreate interest and address the rural imbalance currently evident in regional policies. The government should firstly do something about fuel tax, the appalling extra tax that is applied to everybody who lives or does business outside the capital city areas. No government is serious about regional development while it taxes people with a penalty taxation just because they live far away from· the capitals. (Time expired)  like to respond to some of the issues raised by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and make a few remarks concerning the Working Nation statement. I represent an urban seat. I have said in this House on a number of occasions that I want to acknowledge the disadvantage that is often suffered in rural and provincial Australia. I am disappointed that the members of the National Party, who often represent these areas and who are aware of the disadvantage of living in those areas, can never acknowledge in return the real disadvantage of living in some urban electorates. The issue for the House is that where there is disadvantage, whether it is in rural and regional Australia or even urban Australia, we ought to tackle it. I say to the House that I will always have a great interest in trying to overcome those disadvantages. We gather force if we combine rather than separate. Working Nation has been accused of not providing real jobs and of representing make work schemes. I have to confess to the House that I have always been appreciative of the role that the RED scheme and CEPs played . in so many cpmmunities throughout Australia. the I know they have been much criticised"" but the criticism always fails to acknowledge the lasting benefit of so many facilities that were provided under those schemes, not the least benefit of which was providing unemployed peOple with an opportunity for work. There is nothing in Working Nation that can in any way be compared to - .RED courses. scheme or a CEP.. I think· what opposition members have yet to adequately COme to grips with is that we are seeing a new phenomenon in terms of the long-term unemployed, cerexperience, tainly in the last recession in the 1980s and with this recession. In previous recessions it was the case that, after people had. been put off, when the economy picked up those same people were able to find a job. The distinctive quality that we are finding here in Australia, and, I might add, throughout the world, is that the longant term unemployed are being left behind. Notwithstanding the rapid growth rates hiscriminal torically that Australia enjoyed in the 1980s, only one in seven of the long-term unemjn ployed was picked up in employment. It had nothing whatsoever to do with their motivado tion or what type of person they were. It everything to do with the fact that they long-term unemployed. If members of the opposition say that maybe Working Nation is not. a perfect document or that we have been as yet unable to fully implement a total range of policies that picks up and deals with this phenomena, then probably they are right. But I would like to see a concession that Working Nation has been a very serious and very fulsome attempt to take note of it and deal with it. We on this side of the House are very proud of it. The acid test for us in the Labor Party is how we deal with the weakest in the community. I have said before that as a Labor member I am somewhat saddened that in a sense the goal in terms of unemployment is only to get it down to five per cent by the year 2000. Some might say that if we set more ambitious target then we would be aspiration creating unreal expectations, and perhaps could accept it. But I am disappointed bepeople cause, again, even if everything works for in my view we will still have a greater overhappen· hang of people who are long-term unembeginning. ployed. If any party is going to stand up for them, it is the Australian Labor Party. I find the .criticisms of so much training difficult to accept. I can certainly share any statement which decries the fact that some people have gone through too· many training I agree, but Working Nation seeks to rectify it. It seeks to create a job compact so that at the end· of that training there will be a job where the person can gain real work real job experience, and hopefully completely satisfy the requirements of entering the labour market permanently and without disruption. I am very pleased that in my electorate we .are trying to deal with those who are not suitable for the job compact, ski11share or any of the other programs. I think it is so importthat we really do try to pick up those people who may have had problems with the justice system, who may be illiterate, who may have a health problem or who may fact be homeless-that as a society, as a community, we do. not discard them and we not put them in the too-hard basket. I had remain optimistic that very shortly we will were have an innovative CAP for them. I have exceptionally high expectations of it and I am very excited by it. I turn to the matter of the investment climate, raised by the honourable member for Wide Bay. I think it is true that all members of parliament should seek to create the very best investment climate, not only for foreign or overseas investors but also for our own established businesses. He cited three issues as an example of what he saw as the difficulties. He cited Mabo as one. I say to him that Mabo might not always be the most popular issue in my electorate, but I am pleased to see that as a parliament we are actually trying to do something of a longer term nature about the whole period after European settlement. I hope every member-I can certainly speak a for those on this side of the House-has the that not only the traditional AboI riginal people but also urban Aboriginal will take their rightful place in society us, as a result of these measures. It will not instantly, but. I think it is a serious So many good ideas in the past have failed, but this really does try to tackle the issue in a holistic way. I notice that the Prime Minister(Mr Keating) tabled the land fund legislation today and that is great to The honourable member for Wide Bay also talked about superannuation. I think it is a difficult problem for business in terms of the on-cost of superannuation and award superannuation, but we keep on reminding honourable members opposite that this was provided by the government in lieu·of wage increases that they would have otherwise been· entitled to. I think one of the areas opposition members should perhaps get some credit for is in relation to· raising. the issue of national ings, which the government actually responded to. So where do they want to see that money? Would they prefer to have seen that money in the hands of workers or would they rather see it going towards national savings? That is where it is going. What is wrong with ordinary Australians having access to superannuation? When I came into this place, superannuation for women was just a joke. Ordinary workers on the shop floor knew that superannuation was something everyone else got and they did not. Sure, I was a public servant and any public servant will always have access to superannuation-the chief executives and the executives of private companies had access to superannuation-but everyone else did not. So what is wrong with the proposition? In terms of providing the best investment climate are we going to say to the majority of Australians, at least half of whom are women, 'Look, to create a better investment climate, you are going to have to forgo your just entitlements to superannuation?' I think that is wrong. The government is already committed, as suggestedin the FitzGerald report, to increasing the employee contribution. The old chestnut of industrial relations was raised. I guess there are always going to be areas in which government and opposition members just cannot understand each other's points of view. But I fail to see what is wrong with ordinary men and women'in an organisation organising to discuss their conditions. So much has changed on the fa,.ctory floor. I remember going through a paper production factory in Tasmania and one of the workers saying to me, 'Before all these changes, what. see. I was expected to do when I walked in was to clock in and leave my brains behind.' These days-with credit to management, credit to unions and credit to the changed environment-firms are recognising that damn good ideas come from the workplace. The more we recognise that and the more we involve the workers, the better productivity we are going to have and the better harmony there will be.",108

188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,"I understand that it is the wish of the House to consider the amendments together. There being no objection, I will allow that course of action.",147
189,Mrs CROSIO,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (7.01 p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. Since the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 was considered by this House, the Senate agreed to a number of government amendments to the bill. The first package of amendments will give effect from 4 July 1994 to a measure announced in the government's white paper on industry and employment to strengthen obligations placed a on the unemployed to accept job or undertake reasonable activities t- improve their job prospects. . With the introduction of the job compact and other substantial additional government assistance that will be made available to the unemployed, and that will intensify as the length· of unemployment increases, it is more appropriate to base deferment periods due to activity test breaches on the length of unemployment .as well as the number of previous breaches. Under the new approach to deferment periods, it distinction is drawn between activity test breaches and administrative breaches. Although the penalties attached to administrative breaches will largely remain unaltered, .a new non-payment period structure will apply to activity test breaches, based on both the number of previous breaches and the duration of unemployment. For clients who have been unemployed for less than 12 months,the penalty for the first activity test breach will be two weeks. Subsequent activity test breaches will attract an additional period of six weeks deferment for each further breach. For clients who have been unemployed for between 12 and 18 months, the penalty for the first activity breach will be four weeks. Subsequentactivity test breaches will attract an additional period of six weeks deferment for each further breach. For clients who have been unemployed for longer than 18 months, the penalty for the first activity test breach will be six weeks. Subsequent activity test breaches will attract an additional period of six weeks deferment for each further breach. If a person has committed both activity test and administrative breaches within a three year period, the deferment period applicable to that person will be the sum of activity and administrative non-payment periods. The Senate agreed to amendments moved by the Australian Democrats to provide that the deferment period for activity test and adminisstanding trativebreaches cannot start b-fore a person has been notified that a deferment period applies and the person has received two instalments of jobsearch allowance or newstart allowance after that notification. The second package of amendments relates to tax file numbers and the assets test treatment of allocated pensions and annuities. The bill as introduced provided for amendments to be made to the tax file number provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 so as to overcome the decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Re Malloch and Secretary, Department of Social Security. The tribunal had held that the principal act does not prevent payment to a person who does not provide a tax file number to the department because he or she has no tax file number and has no intention of getting one. Subsequently, the Privacy Commissioner indicated concern that the amendments relating to tax file numbers, including the tax file number provisions relating to disability wage supplement, did not take account of the voluntary quotation principle that is an integral part of the tax file number scheme. The Privacy Commissioner agreed that the proposed amendments put forward put beyond doubt that receiving a social security payment is conditional on satisfying the tax file number requirement, but requested that it be made clear that the deCision as to whether or not an individual applies for a tax file number, in test full knowledge of the consequences, rests with the individual. Further amendments address the Privacy Commissioner's concerns. Immediately following the government's security and retirement statement on superannuation in June 1992, the then Minister for Social Security announced changes to the treatment of allocated pensions and allocated annuities under the social security income and assets test. Amendments to give effect to those changes were enacted by the parliament in division 19 of the Social Security Legislatest tion Amendment Act (No.3) 1992 but have not commenced, as their implementation was deferred until the later date of 1 October 1993 or the date of report to the Senate by a Senate or select committee on the application of division 19. To date, no report has been made to the Senate. The amendments proposed by the government to the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No.3) 1992 provided from 1 July 1994 for the repeal of the amendments made by division 19 and its commencement provision, and the account balance of allocated pensions and allocated annuities to be subject to the assets test. The effect of the government's amendments would be that there would be no change to the current income test treatment of allocated pensions and allocated annuities. The only changes are to be the treatment of allocated pensions and allocated aplluities under the assets test. However, nongovernment amendments made in the Senate. would impose a savings provision so that the assets test would be imposed only for those allocated pensions and allocated annuities purchased on or after 1 July 1992. The government remains of the view that the savings provision will introduce additional complexity and confusion for many social security clients, yet actua:Ily benefit only several hundred. It runs counter to an objective of the social security income and assets test review that is currently under way; namely, the promotion of greater simplicity in this area of social security law and administration.Nevertheless, in the interest of ing the passage of the bill, and so enabling the early implementation of important new initiatives such as the disability wage suppledisability ment, the government has decided not to pursue its objection to a savings provision. The third package of amendments relates, to net rental property losses, otherwise known as negative gearing. Currently, the income test for family payment and the parental income test for jobsearch allowance and sickness allowance is based on taxable income, as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. If a person has· rental property, the tax act allows the person to deduct certain expenses from the income gained from the property. Any resulting income losses can be offset against other income of the person, with the person paying tax on the net figuretaxable income. This process is known as negative gearing. Since the net taxable income figure is also used in income testing for family payment and jobsearch allowance and sickness allowance, a person also gets the benefit of negative gearing for social security purposes. As announced in the 1993 budget, the income test for family payment and .. the parental income test for under age jobsearch allowance and sickness allowance is to be amended from 1 January 1995 so that these deductions will be included as income. Accordingly, income testing arrangements will be more equitable and improve targeting of these payments. This' measure follows the decision in the 1992 budget to add back to taxable income the value of certain employer-provided fringe benefits for the purposes of applying the income test for these same payments. I repeat: this measure follows the decision In the 1992 budget to add back to taxable income the value .. of certain employer-provided fringe benefits for the. purposes of applying the income test for these same payments. Similar amendm-nts are also proposed for Austudy; The Senate also agreed to an amendment by the Australian Democrats relating to the disability wage supplement. This amendment, which was supported by the government, allows persons transferring from disability wage supplement to qualify for disability ensursupport pension immediately, without the need for a medical examination; jf they lodge their claim within 28 days of last being paid wage supplement. The amendment also ensures that only eligible people continue to receive . disability support pension. So persons should easily be - ble to move between. the disability wage supplement and the disability support pension- The government always intended to administer the scheme in this way. It has no intentions of jeopardising people's entitlernentsto the supported wage scheme by putting unnecessary hurdles in their way. . The amendment also allows arrears of disability support pension·. to be paid if a person lodges a claim for disability support pension within 28 days of the date the person was last paid the disability wage supplement. This measure provides additional time for people to lodge claims when transferring from disability wage supplement to disability support pension. The government did not expect that the original arrangements, which allowed 14 days. for lodgement of claims, would disadvantage anyone.· We support the bill before the House.",147
190,Mr RUDDOCK,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,"I thank the Parli;imentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) for her written observations in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994. I was particularly interested to see in the drafting of her comments that so much credit was given to the Australian Democrats. One would almost have thought they were the only people who had a view on, and were largely setting the agenda for, social security matters. The only Democrat amendments that were likely to be successful were those supported by the opposition. The government has made much of its bill because on some matters the opposition supported the government. If my friends in the Australian Democrats were so imaginative and so creative, perhaps I would acquiesce to the comments made by the parliamentary secretary about their contribution. However, I suspect that if the government spent a little more time listening to some of the comments and taking them into its counsel beforehand, it may well have found that so many of the ideas that the Australian Democrats brought forward emanated from those good folk in the Welfare Rights Centre. This piece of legislation. is quite complex, and it is interesting to look at the way in which it deals with such a wide range of matters. The Social Security Legislation Ame-dment Bill (No.2) is the subject of a large number of ameridments generated by the government. Ordinarily, I would say those amendments were of such substance and character as to warrant a bill, or perhaps a number of bills, to enable a proper examination and consideration of them. I think the government ought to be on notice that these matters are able to be dealt with and many of the timetabling requirements accommodated only through the cooperation of the opposition. Many problems would not have arisen if these matters had been dealt with in a more efficient way by the government and its advisers and if they had allowed the House to contribute, if they had allowed the ideas that emanate in this HoUse to be responded to, and if they had allowed sufficient time for those outside to comment. The reason comments of a substantial character emanate from the Senate is that the time that elapses enables those who want to make detailed observations to do so before the committees of the Senate to which these matters are referred. I will not go through each of the government amendments that we have accepted. I will not dignify the government's approach to raising the pension age for. women with too much comment, save .to say that I think the only ones that have not been hypoCritical on this issue have been the coalition parties. We have taken a consistent approach to this matter.. We supported the government when it criticised the approach adv()cated by the opposition. All of the comments made by the former social security minister, Dr Blewett, are on the record. They were quite harsh in the way in which they were expressed. So, in that sense, the only consistent approach to take when dealing with retirement is to have a consistent pension age for men and women, with the flexibility that allows people to continue past the pension age if they wish. I for one hope that the time will come when the government will look at other proposals advanced by the opposition, because they are very creative and constructive. It is a· good pool to examine. One such initiative would enable people to postpone taking a pension at pension age and to receive a larger entitlement when they later draw it down. I think that initiative is well worth adopting. Maybe the time will come when it is adopted.",149
191,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,How are you going to pay for it?,150
192,Mr RUDDOCK,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,",-I do not believe that it generates costs. We examined this matter and found that it would produce savings for the government for the time that people postpone. When we fix the additional emolument paid when people eventually draw down so that it reflects only the amount of income forgone, the savings are more likely to be generated by issues of nature. People who postpone taking a pension may never have the opportunity to draw it down later in life.",150
193,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,"Ha, hal",150
194,Mr RUDDOCK,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,You asked me how the savings would be generated.,150
195,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,Are you proposing to trick people?,150
196,Mr RUDDOCK,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,"I would not suggest that it is a trick at all. People would look at these matters actuarially and make their own judgmeQt as to whether they, wanted to retire at a particular age or otherwise. Dr Kemp-It is freedom of choice.",151
197,Mr RUDDOCK,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,"Yes, freedom of choice is what we press. We foreshadowed that the Privacy Commissioner had some views on taX file number changes. At the time the government, gav- assurances in the House that that matter would be'dealt with. I am glad that it has done, so. We supported the government amendments in relation to this matter and opposed the Democrat amendments, which in that case did not get up. In relation to the obligations of job seekers and the implementation of the government's program, as set out in Working Nation, we have facilitated the passage of the legislation save one matter that we believed the welfare rights movement took up,' and which the Democrats moved, relating to the issue of giving people notice of any penalties as a result of a breach. Our concern was that at present people could find that their benefits were discontinued and be quite unaware that there had been a breach. They would then be left without sustenance or even a reasonable opportunity while they were still on benefits to put matters at issue. In <;>ur view, it is not unreasonable to require notice to be given and for the discontinuance to be postponed until that h;lS been effected. That is the reason in principle that we supported the amendment. We believed it was right, not because the Democrats were particularly' imaginative in relation to these issues. There were two other matters in which the Democrats were particularly active, which I wish to address. One of them related to a series of proposed amendments relating to the issue of assets testing eligibility' for family payments. The Democrats were proposing that people with no income who have a family property which might be of substantial value be relieved of the obligation to satisfy the assets test. The proposal has many implications, and some of them are financial. Our view is that the questions raised, which quite properly have been addressed by the opposition in our own policy, because this is a matter that we have consistently emphasised, ought to be the subject of further examination., It was for that reason that we would have liked the matter to have been dealt with by a committee of this House, but the minister was not willing to arrange for the matter to be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs. For that reason, it will be examined again in the Senate, and it was for that reasQn that we moved in the Senate today that certain matters be referred to the Standing CQmmittee on Rural and Regional Affairs for inquiry and report on or before 20 September. ThQse matters include the ,social and economic implications, of the assets test exemption amendment moved in the Committee of the Whole on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill {No. 2), and whether the Social Security Act should be amended to exempt the assets test for basic family payments, additional family payments, primary producers' .land and primary producers' production plant where a full-time primary 'producer has his or her principal home on that land and would-but for the assets testingbe entitled to such social security benefits. We take the view that that is not an unreasonable reference. It is one that should be undertaken because if relief can be given it ought t? be provided, but not without due inquiry. Finally, I want to come to the vexed question of allocated pensions and annuities. It is a matter on which I foreshadow the opposition will be moving an amendment to the government's amendments. That amendment will read: Tha:t all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""Senate amendments 1-15 and 17-82 be agreed to, and that Senate Amendment No. 16 be amended by omitting '1 July 1992' and substituting '1 July 1994""'. The purport of that amendment is very simple; it is to ensure, that ,the retrospective impact of the government's measure on those who have already taken out allocated pensions and annuities be removed. It means that all those people after tomorrow who take out a]]ocated. pensions will be subjected to this test, and those who take them out beforehand will be exempted from it. It is interesting that this w- the exact approach that the government itself took in relation to shares owned by pensioners who were affected by the provisions relating to unrealised capital. gains being treated as income. for the purpose of the income test. As a matter of principle the government took the view-and there were very large amounts of money involved iii that case-that the measure ought to operate from the time in which it takes effect. The Democrats moved an amendment that this provision operate from J July 1992. That is not the date upon which this measure takes effect; it is the date upon which the government made an announcement that it was going to propose other changes that affected allocated pensions but did not-and I repeat, did not-deal with assets testing of allocated pensions and annuities. That was a new measure announced by the minister. If the parliamentary secretary had another view, she might take the view that it ought to operate from the very date upon which the minister made the announcement several weeks ago. But my view is that it ought to be from the time in which the measure will come into effect: 1 July 1994. The information that was provided by the government indicates that. very few people are affected. In other words, it is not going to have a substantial impact in terms of the way in which this measure would operate. The parliamentary secretary has already .complained about complexity and difficulty associated with the measure that the Democrats have moved. It seems that adopting a more principled approach would not create any greater difficulty nor subject the government to any particular penalty in financial terms if the information. provided by the government is, in fact, correct. The figures we have been given suggest that around SOO clients will have their pensions reduced or cancelled because of the proposal· to assets test the acco,unt .balance of the allocated pension-SOO was the number; the government suggested 300 and then found an extra 200. I suspect the number would be less, on the government's figures, if, in fact, those who took out the allocated pensions before July 1992 and who were going to be exempted by the Democrats ' measure, which the government is prepared to accept,·.were taken into account. I can see no reason why the government ought to, at this point, decline to support the amendment that I will move. We take the view that it is the only principled and consistent way to go, given the way in which the government has treated these matters in the past. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""Senate amendments 1-15 and 17-82 be agreed to, and that Senate Amendment No. ·16 be amended by omitting 'I July 1992' and substituting 'J July 1994""'. We are always anxious to facilitate the progress of the government and the House in relation to these. matters. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary would like to indicate the government's suppOrt and we can deal with the amendment tonight. (TIme expired) .",151
198,Mr SPEAKER,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,Is the amendment seconded? Dr Kemp-I second the amendment.,152
199,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,"---:I would like to take a few moments to make a contribution to this debate because I have not had an oppC!>rtunity to speak in the House on this matter since becoming the shadow minister for community services. First of all, an amendment has come back from the Senate relating to people who have gone off the supported work system and allowing them to still be eligible for the disability support pension. I understand the government is supporting that amendment, and I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Sodal Security (Mrs Crosio) for that support. Clearly, it has general support as it is. plain common sense .. It is essential to facilitate a smooth transition for people moving in and out. of the supported wages system. The coalition supported the disability wage supplement, and welcomes the supported wages system as a move towards increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities. It is a welcome development in the move towards payment of productivity based wages and is one which my colleagues and I will be watching very closely. I Understand· the new provisions will not be able to be implemented until after 20 July 1994, at which time the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission will be asked to approve the awards variation .. Applications have been·rnade·to vary nine awards in the test case which means there will be quite a few people, who would otherwise be eligible, who will' be outside these awards and who will' miss out at least· in the initial stages. This may come as a disappointment to some employers and to some people with disabilities who may wish to participate in the program immediately. I hope the government will waste no time in supporting a broadening of the approval process. I am pleased the government has included the public service award in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). I also hope that a suitable balance between public and private employers is achieved in allocating the thousand places .to help people with disabilities back into the work force. I understand the thousand places in the first year of operation are to be allocated ona 'first come, first served' basis. Obviously, those people who are covered by the first nine awards will have an advantage in taking up those places. There have' been some general concerns about how the supported wages system will actually be implemented, and I am hopeful the government will address these concerns quickly. Employer representatives have expressed to me a hope that the system will be .kept as simple as possible. They are looking for a commitment from the government that in participating in the scheme they will not be forced to follow yet another set of cumbersome rules and regulations. Ih"" addition, some reservations have been expressed about the method of assessment, the issues of superannuation and'workers compensation insurance, and the need to retain individual choice as the means by which people move onto the supported wages system. There is a great deal of concern amongst people working in sheltered workshops that they will be forced to move out of sheltered employment into open employment. These .' concerns are real and need to be put to rest. No-one should be compelled to be in a sheltered workshop but people should have the choice to stay there·ifthatistheir genuine choice. Like the employer groups, the peak disability' organisations have been constructive in·their approach and I'applaud their contribution to the development of this program. I wish to expreSs a personal concern. It would be a sad irony if the move towards providing greater employment opportunities for people with dIsabilities was undermined by the introduction of the government's training wage and its white paper job compact. Given the increase in the government's subsidised employment program and the move towards the introduction of a training wage, I hope the employment outlook for people with disabilities takes a step forward. I am optimistic that it will. Finally, I urge the government to closely monitor its. implementation of the supported wages'system and to be responsive to any difficulties that may arise. The supported wages system has been approached with a spirit of cooperation between employers, peak disability groups, unions and others. I am hopeful that it will provide increased employment opportunities for a group of individuals who have experienced a great deal of disadvantage in the work force.",152
200,Mrs CRQSIO,AND NEWSTART ALLOWANCE,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (7.31 p.m.)-There is not a lot that I would like to respond to in this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). lam aware of the time and the fact that members of parliament are very tired. However, I am sure they will stay with us while we go through this important bill. 1 say to the honourable member for Berowra· (Mr Ruddock) that I acknowledge that the bill as presented in the Senate and debated ad infinitum in that chamber could not have gone through without general support; we did have coalition support in a number of debates. The honourable member and all those opposite would acknowledge that the amendment that has been moved now was very capably put through in the Senate by Senator Patterson. I too listened to the debate that occurred at that time. I thought it was very c1early explained by us in the Senate-but I will do it in this House so that it is recorded by Hansard-. why we agreed to that amendment being applicable from 1 July 1992. As.. debate occurred in the Senate, we thought it would be realistic and reasonable to acknowledge the fact that notiCe was given c1early by a previ:... ous minister for social security when these announcements were made. I know that the member for Berowra disagrees with that but it was stated in the Senate and it has been reiterated since that these were the c1early announced steps the government proposed to take in the future. We believe that cutting off the date from today would be unfair to those who had already put their house in order and that they could be doubly penalised because of the steps we are now taking. That is why finally, if reluctantly, we accepted the amendment as so moved. When I spoke about the amendments I stated that this will caus- a certain amount of complexity. We believe the Department of Social Security will be able to explain the measure and inform those people who may have concerns about it in a fairer way than if we were to make it applicable from today. That is one reason the government, in the Senate, was very reluctant to agree to the amendment being applicable from 1 July 1992. We finally accepted the amendment and acknowledged that it was based on the fact as presented by the Democrats in the Senate that people were on notice. If people Were on notice then we believed that we must take it from there. We have c1early stated our position on the other amendments. I say to the member for Berowra-I know he could not be here when this bill was brought into the House-that there was a very c1ear and open debate on this bill when it came into this place. The debate followed a 10Cof consultation with community groups throughout this country. The debate that occurred when the bill was here, before it went to the Senate, was enlightening. A number of amendments were moved in the Senate by the government. (Quorum formed) I thank the opposition for calling the quorum. For the information of my colleagues who have come in here to hear the rest of the debate, only one amendment to the social security bill was moved by the opposition. I was explaining why certain amendments were moved in the Senate. We will not have a repetitious debate in this House, The amendments have been gone through in detail in the Senate and we do not need to reiterate the same feelings. in this House. A very c1ear debate on this bill had occurred in this House prior to it being introduced in the Senate. I was pleased that the me,mber for Berowra at least acknowledged that the government was mindful of what was occurring. Prior to the quorum being called I expected the debate to tum to the age limit for the aged pension. I appreciate and acknowledge that the opposition supports this measure. The member for Berowra, when debating this issue, stated that the government copied what the opposition was saying. He had some disparaging remarks to make about the previous minister for social security. The honourable member failed to mention-I will mention it now so history will record the facts-that when . the previous minister for social security was commenting on the Fightback package, which the coalition intended and hoped iLwouldbe able to introduce, we said that it was unfair to increase the age limit applying to the aged pension in such a short period. The government has embarked on a long process so that women will know over a 20year period when the age pension age limit is to change. The honourable member said that he thought the government had pillaged the opposition's recommendations. I can tell him quite earnestly that we have never done that because we do not need to do that. We have never governed in a vacuum. We have continually been mindful of what is happening in the community at large and we have made sure that any amendments .or changes to the legislation. refled what theco,mmunity feels, thinks and does.' That·' is why, after long deliberation, the government decided to ame.nd the pensionable age for women through a slow process. We will reach the year 2014 or 2015 before the final effect is felt. A lot of misinformation has been bandied around by both the ill-informed and those who should know better. They do not have the facts and they do not wish to read the bill or find out about the government's intentions with respect to the pensionable age of women. I know that the honourable member for Berowra would support the government in making sure that at all times the facts are represented in the electorate at large. I know that he would support what the government is trying to do, and he obviously has through the support of the coalition in the Senate. I repeat that we will not accept this amend- Simmons, D. W. ment. As I have said before, the amendment that we have finally and reluctantly accepted in the Senate is at least more fair. People were put on notice. They were able to get their personal houses in order as far as the investment procedures to be carried out were concerned. If we were to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra, who represents the coalition in this parliament, we feel that it would not be fair to those people who have already been placed on notice. I reiterate that the government refuses to accept the amendment. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Ruddock's amendment) stand part of the question. MCGauran, P. J.

I was so rudely interrupted by the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was talking about industrial relations and the fact that oppositions do not seem to have appreciated all the changes that have taken place within the trade union movement. They. never acknowledge the fact that trade unions have changed dramatically in their operations. The other points that I want to make about the investment climate have to do with the difficulties that businesses face from state and local governments. Those difficulties represent real barriers. Much more needs to be done at local and state government levels than what we are experiencing today. Blacktown City Council and Penrith City Council are very much minded to drive a wedge through the red tape that often inhibits business",153
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Mr Truss)Order! Would honourable members please resume their seats and listen in silence to the honourable member for Chifley.  Speaker. I am not used to audiences. Research and development is very important to economies. Whilst this government has done much in research and development-we are doing more through Working Nation by allowing smaller companies to be eligible for the 150 per cent R&D taxation allowance-we still have a long way to go. I feel we place too much emphasis on research and not enough on development. We really do need to see more good ideas which are developed in research translated into commercial products. The issue of foreign investment has been raised recently. Whilst I do not think we should b- xenophobic about foreign investment, governments have a great deal of leverage· that they are often reluctant to SENATE exercise in tenns of maximising the benefit and presence of foreign companies. Whatever one might say about industry policy, at its ultimate, we have a necessity to grow Australian companies and to develop those from small companies to medium sized companies, to very large companies. That is not a characteristic of the Australian economy at the moment. It is something that this government and successive governments will need to provide much greater attention to in the future if we are to realise the undoubted opportunities that are conferred upon us as a nation, particularly given our region. Last but not least, I ask the opposition: what are its policies on Working Nation? The opposition is on record as saying it wants to cut $10 billion out of the economy. Does it want to make any cuts to Working Nation? If it wants to have a situation of fiscal rectitude, what aspects of Working Nation will be eliminated by the opposition? (TIme expired)",156
202,Mr NEVILLE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The coalition is sometimes heralded by the government front-bench and sections of the media because we will not reveal at this stage-the first stage of the parliamentary term-the detail of our future policies. It seems to cause anxiety and' frustration. Given the treatment the coalition's policies were given during the last election campaign, is it any wonder? That is an entirely different circumstance from the responsibilities that attend to a government in office. When a statement like Working Nation is released, it is expected that the detail has thought thr?ugh and is available for scrutiny, access and Implementation. In that initial test, Working Nation fails. I would have thought that this government, which demanded detail from the opposition, with its vast array of ministerial staff, advisers and bureaucrats, would have been able to give the parliament much more detail on what it intended to do with Working Nation. The document is long on rhetoric and motherhood but very short on strategy and detail. The other thing that come- through is the lack of real vision in tackling the problem of unemployment. Many of the government programs seem to be more about hiding pockets of unemployment rather than addressing them. For example, we will place young people under 18 years of age, removed from the jobsearch allowance, into what will be euphemistically referred to ""as a youth training allowance, thus removing them from the unemployment figure. At the other end of the scale v:e will have the mature age allowance, removmg yet another group from the unemployment graph. However, more cynically"" many of the measures will not be implemented until July 1995, just six to nine months from the next election. The lack of vision comes through in other ways. Honourable members will remember the government's much vaunted announcement of three major statements. These have now been condensed into one. This statement is thin on the ground in its approach to industry and bland in its approach to regional development. I am not surprised to hear that the Deputy' Prime Minister (Mr Howe) will - ake a major statement in the wake of the final stage of the MCKinsey report in the coming weeks, obviously to plug the holes and beef up the government's regional development profile. . The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Mihister, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), said that we' are negative because we have said that the programs of the white paper will not work, and that we knock it before making constructive suggestions. I say to the parliamentary secretary that the detail is abysmally absent. In the Senate estimates, the coalition asked the sorts of been questions that we might reasonably ask as members, that we might take back to our el-ctorates a-d try to implement-the very thmg the parhamentary secretary was asking of us. One of the questions we asked at the Senate estimates hearings was: What is the specific function of the allocation of each of the following elements announced in Working Nation? Seven questions then followed concerning assistance in the formation of development organisations: how the regions might conduct opportunity assessment, regional audits and action plans; how local government might playa bigger role; financial support; how best practice will operate; how regional development offices might be allocated and what will constitute the regional forum. The answer was-wait for it: These questions cannot. be definitely answered at present. Th- differing nature and regional development reqUIrements of many differing regions throughout Australia demands flexibility in these program elements. There was no detail, just waffle. Then there were three carefully segmented practical questions regarding fundamental definitions like the form of assistance, what constitutes a representative region, who will select the regions, the selection process, what will the process be and how will the regions access monitoring information. What was the answer? It was: Guidelines are currently prepared and will be released shortly. The Senate inquirers also asked which existing government programs will be· in Working Nation and how they will be involved. We were told that where sound practices have been developed and implemented or where the nucleus of concepts is evident, it is proposed to harness these techniques for other regions to follow. I wish the honourable member for Calwell were here. Would he not agree that there is no specific vision; there was no attack plan ahead of the logic, and that the implementation of the programs will rest largely on syphoning ideas from current programs? Further, the estimates committee received an admission which alluded to 'sometime later in the 1994-95 fiscal year' before we see the actual spending of moneys. Clearly, there is a huge element of trial and error and picking up ideas as the program lurches along. Yet another aspect of Working Nation is the way members of the government have approached this much vaunted initiative, particularly in this debate. We should look at the speeches of government members in Hansard and how they came to grips with the program. Their debate has been more like an addressin-reply or a budget response. It has not been focused on Working· Nation. We have heard every conceivable topic from Fightback through to the supposed philosophical stance of the opposition, but precious little on the detail of Working Nation itself. In other words, the Labor Party just does not understand it and therefore cannot deliver this message in the parliament. When we add to this the pilfering of Fightback initiatives-and I list only three: the junior wage, the removal of the training guarantee levy and the establishment of area consultative councils, which was a parallel to an initiative of ours-we can see that again some key elements have been taken from our own agenda. When we view the vision it becomes even thinner. I am no political bigot. I recognise the gravity of having 900,000 Australians out of work and heaven knows how many others unemployed. The shelves of government departments and agencies are filled with un-actioned reports and studies: vision statements, strategic position statements, diversification studies, resource audits and the like-many of them, I might add, very good studies indeed. I was associated with one of them, the country centres study, authorised by the Hon. John Kerin during his time as primary industries minister and overseen by the Office of Local Government. It was an excellent study and in . its first blush looked at 10 regions of Australia. But, like the others, it perished as a result of no follow-through. At the end of the exercise there was no delivery mechanism. There was no way of making any of those projects reality. It will not just happen with another layer of 're-dos', as they are referred to in the Working Nation statement, another layer of bureaucracy. Some local authorities already think that this is a step down the road to regional government. Whether or not they are right does not matter. But there will need to be a vastly better resourced locally based regional development organisation in each region and not a government imposed group of bureaucrats or appointees. Regional development must above all-it is absolutely imperative-have a sense of ownership. It must be sourced from the ground up, not from the top down. If the government is sincere, it will fund existing regional development boards and bureaus. These are already representative of business, industry, local government, sometimes state government and frequently hinterland and outlying interests. By all means set guidelines and goals, but do not weigh down these bodies with endless bureaucracy and reporting. Some of the measures of Working Nation, if sensitively and consultatively implemented, are capable of great success. Young people and the longtenn unemployed deserve a better deal. The initiative of Working Nation is the first step. Beyond that, structural change and taxation refonn will be necessary. Such matters as already canvassed today in . this debate relating to excise, flexibility labour market and infrastructure development will be necessary. I confidently predict that the funding of existing regional development organisations does not take place and structurinterviewers al refonn in regional areas is neglected, Working Nation will follow the fate of the other government statements and reports that preceded it.",157
203,Ms DEAHM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Working Nation document, otherwise known as the white paper on employment ,and growth. This document covers, to my mind, the essential elements of paving the way a better and more equal Australia for all people. It does this through changes to labour market assistance, including the job compact and training and education refonn; refonns to the social security system; and by placing the focus on the need for more development in the regions of this vast country. The initiato tives outlined in the Working Nation docusupport ment are ones which I feel could only have job. been put together by a Labor government-a Labor government which cares about the unemployed, low income earners and areas the country which need revitalising. Those who have been unemployed for any length of time, however short, will tell youand I can speak from my own experiencethat this is a demoralising position in which to find oneself. Those who talk about dole bludgers and the alleged ease with which social security benefits can be obtained have clearly not experienced the humiliation person can feel in having to queue up at a _-ociaI security office to fill in endless and to undergo a most vigorous interview before any decision. is made about paying social security benefits. Unemployed people will also tell you the longer they are unemployed the more demoralised they feel and the harder it is them to raise enthusiasm not only to look for work but to actually front for an interview. spoke only last week to a friend in Queenscreativity land who had been unemployed for some time. He is a confident, articulate, assertive person, who I would never have dreamed would have difficulty with a job interview-a in the job which he was. well qualified for and would have been able to undertake with ease. if He told me of the harrowing experience it was for him to sit in front of a panel of and to be asked questions---:-the answers to which he knew but for which he found difficulty finding words to respond. Such an experience is not new to the longtenn unemployed. For this reason we need to give special attention to the long-tenn unemployed, and this is precisely what the white paper is designed to do. The job compact is a central plank of the white paper and provides individual case management for people for who have been unemployed for 18 months its initially. This individual case management will involve very much a one-to-dne relationship between the case manager and the client. Getting to know a person, their feelings, their qualifications, their desires, their temperament and their potential, will help the case manager direct them to the kind of training and which they need in order to secure a As with the experience of my friend, those of who are already fully qualified often need a little help to prepare them for applying for a job, particularly for undertakingan interview. Part of the job compact will involve arranging training and work experience. The guarantee of a job for 6 to 12 months, which can ease people back into the work force, is an important part of the job compact. The training wage is very much a part of the job compact a for'those who will slot into this category. The opposition has been very keen to fonns criticise the white paper for its assumed failure to create jobs. However, the new work opportunities component will encourage local proposals for the generation of employment, that especially in regions where employment opportunities are limited. The ingenuity and for creativity of Australians should never be .underestimated. We have been great inventors I and creators. Sadly, in the past much of our has been picked up by others and developed. But now we have the opportunity to create new industries, new jobs, new opportunities within our own communities. Education and training are also essential parts of the white paper, and it is universally acknowledged that the more skills we have the more opportunities we have both at home and in the international marketplace. Our employment strategy will therefore be broadened and adapted to improve the skills of all of our young people, whether this is in education, in employment or for the unemployed. It will encourage more companies to take on trainees and apprentices. In my electorate recently I was greatly encouraged to hear a local employer, a small business, tell me that he had recently taken his first female apprentice. I have already spoken about this company in another context in this place, and I am extremely proud of a company which started only four or five years ago with a small handful of ·staff and which now employs approximately 30 people in metal fabrication. The company has obtained large contracts with major companies, including BHP, and is working two shifts in order to keep up with those orders. The owner is a young man who is enthusiastic and keen to see jobs develop in a local community which does not have a high industrial component. He told me that the young woman in question had undertaken a TAFE course in welding because she was unable to find employment or an apprenticeship. She approached him to undertake some work experience as part of her course. As he had a vacancy at that time he gave her a trial run and then offered her apprenticeship. This young woman is now working alongside the men in the factory and on site and is doing extremely well. There should be many more such employers, and being willing to take the gamble when they recognise talent is something that many employers need to latch on to. Under the terms of the white paper there will be revised incentive structures to encourage employers to take on apprentices and trainees. The training wage will simplify industrial relations arrangements for tra.inees. I am particularly encouraged by the work which will be undertaken with high school students in preparing them for job training and employment. Student traineeships will enable year 11 and 12 students to work at their school studies while at the same time obtaining work experience and on the job training. In my electorate this is very much welcomed; I am particularly supportive of the new youth training initiatives which will ensure that under 18s are no longer merely placed on a jobsearch allowance or a homeless youth allowance, They will now receive intensive case management, which will include a comprehensive assessment of their existing skills and knowledge in particular areas and will direct them towards training for employon ment which is applicable to their particular desires and existing skills. I have already see.n the fruits of the employment aspects of the Working Nation document in my electorate. I heard only yesterday that a local women's legal resource centre is hiring an. Aboriginal trainee to work specifically on Aboriginal women's legal issues. In addition, the Blue Mountains Community Legal Centre is employing an extra administration worker under the Working Nation program. I am told that both management committees met this week to consider the matter and they have both agreed to work with·the CES to find suitable workers under the appropriate employment program. The other program which has been very much alive and well in my electorate prior to the white paper but now further enforced by it is LEAP, the landcare and environment an action program. As members will be aware, this program is directed towards young unemployed people and provides them with on-job training, work experience and more formal training. In these cases the work and training are directed towards environmental projects. In my electorate, which covers the Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains areas, including sections of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River system, LEAP has been a godsend· both for the local environment and for the young people involved. To date, LEAP trainees have carried out .work on the Glenbrook Lagoon, the. Wentworth Falls Lake and other· bush regeneration areas in the· Blue Mountains. They have also worked in major projects on river bank restoration in the Hawkesbury area. One of the programs, which was announced in the white paper, was a project to restore the native vegetation and stabilise the river banks of the Hawkesbury River. The grants totalled over $112,000. These funds will provide employment and training for 15 young people for. six months. The initiative was part of the regional development and growth focus of the white paper. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Greening Australia which has supervised these programs in my electorate. . My electorate forms part of the Greater West of Sydney, and the area is ideal for the setting up of a regional development project. I will be working closely with my colleagues in the region to see that this happens in order that we can take advantage of the provisions of the Working Nation program. One of the' other most important planks of the document is the reforms to the social security system. Many people who have been unemployed for some time find themselves in something of a social security trap. When they take ventures into the work force, usually with casual or part-time employment, they find that they are penalised in the benefits which they receive. Sometimes pe-ple have found that it is not economical. to look for kind of work. The Working Nation document will go a long way to alleviate these problems and enable people to undertake part-time work without losing an overall benefit. In order to encourage people to work part time, the government plans to reduce the taper of wages to social security benefits from 100 per cent to 70 per cent. This means that an unemployed person will gain financially from taking up work. The white paper estimates that some 33,000 unemployed people will get part-time work and some of the 132,000 unemployed people who are currently doing part-time work will increase their income when they lose less of their social security benefits while undertaking part-time work. However, I feel that one of the major reforms to the social security system is the treatment of married women as workers in their own right. Until now the social security benefits have been paid to one person, with an allowance for a partner. The incomes will now be split so that if partners are entitled to unemployment benefits they will receive them individually. The new parenting allowance is a huge step forward for women who choose to stay at home and look after their children. It will be a separate payment to the spouse, which in most cases is the mother. The maximum payment will be $132.65 at current rates, and the allowance is expected to increase the income of 118,000 families by, on average, $59 a week. The home child-care allowance, which was introduced by the government earlier this year, was the first step forward in recognising the separate work undertaken by women in the home. I think it is to the government's credit that we have recognised' this valuable contribution by women and to no longer see them as an extension of the main breadwinner. It should be understood that the parenting allowance is an addition to normal family payments. ' As I have already mentioned, I also applaud the new regional development plans which have been outlined in the white paper. For too long Australia has focused on major capital cities. The regions of Australia, whether they this are outer metropolitan, semi-rural or remote country areas, deserve recognition. With the development of industries and the creation of new job opportunities in many areas we will start to take the pressure off the major cities, which are already congested and, in some cases, overdeveloped. Many of my constituents travel for more than two hours to get to jobs in Sydney, and it will be a great advantage if job opportunities can be created nearer to their home base. Challenges for the regions under this program are many. In my particular electorate, where the environment is an important component of the region, tourism is the main industry. Other industries, of necessity, are small in nature, and the challenge is therefore to create the kinds of jobs which complement the environment and, in many cases, enhance it while also providing job opportunities. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his ministerial colleagues. and staff who .have worked diligently in producing this document. . All of us on the government side have had an input into the development of this far-sighted program. It deserves the support of all members because its advantages are great and its effects will be for all Australians. I was very sad to hear many members on the other side being so negative about this far-sighted document. I therefore have great pleasure in supporting the program.",159
204,Mr LIEBERMAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I do not know whether I am tail end Charlie, but I do know that everyone wants to go home. In my contribution in the few minutes I have, I wish to engender in all members a realisation that whilst the Working Nation document contains some very important initiativessome of them are very valuable initiatives-it is an admission by the Keating government that it has made grave errors in its administrathem tion of Australia over the last decade or so. The contacts that I· talk about in the few minutes I have are from the real world. A few weeks ago, I met a constituent when visiting a small town in my electorate. She told me that her son had committed suicide by hanging himself a little while earlier. He was 23 years of age, and he had been having great difficulty coping. He had been unemployed for quite a long time. She was pretty distressed. I must say that I was too. As we talked together, it became evident to me that she was passing on to me the grim realisation that unemployment destroys lives. Long-term unemployment in particular is one of the hardest things for fellow Australians to bear. This woman indicated to me that she was quite worried about her husband, who was not coping with the tragic loss of their son and who was, in her words, walking in the hills each day from early morning to night and then going straight to bed. She could not get counselling for him. I felt pretty hopeless and helpless,. I wondered when I left that town whether I would hear about her husband taking his life as well. Long-term unemployment causes tremendous problems for people. We know that there are also problems of increased crime, violence and desperation. We also note with alarm and regret the fact that Australia apparently has the highest incidence of suicide amongst young people compared with other OECD nations. I am not prepared to accept that this nation should be like that. I am sure that members on both sides of the House also feel as I do. Whatever we do has to be effective and it has to deal with the problems that are causing these good Australians to suffer and, in some cases, take their own lives. So it is in that context that I am making my statements tonight. Firstly, I welcome the idea in this document of the long-term unemployed being allocated on a case management basis to people who can help them. That is really the only way these people can be helped. There has to be a one-to-one relationship with the long-term unemployed. It is no good putting in a queue and making them wait and then having a different officer deal with them every fortnight or so. It is terribly important that every effort be made to try. to understand the problem. We need to find the right way of managing the difficult period for people and providing follow-up assistance. We must ensure that the training they receive is both,effective and will lift their morale and spirit.' That is an enormous challenge. Officers in both the CES and the private sector who will be responsible for managing these cases will have a really big challenge in carrying that out. What· a shame it is that this government, having been in office for nearly 11 years, has taken 11 years to realise that that is the sort of management we need to help the unemployed. The queue is not the answer. Direct iilVolvement and the use of skills and' inanagement is the only way to go. ,-, Secondly, the cruelest thing we can do is PlJt these long-term unemployed people through this process and not make damned sure at the end of the process that everything possible has been done by the government to remove obstacles that take away jobs and prevent new jobs being created. I come from the private sector; J do' not come from the public service. l know what it is like to make a few decisions and take a risk and to go to . the bank manager and ask for an overdraft so that I can take another risk and employ people. I also know how complex it is to find a way of expanding a business and creating permanent jobs. I also understand the challenge that people have, particularly in small business, of building up their business and the loyalty they feel with their employees: They are not really employees in a small business; they are more or less team mates. Such people feel very strongly about the need to ensure that their judgment and business is run so that the employees-their fellow team mates-have permanent jobs and not transient jobs. That is the spirit of the small business woTld which I like so much and which I know many of us appreciate and acknowledge; I worry that this government is fiddling at the edges. It is not addressing the issues that should be addressed in order to clear away the obstacles to people-particularly in small business-making good, sound investment decisions, involving some risk on their part, which will flourish and generate real, permanent jobs for these people that we want to help. I will provide some instances of that. I have observed them in the little· while that I have been a member of this federal parliament. The landmark industrial relations legislation was brought in by the government and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). During the debate on that industrial relations legislation, not only the coalition also many people outside the jungle of politics in the real world made sincere and constructive criticisms of it. We pointed out that it would create problems, not solve them. I will give the most graphic example. I am referring to the piece of the legislation that made it a nightmare for employers to take on new employees because of the possible implications of huge unspecified damages claims being made if-the relationship between them and the employees did not flourish arid lead to enduring jobs. I am referring to the dismissal clauses in that industrial act. As a result of the goverriment ignoring that advice and pushing the legislation through, all of us who are doing our job in our electorates would have met employers,particularly small business employers, who have said, 'I am sorry that I cannot taket he risk of putting on new people because I am frightened about the meaning and implications of this new legislation. I cannot put my own hard work and my family's security. at risk and face some unspecified claim for damages. Along with all the other problems that I have in trying to survive in business, it is just not worth it.' Those members opposite who honestly address this issue in retrospect will accept and admit to themselves-I do not want them to do it here and humiliate themselves-that people in their electorate would have given people jobs but did not do so because of the burden and worry of the ill-founded industrial relations legislation that has been brought in and driven through the parliament. This legislation was supported in the Senate, against the best of advice, by the Australian Democrats and the Greens, which also have to account and explain themselves to the electorate of Australia. So, months after that ill-advised legislation went through, we now find the government acknowledging the problems and bringing in legislation to modify those provisions and to address the criticism that has built up to a crescendo. We know that there are judges now in Australian courts who are yet to adjudicate and hand down judgments on the industrial relations legislation. The speculation is that some of the judgments in some of those cases but will bring record sums of damages. I do not know whether that is right, but I can tell you what is right: that legislation, spawned by this government which ignored advice, has cost jobs. It has cost real jobs and delayed new investment. Therefore, I find it somewhat ironical that the government, with its Working Nation white paper document, is well intentioned. I know that it is well intentioned. It is saying that we are going to train these people, we are going to do all sorts of things to help create skills and training for the long-term unemployed. But the fact is that there would not be so. many long-term unemployed or unemployed at all if the. government would only address the issues that it ought to address and take into account the enonnous obstacles that exist in Australia that stop investment in private sector- All of you over there know that, ultimately, that is the way in which we will solve the problem of unemployment both long tenn and short tenn. You know very well that if the public sector has to take up the slack and offer jobs to your kids and their kids in the future all that will happen is the government and the nation will not grow and develop; we will become heavy with debt, high with taxes and slip into oblivion. You know all that. You know damn we]], whether you are socialists or not, that in this modern, complex world the only way to create pennanent jobs and challenges for people is to stimulate the private sector so that it can provide the jobs and income for the government, through taxes, so that the government can then provide the programs of health and welfare and other programs-defence, education and the likethat we a]] want for Australia. You know that. Mr Dodd- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.",162
205,Mr LIEBERMAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,The honourable member is going to try to stop me from talking. Mr Dodd-The honourable member keeps attributing things to you which I am sure you would not want to take on. Would you ask him to address his remarks through the chair and not attribute things to you.,164
206,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"There is no point of order. MrLIEBERMAN-It is interesting that in the last couple of minutes those opposite were trying to stop me from talking in this vein. wonder whether I have struck a raw nerve. Perhaps the next point'that I make will do so even more. I have in front of me an article from the Wangaratta Chronicle, a newspaper in my electorate, that was faxed to me from my electorate today. The article is headed 'Street talk'. It is an interview of people random in the street on their views on the leader of this government, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and their confidence or otherwise in him to run this nation. Tanya Adams of Wangaratta said that she thought the Prime Minister did make those .comments about his the nation that were referred to by Mr Hawke. She did not believe Mr Keating. She said: The Prime Minister should respect his country. I hope he's not the next Prime Minister. Rob Williams of Wangaratta, in a similar vein, said: As far as him being the next Prime Minister, that's in the lap of the Gods. Jenny Proctor of Corowa said: ... I think the comments ... by Mr Keating ... were probably made ... I don't think Mr Keating will be the next Prime Minister. Wendy Pierce of Oxley said: Yes I think Mr Keating made the comments. Then . she said: the I certainly won't be voting for Mr Keating. Colleen Cannody of Wangaratta said: If Mr Keating made those comments in private they should have been kept private. If he said those things I'm sure he didn't want them repeated at a later date. I hope he won't be the next Prime Minister. Maureen Flavel of Wangaratta finishes up by saying: I certainly hope he is not the next Prime Minister. I believe he will not be the next Prime Minister. (TIme expired).",164
207,Mr CUNNINGHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I want to make a few remarks tonight on Working Nation. The area I want to cover, which relates back to the 1980s, is the basis of some of the problems we are facing today. I would like to mention some of the areas that have not been covered to any great degree, even though we are seeing plenty of action in some of the courts and efforts being made to I drag some people back from overseas who had a very significant part to play in the problems within Australia and the losses that the Australian economy suffered due to bad decision making at that time. Trust in companies and people who have a responsibility to manage the funds of the, at nation, whether it be in superannuation funds, unions or industry, is a very important part of any economy. In the 1980s many decision makers went overboard in relation to how they were managing the new found responsibility they had in a deregulated economy. I am not saying that deregulation is' the problem. Millions of dollars were absolutely w,asted. In Victoria, in particular, through Tricontinental and the State Bank investments with industry, those captains of industry who had responsibility to make honest and proper decisions, millions of dollars were wasted in the decision making processes. Victorians have paid a big price for that. A lot of this nation's unemployment has resulted from unwise investment. I do not think anyone would argue against that. We are still paying the price for it, particularly in Victoria. The need for honesty and management is very important. We are starting to see, with the moves in the courts, some of the people who have been involved in what I would call shady and dishonest deals-some have skipped the country-being brought to heel for what they have done. Ordinary working Australians have very often paidthe price for this. It is going to take a considerable time before we finally cwork all those problems through to the point where we can expect to have unemployment rates of two, three, four or five per cent. Working Nation is designed to put into practice measures which I believe in the long term will solve 'some of the problems, particularly those experienced by the long-term unemployed. They have paid the price of economic changes that have been foisted upon the community because of the dishonest actions of many people. It does not give me any pleasure tonight to bring a matter before the parliament which I am greatly concerned about. We have all been reading in the newspapers about the mismanagement of business. It is very important that people, no matter where they are, who are in a position of trust carry out their duties in an appropriate way in order to protect the money of the people for whom they are responsible. Today I have made' representations to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on a matter that has already been raised in this parliament-more information has since become available-that of a superannuation trust. On 9 June this year, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) reported a number of allegations Of corrupt activities in relation to the Food Industry Superannuation Trust, FIST. Those allegations related to activities by the federal and Victorian secretary of the food and confectionary division, Mr Tom Ryan. Mr Ryan was, at the relevant time, the chairman and fund secretary of FIST. On 16 June Mr Ryan stood down as chairman of the FIST board pending investigations by the Victorian police major fraud squad and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.",164
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Order! I am listening to the member very closely. Is this matter still before the courts?,165
209,Mr CUNNINGHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"No. As I understand it, no charges have been laid. It is an investigation. I am raising this matter because I believe that people who invest their moneys in superannuation funds have every right to expect that the people in charge of those funds treat workers with the proper diligence that is expected of them. Following reports of the statements made in this House, members of FIST received FIST's 1992-93 Annual report to members. The report states under the heading 'Compliance' that the fund is in breach of regulation 8A(3) of the Occupational' Superannuation Act. Specifically the report states that there is an imbalance between the sum of the members' benefit statements and the assets of the fund. The report also invited members to inspect FIST's auditor's report for the year. Note 10 of the auditor's report confirms that the fund does not have sufficient assets to cover the total of the amounts allocated to members' accounts. The report also states: The Insurance and Superannuation Commission has since indicated approval of a method of rectifying the breach whereby the amount of the imbalance will be recovered over a period not exceeding seven years. . . This is the area that my constituent has great concern about and has asked me to raise with the Attorney-General. I have been asked to raise the matter in parliament and to ask whether the Attorney-General will investigate the allegations. In particular, I ask the Attorney-General to determine whether the Insurance and Superannuation Commission has the power under its new act, which takes effect on 1 July 1994, to order FIST's trustees to send to members a full explanation of the financial difficulties of the fund and the method it proposes to use to recover the liability without any further delay. My constituent also, has asked whether the Attorney General could advise whether the trustees can legally reduce members' accounts by an unspecified amount or whether the trustees will have to 'ask the members to contribute the money to make up the difference. He has asked whether I could assist in this matter. I wish to raise further matters. The ance and Superannuation Commission has often expressed concern that FIST has not yet advised its members of the size of the unfundAttorney-General. ed'liability or how FIST trustees intend to recover the liability. I am aware that investithey gation into FIST's accounts has shown that two cheques amounting to more than $23,000 were drawn on FIST accounts made payable to cash. Subsequently, the word 'cash' was crossed out and the cheques were made payable to G. Cotton. The former assistant federal secretary of the Food Preservers Union of Australia arid the current assistant Victorian secretary of the food and confectionary realise division of the AFMEU is Ms Gail Cotton. Also, I am informed that a total of more than $67,000 was paid by FIST to a convicted criminal, Gavin Anderson, and that some these funds were paid without any being presented to FIST. Members. of FIST are process workers in the food and confectionary industry. Many members, especially older members, are very concerned about the allegations relating to superannuation fund. Members have not been told how the trustees intend to recover their unfunded liability. They have not been told whether it is true that they are to be levied sum of funds. It does not give me any pleasure to raise this matter in the parliament, but I believe is important in today's climate that those who? have a responsibility for others' funds, whethsee er they be in the business sector, in superanAustralia; nuation trust funds or anywhere else, are made responsible for the decisions they and are brought to bear if they have not carried out their responsibilities correctly. As I said earlier, many of the unemployment problems we have in Australia today come about from the fact that those who have a responsibility for investing funds, for looking after funds and generally protecting the public in relation' to these matters, are not always acting in the honest and direct way we would expect. A new term being expressed which I have heard several times is 'economic mischief'. It is not really fraud, it is not really attempting to take anybody down, but it is an Insureconomic mischief. We are hearing it too and I believe it needs to be stamped out. I have raised these matters today with the I have raised them here in the parliament specifically because I believe should be made public. I raise them also so that the members of this trust can eventually feel that they will not be left high and dry in their' retirement, as many other people in Victoria have been left high and dry and have found that their funds have disappeared. I have many constituents affected by the Estate Mortgage matter of the 1980s. Because people did not, speak up '. at the time, they did not that their funds were going where they were and they found themselves in great trouble in retirement. It is this waste of money, this poor investment or deliberate of deception, and in many cases fraud, that invoice causes many of our problems. ' Working Nation is a very important document. We in this parliament have a responsibility to see that these things are not allowed to continue in the future and that people who hold a position of responsibility are made the accountable for it and that they are brought before the appropriate authorities if necessary. Those authorities being given the opportunity to assess the issues to bring to the fore the a information that is required is what the issue is all about. I believe that during the 1980s in particular it these sorts of things were swept under the carpet too much. In the 1990s I think we will a lot of people coming before the court in for example, those whom we are still trying to extradite from overseas for the make operations they carried out. The sooner Australia eradicates this type of action and attitude that public funds are dealt with responsibly but to line the pockets of some people who perhaps should not have the opportunity to put themselves in that position the better. It does not give me any great pleasure to raise this matter tonight, I think it is important and should be put before the public.",165
210,Mr ATKINSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I rise to look at this issue of One Nation-or rather of Working Nation. It is a very importavailable? ant issue that we have been debating. I inadend vertently used the words 'One Nation' to start withMr Jenkins-An understandable Freudian slip.,167
211,Mr ATKINSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is not really a Freudheaps Ian slip. When the government introduced in this area. One Nation it proceeded to create division by raising the issue of the republic. We could put Working Nation in the same sort of category. Those opposite talk about working and aboutfull-time jobs for people, but where are they? We are staring in the face of, in official figures, one million unemployed people in this country. Heaven knows exactly what the number of people would be if we took into account people who are underemployed and those who have given up trying to get a job. The Working Nation title fits very well into the pattern that we got into with One Nation. The government has taken the view that if people are put into training schemes, if they are put into various schemes where they gain skills, by some sort of magic that gives them a job. The reality is that it does not. Mr Quick-It does.",167
212,Mr ATKINSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The honourable member ing for Franklin talks about it giving them a job. Those opposite say that it gives them a job. The reality at this stage is that we have many young people going through high school who get out at the end of high school and cannot find work. A lot more people are staying at school. The government claims credit for this-I have to concede that in some areas education more people have been encouraged to stay and complete their high school educaaway tiont-but a lot of those people are completing the high school for no other reason than that they there not to be , cannot get work. We talk about social justice in this government. What social justice is there for the in excess 'of 30,000 students who completed their high school education and intended to go but on, and do a university course but could not get in? What social justice, is there for those people who went through university and completed a course, expecting at the end of it to get a job, but found that jobs were not It is' all very well to say, 'At the of this training there will be a job,' but for many of those young people there is not a job. We could' ask all the people in this parliament for examples, I have a daughter who has cQ.mpleted a university degree in education and cannot, get work. There are of these examples, There are difficulties The real problem we have is that jobs are not created just by providing the training schemes. We need to get this country in order. I relate back to the householder so that people can think in terms of where all these government ideas are going., In effect, we are saying to members of a household that we will give them some pocket money to keep 'them employed, but outside of that household system there is no money coming into provide for that household, to pay its way. The reality is that this year the government is overspending to the order-on its figuresof $11.8 billion. We consider it to be closer to $18 billion when the asset sales that have gone through-which the government miraculously seems to think are going to happen more than once, but they are not - are taken into account. This government is makit more and more difficult for people to get work. Ultimately, we cannot continue to run with this deficit. The only way we can solve it is by increasing taxes. This recipe is not going to solve the problems of people in our community; this recipe means that, because of these increased taxes, fewer businesses will be around to provide job opportuniof ties for yoting people in our country. There is a need for this government to get from its catch statements: the words 'social justice', when social justice is not applying; the words 'One Nation', when government members work through a process of division· rather than building a nation; and the words 'Working Nation"" when the reality is that more and more people in this country are being put out of work. In the short term, the government will say that the unemployment figures are going down, and certainly we are seeing a slight pick-up at this stage in some areas of industry. I applaud every occasion on which those pick-ups in employ-ent occur, but we are not setting the policy mix that will solve the problem in the longer term. As industries pick up in this country-many of them have been making losses for a number of years-they do not have the asset base to build their business within the cash flow that will be necessary to be continually competitive- If we amortise their costs across their production runs, we will see that only the companies with a good cash base will be able to succeed. So, in the process of the economy picking up, we are going to see many of these companies that have hung on Qver a number of years still actually falling over the edge. These are things that we need to.look at very closely. If we look at the industrial relations policy of'this government, we will see that many people in the smaller business sectors-I am not talking about the larger ones-say, 'It is not worth my while employing somebody else. I will provide overtime for the people that I have and that is as far as I will go.' That is the sort of attitude people in my electorate-where there is a lot of small business-have to the process at the moment. It would be great if we could pick up the confidence and build up the interests of our 800,000 small businesses to get an extra employee in each of those businesses. The unemployment problems of our country would be solved. But the reality is that the policy mix and the issues of industrial relations and the way taxes are being handled are making it more and more difficult for these businesses to say, 'Let's employ somebody else. Let's put someone else on.' What happens when, as the economy picks up-let us hope it does; I am very hopeful that it will pick up-these businesses with a lack of cash flow fall over the edge? Some of that work will be picked up by other businesses, but most businesses will not be able to pick up in the time available all of the additional work generated. One of two things' will happen: either they will increase their prices-and they will probably do that anyway because, on the supply· and demand process, they will say, 'If we cannot produce any more we will jack up the prices because the demand is there,' so there will be an inflationary push within that-or, if they cannot supply the products and the prices continue to jack up, more and more products will come in from overseas, which is not going to do anything to solve unemployment in this country. I ask government members to go back and look at the way they are handling this process of job creation. It is not job creation, it is scheme creation-it is moving people onto other methods of getting money. I would be the first to say that I do not want to see young people-and people from all age groups-in this country left out in the cold, without giving them some sort of training scheme and without keeping them encouraged for the opportunity of work down the line. I do not want to see that happen at all. But I also do not want to see the hopes of many of these young people built up to a level where their expectations cannot be met. I believe we are going to find that, at the end of many of these training schemes, many young people are still not going to get jobs. The reality is that the only way we are going to be able to create jobs to look after young people in this country is by providing an environment where businesses are going to employ more people. As a result of their employing more people on a full-time basis, there will be more people to spend funds in the community. As they spend those funds, the demand for products will pick up, and the system will then head in the right direction. As they earn wages, more taxes will be paid and, as a result of their paying tax, a lesser burden will be placed on the other members of our community, which reverses the process we currently have in place. Government members need to go away.and have a hard look at what they have done with the schemes they have established. They need to ask themselves this question: 'At the end of the scheme we have provided for these young people, what opportunity is there for them? Have we a real job for them at the end of this scheme?' I think that if they are honest with themselves they will come up with the answer-at this stage, anyway-that the jobs are not available. I encourage those who stand up and talk about Working Nation as being the solution to the problems of people to remember that it may be a solution in the very short term but, in the longer term of solving our problems, it is in fact a handicap. We have provided a bandaid and not a solution to the initial problem.",167

Let me digress for a moment while speaking about the job training program and the AFL. Last Monday night I made a speech in which I attacked the administration and the financial management of the AFL. In that speech, I said things which have been interpreted outside this House as impinging upon the character of Mr Ross Oakley, the chief executive of the AFL. I say to Mr Oakley that that is not correct. I do not for one moment suggest that Mr Oakley is 110t of good character and does not have high reputation.

NA until Wednesday, 24 August 1994 at 10 order 273 an alternative date or time is fixed. NA The following answers to questions were circulated:· Woodchip Licences (Question No. 421) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 5 October 1993: Further to the answer by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories to my question without notice (Hansard, 29 September 1993, page 1333), concerning logging in compartment 1402 in the south east forests of New South Wales, in which she indicated that a Commonwealth response to the logging was being discussed with the Minister for Resources, has he or his predecessor informed the responsible NSW Ministers that the relevant woodchip licence may be liable to Commonwealth action if the terms of the National Forest Policy Statement are not adhered to; if not, why not; if so, will he table the letter communicating this information. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The National Forest Policy Statement was cievelopedas a partnership between the Commonwealth, the States· and Territories for the future management of Australia's public and private forests on a cooperative basis. Under the Statement, signatory governments made commitments to implement certain initiatives, both individually and collectively but recognising that prime responsibilialso ty for land use issues remains' with 'the States and Territories. The Government believes that the continuation of this cooperative approach between the Commonwealth and the Statefferritory Governments is the most appropriate way to ensure the long term protection of old-growth forests and wilderness. Under the National Forest Policy Statement, aj comprehensive, adequate and representative, reserve system for old-growth forests and wilderness is to be in place by 1995 for forests on public lands and by 1998 for private forested land. A Joint Sub-Committee of the Australian and New Zealand .Environment and Conservation Council and Ministerial Council on Forestry, Fisheries and Aquaculture is currently developing criteria. for determining this forest reservation system. I understand the criteria are expected to be finalised soon. Once the criteria are agreed, the Commonwealth, States and Territories will work together to ensure that a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system is in place. NA As part of this cooperative approach, it was agreed in the National Forest Policy Statement that until forest assessments are completed forest management agencies will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of ola-growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conServation value. This was' not meant to imply a moratorium on logging in all areas of old-growth and wilderness, only those likely to be required for the forest reservation - system. The National Forest Policy Statement recognised that some logging in old-growth areas will continue for sometime to meet the demand for timber. Logging in compartment 1402 was covered by current State environmental impact statements. This compartment was also approved for logging in the context of Harris Daishowa's 1993 export licence following a detailed assessment by the then Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, under COmmonwealth environmental legislation, including the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 and the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992. ' In' accordance with his legal obligations, Mr Griffiths' assessment included consideration of feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed operations and means of ensuring that any adverse impacts on the national estate were minimised. It included consideration of advice from the Australian Heritage Commission. In the context of the 1994 woodchip export licence renewals the then Minister for Resources, the Hon Michael Lee, MP advised State Ministers that he had indicated to licensees that they should have due regard to the objectives, policies and processes agreed by Governments in the National Forest Policy Statement and should consult with State forest management agencies as appropriate on the adoption of these agreed policies. Forests: Old Growth (Question No. 789) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 17 December 1993: (l) Has his attention been drawn to claims that the level of protection for high conservation value of old growth forests in New South Wales is appallingly low. (2) Have Dr Norton of the Australian National University and Professor J. Kiremarkpatrick of the University of Tasmania completed a major report which highlights how little high conservation value old growth forest is protected in national parks; if· so, does the report state that: (a) in north eastern New South Wales, (i) 0.8 per cent of dry/cool, (ii) O. I per cent of dry/warm, (iii) 5.4 per cent of wet/cool and (iv) 0.9 per cent of wet/warm high conservation value old growth forest on flatter terrain with fertile soils is in reserves; (b) in south eastern New South Wales (i) in the Eden Management Area virtually no high conservation value old growth forest on fertile soils is in reserves and (ii) in the Batemans Bay forestry region only 7 per cent of old growth forest on the most productive sites is in reserves; and (c) the best old growth forestshave been excIuded from national parks. (3) Is it a fact that 90 per cent of· the high conservation value old growth forests are available for logging. {4) Does he accept the accuracy of the data provided in the report. (5) What steps will the Governmimt take to stop logging and woodchipping of important old growth forests. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of community concerns.that oldgrowth forests with high conservation value should be protected. (2) (a), (b) I understand that Dr Norton and Professor Kirkpatrick have prepared a paper which contains the figures referred to in the honourable member's question and that these are based upon a study compiled by another author. (c) The paper claims that land ownership and allocation decisions in the past have created a system of forest reserves that are not representative of old-growth forests and forest biodiversity. At the same time the paper acknowledges initiatives in the National Forest Policy Statement for the development of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system for forest and wilderness areas which will be complemented by off-reserve forest management. . Chainnan, Trade Practices Commis..ion Occupant (A)I990-91 Prof Baxt 83,244 (3) I understand that the paper does not assert that 90 per cent of the high conservation value oldgrowth forests are available for logging nor does it define ""high conservation value old-growth forest"". While the paper estimates that for three forest groups in NSW, some 10 per cent occurs in conservation reserves, this does not imply that the balance is available for logging as State Forests are subject to various management prescriptions which may significantly limit areas able to be harvested. (4) Without knowing the basis on which oldgrowth forests are defined or the methodology adopted to produce the data in the report I am unable to comment on the accuracy of the report. (5) The Commonwealth and mainland· States have agreed in the National Forest Policy Statement to a cooperative approach to protect old-growth forests and wilderness and a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system is to be in place by 1995 for public forests ..As part of this cooperative approach, it was agreed in the National Forest· Policy Statement that until forest assessments are completed forest management agencies will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old-growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value. This was not meant to imply a moratorium on logging in al1 areas of old-growth and wilderness, only thoSe likely to be required for the forest reservation system.

(29) No. (30) While the Foundation has yet to be established it is intended that it will offer as much to people living outside metropolitan Melbourne as to those who reside there. (31) Approved Common-ealth methods of financial review and program evaluation will apply. Federal Airports Corporation (Question No. 1015) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 23 March 1994: (1) Did the Federal Airport Corporation's (FAC) Sydney Airport Draft Planning Strategy in July 1990 forecast average annual passenger growth of 3.S per cent to the year 2010, at which time the airport would reach maximum paSsenger capacity of 30 million passengers per annum. (2) Did the Sydney Airport· Draft Planning Strategy Supplement in December 1993 state that passenger and aircraft volume forecasts for the Sydney basin remained substantially the same as predicted in the Draft Planning Strategy. (3) Did the FAC Forecasts for Australian Airports in August 1993 indicate that passenger growth at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport will average 4.4 per cent per annum over the next 20 years; if so, (a) does the forecast imply that the airport would reach maximum capacity at the year 2007 and (b) what are the implications for the FAC's planned development of Sydney's second international airport at Badgerys Creek. (4) Did actual passenger growth per arinum at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport increase from 12.202 MPA in 1988 to IS.5 MPA in mid-1993, excluding transit passengers, at an average growth rate of S.5 per cent. (S) Will the rate of passenger growth increase during Australia's economic recovery. (6) Will the FAC revise its forecast for maximum capacity at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (7) When will the FAC update its projections from the 1990 Draft Planning Strategy for passenger numbers at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in 1995 and the year 2000. (8) Did the International Air Transport Association in 1993 provide a 10 year forecast for air passenger growth in Australia of 7.2 per cent per annum; if so, (a) does the FAC accept the accuracy of the forecast and (b) on the basis of the forecast when would Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport reach maximum capacity. , (9) When does the FAC expect to commence than transferring commuter aircraft movements from Sydney .(Kingsford-Smith) Airport to Badgerys Creek. (10) Did the 1993 Sydney Airport Draft Planning Strategy Supplement forecast 227 950 annual aircraft movements at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport for 1995. (11) Did theFAC annual report for 1992-93 record a total of 235 355 aircraft movements at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport for 1992-93. (12) Does the FACexpect passenger movements to decline before 1995; if so, why. (13) Does Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport have the capacity to accept aircraft larger than a Boeing 747; if so, what capacity; if not, what plans and progress have been made in developing the capacity.",188
242,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has provided the following answer. . (1) No. The Draft Planning Strategy of 1990 forecasts ""... suggest that domestic traffic is expected to grow between 3.3% and 4.1 % per year for the next twenty years"" and that ""International traffic is expected to grow at an annual rate of 3 % to S% for the same period"". The Draft Planning Strategy also states ""if the new [parallel] runway is constructed, airfield capacity is significantly increased and Sydney Airport could accommodate about .30 million passengers annually. This traffic level is expected to occur around 20 I 0"". (2) Yes. (3) As part of its forecasting process, the Corporation produces forecasts on a high, central and low scenario basis. The Corporation's forecasts for the period 1992-2012, published in June 1993, shows that on average over the 20 year period, total passenger movements are forecast to grow by 5.2% in the high scenario, 4% in the central scenario and 2.5% in the low scenario. While each of these scenarios is considered, the Corporation adopts the central scenario for financial planning purposes. The central scenario average growth rate of 4% per annum between 1992 and 2012 is the weighted average of the' international passenger movements forecast of 4.9%, the domestic passenger move Short Term Central Forecasts International pax growth rate Domestic pax growth rate (a) The forecasts show that total passenger movements at Sydney Airport will reach 30 million passengers per annum which, at the current time, is expected maximum passenger capacity of the airport between 2006/7 and 2011/12. However, the passenger capacity of Sydney Airport is subject to change, especially over a 20 year planning horizon due to changes in aircraft technology (such as the introduction of the 8777), changes in aircraft mix (8747-400's replacing 876Ts on some routes, 876Ts replacing 873Ts on other routes as traffic volumes rise), improvements in air traffic control technology and productivity and improvements in infrastructure (e.g. more rapid exit taxiways). (b) The Corporation is currently contracted to Commonwealth Government for a period of ten years (starting 1 April 1992) to construct and manage the facility at 8adgerys Creek and provide as a minimum, the works required as laid down in the lease. Following the Government's decision to accelerate the development of a major aircraft runway, the Corporation has been asked by the Minister for Transport to suspend the issuing of further contracts on the general aviation airport development. (4) The Department of Transport is responsible for the collation of air passenger statistics; however, figures quoted appear to be consistent with existing available statistics and approximated FAC forecasts. (5) The Corporation's forecasts are based on the results of modelling the relationship between passenger movements and a number of key variables. Those variables include the disposable incomes of potential passengers, the cost of travel, ments forecast of 3.6% and the regional passenger movements forecast of 1.0%. The central scenario average growth rate of 4 % per annum between 1992 and 2012 also masks changes in the growth rate over time. In the early years of the forecast period, passenger movements are forecast to grow at a faster rate than the average for the 20 year period and the forecasted growth rate declines towards the end of the period as the traffic base grows. The central scenario forecasts growth rates for internation.al and domestic passenger movements in the early part of the forecast period are shown in the table below. Rate of Change of Passenger Movements-Sydney Airport 93/4 % 94/5 % 95/6 % 96/7 % 5.7 5.8 5.8 5.6 5.5 5.3 4.2 5.1 prevailing exchange rates and the level of trade and economic activity. Changes in any of these variables over time may change the forecast rate of growth of passenger and aircraft movements. (6) At the current time, the Corporation can see no reason to change its forecast maximum capacity for Sydney Airport. Over time, however, airport capacities can vary quite substantially as discussed in response to part (3). (7) The Corporation publishes revised 20 year forecasts of passenger and aircraft movemen- on an annual basis. The last set of forecasts published were in June 1993 for the period )991/92 and 2011/12. Some preliminary forecasts of international passenger movements at Sydney Airport for the the period 1992/93 to 2012/13 were supplied in evidence to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Inquiry into the Sydney 2000 Olympics. These figures show that the central scenario forecast .average growth rate of international passenger movements at Sydney Airport between 1992/93 and 2012/13 would be 5.7%. This compares with the central scenario forecast average rate of growth of international passenger movements at Sydney Airport between 1991/92 and 2011/12 of 4.9%. This increase was largely due to the forecast improvements in the key economic variables. (8) lATA did publish ""International Traffic Forecast-Scheduled passengers 1993-1997"", (Published October 1993). This document predicts a growth rate of 7.5% for the period of 1993-1997 for international passengers only, for all Australian international airports. (a) No; however, lATA forecasts which are based on surveys of all airlines (noting that Qantas did not participate in the· survey) are accepted as being substantially valid for the purposes for which they are intended (Le. marketing targets rather forecasts). . (b) As the interpretation of the forecast appe-rs to be incorrect, no. conclusion regarding overall capacity at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport can be reached. (9) The Corporation does not have the power to transfer any traffic from Sydney Airport to Badgerys Creek Airport. Any passenger traffic that does transfer will do so because of the attractiveness otherwise of Badgerys Creek to passengers and/or because of pricing initiatives/incentives. (10) Yes. However, there are two other issues to consider. First, the Sydney Airport Draft Planning Strategy forecast was originally produced in 1990 prior to airline deregulation. Second, the forecasts in the Sydney Airport Draft Planning Strategy Supplement do not include movements by rotarywinged aircraft, which are included in the annual report figures, making the figures difficult to compare. (11) Yes. See response to part (10). (12) No. (13) Yes. The Draft Planning Strategy of 1990 states that ""A larger aircraft could operate at Sydney but only under special procedures as are currently being used for occasional large aircraft such as the Antonov ANI24, which has a wing span of 73m"". Subsequently, the Draft Planning Strategy Supplement of 1993 states"". . . that up to 5 New Larger Aircraft (NLA) gates may need to be accommodated at Sydney Airport at the end of the planning horizon"" and then describes how they can be accommodated. International Council of Monuments and . Sites (Question No. 1048) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 24 March 1994: (1) Does a representative of the International Council of Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) attend meetings of the World Heritage Committee in an advisory capacity.

245,Mr KEATING,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (11 I did receive the Honourable Member's letter. The delay, for which I apologise, was due to an oversight in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. (2) The Government affirms that human rights are both universal in application and indivisible in scope. It sees a dialogue on human rights as an important part of our bilateral relationship with all countries, including Vietnam. During my visit to Vietnam in April 1994, I raised with the Vietnamese Government specific cases of human rights concern. (3) The Government's approach has been to build a productive and broad-ranging relationship with Vietnam. The Government regards this as providing an effective and constructive context for addressing human rights issues. (4) Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet agreed, during his visit to Australia in May 1993, to the visit of an Australian parliamentary delegation to have a first hand look at the human rights situation. I confirmed arrangements for the visit of a Parliamentary Consultative Delegation during my visit to Vietnam in April 1994, the details of which were announced by my colleague, Senator Evans, on 5 May 1994. Unfortunately, the subsequent decision by the Vietnamese Government to deny a visa to one member of the delegation and scale back the delegation's program has made it necessary for us to decide not to proceed with the proposed visit at this time. Pensions: Effect of Un realised Capital Gains (Question No. 1078) Mr Nehl asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: (1) How many pensioners have lost (a) all or (b) part of their pensions administered by his Department as a result of the Government's treatment of unrealised capital gains as income and the calculation of rates of return on their investments for the purposes of the pensions income and assets test. (2) What is the net savings to his Department of the new provisions and the cancellation of part or all of the pensions. (3) How many extra staff have been required to implement the new provisions. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as fo]]ows: (l) The assessment of income using a rate of return which takes into account both changes in capital value on the investment and dividends or income distributions made over the previous 12 months applies to certain managed investments and listed shares. For managed investments, this approach applies to investments acquired after I January 1988 (for friendly society bonds) and 9 September 1988 (for market linked investments). In March 1993, the way in which the rate of return is determined changed in relation to market linked investments, with the rate of return assessable over the preceding 12 months being based oil the investment's actual performance and the 11 % ceiling rate of return removed. From 20 September 1993, similar rules were introduced for listed shares acquired after 18 August 1992. Since the above changes took effect, there have been quarterly bulk reassessments of the income earned by managed investments and listed shares acquired after 18 August 1992. These bulk reassessments resulted in the following changes for pensioners with such investments on the 6 January 1994 update: 43,850 or 62% of all cases with managed investments or shares had no change in their rate of payment. 15,000 or 21.5% of all cases with managed investments or shares received an average $4.00 increase; 11,650 or 16.5% of all cases with managed investments or shares received an average $7.30 reduction; 158 or 0.2% of all cases with managed investments or shares had their pensions cancelled with an average $30 pf reduction. Of these cases, some pensioners held managed investments only, some held shares only, arid some held both shares and managed investments. It is not possible to provide such a breakdown for the June 1993, September 1993 or March 1994 quarterly updates as the only figures obtainable include a range of pension and threshold indexation rises which mask the individual impact of managed investments and shares. It should be noted that a client whose pension is cancelled at one bulk update may be regranted before the next update and their rate amended because of that update. Also, a client whose rate decreases as a result of one bulk update may have a rate increase at the next bulk update because the overall currently - ed return on their managed investments and/or shares has decreased. (2) The estimated net savings from the application of the new rules referred to above are; for managed 'investments ifis. only possible to provide the overall effect of a package of proposals; some of considerable benefit to pensioners such as the offsetting of losses against profits: 1992-93-$.24m I 993-94-$.35m 1994-95-$.36m I 995-96-$.38m for shares (revised to allow for the new start date): 1992-93-$.(472)m 1993-94-$.(725)m 1994-95-$.(991)m 1995-96-$.(991 )m (3) Additional funds for staffing required to implement the new provisions was $87,000 in 1992/93. Ongoing funds are 40,000 per annum. Whistleblower Legislation (Question No. 1085) Mr Latham asked the Attorney-Generalupon notice, on 3 May 1994: Has he or his Department reviewed the effectiveness, of the whistleblower legislation before the Queensland and New South Wales Parliaments; if so, what plans and progress have been made to introduce similar legislation for the Australian Public Service.",196
246,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as fo]]ows: I am advised that my Department has not formally reviewed the effectiveness of the whistleblower legislation currently before the Queensland and New South Wales Parliaments, although it continues to monitor legislative developments relating to whistJeblowing in all Australian jurisdictions; The Government has been examining proposals for legislation to protect whistleblowers as part of its consideration of recommendations made by the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law (conducted by the Gibbs Committee) on the disclosure of official information. The question of . introducing such legislation is also being examined by the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, which is due to report by 30 June 1994 but which may be delayed into August due to the illness of Senator Newman. AFP Investigations: Emerald Area (Question No. 1112) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister· for Justice, upon notice, on 4 May 1994: (1) Is it a fact that following the presentation of a case to the Australian Federal Police (APP) by Mr Rod Barret of Emerald, Qld, Mr Barret has been advised that the case will not be investigated until another unassociated case is presented in the Emerald area; if so, is this normal procedu\-e. (2) When was the last case presented to the AFP in the Emerald area. (3) What is the time frame before a single case in a rural area is investigated. (4) What criteria are used to judge the priority of a case. (5) Who determines the criteria. (6) Will he investigate the matter referred to in part (1).",197
247,Mr KERR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The case in question relates to possible breaches of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 referred to the Austmlian Fedeml Police (AW) by the Director of Public Prosecutions Office in Brisbane, not by Mr Barret. The matter was given a medium to low priority when assessed by the APP. On 23 November 1993 Mr Barret was advised verbally that the investigation would be conducted when resources became available. (2) The last case presented in the Emerald area was in March 1993; however, the priority of that investigation did not allow the allocation of resources to the case in question. (3) The time frame for investigating rural area matters is dependent upon a number of factors, and can range from immediate in high priority matters to a delay in low priority matters. (4) The priority of a referral is assessed on AFP policy on investigating fraud and general crime on the Commonwealth. It is largely based on the evaluation of the AFP's capacity to respond, justification for applying police resources and the priority of other cases requiring attention. (5) The criteria are developed at a national level and applied by Branch management at Regional level. (6) The matter is in the hands of the AFP and will be investigated in accordance with its priorities. 1995 UN International Year for Tolerance (Question No. 1142) Mr Melham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 10 May 1994: (1) Did the UN General Assembly on 20 December 1993 unanimously resolve to (a) proclaim 1995 the UN Year for Tolemnce, (b) invite UNESCO to assume the role of lead organisation for the year and (c) request UNESCO to prepare adec1aration on tolerance. (2) In what ways is Australia (a) coopemting with UNESCO in preparing programs for the year and (b) implementing the activities to be organised within the framework of the year.

We are awaiting further details from UNESCO on the International Year for Tolerance before considering other activities to be organised during the year.

(3) The kits are being progressively distributed to secondary schools around Australia from ATO Branches. (4) The total cost of manufacturing and distributing the kits was $397,600. A break-up of this figure shows that $382,600 was spent on manufacturing and $15,000 was for distribution. This figure equates to approximately $53.00 per kit and includes contracting and consultancy fees for development, printing and production and market testing. (5) The total cost of the project involving the kit was $409,815. (6) The funding for the kit came from the Taxpayer Assistance Group and the Client Services and Processing Support Branch of the Revenue Collection Group within the Australian Taxation Office.

(2) What is the average proportion ofprogram participants who respond to the survey. (3) What proportion of the successful employment outcomes is directly attributable to the ATS JOBTRAIN - Preparatory JOBTRAIN-Other NA Job Clubs Special Intervention NA ATY TAP NA SkillShare NA (2) The Post Program Monitoring survey attempts to collect information from all former program partiCipants apart from those who have undertaken a JOBSTART placement where, given the large numbers of partiCipants, a 50% sample is used. The average proportion of responses from clients included in the survey in the year to end March 1994 was 70%, yielding outcomes estimates that are in general accurate to within plus or minus one percentage point. (3) Post Program Monitoring - urvey data provide no information on the causal link between program participation and unsubsidised employment outcomes. However, the issue of what role program intervention plays in relation to outcomes has been addressed in recent program evaluations. This has been done by measuring the net impact of the program. Measuring the net impact involves an assessment of the effect of program partiCipation on a person's chances of obtaining a job by comparing the outcomes of partiCipants with those of a comparable group of Commonwealth Employment Service clients who did not receive similar program assistance. The difference between the two sets of respondent's partiCipation in the program for which the respondent is being surveyed. (4) Has his Department conducted or commissioned 'any surveys 'or studies which' examine successful employment outcomes for periods longer than three months after program completion; if SO; what .were the findings. ' . Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ,. , (1) The most recently available post program data available are for the 12 months ending March 1994.. The proportions of program participants obtaining non-subsidised employment and .positive outcomes (an unsubsidised job or non-DEET education/training place) were as follows: Unsubsidised Employment % Positive Outcomes % 81.1 85.2 22.6 37:5 30.8 41:9 57.9 61.2 39.4 .48.9 16.8 43.3 33.9 43.2 26.9 39.7 38.3 43.7 32.9 64.1 30.8 42.2 35.2 4L2 outcomes is the 'net impact' of the program ,or the proportion of the program outcome that. can be attributed to the program intervention. Since 1991 the Department has conducted net impact studies using this methodology for. the JOBSTART, JOBTRAIN, SkillShare and Job Clubs programs. The net impacts of these programs were 30, 11, 12 and 11 percentage points respectively. (4) Evaluation studies have shown employment (including subsidised employment) outcomes six to eight months after program participation to be 60% for JOBSTART, 34% for JOBTRAIN, 36% for SkillShare and 44% for Job Clubs. At twelve months after program partiCipation outcomes data were collected in the. NElS andATS evaluations only. The evaluation of NEis showed that 54 % of former partiCipants wereiri self employment and a further 9% were in other employment. The evaluation of ATS showed that 87% of former partiCipants were in employment. At twenty-four months after program participation, employment outcomes data were collected in the ATS evaluation only. Some 87% of ATS participants were found to be in jobs.

(2) What specific measures have been taken in the processes referred to in part (I) to halt the use of tax file numbers to avoid Australia's laws on access to tertiary studies. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Tourists enter Australia on a visitor visa. As a condition of this visa, they are not permitted.to undertake full-time tertiary studies in Australia. However, they may undertake informal courses of up to three months' duration which do not lead to an award. DEET and OlEA liaise with education institutions to ensure they are aware of all regulations and visa categories with conditions relating access to formal education. DEET has recently sent to all higher education institutions the latest OlEA classification details on visas and entry permits, together with a reminder to verify the enrolment status of all students, particularly those who claim permanent resident status. DEET also provides information on changes in regulations and visa categories to State and Territory authorities sible for tertiary education institutions. (2) Tourists can apply for a tax file number (TFN) from the Australian Taxation Office if they provide proof of identity. They may have a legitimate reason for requiring a TFN. The onus rests on institutions to validate claims of permanent residencommunication cy/citizenship through checking passports and/or birth certificates. UN Human Rights Committee (Question No. 1227) Mr Melham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 1 June 1994: Did the Human Rights Committee bring to the Government's attention communications from individuals subject to Australian jurisdiction who claim to be victims of a violation by Australia of any of the rights set forth in the International Covenant on Civil and Political what dates, (b) which provision of the Covenant is Australia alleged to be violating and (c) which laws in Australia purport to implement the relevant provisions of the Covenant. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Australian Government has . been officially notified of nine complaints under the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. (a) The nine communications were transmitted to the Australian Government on the following dates: 14 May 1992 22 September 1992 29 April 1993 13 May 1993 14 May 1993 7 June 1993 29 November 1993 3 December 1993 4 May 1994 (b) Of the nine communications, three have been declared inadmissible by the United Nations Human to Rights Committee without reference to the Australian Government. Of the six remaining communications, three concern the criminal justice system, one is in the area of family law, one deals with the treatment of refugee applicants and the final complaint concerns the Tasmanian Criminal Code which makes consensual sexual contact between adult men in private a criminal offence. The responCommittee has made its final views known in relation to the last communication. The other five communications are still under consideration by the Committee. The Committee has made it clear that the procedure is confidential and that Governments must not make public comment on individual communications while they are still under consideration by the Committee. It is not therefore possible to go into any more detail on the individual complaints. (c) The rights set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are protected in Australia by a range of constitutional, legal and . administrative mechanisms. These include the basic institutions of a liberal democratic society-such as parliaments and an independent judicial system-as well as more specialised legislative and administrative arrangements such as those administered by the federal Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Rights; if so, (a) on Commission.

(2) What were the reasons for the Minister's action in each case referred to in part (1). (3) What criteria has the Minister established for deciding when to exercise ministerial discretion to waive the health requirements for entry by immigrants. Mr Baldwin-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I have exercised my powers of intervention on 10 occasions in respect of applicants failing to meet the health requirement. (2) Reasons for decisions in 6 of the cases have been tabled and are therefore available through the Table Office. Tabling of the reasons in respect to the other 4 cases is in progress. (3) Sections 115 and 137 of the Migration Act provide an intervention power where the Minister thinks that it is in the public interest to do so. The criteria established for this purpose are that: (i) the circumstances of the case are such that the Migration Regulations could· not have anticipated them; (ii) the consequences of not having recognised the circumstances in the Migration Regulations were clearly not intended; (iii) the applicant presents strong compassionate circumstances of such an order that failure to recognise them would result in irreparable harm and continuing hardship to an Australian citizen or lawful permanent resident aggrieved by the decision; and (iv) the applicant would bring substantial economic or cultural benefit to Australia. Rights of Students: Kit (Question No. 1237) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 2 June 1994: (1) Is it a fact that the Australian Youth Foundation financially supports the National Children's Affairs and Youth Law Centre. (2) Has his attention been drawn to (a) a kit for students produced by the National Children's and Youth Law Centre entitled ""Know your rights"" and (b) concerns that the kit focuses on students' rights at the expense of their responsibilities.

(4) Has the effect of the kit on discipline in Queensland schools been evaluated; if so, with what result. (5) Was the production of the kit funded directly or indirectly by the Commonwealth. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) (a) Yes and (b) Yes. (3) No. The kit clarifies student and teacher rights and responsibilities as well as school rules and common law. Student responsibilities are an integral part of the material in the kit. (4) No. My Department has no information to indicate that such an evaluation has been undertaken. (5) The kit was funded from the annual budget of the National Children's and Youth Law Centre, income for which is received from the Australian Youth Foundation, for a three year period, and is supplemented by practical support from two universities, a private law firm and the Public Interest Advocacy Centre; and supplementary support received from bodies associated with the legal profession. However, the Australian Youth Foundation's core funding is derived from Commonwealth funds. In the 1989-90 financial year, the Commonwealth, through the Australian Bicentennial Authority made a one-off payment of $13.4 million to the Bicentennial Youth Foundation, subsequently incorporated as the Australian Youth Foundation.

Industrial Relations Legislation (Question No. 1250) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon. notice, on 7 June 1994: (1) Did he state that Australian business groups were scaremongering about the unfair dismissal provisions in recently implemented industrial relations legislation and were worrying small business. (2) Has he proposed changes to the unfair dismissal provisions which will result in business proprietors paying salary for 6 months to unfairly dismissed award workers and $30,000 to non-award workers earning less than $60,000 per annum; if so, how will the changes address the concerns of small business proprietors.",210
254,Mr BRERETON,JOBSKILLS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) J stated on 18 May 1994 that the Opposition and some employer groups were scaremongering about the termination provisions introduced by the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 and that this had made small business, in particular, apprehensive about the new laws. (2) Following wide consultation with groups including the Business Council of Australia, small and medium sized employers and the ACTU, I announced the Government's intention to make a number of changes to the termination provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The decision to act was taken in direct response to some employers' views that the unfair dismissal Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor General Office of National Assessments Office of the Economic Planning Advisory Council Public Service Commission Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman Merit Protection and Review Agency Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies With the exception of ATSIC, the figures in column (a) are based on the amounts apportioned to the corporate services or equivalent program or sub-program of the agencies concerned. The provisions are an impediment to the employment of new staff. Contrary to the implication in the honourable member's question, the changes will not result in employers being required to pay 6 months salary to unfairly dismissed award workers and $30,000 to unfairly dismissed non-award workers whose wages are $60,000 per year or less. In fact, these will be the maximum amou.nts that the Industrial Relations Court will be able to award to an unfairly dismissed employee by way of. compensation, where reinstatement is impracticable. The 6 months salary limit is.similar to the limits applicable in New South Wales and Western Australia. The changes to the termination provisions will remove the uncertainty amongst some employers about the new minimum standards and give employers the confidence to take on new staff without the fear of their businesses being jeopardised by the threat of unduly large compensation payments. Corporate Services (Question No. 1254)",211
255,Mr COSTELLO,JOBSKILLS,"the· Prime Minister, upon notice, on 7 June 1994: What are the (a) cost of corporate services, (b) running costs and (c) percentage of corporate services costs to running costs for 1994-95 in each agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility.",211
256,Mr KEATING,JOBSKILLS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (b) (c) $5,930,230 $44,355,000 13.1 % $1,019,905 $6,976,000 14.6% $967,000 $6,307,000 15.3% $271,800 $2,132,000 12.7% $1,134,000 $16,327,000 6.9% $917,358 $7,428,000 12.4% $440,509 $5,482,000 8.0% $151,000 $692,000 21.8% $13,036,000 $131,595,000 9.9% $629,661 $4,788,808 13.1% method of apportionment and definition differs between agencies, depending in part on the extent to which corporate functions have been devolved and costed to other programs. Caution should therefore be exercised in comparing and interpreting such data. In respect of ATSIC the cost of corporate services comprises the following sub-programs of the Commission's Corporate Services Program: Executive Management; Finance; Human Resources; and the Commission Secretariat excluding the elected arm. Information in respect of the Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) is not available as the TSRA does not come into existence until 1 July 1994 and assumptions cannot be made about the level of resources that the TSRA wiIJ allocate to corporate services.

This has been split between corporate the Audit Business Units. Parties to Treaties (Question No. 1275) Mr Slipper asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 8 June 1994: Which other countries have (a) signed and (b) ratified each international (i) treaty, (iii) protocol and (iv) other agreement to which Australia became a signatory in each year since 1970-71. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided· the following answer to the honourable member's question: The honourable member's question relates to approximately 160 multilateral treaties, conventions, protocols and agreements which have been signed on behalf of successive Australian Governments since 1970-71. Each treaty, convention, protocol or agreement has been signed and/or ratified by up to 150 countries. This information is not readily available. To collect and assemble it would be a major task and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of the money and effort involved in performing the work. ANZ Bank Employment Advertisement Series (Question No. 1277) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training , upon notice, on 8 June 1994: (I) Is it a fact that the latest ANZ newspaper . jobs advertisement series shows that (a) the inin jobs advertisements has fallen to its lowest level since June 1993, (b) the rate of growth in the series has fallen from a peak of 4.5 per cent in October 1993 to 1.5 percent in May 1994 and (c) there have been seven consecutive months in the which the number of job advertisements has fallen. (2) Did the Government predict the creation of 250 000 jobs in 1994-95; if so, wiIJ this occur. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The May 1994 ANZ Bank Employment Advertisement Series released on 6 June 1994 showed that: (a) the rate of increase in the number of vacanfor cies in May 1994 was the smallest increase since June 1993. The series has, however, continued to rise since February .1992 to reach its post-recession services and high in May 1994. (b) the rate of growth of 1.5 per cent in May 1994 was lower than the most recent peak of 4.5 per cent in October 1993. However, the series is now 64.1 per cent above its recession low point in December 1991. Over the twelve months to May 1994 the level of vacancies increased by 43.8 per cent, the highest yearly rise since the recession. (c) No. The level of job advertisements has (ii) convention, continued to rise. (2) The 1994-95 Budget forecast a 3.0 per cent rise in employment over 1994-95. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer noted that this represents almost a quarter of a million jobs. This forecast appears to be achievable given the good prospects for economic growth over the 199495 finlmcial year: real GDP growth over the year to March. 1994 was around 5 per cent; company profit levels are high; inflation is at a very low level; real unit labour costs are expected to decline over the year; and economic activity in the major market economies is expected to rise. In addition, the White Paper on Employment has put forward a broad range of measures which will promote economic growth and assist the unemployed back into employment. Duty Free Goods (Question No. 1281) Mr Richard Evans asked the Minister representing the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, upon notice, on 8 June 1994: (1) Do customs regulations prohibit the taking of duty free goods on board ocean liners by overseas visitors leaving Australia; if so, why. (2) Are overseas visitors travelling by sea required to make duty free goods they have purchased available to ship's officers before the vessel departs Australia; if so, does this deter visitors buying duty free goods by necessitating their transport, often at the visitor's cost, to the port of departure for inspection, if necessary, by Customs officers. (3) What action will the Government take on the matter. Mr Lee-The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: . (1) Customs regulations do not prohibit the taking of duty free goods on board ocean liners by visitors leaving Australia. However, the proof-ofexport arrangements available for off-airport duty free sales to air travellers whereby the traveller receives the goods in a sealed bag for presentation beyond the Customs barrier are not available for sales to sea travellers. There are two reasons for this. The first is that there is no provision in the legislation for duty free goods to be delivered in sealed bags to sea travellers at the time of purchase. The second is that the arrangements for proof of export which are available for air travellers, that is, the ""plucking"" of invoices from sealed bags at airports by representatives of the duty free operators, are not able to be conveniently provided by the duty free operators at waterfront locations. The Government is planning to amend the legislation to permit use of the sealed bag system by sea travellers and will do so as soon as the amendments can be fitted into the legislative program. (2) In the meantime the arrangements for duty free sales to sea travellers necessarily require ""under bond"" movement whereby the duty free shop operator takes the goods from the shop and delivers them beyond the Customs barrier to the ship or wharf: The Government is aware that some differences have arisen between shipping operators and duty free operators over which organisation should have responsibility for delivery of the goods into the possession of the· traveller. This is essentially a matter which must be resolved between these bodies. The main concern of Government and Customs is to ensure that there is satisfactory proof of export; otherwise the duty free operator is liable for the duty concerned. ' In the case of travellers who intend departing Australia by sea and who make purchases other than at the city of departure, the goods would have to be transported by the shop operator to the port of departure. There apparently have been instances where duty free shop operators have not made sales to sea travellers in such circumstances because the from operator was not prepared to transport the purchases to the ship or wharf at the port of departure. (3) When the legislation is amended, duty free shop operators will have the choice of either delivering purchases to sea travellers in sealed bags and then plucking the associated invoices beyond the Customs barrier at the waterfront, or arranging delivery of the purchases to sea travellers after the traveller has passed the barrier. In either case the responsibility to establish proof of export will remain· firmly on the duty free operator; otherwise the operator must pay the duty concerned. Emeroo Station (Question No. 1282) Mr Wakelin asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 8 June 1994: (1) What are the details of all Commonwealth funding, including that provided through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), which has been .provided to Emeroo Station in the electoral division of Grey. (2) With what expectations, especially with respect to outcomes, did the Government and ATSIC provide the funding. (3) Have the expectations been met; if not, why not. MrTickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following information: (1) Emeroo has been provided with the following funding: Initial purchase, legal fees, stamp duty etc$888,768 Property Maintenance: 92/93-$41,638; 93/94-$44,423 (2) The funding was provided with the expectation that the community would run a sheep and cattle operation. Initially this would be done in conjunction with a Community Development Employment Project to be established on the property. (3) The expectations have not been met due to a dispute over traditional ownership of the property. However a comprehensive anthropologist's report was commissioned by ATSIC to determine which groups may legitimately claim to be traditional owners. This was completed in February 1994 and was made available to the three interested parties and the ATSIC Regional Council in March 1994. The findings of the report are currently under consideration.",212
