1,Mr DEAKIN,MOUNT KEMBLA COLLIERY,"Ballarat-Attorney-General - In view of the information ..which has reached us, I take the first opportunitythis morning to move, without not i c e That this House expresses its deep regret at the appalling disaster which has occurred in the Mount Kembla colliery, and its sympathy with the relatives pf those who have been killed or injured. The resolution is simplicity itself,' as probably befits any reference to such a catastrophe. It appears that tragic incidents of this kind are inseparable from coal-mining, one of the greatest industries upon this or any other continent, and that the resources of science .and the training of those engaged in the industry are alike unable to guard against awful sacrifices of human life, sudden and terrible. It is with the deepest regret that I submit this motion as some indication to those now suffering that their calamity has not passed unnoticed in this House, and that the representatives of Australia are all in sympathetic touch with them in their great affliction. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - This motion must necessarily appeal to every honourable member of this House, and to every member of the community. It is oue of the saddest features of our industrial life that men employed in mining and some - other avocations carry their lives in their hands in their daily operations, and arc occasionally stricken down, as these men have been, by an overwhelming disaster. We know that the men who work in mines , ure capable of performing deeds of quiet heroism. The facts are not always published, but if they were they would invariably justify our highest admiration. When we think of the domestic trouble caused by this lamentable disaster, must bleed for the unfortunate members of the families of tliose who have been stricken down. I second the motion.",14
2,Sir JOHN QUICK,MOUNT KEMBLA COLLIERY," A-As the representative of the great mining community - of Bendigo, I desire to express my fullest '.sympathy with the motion submitted by the Acting Prime Minister. In times past we have had very many mining accidents of a tragic and fearful character in Bendigo and other parts of Victoria, but never such an appalling disaster as this.' Perhaps never in the history of Australia has there been such a'dreadful wreck of human life, with jill the consequent prospective human misery. I desire to express my own sympathy and :that of the minors of Bendigo, and of Australia generally, and I trust that when .the proper time arrives everything possible will be done to lessen the misery resulting from this dreadful catastrophe, and that those who have been involved in suffering will have the hearty assistance and substantial support of the people of the Commonwealth.  representative of 'the district in .which this unfortunate accident has occurred, I desire to join with the Acting Prime Minister and those who have spoken to the motion, in expressing my sympathy with those who have afflicted. In my position as representative of the district, I knew many of the men who have been stricken down. Unfortunately some of the heroic men who attemptedto save the doomed miners have sacrificed their lives, among them being Major MCCabe, one of the leading men in the district. This odds to the very serious"" consequences of the disaster, and, I join with other members in expressing my sincere sympathy with those who have been overwhelmed with sorrow. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne)^-As one largely interested in an adjoining property, I feel that it would not be out of place on ray part to express my deepest sympathy with those who are suffering in consequence of the disaster. The sad loss of l if e ' anddisiocating of trade will be attended with disastrous consequences to the district, and,' so far as I am concerned, and the company with which I am connected, 'everything possible will, be done to our hearts help those who are suffering.",15
3,Mr WATSON,MOUNT KEMBLA COLLIERY," I think the Acting Prime Minister is to be complimented upon., having given the House an opportunity to express its feelings in regard to this disaster. I do not. suppose there are any of us who do not feel the deepest sympathy with all the relatives of the men who have been killed or injured. The disaster is, unfortunately, one of several that have occurred in New South Wales, and the only relief we can feel in the midst of the present trouble is afforded by the knowledge that some steps have been taken in the past to provide for such emergencies as that which has now arisen, and that relief will be afforded to thoso who are left behind. There is no necessity to say more than that we are all in sincere accord with the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative.",15
4,Mr DEAKIN,MOUNT KEMBLA COLLIERY,"May I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that you will be good enough, on behalfof the House, tp forward this resolution, by telegraph, to the Mayor of Wollongong.",15
5,Mr SPEAKER,MOUNT KEMBLA COLLIERY,I shall be happy to do so.,15
6,Mr OMALLEY,MOUNT KEMBLA COLLIERY,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether the Government will grant £10,000 or £15,000 towards assisting the families of the unfortunate victims. In the case of the disaster been at Mount Pelee the American Government voted £100,000 for the assistance of the sufferers.",15

20,Sir GEORGE TURNER,APPROPRIATION OP REVENU E,"The House pared was good enough to provide me with an advance of £50,000.

NA In Committee (Consideration resumed from 31st Jul}', vide page 14S05) : Clause 3The Governor General may authorize the ment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated for the purpose, of bonuses on the manufacture in Australia after the commencement of this Act of the goods specified in the schedule to this cording to the rates set out in the said schedule. private enterprise. Provided that no bonus shall be paid in respect of pig-iron, puddled bar iron, iron or steel pipes tubes, or steel, unless the same is manufactured in works operated by a State Government. Upon which Mr KINGSTON had moved, by ment way of amendment That all the words after the word ""schedule,"" line 7, be omitted,",17
21,Mr BROWN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S," When this matter was previously before the committee I spoke at some length, and I have no desire to traverse the ground which I then covered. Considering the inordinate length Bill 1 of the session and the urgency which exists for bringing it to a close, I regret that Government should have revived this Bill, especially when there are important measettlers sures awaiting consideration. To my mind legislative action in connection with this matter might very well have been deferred for the present, and a fair opportunity given to the States to decide whether or not they are prepared to embark upon the iron industry. Last night the Minister for Trade and Customs made a very general]}'-. impassioned address, from which I gathered that he is strongly in sympathy with the entertained by a number of honourable members that this industry ought to remeantime, ceive special attention at the hands of the a States Governments. Yet, because he has received a message from the States Premiers indicating that they are not preto immediately nationalize the work of iron production, he abandons his convicof tions and invites the committee to adopt the original proposition of the Government. the Minister realizes that lightning dischanges occur in politics, and that very been frequently a Government hostile to a carry measure today are its strong advoi n cates tomorrow. The honourable member for Bland instanced a number of such changes in the New South Wales Legislature, pointing out that^ important measures like the Old-Age Pensions Bill, and the Arbitration Bill, had been placed upon the statute-book through the instrumentality of men who had previously opposed them. I BILL. have in my mind a further instance. Just about twelve months ago I introduced to the present Premier of that State a representative deputation of farmers and settlers, paywho requested that legislation should be enacted to assist land-holders by making monetary advances. The Premier strongly opposed such a step, as an unnecessary and Act acunwise interference in the domain of Before the session or closed, however, he had evidently realized the error of his ways, seeing that he had introduced and passed through the Parliaa measure which practically gave effect to the views of the deputation. If the Bill under consideration be passed, and the same amount of pressure is brought to bear upon the New South Wales Government, I am convinced that history will repeat itself.",17
22,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member is referring to the Advances to Settlers',17
23,Mr BROWN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I am referring to the the Advances to. Settlers' Amendment Bill. The original Act provided for advances to in the drought-stricken areas only. But what I desire to emphasize is that, despite the unfavorable reply which the deputation received, the period for repaying loans has been extended from ten to 30 years, the maximum advance has been increased from £200 to £500, and the Bill has been made applicable to land-holders I claim that if any industry ought to be under the direct control of the State, it is the iron industry. I know that some gentlemen view such a doctrine with suspicion, because they regard it as an incursion into the domain of practical socialism. Their inconsistency, however, is evidenced by their admission that the'State ownership of the railways, telephone and telegraph systems, has been amply justified. This is an experiment upon similar lines, and I hold that the nationalization of the iron industry will be abundantly warranted by results. In support of that contention, I would point out that there is a great dissimilarity between the Australian States and other .communities, such as Canada and America. In those countries the railways, which are the largest consumers of iron, are in the hands of private enterprise. In launching upon the work of iron production, a State would be assisting its railways, which consideration furnishes an additional reason why the industry shou.ld be nationalized. Further, the iron industry is the mother of all others.",17
24,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,It is the backbone of most industries.,18
25,Mr BROAYN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Exactly . It is industry which, if handed over to a private company, will place that company in a posiand tion to dictate terms to every other industry. From the very outset, therefore, it should be placed upon the same footing as our railways, telegraphs, and telephones, I am surprised that, because of a little opposition from various States, the Minister for Trade and Customs should feel called upon to take his hand from the plough to look back. If he wishes to plough a straight furrow in connection with this matter, he must look forward. previous remarks upon this question I four stated that if I had to choose between granting this industry indirect assistance by means of the Tariff, and direct encourse couragement by the payment of a bonus, I 1,090,300 tons. should prefer the latter course. same time. I added that I would rather grant a bonus to the States' Governments tons. than to private enterprise. That is the attitude which I assumed, and pared to abide by it . But if the proposal to nationalize the iron industry is defeated, I ' shall not fight against assisting private enterprise in this particular direction, Although I shall endeavour to see that the interests of the taxpayer are properly guarded. In submitting this proposal the committee I claim that the Minister Trade and Customs has not supplied honourable members with sufficient information to warrant them intakingthe step which heasks. If this were merely a question of voting £250,000 for the assistance of some private company, it would lose some of its importance. AVe have to remember, however, that in order to raise the amount we shall have to impose additional taxation to the extent of £1,000,000; and, under the circumstances, the necessity for information and for thoroughly safeguarding the interests of the taxpayer is accentuated. Canada has, I suppose, experimented more extensively with the bonus system than has any other British community. The Dominion Government have followed different lines from those which have hitherto been adopted in Australia. The States here have directly undertaken the work of developing our natural resources by means of railway extension, harbour accommodation, and postal and telegraph conveniences, whereas the Canadian policy has been, to assist private enterprise by the granting of bonuses. AVe are invited by the Minister an to take Canada as our example in dealing with the establishment of the iron industry, he has quoted figures showing the great . development which has followed the application of the bonus system in that country. The Blyth River Iron Mining Company, who strongly urge the adoption of the bonus system, have circulated a reprint of an article from the Canadian Iron and Steel Industry Magazvne of May, 1902, and I and presume we may regard the statements therein as reliable. In that article it is stated that the number of blast-furnaces in In my Canada is about fourteen, and that there are in course of construction, and four more projected. It is estimated that the total capacity of the furnaces in existence and in of construction in Canada represents At the Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The total consumption in Canada last year was only 190,000",18
26,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,No ; that was the conI am presumption of pig iron only.,18
27,Mr BROW N,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"The production rose from 44,791 tons, in 1894, to 244,976 tons, in 1901, and, according to the article, the output of the Canadian furnaces is 22 per cent, of the capacity, as against 60 per safecent, in the case of the furnaces in the to United States. On a per capita basis the for production in the United States is four times that in Canada, the former being 475 lbs., and the latter 110 lbs. The writer of the article - strongly favours the bonus system, but he urges the very significant contention that a duty or bonus should be so framed as to be efficient in hard times as well as in good times. The true import of that statement is found in a table which shows theamounts which have been expended in bonuses in Canada. In 1884 the amount paid was 44,090 dollars, and every year shows a variation, until in 1891 the figure is 20,153 dollars. In 1901 the expenditure had increased to 351,259 dollars, showing that there have been periods of prosperity and periods of depression. is said about great benefits which result to wage-earners from the introduction of capital by means of the bonus system, and to hear the arguments usually advanced one would suppose that the wages fund was wholly drawn from capital. But the common experience of hard-headed, .. practical commercial men is that capital does not pay wages for any very lengthened period-that if wage-earners are not able to produce their own wage fund and a little over, an industry very quickly comes to a standstill, and the wage-earners have to seek elsewhere for employment which will enable them to provide the fund. mittee coimted.)",18
28,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHABN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"When that happens capital, as a rule, has gone also.",19
29,Mr BROWN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Capita l will not stay long where any very great demands are made on it, no matter what the industry or the ance granted may be. There is a further paragraph in the article, which I commend to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who is the high-priest of protection in Victoria. The .contention-of that honourable member when the TarifF was under review was that protective duties, whilst blocking importation, result in the decreasing the prices of commodities within the charmed circle on which its benefits are conferred. The article states that the Canadian mine owners have to face unfair competition at the hands of the American mine-owners, who are selling iron in Canada at 3 dollars per ton less than American consumers have to pay for the same article. Under the circumstances, it is contended that .. further assistance should be given, and in the Argus or Age of yesterday may be found a cable message stating that a new steel corporation has been founded in Canada for the purpose of meeting and resisting the competition. This corporation has a capital of £3,600,000, and it is to receive assistance from the Canadian Government by way of bonus to the extent of £1,000,000,"" with the further extraordinary concession of exemption from the federal taxation for twenty years. It is anticipated that by these means the mine-owners of Canada will be - able not only to meet the competition of the American mine-owners, but also to produce iron 30 per cent, cheaper than is possible in America. The bonus system in Canada has been in vogue for a number of years, and, as Much there has been fair opportunity to demonstrate its good as well as its bad qualities, the results should prove instructive when it is proposed that we should embark on a similar policy. It will be readily admitted, I think, that the Economist is a reliable and competent authority on politico-financial questions. In that publication of 3rd May this year there is an article from a Canadian correspondent on the subject of Canadian finances, and it appears that the Dominion Government, by way of loans which have been converted into subsidies, and by subscriptions for shares and subsidies direct, have expended (Com- 200,000,000 dollars, or about £40,000,000. An HONOBABLE MEMBER - On the iron industry ?",19
30,Mr BROWN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"No j on general subsidies, mainly on railway construction, waterways, and so forth. The provincial Governassist- ments of Canada have expended £6,600,000 in this direction, and the municipalities £3,600,000, or a total of £50,000,000, and this is in addition to other concessions. In connection with railway construction the Canadian Government, besides giving monetary assistance in the way of enormous subsidies, has given something like 50,000,000 acres of land to private companies in order to encourage and promote the construction of railways. The article says The St. Lawrence water route,-from the Great Lakes to Montreal and Quebec, has cost the 'Canadian taxpayer 100,000,000 dollars : and there are several other works in projection which will cost enormous sums of money. The article mentions these facts as showing the abuses that may arise under the bonus-giving system. It points out that subsidies have been given for the extension of these facilities on the ground of public services and advantages, and that the private companies.have controlled the works in their own special interest, so the communities affected have asked for construction of opposition lines for the purpose of getting a "" fair deal"" by roundabout method of competition. The Dominion Government are asked to subsibe dize the construction of those opposition lines, or to spend money in their construcwe tion. This must be admitted to be a wasteI f u l expenditure, which would have been avoided if the Canadian Government had followed the wiser and more enlightened System adopted in Australia of ""constructing lines of railway by the State and running not unreasonable. them in the public interest. The article the Economist goes on to say that-^The other day the New Brunswick Legislature wag only just prevented from guaranteeing bonds of a railway several years old, which been hawked about for sale since 1897, the being to benefit certain speculators. Then it goes on to refer to a matter should receive the serious attention: of this committee and of the Government, and is points out that the system of granting bonuses has had a demoralizing influence upon the political life of Canada. It has introduced a system of log-rolling, of watera ing stocks, and so forth. Perhaps I cannot do better than quote a short paragraph dealing with this particular phase in the words of the writer :It is scarcely necessary to suy that a good of corruption in Dominion, provincial, and cipal affairs is engendered by this system. Thesubsidy is almost always '' milked "" by the politicians who grant it, while the contractor, whose profit comes from construction, and sometimes, handling the bonds, takes care-of those, in of Parliament, wtjo may be disposed to question the wisdom of developing the country in fashion. It is only right to add, however, the best men on both sides of politics woulcl to see the whole business abandoned. tunately, the promoters and contractors have mode a great many people believe that subsidies are necessary to enable us to keep step in advancement with the United States, an arguformer ment which every census shows to be fallacious, and which at best is merely saying that it is ripht to do evil that good may come. Unfortunately our information on Canadian matters has hitherto been very limited, even though the Dominion is part of the great British Empire to which we belong. trust that the tendency of drawing all of the Empire together will have such influence that in the near future we shall know very much more of Canada tban has been the case in the past, and that Canada will know more of us. The article I have quoted seems to me to indicate grave reasons that why we should enter upon this system the of granting bonuses to private companies only with a great deal of care, and that we the should at least have sufficient information to indicate what are thedangers to avoided, and how best to safeguard the public expenditure under the policy to which are asked to commit the Commonwealth. intend strongly to oppose the Government in the proposal now submitted, and to endeavour to have the Bill passed in the form in which it was amended at the instance of the honourable member' for Bland. That is If the Bill be so in passed it will give an incentive to those States that like the idea of working their iron deposits to set to work in that directhe tion, and if they are unsuccessful no great had harm will have been done. I know that on object the Opposition side of the Chamber there are some honourable members who. are which altogether opposed to the granting of bonuses, and who believe that if an industry to be left to private enterprise at all, it should be left to it entirely. Some of those who voted for the proposal of the honourable member for Bland felt that if it comes to be question of choosing between bonuses to private enterprise, or to the States Governments, they'would prefer to leave the matter under the control of the Governments. But I understand that some of those honourable deal members are now inclined to question the muniwisdom of that course. I want them fairly to face this phase of the matter-whic h do they prefer, bonuses to private individuals too, by without restriction as set out in this or out Bill, or bonuses to the States Governments 1 this If they prefer the method of granting that bonuses to the States Governments they like should, even though they would prefer to Unforhave no bonuses whatever, stand by the vote tliey previously gave. I venture to material prophesy that if they go back upon their vote, the alternative course will be carried whether they like it or not.",19
31,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Northern Melbourne) It is lamentable that we should be coming to a dead-lock with regard to this measure, considering the very small line of demarcaI tion between the views of honourable memparts | bers, and the fact that the vast iman portance of the iron industry is generally j recognised. It is evident from the remarks of the last speaker that he recogI nises the iron industry to be a parent industry, one from which other industries branch, on which other industries lean, and which will give work and new re^ sources to the people of Australia for a time to come. Upon that point there is a general agreement; and I think also that there is a large majority in the House who ment is. I am. would like to see so valuable and so cardinal an industry in the hands of the State. They, recognise that it is not safe, i interests of the people, to leave dustry in the hands of private enterprise. I , at all events, am one of those who, rightly or wrongly, believe that. But although I may not see my way to the State taking tip the matter at the pretook sent time, I think it would be lamentwork able if the iron industry were not started. I do not think it will be started by a State Government. I should like, therefore, make a suggestion-that we should insert clause in the Bill to the effect that, bonuses be granted to any private company or firm, there shall be an option for the State to take over the industry at a valualearned tion to be fixed, upon giving a certain notice.",20
32,Mr SPENCE,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,A good method of putting difficulties in the way of the State doing the work!,21
33,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Nothin g of the sort. It would still oe open to a State to start the industry.,21
34,Mr SPENCE,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,An honourable member believes in the State engaging in the try should vote straight in that direction.,21
35,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Eac h one is entitled his own view. But there is this point to considered-that the State is not a good pioneer of industry. Nearly all industries are pioneered by private enterprise. selectors in the back-blocks made rough roads for their own purposes in the at first instance. You also find the tors establishing their own temporary offices. It is private enterprise that often erects the first schools, and so with nearly all the other requisites of civilized life. After private enterprise has established these things, the State comes along and puts them in order.",21
36,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,The State pioneered the railways in Australia.,21
37,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,I am not arguing against the honourable member's principle.,21
38,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Is the honourable learned member speaking on behalf of Government ?,21
39,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member for Macquarie, from his official position upon the opposition side of the Chamber, no long doubt knows whether the Government is in favour of this proposal or not. But it does not concern me whether or not the Govern",21
40,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,The honourable and learned member took up a similar position n the for the Government in regard to the Gosuch an invernor-General's allowances.,21
41,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I do not know what the Governor General has to do with iron ore. I think it would be an advantage to the particular State of the Commonwealth which tip this industry if the pioneering were done by private enterprise. It is like the case of the shark and the pilot fish. The pilot fish comes along and to nibbles at a piece of meat, and then the a shark-if I may compare the State to the if shark - puts in an appearance, drives the pilot fish away, and takes the food.",21
42,Mr THOMAS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Does the honourable and member think that the iron industry would be run by business men or philanthropists ?,21
43,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"By business men. I ever recognise that men would not take up an industry unless they hoped to make money out of it. Honourable members will perhaps recollect that I suggested an alteration in one of the clauses, to .the effect who that any company or body of persons induswho obtained the bonus should do so subject to certain terms with regard to the to wages and hours and conditions of labour be of its employees. I think that there might also be a Specific provision in the Bill to the effect that no bonus shall be paid to The any company or persons except upon the condition that a State may buy them out a valuation to be settled by arbitration, selecand upon a basis which has yet to be postthought out. The pioneering work would then be done by private profit-seekers, and in the course of a few years, when the States Governments had become more amenable to reason, as I hope they will be, we should be able to compel them to take over the industry and to work it upon lines which experience might dictate. In our present financial system it would not be advisable for a State to enter into a huge enterprise of this kind. It would be like enterand ing into an unknown country. Let the the country first be explored and tested. There is a great advantage in giving a bonus. If we give a bonus we know exactly how much we are spending; we know what we can afford to lose, and we have no care, no worry, and no responsibility. But if a State should be the first to enter upon the establishment of the iron industry, it would have to work a most difficult undertaking under unknown conditions. I would not presume to say how far the industry would succeed in Australia for some years ; having regard to the conditions operating in America, and in Canada, particularly, I would not say how far it might not be undercut from outside. Until private enterprise has clone the exploration work, I should not like to see any State enter into a business which might involve a great many incidental calls upon the public purse. I think it is a dangerous thing. I .say this hoping, at the same time, that in the course of a few years the business will be carried on by one of the States. I should much prefer it to be conducted by the Commonwealth than by any of the individual States, but that cannot be done.",21
44,Mr THOMAS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Why not ?,22
45,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Because the Constitution will not allow it .,22
46,Mr THOMAS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"We were told in South Wales that the Constitution could be amended in the easiest possible manner. I admit that the honourable and learned member did not say so. ,",22
47,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"That is the old story. We have to deal with existing facts and make the best of what I might call a bad job. The next best thing to the establishment of the industry by the Commonwealth is that it should be taken up by one of the States, and a State would enter upon it to the greatest advantage at a time when it could profit by the experience of the private profit-seeker. I have never known an industry to be taken up by the State which bad not previously been tested by private profit-seekers. The State often fails, but when it does succeed, it succeeds always in cases in which it has followed the experience of the private profit-seeker. W it h all respect to the honourable member for Bland, I think that those who are advocating the immediate thrusting of the iron industry into the control of the State are the enemies of the State working of monopolies. This is a monopolistic industry, but it is a mistake to desire the States to set the ball rolling. We cannot get the State to work with its cumbrous machinery until we have had the experience of men who commeaca operations for the mere purpose of profit ",22
48,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,The railways were new when the State took them up here.,22
49,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"That is a very different thing, but we had private railways in Victoria. The first railway in Victoria was constructed by private enterprise.",22
50,Mr TCDOK,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I am informed that the first line constructed in Victoria was that running from Melbourne to Williamstown, and that it was built b j the State.",22
51,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"W p had the Hobson's Bay line, and also the Geelong to Melbourne railway was built by a private company. All that I am putting is that in view of the tremendous movements to control the output of iron and rails in America and elsewhere, it is impossible.for us to foresee how the iron industry will succeed here. There are men who are willing to risk their capital in it , provided that they have a chance of making reasonable profits.",22
52,Mr THOMAS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Would they enter upon it with the certainty that their works would be taken from them if they established them New successfully ?,22
53,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"That is a mere question affecting the conditions to be imposed. I think the honourable member is quite right in saying that a man who believed it possible that if he successful^ established an industry it would be taken from him, would be chary in entering upon it . But if we provide conditions which will show those who may think of entering upon the industry that they will not be robbed of the fruits of their labours, they will be far more likely to take it up. It is for this reason that I still adhere to the view which I took when the committee last divided upon this question, and I shall certainly vote for the excision of the proviso. I voted on a former occasion for a modified excision of the words, but that proposal was not accepted. I should still vote for it if it were proposed, but it is not. A compromise has been suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that no bonus should be paid to any private company or individual for a period of two years, in order that the States might have time to take up the industry. That proposition was not accepted. I should be willing, although with regret, to adopt it . I prefer to see the proviso omitted, so as to leave the industry to private enterprise in the first instance, and when that had done the pioneer work, to enable a State to take it up.",22
54,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S," I have listened with some surprise to the peculiar proposition for encouraging the iron industry, which has been made by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. His proposal is that a bonus of £250,000 shall be given to private in every dividuals.",23
55,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,That is not so.,23
56,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"j-The proposal is, I suppose, that the Bill should be passed, as the Minister desires, in a shape providing for a bonus of £250,000 to be paid'to private individuals who enter upon the iron industry, and that at some period subsequent'to the payment of that bonus a State should take up the industry. Presumably the honourable and learned member proposes that the State shall take it up only if it is a success. If it is a failure, the State is carefully to-let it alone. If the honourable and learned member's proposal were carried out it ' would mean that private individuals would be induced to establish the industry by their own enterprise and perhaps at considerable loss, the State contributing £250,000 to make good that loss. But as soon as they had proved that the industry could be successfully carried on the State would say to them-""We will take your property, work it ourselves, and annex the profits.""",23
57,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,At a fair valuation.,23
58,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Tak e it, I presume, on payment for the works and land. An y one who enters upon such an industry does not look to the profits of the first few years to recoup him. He looks to their continuance for an indefinite period-to the accumulated profits for his return.",23
59,Mr FOWLER,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,We should have to recompense them accordingly.,23
60,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Of course. If the honourable and learned member means that on taking over the works the State should pay the owners a sum representing not merely the money expended upon them and 10 per' cent, as compensation for resumption, but an amount based upon the anticipated profits for a considerable number of years, I do not think it would be a good thing for the State to entertain. On the other hand, if a State could take over the property on paying merely an additional 10 per cent, for resumption, surely it would be impossible to find any individual so simple as to enter into the industry.",23
61,Mr HIGGINS,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,The honourable member's argument is against all option to purchase.,23
62,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,If it is desired to establish the iron industry it cannot be well done with an option to purchase.,23
63,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Indee d it can. Nearly Act authorizing the construction of a private railway Or tramway gives to the Government or local authority the right to purchase it after a certain time.,23
64,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,After a considerable number of years.,23
65,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,That is so ; but I do not understand that the suggestion here is that it should be done at once.,23
66,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,There is far more trouble in establishing an iron industry than in constructing a railway or a tramway.,23
67,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Regulation s could deal with question of terms.,23
68,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I suppose the Minister is favourable to this proposal, as he is defending it 1",23
69,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,r favour anything which asks for a fair protection of the State.,23
70,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"We are beginning to see that this proposal is made under the wing of the Government. If the Minister anticipates starting an iron industry under these conditions, I am very much afraid that he will be disappointed. I was rather amused at his touching references to his belief in a State iron industry, and his regret that no State had seen fit to undertake its establishment. He says that a month ago that he hoped, and fervently believed, that some State might embark in this enterprise, and for that reason he accepted with delight the amendment which he now resists.",23
71,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I did not say anything of the sort. Considering that I divided against the amendment, how could I have accepted it with delight?",23
72,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"That is what the members of the committee understood. The Minister read the refusals of the States almost with tears in his eyes; and it is very astonishing that he resisted the proposal previously, and is resisting it today. He also spoke very touchingly, and no doubt truly, as to the great importance of the iron industry. But what does his proposal mean ? Does it recognise the importance of the iron I industry ? It says that this large industry I can be established by giving a bonus of £250,000, and that it will not be created, whatever its prospects may be, without that gift. It is too big an industry by the offer of that bonus. If there is a profitable outlet for the enterprise, not for the first'few years, but during the-course of many years-if investors can be convinced in that respect-the y will not wait for a bonus of £250,000. If no profitable outlook is promised, no such sum will induce them legitimately to embark in the enterprise. If they do, it will be done simply order to get hold of' that £250,000. They will float some concern on the markets of the world where the facts are not so well known as they may be to themselves, with the object of annexing the bonus, and the premium which will attach to flotation, owing to the gift of the bonus, and leave the company thus established to its fate. Either the bonus is not sufficient to induce the starting of the industry unless otherwise it can be a success, or the Minister means at a subsequent period to propose an additional bonus or duty if it is not successfully established. The Minister has .given a glowing picture of the growth of the iron industry in Canada, but what are the facts? Before the bonus was given Canada manufactured 36 per cent, of her own requirements in iron. What has been the result since the bonus was-given? Further bonuses have been asked for, higher duties have been requested, and today not a paltry £250,000, but millions are required to support this industry, which is said to have been so thoroughly established by the bonus system. Surely the Minister was unfortunate when he went to Canada for an example to us. Everything which is feared here has occurred there, and some of us feel that the course of embarking in this giving of bonuses in connection with the iron industry will be attended with the same objectionable results as have occurred in Canada. In this case the Minister proposes to impose protective duties after the cessation of the bonus. It is not the bonus itself only that we have to deal with. Even under the Ministerial proposal there are to follow protective duties, which, we may feel certain, will not stand at the moderate level at which they are proposed, if the industry demands higher ones. Having brought into existence this bantling, it litis to be supported at all hazards. It must be brought to manhood if possible, and the State will be asked to do it .",23
73,Mr MAUGER,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"The duties will be as high as necessity demands, and as low as circumto be affected stances permit.",24
74,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Her e is a candid admission by the honourable member. We know what demands we had in other directions when we were framing the Tariff. But what arethe demands likely to be in connection with the iron industry ? I am against the giving of any bonuses. I am asked to vote to give a bonus to a State. in How can I legitimately and consistently give such a vote, especially as I am more opposed to a bonus being offered to a State than to its being thrown open for the acceptanceof all ? A strong objection to this assistance to industries is that it creates an opportunity to levy taxation from the people. Under a bonus, without coming duties, that cannot be done, I admit, to the same extent as can be done under .protective duties. In this case protective duties are to follow, whether a State or a private person takes up the industry, and those duties rise with the necessity. My objection, and that of other free-traders who think with me, to that is that it creates an opportunity for taxation being drawn from the people of the State, or if that opportunity does not exist, because the duty is not sufficiently high to exclude competition by the outside world, then every industry, and every other consumer of its product is made to pay for the support of the producers. That is the position, and it is not relieved because the bonus is given to a State; in fact, it is intensified. If a State establishes the industry, and it cannot compete easily with the outside world, it will get what it demands, to enable the continuance of the competition with the outside world. There will be a tax, levied on the consumers of the material.",24
75,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,A State can pull less strings than a private syndicate in that connection.,24
76,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I do not say that, a State would endeavour to get all the profits which a duty, if too high, would allow.",24
77,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"As regards getting an increased bonus, or an increased duty, a private enterprise syndicate will pull more strings'than a State can do.",24
78,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I believe that the honourable member is right in that respect, Only I think that the State would have more weight in the getting of the help. If the State is to do outside business, apart from meeting its own requirements, it will demand, and probably will get, this higher duty, which will handicap the other industries of the Commonwealth, because pf the prices which will have to be paid for the material it produces. As regards what it uses in its own departments-and that represents a very large proportion of the total consumption-eve n if . it costs 50 per cent, more than the article could be imported for, the State will use the product of its industry, and' will make the people at large pay the extra prices, and thus support all those engaged in its production. That I consider is a national loss. Holding that opinion I cannot depart from my objection to vote for a bonus to a State. At the present stage there is really no question of a State industry versus a private industry. Any State, if it likes, can start an iron industry tomorrow.  private enterprise also.",24
79,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Unde r private enterprise also. ,25
80,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Unles s it is intended ss a means of getting something immediately by the flotation of a company which the company would have no light to get, scattered an industry like the iron industry, which should run through the ages, £250,000 is a mere nothing. If the industry would not start without the bonus, it would not start with it . If the industry will start without the bonus, and it will if the opportunity is there, then it should not be given. Surely no State needs a bonus of £250,000 ? What a farce to offer that sum to the States ! Cannot the poorest and the weakest of the States find £250,000? Tasmania could raise that sum tomorrow if she wanted it, and so could any other State in the Commonwealth. From that aspect, the whole thing is ridiculous. There is nothing that may be put into this cr any Bill which will prevent any State, if it wishes, from embarking in the iron industry. For that reason also I do not see my way to support the giving of a bonus to the States. Then we . liave this other question- although it is a most important one, the Minister has given us no information-ho w will it affect our financial position ? If have to provide £100,000 a year for the payment of these bonuses, and if we are going, as the House has expressed its desire' that we should, to pay out of revenue much which hitherto has been paid out of loan account, where are we to get this sum of £100,000 a year from? Are we to raise £400,000 or £500,000 in order to provide for it ? If not, we should have some indication from Ministers regarding ways and means. The Loan Bill has not yet been passed, and may not be, and the Governmentshould be able to tell us how they propose to find the money. In the interests of the industry itself, and of our own financial position, it would be infinitely better for the Ministry to allow this proposal to stand over for the present. The members of the labour party have expressed themselves against giving bonuses to private individuals.",25
81,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"No , not all of us. We are all in favour of giving the preference to the States.",25
82,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"--Some of us, including myself, are against giving bonuses to private individuals.",25
83,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"So am I , but others are not.",25
84,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member for Bland said yesterday that such a strong feeling existed in New South Wales in favour of the Government establishing over the iron industry that, if some agitation were made, the Ministry would probably enter upon the industry before many months were over. If the view of the honourable member is correct, we had better, from his point of view, reject the Bill, and leave the States to take their own course. Mr BROWN. - Thos e who favour the .establishment of State iron works in New South Wales say that we shall assist them if we pass this Bill.",25
85,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"If this Bill were passed, the States Governments would probably not have the same opportunities of establishing the iron industry as would be afforded in the absence of federal legislation. The honourable member for Canobolas was wrong in stating that, if honourable members on this side of the Chamber supported the Government in excising the. provision for bonuses to the States, there was only one way to do it .",25
86,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"If the Bill is passed in we its present shape it will assist in the establishment of State iron works in New South Wales, because the Government of that State will then be able to obtain assistance from the other States.",25
87,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Does the honourable member suppose that a bonus of £250,000 is likely to influence the Government of New South Wales ? That State could raise ten times £250,000 if it desired to establish the iron industry. I intend to vote against bonuses in any form. I sball vote against this clause, and I trust that the Bill defeated. I am satisfied that by granting bonuses, either to the States Governments or to private individuals, we shall enter upon a policy the end of which we cannot see. The Commonwealth will be dragged into giving more and more support to any industry that may be created upon such a false basis. I look upon the proposal to grant £250,000 as worse than a scheme involving an outlay of £1,000,000.' If it were proposed to spend the larger sum we might look upon that as ending the matter, but a grant of £250,000 will simply introduce the thin end of the wedge. If the industry were started under that bonus we should have appeals for further assitance made to us within a very short time. We should be asked not to destroy that which we had created, for which the future held out great hopes of prosperity. A bonus of £250,000 would be a mere drop in the ocean. We must not look to the expenditure of a year or two in connection with such an enterprise, but to an outlay extending over decades. If the opportunity presents itself the iron industry will be established upon asound basis, and undersuch conditions that those engaged in other industries will not be required to contribute to its support, and consumers will not have to pay more for what they require. The industry will then grow with the progress of the Commonwealth, and may even, by means of an export trade, bring wealth to our shores from other parte of the world.",26
88,Mr SPENCE,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S," I listened with great interest to the reason which the Minister gave for asking honourable members to reverse the decision previously arrived at. Although the right honourable gentleman spoke with great earnestness, and stated that he had the most convincing proof of the necessity for restoring the Bill to its original form, the facts adduced by him seemed to me to constitute the strongest arguments against his proposal. The information received from Canada proved that large sums of money had been spent by the Dominion Government, and that the ironworks had greatly increased their output, but, at the same time, we find that those engaged in the enterprise are still crying out for more assistance, and that there is no perceptible end to their demands. There are any number of men who will produce anything in the Commonwealth if the Government will, pay them to do so. The will be reports quoted by the Minister indicate that there are such dangers connected with the bonus system as should frighten every honourable member. I do not think that the reports from Canada had much to do with the desire of the Government to restore the Bill to its original form. I should be sorry to say that the lobbying which has been going on for some time past had anything to'do with their action ; but the fact that some honourable members have changed their opinionhas, nodoubt, largely influenced tbem. They have been relying upon the count of noses rather than upon the figures from Canada. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne made a most extraordinary proposal. He evidently thinks that a heavy loss will be incurred in connection with the establishment of ironworks. He, therefore, suggests that a handsomebonus should be granted to induce some one to undertake the experiment, his idea being that the State should, in the event of success, take over the works. Is it likely that the Government will be able to take over the industry unless they pay the firm for any loss which it has incurred ? Would it not be a great deal safer for the State itself to find the money necessary to embark upon the undertaking ? The party with which I am associated are prepared to stir up public opinion upon this matter in New South Wales if the Bill in its present form becomes law. At the scmo time, we have just cause of complaint against the Minister'for Trade and Customs. When the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Bland was carried, we accepted his assurance that the Opposition had not succeeded in killing the'Bill, and that the Government intended to proceed with it . It is a very big strain upon our faith, therefore, to find the Minister now attempting to reverse the decision arrived at by the committee, and it is misleading to the section with which we are associated. The replies received by the Minister from the States Governments are just what might have been expected. But despite the statement of the Premier of New South Wales, I hold that if the Bill passes in its present form he will be unable to resist the pressure of public opinion that will be brought to bear, and will be compelled to embark upon this industry. At the present time, however, he can excuse Government inaction by the plea that he has no assurance that the Bill will pass both Houses of this Parliament. As the honourable member for Bland has pointed out, past experience teaches that the States Governments will never enter upon any large undertaking until they are forced to do 50 by public opinion. In effect, the proposal of the Minister for Trade and Customs is to borrow money from one set of British capitalists for the purpose of advancing it to another. ""We know that syndicates are always ready to secure privileges, which they dispose of to a large - company, which they receive a big share. In mining circles these individualsare known as ""first robbers."" If the industry does not pay-they close down the works, and deputations wait upon-the Government pleading for further assistance, either by way of the payment of an increased bonus or the imposition of a higher duty, so that they may put money into their own pockets. Honourable members are practically asked to allow themselves to be used as mere tools for the benefit of a few capitalists in Great Britain. Even if the proposal of the Minister is assented to, we have not the slightest guarantee that the iron industry will be established by private enterprise. This is a question in which the labour party has taken a very keen interest for a considerable time, and I unhesitatingly say that the action of the Minister is calculated to defeat his own wishes. It is all very well to argue that none of the States Governments will embark upon this industry. But I would point out that New South Wales has a sufficient surplus income to engage in it even without any artificial aid. I venture to say that, if the Bill be carried in its present form, within a year or two one of the States will nationalize the industry. . Mr KINGSTON - The Government offered £0 confine the Bil l to the"" States Governments for two years, but the party to which the honourable member belongs would not Agree to the proposal.",26
89,Mr SPENCE,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Syndicator s do not care twopence whether or not the iron industry becomes established so long, as they can attack somebody's pouketSi There is always something rotten, associated with appeals to the Government to aid private enterprise: The whole principle is a bad one. There is absolutely no justification for offering thisbonus at such an early stage in our federal history. At the present time we have not a penny to spare. We cannot get a telephone wire put across a street, at a cost of30s., 'because there is no money available, and yet it is proposed to offer private individuals £320,000 to engage in these industries. I do not like the look of this proposal, and I protest against the lobbying which has been going on within the precincts of this House.' We had. enough of that in connection with the Tariff proposals. If only, a man and a boy are engaged in au industry they can get almost in anything for which they choose to ask from this Government. Of course lobbyists do not worry me, because my views upon this question are well known. Since I have occupied a seat in this Parliament I have been astonished to find prominent labour men interviewing honourable members on behalf of the British capitalist. To what istlie country coming when we witness that sort of thing? The time seems to be rapidly approaching, when we shall have to frame a standing order for the purpose ofpreventinglobbying. When I see honourable membersprofessing certain principlesand deliberately placing, obstacles in the way of the realization of those principles, there-is a big strain on my belief in their sincerity. The honourable member for North, Sydney, and others-who think with him, had better be careful or they will fail to accomplish the object they have in view. There are many who believe in the bonus system, and many who are opposed to it , and the voting will be somewhat mixed ; but I sincerely hope the committee will adhere to the previous decision. If the States fail to take the matter up"" there will always be the opportunity for the Government to carry out their desire to encourage private enterprise. No doubt we have all. received the circular to which reference, has already been made, and from the statements therein we can see that, the drift in Canada is in the direction of monopoly. In Australia it is clear there would be a monopoly; practically, from the start; and that meansthat the Government would give away money which it had no right to give away, and the country would ultimately suffer. To resume the industry at some future time would prove a most costly and stupid method. It is idle to speak of experiment in connection with one of the oldest dustries in the world ; and the Government would be able to employ experts with much or more easethan could anyprivate company. We have the ""United States, say it does. England, and Canada, from which to select men of experience, and they would more tralia readily work for a Government than for corporations who are not always the most satisfying of employers. Experiments in the iron industry have already been made elsewhere, and scientists could easily apply,at a comparatively trifling cost, any tests which might appear necessary. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Mel1883 bourne) - The honourable member for Darling seems to have very great faith in State trol, but he cannot have looked at the statissystem; tics which show the result of the management of Government railways and tramways.

93,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"The right honourable member is dealing in the old country. In Australia there will be a sad state of affairs when we find State socialism creeping in and taking control enterprises, and especially an enterprise like the iron industry. The honourable member for North Sydney referred to iron manufacture in Canada prior to the granting of the bonuses, but he said nothing about the crease in the export of iron from that country. In 1892 the export of' pig-iron from Canada was only 3 tons, whereas in 1901 it was 5,623 tons, and in the first eight months of the present financial year reached the enormous figure of 6S.669 tons, valued at 661,000 dollars. The increase iover 60,000 tons in eight months is, I conintend, entirely due to the bonus.",28

95,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,I dare,28
96,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,But all those in Auswho are interested in the sugar industry are. opposed to the continental bonuses.,28
97,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,That is because those interested in the sugar industry desire to look after themselves. In Queensland we had a very good example of the effect of rejecting a proposal for granting what was equal to a bonus. In the Government of the State proposed to arrange for the construction of a transconcontinental railway on the land-grant but the idea was so strongly opposed by the combination of pastoralists n and the labour party that the Government,28

That is an instance which should-be seriously considered in connection with the Bill before us. I do not.say that the State should not by have the right to acquire any ironworks which may Le erected. In granting any concession, the State should reserve the to come in at the expiration of some with tramways period and purchase",28
100,Mr SPENCE,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Fro m that point of view, the honourable member ought to vote against of all the proposal of the Government.",28
101,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I shall not vote against the proposal of the Government, but I should not object to vote for such a period being allowed as to insure that inthose who start the works will be recouped for losses which will necessarily occur at the commencement of a venture of this nature. It would be ridiculous, however, to compel a company to sell to the Government at an it advance of 10 per cent, at the end of, perhaps, four or five years, just when the works of were beginning to pay, after losses had been incurred. Personally, I should rather see the Bill carried as now proposed, because its scope can be broadened at any time to enable the Government to step in and purchase. While I should not like to see the Bill lost because a provision of that kind was not inserted, still I prefer that it should not be inserted now. Frequent reference has been made by the honourable member for .Darling to the necessity which has arisen for further assistance to the Canadian iron industry : but surely that honourable member has not looked carefully at the telegrams which have appeared in the press. The Government of Canada have seen that American combinations are likely to get control of the shipping between Canada and Great Britain, and, as would be done here in similar circumstances, it has been decided to contribute a bonus of £1,000,000, and give twenty years' exemption from wharfage and other charges in order to retain communication with the old country. The object is not to bolster up the iron industry, but to retain the present growing trade. Mr .SPENCE.^-Where is the difference the taxpayer 1",28

106,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I assist have no objection to the Government taking the works over if necessity arises; but the honourable member for Bland contends that there should be no possibility of private enterprise. As I have said, I prefer that any provision as to purchase by the State should be omitted, but rather than see the industry thrown back as railway enterprise was in Queensland, I am prepared to accept the measure with a clause to that effect. I shall support the Government proposal.  question is not one of private enterprise' versus State control, but whether we ought, as a Parliament, to assist private enterprise to the extent of a quarter of a million, and thus enable a syndicate to float a company. We have had a varied experience of such concessions, aud I look on this as one of the most serious proposals of the kind which ever emanated from a Government. I am astonished to find the Minister for Trade and Customs fighting for the Bill, because hitherto I have recognised him as one who believed thoroughly in State control of large enterprises which come within the category of monopolies. The bonus will not be claimed by more than two companies, who will very soon be .able to so arrange matters as to avoid competition.",29
107,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"In Canada there are eight companies. to Mr KINGSTON - There are many more : than eight companies in Canada.  ber for Melbourne is a thorough believer in private enterprise, but we have had some very startling experience of State concessions, of which he knows something. This offer of £250,000 will enable a syndicate to t is appeal to British capitalists.",29
108,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"It is not an offer of £250,000, but an offer of 12s. a ton.  £250,000, which will enable a syndicate to call in the aid of British capitalists and distinguished gentlemen in fixing up a very nice prospectus. A number of free shares will be given to those gentlemen, and when the company is started these shares, as is frequently done, will be unloaded on an unsuspecting public. When the enterprise collapses the public will have the shares, and the other people will have the money. Is it a proper thing for this Parliament to people to do that sort of thing 1 It has been done in Queensland and in other places several times. What experience have we had of private enterprise in South Australia recently 1 The Minister for Trade and Customs knows how much it was against his wish that the streets of Adelaide were given over to certain peisons ior the purpose of constructing privatelyand owned tramways - AVe were told that the enterprise would lead to opening avenues of work for the unemployed. Those who opposed the scheme were told that it was cruel to those who were out of to offer opposition to the benevolent men who intended to spend half-a-million of onone}' straight away upon the construction - of the tramway system. Hundreds of the working classes supported the scheme, cause they thought it meant more work them. But what is the position today? The working classes have not had a penny out of it . Having secured the cession, the promoters are hawking it about - in England for the purpose.of promoting company. It is more than three years since these promoters said that they had the capital, and that everything was ready to - commence operations. All they wanted was the legislation to permit of the work done. But all they have done up to the present has been to have a few loads stone broken. The latest information we have is that one of the principals is drawexpressing ing up elaborate plans, which are to be mitted to English investors. In the meanelection, time no extra work has been found for the (unemployed, and there is no guarantee that any will be found. What this Parliament is now asked to do is to sanction the giving - of £250,000 by way of bonuses at the of 12s. a ton for the production of pig-iron. 'That will be a great inducement for pany promoters to parcel out shares as they have done on many occasions for their own benefit. So many free shares will be allotted, and so many to the promoters. Look what has been done at Chillagoe. - Mr Mahon - Who gets the free shares ?  .working man. At Chillagoe, where a big concession was granted, I venture to say that the people today rue that the claim was ever taken in hand.",29
109,Mr FOWLER,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Is that the kind of private - enterprise that was referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne ?  Tefer to anything of a personal character connection with the matter, but the circumtime stances in regard to Chillagoe are well known to Victorians, who are acquainted with the scathing references that appeared in the press a little while ago.",30
110,Mr MCCAY,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Is there not a difference between concessions in return for promises 42 c payment for work done? In this case'""' no company would receive payment until up new they had done the work.  payment is concerned, I agree that it would work be possible to get money from the English public, and afterwards the promoters could sell out and leave the public with so much waste paper. It would be possible to get capital from the English public befor any reasonable proposal by showing for that the promoters have a guarantee from the Government of a bonus of 12s. a ton, or £250,000 as a maximum - That is cona big lever to assist any one who goes to the English capitalist for money. I do not a know why there should be such a hurry about this matter. The proposal was never put before the electors in a concrete form. They were never told that Parliament was to be asked tovote£250,000 of the taxpayers'money being for such a purpose. The subject was not mentioned in the Governor General's speech. of Why should the matter not be allowed to stand over until the people have a chance of their opinions about it ? In less subthan eighteen months there will be a general when eveiy constituency throughout the Cdhimonwealth will have an opportunity to say whether it favours giving £250,000 to private enterprise for the purpose of carrying on the iron industry, or whether it is in favour rate of the States undertaking the work themselves. We are in the position of not knowcoming exactly where we are in regard to our finances. The Loan Bill has,been laid aside. - A number of works that used to be undertaken by the States out of loan money are at now to be paid for out of revenue. AVe t also know that the revenue of some of the States is not as buoyant as we should like it be. The result is that some of the States, in consequence of the action of this Parliament, will suffer a loss of revenue. In South Australia there has been a serious loss of revenue through the shrinkage of the railway receipts. I do not wish to be' a croaker, but we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that, in consequence of the drought and othercauses, this country has aveiy dark in outlook before it. There has never been a when the pinch was so serious as it is just now, and as it probably will be during the next twelve months. The revenue of the Commonwealth from customs and excise must be materially affected. In face of these facts, the Minister will be wise to allow the mat^ ter to stand over until after the next general - ejection. In the meantime, if any of the States 'wish to undertake iron works they can do so. At present the States have had no chance to express their opinion adequately. It is true that the Minister has read letters showing that some of the States do not intend to embark upon such an enterprise, but there are often changes of opinion in connection with such matters. There is no one in this House who is more sincere in regard to the State undertaking works than is the Minister for Trade and Customs. He has taken strong action in regard to the nationalization of works in South Australia. Therefore, I cannot understand why he is so anxious that private enterprise should undertake the iron industry, which comes within the category of works that ought to be controlled by the State. In any case, the manufacture of iron in this Commonwealth must be a monopoly.",30
111,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"How does the honourable ' member define monopoly in this connection  more than a couple of such works will started in any case, a'nd the tendency for the two companies not to compete against each other. If they are of equal strength, they will soOn arrive at an agreemerft; if one company is stronger than the other, the weaker one will have to go down.",31
112,Mr MCCAY,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Will not - the monopoly position be equally applicable to any one State that undertakes the work ? What to prevent one State from squeezing the of the States of the Commonwealth ?  a State would not work for the purpose of earning dividends on watered In-conclusion, I would remind the Minister of the somewhat chequered career of the Bill. ' If it had not been for the casting vote of Mr Speaker the measure would have been referred to a select committee. That is very striking evidence that House is very much divided upon the question whether the industry should be it while this provision remained. - controlled by the State or private enterunderstand prise subsidized in the way proposed. Since then we have had a series of discusare sions on the Bill, and opinion is apparently almost equally divided in regard to whether now is the proper time to .proceed with the project. In . view of all these circumwould stances, I - think the Minister would do well to allow the Bill to go to a select committee. If it were possible for an' amendment now to be tabled to refer seriousness to a select committee the whole question of what the undertaking should be, I shouldvote for it in preference to allowing the bonus to be paid as proposed by the Government. If the Minister persists in dividing the committee on the Bill as it stands, without giving us any information of what further proposal he has to bring, forward, I shall certainly vote as before for the retention of the proviso' inserted by the honourable member for Bland.",31
113,Mr A MCLEAN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S," Honor able members will remember that when the Bill was last before us, I was one of those who, whilst they could not see their way tovote against it , as they were deeply impressed with the importance of establishing; the industry, thought that the Government should have withheld the proposal until they were prepared to submit fuller particulars to Farliament, to enableus to deal with it in the light of the fullest ? information. The clause now before us that proposes that the industry shall be be a State monopoly, and I am afraidwill be. some honourable members may not have weighed fully what the consequences would be if it were carried. I am as favourably and disposed towards the establishment of the industry by the State as is any honourable member, and I should be very pleased indeed to see it taken up by one of the States. But if we pass the Bill in its preis sent form, and the industry is not taken rest up by any of the States' Governmentsas I believe it will not be-the effect will to shut out private enterprise altogether.",31
114,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"It would give notice of shares. a powerful competitor. ' Mr A., MCLEAN - There would be the possibility not only of a powerful competitor against any private enterprise, but of a State as a competitor assisted by a bonus. Several persons who are interested in the the iron industry have assured me that not one shilling would be invested in I can the attitude of those honourable members who, upon principle, opposed to bonuses, but nevertheless may be very favourable to the establishment of the industry by private enterprise. That is a consistent attitude to adopt, but I point out that the retention of theproviso in this clause would shut out the possibility of private enterprise. Privateindividuals would recognise at once the of 'embarking their capital in the industry, when there was a prospectof a State Government, assisted by a large Government bonus, entering into competition with them.",31
115,Mr SPENCE,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,That is an argument that the industry would be a monopoly.,32
116,Mr A MCLEAN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"It has nothing to do with the question of monopoly. If my honourable friend were a member of a private company which proposed to invest several hundred thousand pounds in the industry, he would surely object to the adoption of that course if he believed that the Government of any State, supported by a Government bonus, was likely to enter into competition with it . A private company would be placed at such a disadvantage that it would not be likely to enter upon t/he work. I would rather see the Bill lost than passed with this proviso in it , because I believe it would have the effect of effectually shutting out private enterprise. I would ask those honourable members who are opposed to the payment of a bonus in any shape or form, but who are friendly to the establishment of the industry by private enterprise to give that aspect of the case careful consideration. It was very strongly impressed upon me by gentlemen w ho are interested in this industry that ; they would not invest one shilling of their capital in it if the measure were placed upon the statute-book in its present form.",32
117,Mr FOWLER,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S," There are two aspects of this subject for which I am unable to find any satisfactory explanation in my own mind, nor have I obtained it from any honourable member. In the first place, I cannot understand the reason for the haste shown by the Minister in charge of the Bill. I cannot see any great national calamity behind the possibility that this project may be set aside for a little while until we see how we stand financially. I apprehend that we have been doing fairly well in obtaining our supplies of iron from the cheapest markets of the world, and while I should certainly like to see the industry established in Australia, I am not so foolish as to imagine that it could be entered upon either by private individuals or by any State without a careful scrutiny of all the circumstances, and on the very best consideration from an expert and financial point of view was likely to prove 'successful. I can understand that certain gentlemen who have' been perambulating about a part 42 c 2 of this building which is supposed to be set apart for the use of honourable members should regard this matter as an urgent one. A sum of £250,000 is not to be sneezed at in these times, and if they could manage to impress the capitalists of the world of the advantage of doing something to acquire that sum the result would be sufficient to justify any exertion which they might have put forth. The second difficulty which I have is in regard to the position taken up by many honourable members, who, while professing a great admiration for a certain principle-in this case the organization of the industry upon a State or Commonwealth basis-ar e prepared to put aside that principle because they do not think it possible forthwith to carry it into effect. It is a position worthy of an Australian aboriginal or a Hottentot, that men professing to be statesmen should be so destitute of patience and foresight that, for the sake of atemporary advantage, they are willing to allow a condition of things to be established in Australia for all time, which will mean that the heritage of the people of the country has been given away for a mess of pottage. The position taken up by such honourable members is analogous to the lack of foresight shown by the most degraded savages on the face of the earth, who if they obtain a meal today will gorge themselves to repletion without any thought of tomorrow. We are told by the Minister for Trade and Customs that he wishes to secure employment to the workers of the Commonwealth. He is so anxious about that matter, that he' is prepared to hand over one of our great national resources to the handful of energetic gentlemen with whom we have become so familiar during the last week or two. The Minister must be aware of the circumstances which have made a lack of employment so common throughout almost the whole of Australia. He must recognise that it is because the natural resources of the country, to a very large extent, have been secured- in many cases by means which will not bear investigation-by a handful of people, and that those people entrenched behind the laws of the various States are able to utilize these resources in a way detrimental to the welfare of the community. On the'face of it , it .is absolutely preposterous that there should be' this lack of employment on an immense continent so thinly populated as this is ; but, because of it, we are asked to take another step in the same direction. I exceedingly regret that such a number of enthusiastic supporters of the principle of State socialism are prepared to put it aside upon the pitiful excuses that we have heard both today and last night. I am reminded that not very long ago the Government sought permission to raise a loan, to enable them to carry out public works which would give a vast amount of employment. The sum which they are prepared to throw at the heads of these syndicators represents about one-half of what they desired to .borrow for Government works. If they would reconsider the matter, and expend this amount in improving the telephonic service, and in carrying out other works, they would obviate to a very large extent the unemployed difficulty in several of our large centres. The honourable member for North Sydney wished us to understand that, as a rule, State industries were.to some extent a tax on .the general community, inasmuch as they were not prepared to market their product on a commercial basis.",32
118,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I said that a bonus, if it encouraged a State to embark in the industry, might cause a heavier taxation of the people than would be the case if a private person did, because it would always use its own product no matter what the cost might be.",33
119,Mr FOWLER,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Amongs t persons who have not given the subject bf the nationalization and municipalization of industries very much attention, it is a common impression that the""se are expensive luxuries, and the honourable member for Melbourne was very emphatic on that point as regards railways and other matters. An y one who takes the trouble to consult up-to-date authorities-and numerous works on the subject have been issued of late years - will find a mass of information which proves conclusively that national and municipal industries can be carried on absolutely on a commercial basis. Speaking as a convinced socialist, I assert most unhesitatingly that socialism as a principle, stands or falls by the necessities of everyday life. I have no doubt that the ordinary impression is that socialists are very unreasonable people, but if any holder of that view will take the trouble to read up a little on the subject he will find not only that they are reasonable, but that some of the best master-minds of the world are on their side. Just before I rose to speak I was referring to the current number of the North American Review, which contains an article, not by one of those wild, hair-brained socialists, but by a sedate professor of political economy in Berlin University, on the national debts of the world, dealing - particularly with the public debt of Prussia.",33
120,Mr CROUCH,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,How does the honourable member know that he is not a socialist 1,33
121,Mr FOWLER,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Whil e it is just possible that he is a socialist, still he is a man of such standing that I think very few honourable members would care to cast a stone at him. In this article he is enthusiastic in pointing out the advantages to the Kingdom of Prussia from the adoption of State socialism as regards its railways and other national industries, and he makes out a wonderful case for the adoption of the principle which might be worth the consideration of the Minister for Trade and Customs. At the. present time, with the development of commercialism which is taking place, there is no difference between a State industry and a large private industry so far as general management goes. At one time it was argued that a private industry had always the direct supervision of those who were specially interested in its success. But at the present time the position of the shareholders in many of the large industries of the world, in respect of the management, is quite as impersonal as is that of the people of a State. As regards the management of the iron industry in Australia, the proposals of the syndicate are practically on all fours with those which would emanate from a State, or possibly, from the Commonwealth-, if the constitutional difficulty were overcome. The first step would be the provision of a certain capital, and the next step would be the appointment of a manager, who would act in precisely the same way, whether he was representing a State or a private individual. I feel sure that if it is sufficiently attractive to a private company to embark in this industry under these conditions, the State after a little more hesitation, perhaps, and a little more inquiry, will be perfectly prepared to do so. All I ask for is that necessary interval to enable the State to institute the inquiry which the people naturally expect. As regards the possibilities of the industry, even the Minister is in absolute ignorance. It is at present in the clouds. He is not certain whether it can be made a commercial success or not. Under such circumstances, there should be appointed a commission which would be able to put such information before the States and before private individuals as would furnish some basis to go upon, and. if its report were favourable to the establishment of the industry within the Commonwealth, it would afford to the Minister, who is anxious for the nationalization of such industries, a splendid opportunity for going to the people of the Commonwealth and asking them to alter the Constitution in the direction of enabling the Government to take up the work. Surely that is a prospect which ought to have some attraction for him. Mi"". KINGSTON - On e would think that \ was groping after something to do, as if I had not plenty already to do. . Mr FOWLER, - The Minister has al ways such a vast amount of superfluous energy that anything which is likely, in his opinion, to tend to the welfare of the people of his State, or of the Commonwealth generally, will have his best attention, and command his - best work. I hope that as the result of the division a little more time will be given to the States to consider, where they stand, and to the people of Australia to develop the ideals of national progress, as a good many of us understand them, and that is to give the population of the country the full advantages of its own national resources.",33
122,Mr CROUCH,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S," When , on a previous occasion, I attacked what I regarded as a socialistic addition to the clause, I was the only member of the committee who then took up the position of an individualist, and I am very glad indeed to learn, in the course of this discussion, that I.have received support from quarters whence I did not expect it to come, and whence, certainly, it did not come on that occasion. I believe that if the committee could vote free from party influences there would be a majority in favour of the institution of a bonus, I also believe that if one section of the committee could be excluded, both the main. Ministerial side and the main Opposition side would vote in favour of stopping this proposal to introduce socialism. When the honourable member for Perth expressed his surprise that a professor of political economy in Berlin University should be a socialist, he gave perhaps the strongest argument against socialism which has yet been given here. When I asked whether a professor was a socialist, the honourable member said that he was a professor of political economy, and he seemed to think that that was a clinching answer to my question. I am ready to accept his deduction, and to state that no man who is a sound political economist could be a socialist. I take it that the great difficulty, in regard to the position which has been attempted to be taken up by certain honourable members, is that the State which owned the works would feel that it was its duty to give the best terms it could to its own constituents; it would not act impartially to the whole Commonwealth. The duty of a State, as a State, is to look after its constituents who pay the taxes. For instance, if Tasmania or New South Wales were to spend public money in addition to the bonus of £250,000 in establishing ironworks, are we to expect that it would treat equally with its own people the inhabitants of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia, who wished to use its iron 1 The people who were taxed to support an iron industry would certainly expect to receive more advantages than the people of other States. If a State establishes the iron industry, it will not be able to confine its attention to the smelting of iron, but will have to carry on smithies and foundries. It cannot go backwards, but must continually extend its bounds. To institute this State industry necessarily means the extension to all industries. The most forcible argument against this socialistic proposal is to be found in the fact that every enterprise upon which the State enters involves an increase in the cost of administration and of production.",34
123,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,What about the railways 1,34
124,Mr CROUCH,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"The effect of State control of the railways in Australia has been to largely increase the cost, not only to those who use them, but also to the general body of citizens. If the users do not pay it in fares, they do in the additional taxation which the deficit brings.",34
125,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,How about the Silverton Tramway ?,34
126,Mr CROUCH,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Migh t I refer the honourable member for Bland to the statement recently made by the Honourable J. H . Gordon, Attorney-General for South Australia, when speaking recently with regard to tenders received for /the construction of locomotives. He saidThere seemed to him to be something wrong when, for ten locomotives, Martin and Co..could tender at £45,280, or £13,309 less than the from the Government mechanical engineer. He believed Martin and Go. paid the same scale of wages, so the enormous difference in the tender - suggested that they got more out of the men for the money.",34
127,Mr FOWLER,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"They are making railway carriages at Newport cheaper and better than those constructed by private manufacturers. - Mr CROUCH - If the honourable member had read the evidence given in the case of Speight v. Synie he would know that the cost of constructing engines and carriages at the Newport works is outrageously high, - and largely in excess of the prices charged at the Phoenix foundry at Ballarat, or at the Sandhurst carriage works. The honourable member might also have read reports in the newspapers to the effect that between £400,000 and £500,000 worth of material which had been taken into account by the railway department as an asset, is about to be destroyed as useless or sold as out of date. Any honourable member - who compares the results obtained under the Government control of manufactures - with those achieved under private management must admit that the cost in the former case is excessively large. The effect of establishing ironworks under Government control would be to largely increase the cost of iron, and this w.ould affect nearly every industry in the Commonwealth-in some cases, even to the point of disaster. When it is remembered that every industry in Australia is dependent upon the use of iron or machinery in one form or another,-the position becomes critical if the original cost of the iron is largely increased. No industry can possibly succeed unless it is placed under proper control. If the aspirations of the members of the labour party are realized, the ironworks established here will be under the dual control of the Commonwealth and State, - because the Commonwealth will have to satisfy itself that the bonus is being properly applied. We shall, therefore, have a control of the very worse description, - namely, that of Parliament. This must prove ineffective, because both the States and Commonwealth Parliaments are already - overworked and will not be able to give to the industry the close attention and economical management essential to - success. Therefore, it must either fail,-- or involve such heavy expense as. to make the operations utterly unprofitable. So far as the tender State control of the railways and the post-office is concerned, I hold that anything that can be done properly by individuals should be left to private enterprise, and that in all other cases the work should be carried out by municipalities if possible, or if not by municipalities, by the State.",35
128,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,That is rank socialism.,35
129,Mr CROUCH,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"If the honourable member agrees with that view he must admit that his amendment should be struck out, because he has not proved that individuals cannot effectively carry on the manufacture of iron.",35
130,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,I say that they cannot do it as effectively as the State.,35
131,Mr CROUCH,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member has not quoted any instance in which a Government has taken up the iron industry, and therefore his statement is in the nature of a prophesy rather than an argument. The railways and post-office stand upon a footing altogether different from that occupied by the iron industry, but I am sorry that the States Governments have taken over the railways to work them. They should rather allow private enterprise to have control; and take a fair share of the profits. I believe that they could make a profitout of the railways by leasing tbem. The political management of our railways has been so inefficient that efforts have been made in almost every State to remove them from political control, by appointing commissioners. Some reference has been made to the feeling regarding this Bill in New South Wales. I might point out that the Age of 21st July contained the following telegram from Sydney :The Carcour Municipal Council has adopted a motion to the effect that the action of the Federal Parliament in amending the Bonus Bill and making it applicable only to the States as manufacturers is one tending to the destruction of the iron industry, and in order to insure the industry being developed, the Federal Government be requested to reconsider the proposal, with the view of extending the bonus only to manufacturers of iron made from Australian ore. All the municipal councils of the State are to be asked to cooperate with the Carcoar council in bringing the matter before the Federal Parliament. The Council of the Chamber of Commerce of Melbourne, on 22nd July, passed the following resolution - That this council, while not expressing any opinion as to the wisdom or otherwise of giving bonuses, records its strong objection to confining their operation to the States alone, believing that they should be open to all members of the community. The Argus of 31st July contained the following telegraphic message from Sydney :In the Legislative Assembly today, replying to Mr Ferguson, the Premier (Sir John See) said that he hud written to the Federal Government, saying that the establishment of steel and iron works was a matter for private enterprise. This Government was not in a position to undertake the responsibility of establishing these works. The Government could not see its way to do anything of the kind. At the same time he would be glad if the Federal Government offered a bonus in connection with steel and iron works, because he felt that they would be established in this State. These expressions of opinion from New South Wales should have some influence upon the honourable mernber for Bland. . Mr WATSON - No . It is because I know those who uttered them that I am not influenced.",35
132,Mr CROUCH,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"The recent committee of - the House of Commons, which was appointed to consider the question of the State purchase of cables, and which was composed of men holding the very highest positions in English politics, passed a resolution upon very much the same lines as the anti-socialistic arguments which I have used during this discussion. They point outThat the State does not obtain favourable, - terms for the transfer of property to itself, and that when the transfer is made there is constant pressure for an increase of the wages of the ing staff and for an indefinite reduction in These objections would not be fatal if. it were established that submarine cables would be more - efficiently managed by the State than by private companies, but no serious attempt litis been made - to prove this point, and we ourselves are decidedly of a contrary opinion. If ironworks were established under State control, an agitation would very probably be raised with a view to securing a reduction in the prices charged to consumers, and if this proved successful, the whole of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth would be called upon to pay taxes in perpetuity in order to keep the industry going. I hope the committee will support the Government, .so that the industry may be established nnder the control of persons who are able to carry it on without imposing too heavy a burden upon the taxpayers, and who from, the experience of the past and the teachings of history best make it effective, permanent, and successful.",36
133,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I have been somewhat surprised to hear some of the observations made by honourable members, but as I desire that a division shall be taken as early as possible, I do not intend to do more than briefly refer to them. [Committee counted.] I have been taunted with professing a desire to see the iron industry 'established by the States, whilst refusing to afford the necessary facilities. If honourable members give the matter the slightest consideration, they must come to the conclusion that those taunts are entirely undeserved. From first to last, there has been an endeavour on the part of the Government to give the States every reasonable opportunity to embark upon this enterprise, if they choose to do so. In connection with the Tariff, we introduced Division VIA . , without any express provision in regard to the States. A suggestion was then made that it would be a proper thing to extend its operation-to them. We introduced the necessary words without any demur, and, therefore, our intention was perfectly clear from the beginning. Further, when the matter was previously under consideration, it was put that the States Governments ought to be given a preference over private individuals. Believing in that policy then-as I do now-bu t holding that there were doubts as to whether any State would nationalize this industry, I contended that we ought not to confine the payment of the bonus to the States for all time. Accordingly, I moved to limit the exclusive right work- of the States to the bonus for a couple of rates. years. In taking that action, I was surely doing what was reasonable and liberal under the circumstances. At first those who pleaded the cause of the States sought for a shorter period; but just as we gave way the term was enlarged. Finally, however, they refused to be satisfied with any limitation, and desired to expressly 'provide that at no time should private individuals be permitted to share in the benefits conferred by this Bill. When we were asked to concede that we were asked to concede too much. If the iron industry is to be nationalized, surely two years is a reasonable period to allow of the States taking some action in that direction. I hold that a considerable advantage would be gained by limiting the exclusive right of the States to the bonus, in that it would operate as a stimulus to action, and thus induce an early settlement of the question, to the benefit of all concerned. Therefore, the charge of inconsistency which has been levelled against the Government in connection with their declared preference for the States undertaking the work is not justified by the facts. This is not an ordinary unsentiment dertaking. The question is whether money shall be given to private individuals for purpose of carrying on a certain enterprise that is beneficial to the community, whether the work shall be undertaken by the State itself. No doubt, it is right that we should give a preference to the States over a private company ; but at the same time the claim of any State, which is only a component part of the Commonwealth, to the benefit of the whole of the federal expendiThe ture in this direction is not so great be that of the Commonwealth itself. We see what are the probabilities. The Commanufactures monwealth has no power to undertake this work. We recognise that New South Wales - Parliamentbotli possesses a larger claim to preference over private enterprise than any other State, though not so great a claim as Commonwealth itself.

134,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Does the Minister accept their views upon free-trade? - Mr KINGSTON - Accep t them ?. I pose there is a possibility of accepting their views with reference to New South Wales upon the question of free-trade ? It has always been suggested that they are the the exponents of New South Wales opinion generally.. How do they speak upon a or matter of this sort ?,37
135,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"They opposed compulsory education, early closing, and every other reform.",37
136,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"And I had the honour of proposing those reforms a long time ago. Sydney Morning Herald, in writingas would upon this question, saysPreparatory to re-submitting the Bill to aid by a bonus, and particularly iron manufactures, certain steps have been ' taken, by the Cabinet, and by *others, to guide in coming to a decision. After discussing the matter, that organ that of the sums up as follows :In our own State, which is directly interested in any proposal affecting the iron industry, the of Sir John See expresses what we believe to be the opinion of the great majority of those competent to form a responsible judgment upon the The Telegraph writes in a similar strain. It . The Premier of New South Wales, the State possesses the most favourable opportunities for establishing and successfully carrying out. the industry, replies that after fully considering theI question, the Government is of opinion that ironworks, and works of a kindred character, ""should be carried out by private enterprise than by the Government of the State."" it is seen that the questions submitted by Federal Government have received replies that are riot wanting in definiteiiess or decision. The amendment - has already extinguished the of works being carried on by private this or enterprise.* Perhaps the language employed in that connection is a trifle too strong. At any rate, let us hope for the best. The Bill has notyet finally emerged from committee. The faithfully Telegraph continues- The provision intended to give help and stimulus to the iron industry has assumed a shape makes the industry impossible. It is apthat a serious mistake has been made. It to be seen whether, while there is yet the error will be corrected, before still more mischief has been done. is ,So far as any State in the Commonwealth can speak, every State has spoken through its mouthpiece, its constitutional representatives, the Government. They tell us in plain terms that they are not prepared to supact. Concerning New South Wales, we find the Government sayftig not only that they are not prepared to act, but that they believe in the Bill as we originally introduced it . They affirm that the establishment of the iron industry is a matter for private enterprise, and they are supported in that contention by the two great .representative journals of the metropolis. Under such circumstances, however desirable it may be to induce the States to a contrary conclusion, there is nothing which would warrant ns in embodying within the four corners of the Bill a provision that there shall be no hope of help to any one else for all time. We are perfectly prepared,-as we were previously,-to limit the preferential right of the States by prescribing a fair time within which they must commence operations. Some little amusement was caused by our approval of the provision suggested to the committee by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. I wish to tell honourable members that we. are prepared to do anything that we reasonably can, or ought to be asked, for the protection of State interests in connection with matters of this sort. We know the inconveniences which ma}' possibly arise. We realise that large monopolies may be created. We know further how at different times Parliament attaches various conditions to the granting of privileges. It was suggested by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, .who was simply carrying out a proposal of which the honourable memberforMelbournePorts had given notice, that there should be a right of purchase attached to the grant of the concessions conferred by this Bill- a right on the part of the Government to acquire the works and industry upon certain terms. That suggestion was laughed at by some, who urged that it would be infinitely absurd for the State to give to certain individuals a right to start an industry, and immediately it proved to be a success, to take it away from them. Nobody suggested anything of the sort. In South Australia. I know there are very few instances in which special concessions are granted without a rigbt-of-purchase condition being attached to them ; but, of course, it is not a condition c which enables a State to wrongfully deprive a man of that which his own enterprise has created. I venture to suggest that for years past no Bill authorizing the constiuction of a tramway or electric work has received the assent of the South Australian Legislature which has not had attached to it the condition that after the lapse cf a certain period, during which the promoters could obtain a reward for their enterprise, there should be a right of purchase by those chiefly interested-eitherthelocalauthorities or the Government-at a fair rate, and on a valuation to be determined by arbitration. There is much to be said for the contention that a condition of that sort should be attached. I hold in my hand a volume containing the latest South Australian legislation, and I find attached to the permission to the Broken Hill Company to construct a railway to the Iron Knob the condition that the Governor and the Railway Commissioner may at any time purchase the lease, with all the buildings, rolling-stock, plant, and jetties and other works, the price not to exceed the cost of such railway, with a fair deduction, to be determined, in case of difference, under the Arbitration Act. In an Electric Light Act passed in the same State there is the condition that at any time within three months of the expiration of three years after the passing of the Act, and at any time within three months of the expiration of any succeeding two years, the local authority may purchase at a price to be fixed by arbitration.",37
137,Sir JOHN QUICK,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Thos e are cases where the granting power reserves the right to resume.,38
138,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Thos e are cases where the grantor attaches as a condition the right to resume the works and all connected therewith after a lapse of time, on such terms as shall give a fair opportunity for profit earning, and shall not deprive the grantee of one penny to which he is fairly entitled. And so, as regards this proposed bonus of £250,000 for the encouragement of the iron industry. We may reserve to the Government the right, after an interval to be specified, and on terms fair to both the Government and the individual, to acquire the industry and plant: Of course, all details will have to be considered if such a proposal is made, but the terms must be such as will leave no ground for complaint by one party or the other.",38
139,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,I should like to seeterms which would have that effect.,38
140,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I undertake to draft any set of conditions, the honourable member desires, but it is .too much to expect me to state exactly whatthose conditions shall be, when I am simply indicating the readiness of the Government to take steps for the further protection of the State. If a proposal of .the kind hemade, a clause will have to be brought down and debated every line and letter, £1,000,000. - but I am sanguine that principles which liave 'been applied under elsewhere may be applied in Australia. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable gentleeasy man will do anything to get the Bil l say; - through.",38
141,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"No ; I shall do only what I believe to be fair and right. Anxious as we are to have this industry established, the terms must not be unfair to Australia, but such as, while encouraging the individual, will preserve the State right even to the extent of purchase at a, fair value. In the case of purchase we should be in the same position as if the State had - originally started the enterprise, except that the industry would be proved, and we should not be called upon to embark in pioneering work. I was amused to hear honourable members talking in such a strain as to leave it doubtful whether, in their opinion, the industry will be a success or a failure. The honourable member for Bland was one of these, and I wondered why, if he is so doubtful, he should be so enthusiastic about confining the bonus to the States.",39
142,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,The Minister misunderstood me. What I said was that it was unlikely Australia could successfully manufacture for export. I am of opinion that the State could supply our own requirements. I was speaking on figures supplied by one of the experts.,39
143,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"The honourable member for Melbourne has told us that from Canada during the last eight months of the present fiscal year there have been exported €6,00 0 tons of locally-made pig. iron. If that could be done in Australia we should have every reason to be pleased.",39
144,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,That is not a very great quantity.,39
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"How much was im35,000,000 ported into Canada ?",39
146,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I have not the figures as to the imports during those eight months ; I have dealt only with the statistics to the end of the year 1901. The honourable hand, member for Bland said that what is desired can be practically gained by an expenditure of £220,000, but I am told that the expert who supplied the honourable member with the figures is of opinion that that is the amount necessary to commence which, if successful, would produce 26,000 tons a year, when it would be necessary estimate. to provide plant to the value of over",39
147,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,I am not relying on those similar conditions figures alone.,39
148,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,I know it is very to misunderstand what the expert did . Mr WATSON - I do not misunderstand him ; I have all his figures in my head.,39
149,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"What the honourable member for Bland said was that £220,000 would provide all we want.",39
150,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Yes , in the meantime.",39
151,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"The population of Australia is very little less than that of Canada, and the trade of the Dominion is no greater than that of the Commonwealth. When we are told that Canada requires a certain quantity of pig-iron and manufactured goods, we shall not be over estimating if we say that our requirements are about the samp ",39
152,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,For some years to come our requirements will be much below those of Canada.,39
153,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I am inclined to think that our requirements in regard to pigiron and manufactured iron are equal to those of Canada, and it is nonsense to speak of £220,000 as being sufficient. Have honourable members any idea.of the amount invested at the present moment in the Canadian iron industry? The amount invested is 35,000,000dollars, or £7,000,000. Mr SPENCE.'-Is that in plant ?",39
154,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"It is invested in mines and. in plant, and in two or three years the amount will reach 5.0,000,000 dollars. From the Statistical Yeair Booh of Canada we learnThe united investment at Sydney, Hamilton,' Deseronto, Midland, New Glasgow, Radnor, Druirimondville, and '.Ferrona amounts to 24,500,000 dollars, which will be increased to by new plant, now building. Within five or six years the total investment will aggregate, approximately, 50,000,000 dollars.",39
155,Mr CONROY,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,That is merely an estimate.,39
156,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"And ' on the other we have an estimate^ of £220,000, representing 2£ per cent, of the £10,000,000 which is invested in the industry in Canada. Australia is capable of greater things than I thought if with £220,000 she can do what Canada finds it reasonable and profitable to experiments do with £10,000,000.",39
157,Mr WATSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"That is merely a paper - Mr KINGSTON - We know how actual expenditure tends to' exceed estimates. Whether it be the building of a house or the starting of works, low estimates are held forth as an inducement to invest; but the real test is what is done by similar people under similar conditions, and a statement that £220,000 is sufficient is difficult of acceptance by a deliberative Assembly.",39
158,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"What is the relation of £250,000 to £10,000,000?",40
159,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,It is 2*. per cent.,40
160,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Will so small a bonus have any influence ?,40
161,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Yes, though the honourable member smiles at my reply. I do not say that in the first instance an outlay of £10,000,000 is necessary; but what is the proportion of £250,000 to £220,000 ? I am inclined to say that in this case the bonus is a matter of very considerable importance.",40
162,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"The right gentleman denies that £220,000 is sufficient.",40
163,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I am taking the - highest and the lowest figures. I have put the case fairly and fully, after having given it the best consideration of which I am capable ; and it is my opinion that the proposal of the Government will act as an incentive, and result, as we desire, in the early establishment of the industry. There is much speculation as to the result of the proposed enterprise, but my own opinion is that it will be a success. Honourable members have twitted me with not giving all the information they desire, but I have ransacked all possible sources, and I do not know - what further facts can be laid before them. In committee I have not addressed myself at length to the question for the reason that I have spoken several times previously. But for the purpose of introducing the measure originally I studied the debates which took place in the Canadian Parliament when similar legislation was proposed, and. I found that the speakers referred to history, and to the encouragement which had been - given to the establishment of this industry by the imposition of certain duties in America and England. They pointed to the results, and asked whether it was not possible by fiscal aid to establish the indust r y in Canada. In asking the committee to embark on a similar enterprise, I have briefly glanced at the circumstances which - induced the Canadian Government to grant bonuses. Having shown the results of the policy in that country, I do not know of any further facts which are necessary to enable honourable members to arrive at a conclusion. Granted that there is some risk, I ask. whether is it better, at this time in our history, that we should provide a sure and safe means, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, of establishing this industry, or that we should embark upon what it is suggested will be at least a doubtful enterprise? This is not a case in which we risk a single sixpence without the assurance of a five-fold return. We are asked to pay 12s. on every ton of pig-iron producedthat is 12s., or 20 per cent., on £ 3 in .value. And this is value produced for Australiaby Australian flux, Australian ore, Australian coal, and Australian labour. What more do we want ? How often has it been my unhappy lot, in connection with matters of this sort, to be desirous of_ finding employment for our people, and failing to do honourable so? The establishment of an industry of this sort in our midst will be a means of finding fresh and profitable employment. And there is another reason for what is proposed. Eor every 12s. we pay, there is an increase of £ 3 in our National wealth. What is the value of the ore when it is lying in the ground ? What is the good of the flux unless it is used ? What is the value of the coal unless it is employed for useful purposes ? What is the use of the labourer going about the streets with his hands in his pockets seeking for work and being unable to find it? For the £250,000 which it is proposed to spend, and which is only 20 per cent, on the value of the iron that will be produced, we shall be bound to get a return equal in value to £ 3 for every 12s - There is no risk. Not one penny will the Commonwealth be called upon to pay, and no claim can be sustained, unless there is submitted to the inspectors of the Government five times the amount of material wealth for the amount expended. The return we shall get for our expenditure will be a £1,250,000 for £250,000 of outlay. Why do honourable members hesitate? It is an absolutely sure thing. Those are the conditions, and the only conditions, upon which we are called upon to pay. I say, looking at the history of other countries, and at what they have been bold enough to do, that Australia is capable and bold enough to do ths same at least. That being so, we should no longer hesitate to do it at the earliest opportunity.",40
164,Mr CONROY,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S," Honourable members opposite have had opportunities of speaking on behalf of property, and now I shall take the opportunity of saying a word or two on behalf of the people. We have had a vehement speech from the Minister, the Right Hon. C. C. Kingston- "" Continually Cursed "" Kingston, I suppose would be' the proper way of addressing him.",41
165,The CHAIRMAN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,The honourable memthat ber must not refer to a Minister in such terms. I call upon him to withdraw the expression he has used.,41
166,Mr CONROY,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I will withdraw the remark, as applied to the Minister in regard to the "" CC."" But it is necessary to deal with his history in connection with this measure. Last night the Minister delivered a speech-able , I admit it was-whic h showed that he had thoroughly studied his brief in a way which enabled him to adopt the attitude of Mr Facing-both-ways. Let ns look at what the Minister has done in the light of his utterances of last night and to day. He tells us that even if the Government are defeated with regard to the proposal now before the committee, he is really in favour of the policy favoured by the honourable member for Bland, and has wished for it all along. If that be so, why in the name of all that is good has he not brought in'a Bil l on the lines of that policy? Why cannot this Ministry show a little pluck in regard to their measure?",41
167,The CHAIRMAN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,The honourable and learned member must confine himself to the question.,41
168,Mr CONROY,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Then I m o v e That the Chairman do now leave the chair. That will enable-me to address myself to the whole question, and to give the reasons which animate me in continuing the debate. The Ministry have shown that they are unfit to deal with the matter. Although they have a big majority at their back, these courageous men suddenly have become cringing and. crawling in their endeavour to save their miserable souls.",41
169,The CHAIRMAN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I cannot allow the honourable member to allude to Ministers in such terms. He must withdraw the words ""cringing and crawling.""",41
170,Mr CONROY,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"If the Chairman rules that those words are..offensive, I withdraw them. Of course, they were used only in a. parliamentary sense, and did not apply to Ministers personally. Why should a proposal like this be brought before Parliamentat a time when the Treasurer tells us that"", he is unable to bring forward the Estimates for the present year ? Is there any explanation as to why there should be such haste ? Is there a single honourable memberwho can claim that he is thoroughly well informed on the subject ? We have asked for a Royal commission to inquire into it so we may know what grounds there arefor asking that a large sum shall be taken from the people' and handed over to aState or to a number of private individuals. But the very same feeling that made the Government lukewarm with regaid to the proposal that the State should undertake ironworks, because there were no private, syndicates to interest themselves in such an enterprise, makes them earnest about their present proposal, now that one or twopersons may be seen continually in the vicinity of the Chamber urging upon them to do something.",41
171,Mr SALMON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Does the honourable and learned member mean the representatives of the iron workers at Lithgow?,41
172,Mr CONROY,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,I refer to the representatives of the various ironworks.,41
173,Mr SALMON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,The workmen from L it h gow have been here.,41
174,Mr CONROY,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"No one has a right to come to the House, and endeavour to in fluence the votes of honourable members in regard to a question before Parliament. If these people wish to discuss the matter, they should discuss it outside the precincts of the House. It is not right that honourable members should be lobbied just as they are entering the Chamber.",41
175,Sir JOHN QUICK,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,Plent y of free-trademerchants haunt the House.,41

181,Mr CONROY,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I will withdraw the expression, and instead of saying that the honourable member lies, I will say that he has made a statement which is absolutely incorrect, and that, moreover, he must be .aware of it .",42
182,The CHAIRMAN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I hope I shall not . have to plead with the honourable and learned member any further. I request him unreservedly, and without comment, to withdraw his offensive expression, and to - apologize to the committee. . Mr DEAKIN - Migh t I suggest that the honourable and learned member can secure - all the purposes of this statement by means perfectly well known to him, without offending against the standing orders?",42
183,Mr CONROY,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"Ver y well; Mr Chairman, I withdraw and apologize.",42
184,The CHAIRMAN,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"I understand from the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, that the honourable member for Laanecoorie made use of some offensive expression. I did not hear it, but if the honourable member used it, I ask him to withdraw it.",42
185,Mr SALMON,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"The expression which I used was that the honourable and learned member himself had been in consultation with the representative of the free-traders. I made the statement as the result of my own observation. I have seen the honourable and learned member, in the precincts of the House, in . consultation with Mr Max Hirsch, who is looked upon as the representative of the Free-trade League in ""Victoria. If the statement is distasteful to the honourable and learned member, I will withdraw it .",42
186,Mr CONROY,BONUSES POR MANUFACTURE S,"If that is what the honourable member meant, I admit that it is - correct, and I regret the expression that I made use of towards him. I understood that he said something quite different, and so - offensive, that I should have asked him to repeat it anywhere. The Minister for Trade and Customs now says that he is in favor of imposing certain restrictions in re.gard to the payment of the bonus. This is another instance of the attitude which Ministers generally have adoptedi n reference to this measure. When it was introduced, not one word was said about the addition of words giving any State the right to take over works started by private enterprise. It was only when he found that the committee were against him, and that he could not carry the bonus proposals without some restriction, that the haughty Minister at once becameextremely def eren rial, and said that the proposal agreed with what the Government had intended from the first. The Government proposed that the measure should come into operation on the 1st ult. If that intention had been carried out, the bonuses would have been offered, not to a body of manufacturers, but to one or two firms who happened to be ready to take whatever the House chose to give them. Not one word was said by the Minister in introducing the Bill showing that he considered that delay was desirable to enable the scheme to be advertised throughout the world, so that we might secure 20 or 30 firms instead of one or two to embark upon the enterprise. The Government desired that the Bill should come into operation at once, so that one or two firms might be in a position to take advantage of it . The Minister said that the Government had been interviewed by one or two syndicates, and that he knew that capital was waiting to be invested in the industry. He had been behind the scenes; he knew what was going on; and said, therefore, that we ought to grant this money. Could a more direct appeal be made on behalf of a special body of individuals ? If the right honourable gentleman had accepted a brief to plead their case in another court, he could have said no more in favour of starting the industry at once. Hundreds of pastoralists and agriculturists have been rendered practically destitute by the drought; but the Government have not come forward with any proposal to give.them a bonus of £ 1 for every £ 2 which they can collect. Thoy seem to think that their whole Ministerial existence depends u pon their effort to force upon Parliament a Bonus Bill which will hand over this large amount of money to a few men. The Minister pretended to be in favour of a State monopoly, but if he approved of giving the bonus to one of the States-whic h would be a return of the money to the people themselves-ho w could he be in favour of handing it over - to any syndicate or syndicates ? This bit of special pleading on his part comes with an ill grace and looks bad. Have we heard one argument from him in support of the excision of the proviso, save that the various States Governments will not go on with the work ? It is worthwhile noting the way in which the message on the subject was sent to the States Premiers. were asked to reply as speedily as possible, so that the matter might be rushed through. No reason has been given why honourable members should reverse the votes recorded by them upon a former occasion. The right honourable gentleman has said that some 66,000 tons of iron were exported from Canada last year. So many figures have been quoted by him that we are disposed to subject them to considerable criticism, because the necessity for special pleading on his part often causes him torefrain from quoting the available information in full. Taking his own estimate of 66,000 tons,""at£3 a ton£19S,000 was the value of the annual export for last year. I do not know whether he thinks that men engaged in other productions are to be considered less than men under the control of some wealthy manufacturer or other. I tliink, indeed, he must. Although the exports in other lines from New South ""Wales alone amounted to £28,000,000 last year, yet he talks as if no such thing as production can go on, unless we give the manufacturers a 30 per cent, protective duty, and also a very large bonus. Because, if his argument amounts to anything, it means that we are to pay these men a far larger sum than the value of their exports. If no account is to be taken of anything but the export-and I might remind the Minister that very often it represents the sum which has to be paid by a debtor nation to a creditor nationit makes a very paltry show as against the £28,000,000 worth of exports from what was the free-trade State of New South Wales. The Minister talks about the consideration he had for the Premiers, and says that because they have made certain statements, we in this committee ought implicitly to bow down to them. He reads a letter in which the Premier of Queensland that he is not likely to deal with this subject. We can all remember with what a great flourish of trumpets he exhibited as a  we were discussing a question which vitally affected Queensland-theretention of Pacific islanders for a further term-did he then pay any regard to the statements of its Premier? Not one word, although-it was pointed out by Mr Conroy.  be coming on, the)' would be able to deal with the matter then, and that all they asked the Federal Government to do was to wait until they could get an opportunity to ascerThey tain from the people whether a certain course was right or wrong. Despite the protest of the honourable members for Brisbane and Oxley, and despite the written and oral protest of the Premier of Queensland, did the Minister for Trade and Customs ask us to pay the slightest attention to their objections to that Bill 1 Did he not cast aside the protests as something not to be considered for a moment? Why ? Simply because it never fitted in with his own views. But when we come to consider the question of granting a bonus for the establishment of the iron industry, what does he do? Because it happens to accord with his own views, he rushes with what one might almost characterize as indecent haste to acquaint the State Premiers with the result of the vote in this committee, and asks tbem to send him as speedily as possible an answer, which he afterwards quotes to us as a guide that we ought to follow. Again, if regard is to be paid to the statements made by the State Premiers, may I ask, did the Minister pay any deference to the statement of. the Premier of ""Tasmania when we were dealing with a question. which vitally affected its revenue ? Whatever may. be said against gambling in any form, Tattersall's sweeps did at least prevent gambling in any but one form in that State. It compelled men to take the trouble to sit down and to reflect before they indulged in any little .specula-tion. When the. Premier of Tasmania made a protest against stopping the transmission of letters to Tattersall's, and he was supported by the representatives of that State who sit on this side of the House, did the Minister for Trade and Customs pay the faintest attention to their objection? No, although from the very nature of tilings the State was perfectly competent to deal says with the whole matter. Such a bit of political work as to try .to influence the committee by getting telegrams or even letters from the State Premiers on a question of this . kind before the members of State Parliaments had had an opportunity of discussing it.has never been done before. What does ' Sir John See know as to whether the Parliament of New South Wales will approve of the establishment of a State iron industry ? I admit that I . have never argued altogether in favour of State socialism. Mariy.honourable members have supported a ' movement like this, sometimes as the lesser of two evils. If it requires such an enormous capital Tuesday as the Minister urges it does, the manufacture of iron must, in the very nature of. things, be a monopoly. The supply of ore is limited, as he urges, and there are only one or two beds that can be opened. Under these circumstances, al-. though perhaps not under others, there are honourable members on this side who will turn round and say- "" Much as we are in favour of private enterprise, if we allowed this business to be held entirely by private individuals, it would be encouraging monopoly-it would be giving a grant to special individuals which they did not deserve."" As the honourable and learned member for Corio very truly pointed put, we must not forget that iron is used by men in at least twenty trades, while only one is engaged in its production. The right honourable member has stated that 4,000 men may possibly bo engaged in the iron industry in time to come. That is the utmost estimate which even the Minister has dared to offer. We know his power of imagination. We know exactly how' much reliance to place on his figures.
