1,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,I wish to know from the Treasurer how long it is sinGe the Government decided to tax entertainments got up by committees for saying f aire well to soldiers going to the war or receiving back men from the Front?,5
2,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I have no knowledge of the matter, but if the honourable member will place his question on the notice-paper, I shall be prepared to answer it later. COMMONWEALTH ' AND STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS.",5
3,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Has the Treasurer tem the report in today's Age of a debate in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, at Perth yesterday, during which the statement was made that the State ha? been required by the Commonwealth Treasury to redeem certain Treasury bonds? Does, the right honourable gentleman regard this as an act of repudiation, which it is alleged by the ex-Treasurer of Western Australia to be. Is there any understanding concerning the son-payment) of these bondsduring the war ?' Sir JOHN"" FORREST - I have seen the paragraph referred to. statement made in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia was not sufficiently clear, and was' not based on facts. The ex-Treasurer the State in using the word "" repudiaof tion "" did ' so improperly, - and without justification. I cannot understand use of such an expression by men who have had responsibilities. The Commonmore wealth has lent about £30,000,000 to Wie States, and under an agreement about £3,800,000 more should be paid to them by tas during the present year. But the difficulties in the way of borrowing money should he' as well known to who spoke on the subject in the Legislaformation tive Assembly of Western Australia as the Treasury statements that they are-.to honourable members and to me. been published. - r The Commonwealth has behaved moifc generously to the States. It went on/to' the London market to borrow £7,500,01)0, and also borrowed £3,000,000 more, - with the consent of the British Government, from the War Fund, in order to f u l f l its. obligations to the States, and to enable their public works to be continued. ,- As I have said, £3,800,000 remains, to be paid to the States during this calendar year under the agreement bebween them and the Commonwealth. When I came into officeI discovered that the States had borrowed £18,000,000 from the Commonwealth on the understanding that they would pay the money back within two years, it being thought, no doubt, that the war would then be over. At the end of two years, the period of the loan was extended for another year, which has now nearly expired. The obligation to pay this money is as binding on the States as the obligation to advance them money is' binding on the Commonwealth', and a reasonable understanding might be arrived at regarding the two agreements. ""A week ago the Treasury telegraphed to the Government of Western Australia, through the Prime Minister,, saying that we should do our best to fulfil our promise to advance £3,800,000 more this . year, and we hope to find the money to do that. The market is perhaps a little better than it was, but it is not advantageous to go on to the London market for small amounts. Although that telegram was confidential, those to whom it was sent might have prevented the statement which was made about repudiation.",5
4,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Has money been raised for the States which the Treasurer re-: The fuses to pay to them ?,5
5,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"No . We have paid to the States all. the money borrowed of on their behalf. To comply with the letter the agreement, we must raise a loan of £6,800,000 to repay the £3,000,000 borthe rowed from the War Fund of the British Government and to provide £3,800,000 for the States this year. I believo thnt we shall be able to do that, though there are difficulties in the way.",5
6,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I understand that the Treasurer is asking the States to pay up 1,5
7,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Honourable those members have been given all in concerning this matter in have I think that the obligation of the States to pay us the money that they have borrowed under the promise to pay it back is as binding as our obligation to advance further money to them. The two agreements should be looked at together, and an understanding should be come to with regard to th'em. It is my desire to be generous to the States-and that we have been-bu t we should be treated generously, too. PAPUAN OIL FIELDS.",5
8,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Is the Minister for Home and Territories prepared to make a statement concerning the oil finds in Papua ?,6
9,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I can make known the general position. Oil' was discovered in Papua about 1911, and in 1913 bores were put down under the advice of an expert. When Dr Wade took charge in May, 1915, five bores had been put down, and although oil has been obtained from them, they ceased to be used because of the mud that rose with it , and it was thought better to put down other bores. The plant that was used in the first instance was rather small, and the bores too narrow for deep sinking. Two more bores have therefore been put down, and one of the old bores has been redrilled. Of the new bores, No. 6 was commenced in 1915, and No. 7 in October, 1916. Bore No. 6 is down to a depth of about 500 feet.",6
10,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,What is size of the bore ?,6
11,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I forget the size for the moment. The No. 7 bore is wide enough to get down to at least 4,000 feet, and is now down to about 1,700 feet, at a point determined by the geological knowledge of the expert, Dr Wade. It has been successful in respect of quickness of boring, and the fact that as greater depth is attained there is a comparative exempt them from taxation ? absence of m u d ; and there are other indications that the bore will develop well. The actual cost of No. 7 is about £ 1 per foot. Case artesian boring in tralia costs about 30s. per foot, and when I remind honourable members of the excepshortly. tional conditions in Papuan-the distance from the source of supply, the fact that ithe boring is done at places where rain falls every day and averages from 150 to 200 inches per annum, that the natives are attacked by pleurisy and pneumonia, that the site is approached through an almost impenetrable jungle, and that it takes several months to make a road to the site from the nearest point at which t}ie vessel touches-'the y will understand that the enterprise .is attended with great difficulty. One cannot compare the outlay from the beginning of the enterprise because that might run to about £ 2 5 per foot, but comparing the actual cost of drilling with the cost of similar work on other fields in Australia, America, and Russia, the result of No. 7 bore is good. Up to the present time there has been an expenditure of about £65,000. The last bore has been put down at a rapid rate, a depth of 300 feet having been reached in the first month. The cost compares favourably with that on other fields, and at present we have about 2,000 gallons of oil, but commercial quantities cannot be touched u n t i l we get down ' to a greater depth. The oil is of first class quality, and compares well with that from Sumatra and other parts of the Dutch East Indies. If the boring is successful the results will be of great advantage to the Commonwealth.",6
12,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,- Has the Minister been approached by any person or persons representing private enterprises with a proposition to develop the Papuan oil fields?,6
13,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There have been many suggestions from the United Kingdom and other places in regard to allowing prithe vate persons to engage in this enterprise, but I have not felt justified in acceding to the suggestions. TAXATION OF SOLDIERS' PENSIONS.",6
14,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"Is the Treasurer aware that under the present law soldiers' pensions are subject to income tax ? If so, will he introduce an amending law to '",6
15,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,I believe the House has already been informed that it 16s. is the intention of the Government to Ausexempt soldiers' pensions from taxation. AB ill for that purpose will be introduced LENGTH OF QUESTIONS.,6
16,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I should like to ask you, Mr Speaker, if the Standing Orders impose any limit on the length of an answer which a Minister may give to a question, and whether you will allow questioners to ask questions of the same length as some of the answers that have been given this afternoon ?",6
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It seemed to me that the answers referred to were of somewhat unusual length, but the matters to which they related were certainly of very great importance. I would suggest: to Ministers that when a question involves the making of a long statement in reply-,- it would meet the wishes of the House if they would first obtain leave to make a statement.

22,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister read - in the press a report of statements made by members of the Council of the Employers Federation in New South Wales in criticism of a Judge of the High Court? Have members of Council of the Employers Federation received them. greater privileges in that respect than are condemned. enjoyed by other members, of the community ? If not, what authority exists for protecting High Court Judges from attacks of this kind ?",7
23,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have not seen the report; but I shall look at it , and answer the honourable member later. NA EXPENDITURE. .",7
24,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is the Minister for Home and Territories in a position to give the House the information he promised in regard to the expenditure in the Northern Territory?,7
25,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At the request of the honourable member, I personally prepared a statement on the finances of the Northern Territory, and it has been ready for some time. I thought, however, that I would make two or three additions in regard to agriculture, pastoralism, and too mining. I hope to be able to complete statement next week, and lay it on the ADVISORY COUNCIL OF SCIENCE.",7

I read in the press a criticism in regard to the matter, and I am glad that the honourable member for Wimmera has afforded me an opportunity of explaining that, in an effort to comply with the request of an honourable member, without waiting to remove the red tape, I handed the over the papers in the state in which I For that I have been",7
28,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I wish to know whether the papers are now available, or whether the embargo that any honourable member who wished to peruse them must give his word of honour not to communicate any of the contents to the press still remains on them.",7
29,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have not seen the papers. I handed them over as they were handed to me. I have tried to explain how it came about that the words ""Secret and Confidential"" appeared on them. They were on them when they were handed to me, and every honourable member who has held Ministerial office knows that papers are usually so marked when sent to me by departmental chiefs. No doubt the Librarian, on seeing that inscription - upon them, was quite righ t in demanding from any honourable member that the documents should be read with the qualification to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred. I know of - no reason why the contents should not be published, but I confess that I have not seen the papers and cannot express any opinion until honourable members give me a few moments in which to peruse them. COST OF RECRUITIN G.  lowing telegram from the Queensland Recruiting Committee: Committee instruct me to state that the cost of recruiting in New South Wales, as given in the House yesterday, was totally wrong and misleading. The Queensland figures, given include salaries, recruiting employees, office expenses, travelling allowances, rail, steamer, and coach fares of recruiting employees and recruits, also recruits' meals, medical examinations, printing, stationery, advertising, and all the other many oontingencies. The New South Wales figures as given cannot possibly cover all these items. Will you please correct. ' Will the Honorary Minister inform the House whether the figures that he gave yesterday in regard to the cost of, recruiting in the different States were correct?",8
30,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The figures given by me in answer to the question submitted by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie were supplied by the officials of the Department. The honourable, member for Moreton has already handed me a copy - of the telegram in which my figures are criticised, and I shall have the matter inquired into in order to see whether the statements made are in any way accurate. MR. P. J - BROOKFIELD , M . L . A .",8
31,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Can the Prime  field, the member for Sturt in the Legisa lative Assembly of New South Wales, has been prosecuted for an alleged offence in March last, and why such a long period was allowed to elapse before the prosecution was instituted ? I would like to know, also, whether the Prime Minister is aware that the repeated prosecutions of Mr Brookfield have created an impression among the workers of Broken Hill that he is being treated very unfairly, in fact persecuted, and that this feeling has grown to such an extent that there has been a total cessation of work in Broken Hill today as a protest against the prosecutions ?",8
32,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Until I saw a paragraph in the press this morning I was not aware that Mr Brookfield had been prosecuted. I confess that as a citizen I frequently wondered why he had not been prosecuted, but as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth I was not officially aware of the fact that he had been. Probably the prosecution referred to is being dealt with by the State magistrates. It may even be that the offence is against a State law. If that is so, the more credit falls on the State law and the greater criticism descends on the Commonwealth law and the Department over which I have the honour to preside. I am not aware that Mr Brookfield has been treated unjustly. If he has been treated so, he shall have justice. He deserves justice, but he certainly does not deserve mercy. He will have what the law gives him, but no more. I am not surprised to learn that the men at Broken Hill have ceased work; I should be surprised to learn that they work for any length of time continuously. I am aware that they have threatened to do certain things. I am perfectly aware that it is their practice to do so, and I am sure that when the honourable member for Barrier has been a little longer in this Parliament he will learn that the rumblings which disturb him so greatly affect us not at all. FORTNIGHTLY PAYS.",8
33,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"L as t year the Treasury undertook to pay the salaries of officers in the Public Service in regular fortnightly payments, but since then there has been a considerable hitch. I underthat the Treasurer has appointed Board to overcome the difficulties raised in the case of the Postmaster-General's Department, and I would like to know from the right honourable gentleman whether he has in his mind any probable date by which his Department will be able to keep its promise?",8
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have not heard lately the progress that has been made. I may say that the desire is to meet the wishes expressed by the honourable member, and I am hopeful that the difficulties that have arisen will be overcome; if the honourable member will place his question on the notice-paper for Wednesday next it will give me time to supply him with full information on the matter. CADETS: AREA OFFICERS' NOTICES.",9
35,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether he will have very distinct instructions sent direct to area officers others controlling the' - training of cadets in order that parents may be relieved from harassing notices. I have here a third notice which has been addressed to a lad, the father and mother of whom told the officers concerned, months ago, that he was dead - This last notice was received only the other day, and threatened the lad with prosecution if he did not make good his drills. Such notices are both harassing and hurtful to parents, and I ask the Minister to see that officers are instructed to exercise greater care in this respect.",9
36,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member asks that because of this specific case a general instruction should be issued 'to all area officers throughout the Commonwealth. Definite instructions are given as to the procedure to be adopted, but the honourable member must recognise that individuals sometimes fail to accurately carry out the directions received. If the honourable member will supply me with the particulars of the specific case to which he has referred, I shall be glad to make it the subject of special inquiry. COMMONWEALTH BANK. PURCHASE OF LAND AT SYDNEY - BOAR D OF CONTROL.",9

39,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Las t session, and early in the present session, I asked the Treasurer whether he would give consideration to the desirableness of appointing a Board to control the Commonwealth Bank. Will the right honourable gentleman state whether he has considered the question, and if so, with what result ?",9
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I forget for the moment the answer that I made to the honourable member's question on a. previous occasion, but if it was that the matter would be considered, I can only say again that it will be considered. ARMY RECRUITS: MEDICAL INSPECTION.",9
41,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is announced and in the press that the Imperial Government have appointed a Select Committee to inquire into the medical inspection pf recruits for the army. Will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence see that copies of the report of that Committee are made available to members of this Parliament?,9

In view of the plenary powers possessed by the Government under the War Precautions Act, what does the Government propose to> do to protect the general public throughout Australia from extortionate prices charged' for apples and other foodstuffs?",10
48,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. It is known that, in' accordance with custom extending over many years, considerable quantities of apples are held in cold storage, but there is no available evidence as to ownership. 3. The price of apples is above the average this, season, owing to a shortage in the crop. 3.. The Government will use its powers to protect the general public from exploitation.

85,Mr RILEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"South Sydney) [3.16] I have received several complaints from people who have sons at the Front, and one of those complaints is very serious. A lady in my electorate had. two sons on service, one of whom was killed and the other sent home wounded. She received information from the Defence Department that she had to apply for the deferred pay in respect of the son who was killed. She filled in the necessary papers; but, after all the arrangements had been made, an order came to her from the Treasury or the Defence Department to the effect that from the amount due there would have to be deducted £ 1 8 . I have in my possession two letters, one from the sergeant-major of the company, and the other from the lieutenaut in charge, giving the soldier a splendid character, and speaking generally in the highest terms of him. The amount deducted is for fines, and the mother is quite at a loss to know what these fines can be for. I made inquiry at the barracks, and was informed that since the present Government came into power, the policy of the Department has been altered. Previously when a soldier was killed, any fines there might be against him were The wiped out by the fact of his death.",14
86,Mr GROOM,COTTON CULTURE IN,Who told you the policy Mr Tudor. had been altered ?,14
87,Mr RILEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"The gentleman in charge me that under the present policy any fines may be deducted from amounts due. This I regard as disgraceful. The poor woman has lost a son who was her support, and it is necessary that attention should be called to her treatment in the r . matter of the deferred pay, though I rer . gret the fact, because I know that such will not encourage recruiting. I made some further inquiries as to what these fines are inflicted for, and I find if a man loses his rifle he is called Sampupon to pay a certain amount. It stands to. reason, however, that if a man is killed in action he cannot come back with his rifle; and yet it appears that in such a case a fine of £ 6 is imposed. Clearly there should be some arrangement made whereby,, in the case of a man killed in such fine shall be remitted. There is another little matter to which I should like to call attention. We haveprovided that if a woman loses her son at the war, she shall receive a pension of £ 1 per week; but if that woman happens to be in receipt cf an old-age pension, she is, on that account, paid only 7s. 6d. a .week by the Treasury. It was understood that the policy of the Government was to so amend the law as to allow persons under these circumstances to receive the full pension.",14
88,Mr BOYD,COTTON CULTURE IN,"If she got the full military pension, the old-age pension would be cancelled.",14
89,Mr RILEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I wish to alter tihat. She should get both pensions in full , because of the sacrifice she has made. The New Zealand Government has not been cheese-paring in this way, and allows a woman who has lost a son to receive the full old-age pension and the full military pension as well. Another matter I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister is the fact that instructional staff sergeants-major are receiving less pay than corporals who havevolunteered to go to the Front. This creates discontent, and it does not seem' right that instructors should be paid less than the men .whom they are drilling. Mr J . H CATTS (Cook) [3.32] - I move That all the words after the word "" That "" be struck out, with a view to the insertion of words to cause the motion to read as follows :- "" That a Royal Commission be. apf iointed to investigate and report upon the pubication, issue, distribution, and financing of the Critchley Parker election pamphlets."" Every honourable member is aware that during the last Commonwealth election the country was literally flooded with pamphlets and other printed matter of a sectarian character, all issued over the name of Critchley Parker, at 376 Flinders-lane, Melbourne. The price of printing paper has in creased greatly of late. paper proprietors of Australia, notwithstanding their immense resources, are complaining of this increase in price, and are finding ib necessary to place a restriction on their issues; but during the last election no restriction was placed on the issue of the kind of literature to whic>£ I am drawing attention, which strewed the Commonwealth almost knee-deep. There was widespread circulation in every State, showing that powerf u l organization was behind it . It must have cost an immense amount of money to distribute that literature. Where did the money come from ?",14
90,Mr FALKINER,COTTON CULTURE IN,Perhaps from the unions.,15
91,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"The honourable member is associated with the Pastoralists Union, and,, therefore, no doubt gives a correct answer so far as one union is concerned. Ib is time that an inquiry was made into this unmeasured distribution of sectarian . election literature. know the forces at work, and we should know what advantages they are to reap 'from their huge expenditure, what favours they are to get from the Government which has succeeded because of it . If the Pastoralists Union necessary money, that fact,. no doubt, is"" related to tlhe exemption of tlhe pastoral industry from taxation under the War Profits Bill . The matter should be ject to searching inquiry. The putting out of this literature has done an immense amount of harm by causworkman, ing feuds and dissensions. We were told it was the highest aim of this so-called National Government to unite all sections of the community for the great tasks with which we are confronted.",15
92,Mr BOYD,COTTON CULTURE IN,The National Government had nothing to do with Mr Critchley Parker.,15
93,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,Le t us have an in quiry into that.,15
94,Mr BOYD,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Why do you not make an . inquiry, and pay for it?",15
95,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"It is beyond t h * means of any member of this House to institute such an inquiry. Only aa authority clothed with power to call witnesses before it , and to compel them to give evidence, can properly institute such an inquiry. ' The news- I shall ""not deal with t,hi3 literature in detail; there is too much of it ito make that possible in the time available. I have here a sheet upon which is depicted a. priest, holding a waddy in his hand, and before hi m on the floor is an Irishman, bound hand and foot. The priest is telling the Irishman that if he does not vote as he is told he will neither marry nor bury him. Alongside is printed this statementArrayed on the one side you have the Roman Catholic Church, the Sinn Feiners, the Industrial Workers of the World, and the pro-Germans, and on the other the rest of the community. There is also a picture of a shamrock, with the wordsUnder this emblem conscription was killed, and the name of Australia dragged in the dirt. On another sheet is a picture of a Protestant minister standing in the pulpit, and admonishing his hearers toThink of Eternity, and vote for the National party. We should The statement is also published thatTlie Caucus party, led by Mr Tudor, has a big proportion of the Catholic vote assured to it ; that that means 631,444 votes, of which all but a small exception will be cast against England and the National party. Don't stop to listen to any other reason. That is what provided the is going to happen. Another cartoon shows a large snake curled up, with its fangs showing, and obsubjectionable epithets issuing for m its mouth. On an opposite page is an Australian as it is alleged the Roman Catholic Church would have him-that is, carrying a priest on his shoulders. Another picture shows, a priest using battering ram against the door of Parliadamaging ment. I hold in my hand a sheet the size of ordinary newspaper, of which there were several issues. This issue is dated 19th A p r i l , and is marked No. 2. Such sheets were distributed ad lib. to the community, and an immense amount of money must have been spent on their distribution. Here is another quoteThe election suggests an invasion tralia. We are threatened by the foreigner. Rome has come among us and put our own people against us. Ireland gloats strife and dissension which the Roman Church has raised here through her agents. There are articles on >"" The hidden the enemy,"" "" Sectarianism rampant,"" "" A against danger to the community,"" and other pamphlets articles ridiculing Ireland's part in the prejudicial war, and impugning the loyalty of the our Roman Catholic Church. The whole of representative this literature is of a most objectionable kind. Another cartoon shows Australia dressed as a woman, and carrying the British flag, an Australian soldier in uniform with the word "" Volunteer printed on him , and the thir d person in the picture is a priest. The soldier saying to Australia, "" I am ready to go, but what about him , "" pointing to the priest. The cartoon practically calls upon one section of the community to reMajesty, fuse to go to the war while priests are in Australia. No literature that has been issued in this countJ'y could have had a worse effect upon recruiting than this to which I drawing attention. Why has Critchley Parker not been proceeded against? Why has not the War Precaushall tions Act been put into operation against him? These cartoons were used during the New South Wales State election, then ing the Commonwealth election last May, and now that a bye-election is taking place in New South Wales, they are being dissent tributed about Dubbo and Macquarie with with the words printed on them, ""Vote for MCLeod and be Loyal."" I produce a sample for inspection. MCLeod is the Nationalist candidate for the Macquarie seat in the State Legislature. So that, spite of all protests and assurances f r a the Government that this literature is to National harmony, it is still being issued broadcast. This sort of an thing has continued for months, and it appears as if in this time of war persons are to be allowed to divide the community on the sectarian issue without any action being taken. I have no desire to interfere in any religious matter. These pamphlets have no religious object. They ar« political only, and party political at that. « To illustrate the view taken by the of AusCatholic members of the community, I quote the following resolution passed by over the the Golden Grove branch of the Catholic Catholic Federation of New South Wales:That the members of this branch protest in name of the Catholics of this district the issue and distribution of certain over the name of Critchley Parker. They are a cause of discord, and, in effect, to recruiting. Hence we instruct honorary secretary to write to our Federal and request that he will ventilate the matter on the floor of the House, and have a regulation introduced under the War Precautions Act to prohibit the issue and circulation of those and like pamphlets. I have similar communications from the Beaconsfield, Newtown, and Camdenville "" centres of my electorate. The War Precautions Act 1914 prois vides that the Governor General may make regulations, inter alia, ' ' To prevent the spread of false reports, or reports likely to cause disaffection to His or public alarm, or to interfere left with the success of His Majesty's Forces by land or sea."" . War Precautions Regulation No. 28 made thereunder provides that no peram son by word of mouth, in writing, or Mr in any newspaper, periodical, book, circular or other printed publication spread false reports, or make false statements likely to prejudice recruiting. War Precautions Regulation No. 28a gives power to the censor to require the dureditor or printer of any newspaper or periodical to submit, before publication, matter which relates or refers to the pre-war, or any subject connected thereor arising therefrom, or publications which would be an offence under Regulation 28 above mentioned. War Precautions Regulation No. 43 provides that "" If any person attempts in to cause mutiny, sedition, or disaffection o m among any of H is Majesty's Forces, or the civilian population, lie shall be guilty ©f an offence against 'the Act . "" Several prosecutions have taken place under this Act , but for some reason Critchley Parker escapes. He is a greater offender than those against whom the law has been put into operation. The matter was brought under the notice of the Government by the postal officers of New South Wales. The letter carriers' organization, finding that literature of this kind was being distributed through them, and that people were raising objections, made a protest to the Postmaster-General, and asked that the issue of sectarian pamphlets through the channel of the Post Office, and per medium of the letter carriers, which was insulting to many of them, should be prohibited, but the Government absolutely refused to take any such action.",15
96,Mr BRENNAN,COTTON CULTURE IN,"As a matter of fact, the Post and Telegraph Act prohibits the transmission of scurrilous and offensive matter of that kind.",17
97,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"The honourable member is correct. There is a provision in the Post and Telegraph Act which prohibits the transmission of literature of this description through the post. There is a little paper connected with the In dustrial Workers of the World, and called Direct Action. The Government have found that they have power to suppress that journal, and have taken action against it . A great deal is said about the Industrial Workers of the Worl d and Btrecf Action. I disagree fro m that organization and everything connected with it , but in reality its propaganda is avery tiny affair when compared with the"" issue - f these pamphlets by Critchley Parker. Apparently it is part of the programme - f the present Government to magnify the Industrial Workers of the World as much as possible, in order to make out that they are fighting a dangerous .giant. But, as a matter of fact, it is not of anything like the proportions that might be inferred from the exaggerated statements that we hear concerning it .  of the Australian Workers Union admits that the Industrial Workers of the World is 'a very dangerous organization.",17
98,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"It is unfortunately true that a few members of the Industrial Workers of the World have found their way into the unions, and, in sparsely attended meetings, are exercising an influence altogether disproportionate to their number. They are undoubtedly causing a great deal of trpuble and - dissension in Australia. But whilst action can be taken by the Government against this little double foolscap paper, issued by a few recalcitrant workmen, most of whom have come from Great Britain , we are told that no action can be taken to suppress the objectionable literature of Critchley Parker and the Minin g Standard, which appears to be supported by some of the wealthy classes of this country. The honourable member for Wentworth interjects about Archbishop Mannix. That gentleman has made some statements which have been seized upon, and a great deal of publicity has been given to him. But Dr Long, the Anglican Bishop of Bathurst,' New South Wales, said deliberately, when I was. in charge of the recruiting campaign in that State, that he would refuse to allow ecclesiastical students belonging to his church to enlist. ' Mr KELLY - A r e you sure that he did not say he would refuse to allow them to become combatants?",17
99,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I am not under any misapprehension about the matter at all . As a matter of fact-, several authorities' of the Anglican Church have taken steps to prevent ecclesiastical students enlisting with the Forces, I am not making any attack upon Bishop Long particularly, but if any action at all. is to be taken in this matter, let it. be taken against all persons alike. The figures relating to recruiting show that the Roman Catholic section of. the community does not compare unfavorably with any other religious denomination in respect of its representation in the fighting Forces of Australia. Figures regarding denominational representation in the Expeditionary Forces were published b "" Colonel Gerald Campbell in the Sydney .daily press, about a month ago. I have not the particulars with me, but ' the figures for the Roman Catholic section of the community, compared to adherents, were greater than those for the Methodist section, to which I belong. I know that in my own electorate very many Roman Catholic families are represented in the firing line by a considerable proportion of their numbers.",17
100,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COTTON CULTURE IN,"There are some figures in the paper you are reading show the opposite to be the case. I think the utterances of Dr Mannix deserve they get. Mr J. If . CATTS - I am making no made. apology for Dr Mannix or anybody else. The honourable member seems to have made a study of the Parker pamphlets and accepted their authority in preference to Colonel Gerald Campbell. I think that attention ought to be to the. fact that Mr Mahon, who was a Minister in the last Labour Government, has associated the previous Cabinet with the issue - of these 'election pamphlets. The following statement was telegraphed from Western Australia to the Sydney press on the 27th April, 1917.:Mr Mahon, M.H.R., who acted as AttorneyGovernment side. General during Mr Hughes' absence in England, said I observe that Mr Hughes the above sectarian production, but he cannot disavow close .personal intimacy with its author, Critchley Porker. Ever Mr Hughes .became Leader of the Governseries ment, Critchley Parker has had frf>e entry to the Prime Minister's office. ther, the power and authority deral Government have been used by Mr. Hughes to safeguard Critchley Parker's .private interests. Prior to Mr Hughes' departure for England he became aware that Parker was threatened with an for libel 'hy a powerful American company, supposed to be dominated by - German shareholders. Mr Hughes directed that a regulation should be prepared under the 'War Precautions Act providing, amongst other things, that no action should ceeded with during the' currency of the war in such cases as Parker's without the written consent of the Attorney-General. 1 refrain from disclosing the reception thia move had, but it was subsequently passed by the Federal Executive, and is now law. Parker was waiting in the ante-room on the day Cabinet considered the regulation, and was seemingly very much relieved when informed that the Hughes regulation had been passed, and that the law action threatened against him would be stopped by Government authority. These facts are on the public records. Critchley Parker issued the same kind of literature during the conscription campaign, but Mr Hughes did not repudiate it. I do not associate the Prime Minister wealth. with these pamphlets. I know nothing about them. But here is the statement made by a gentleman who was acting as Attorney-General for the Prime Minister.",18
101,Mr WATT,COTTON CULTURE IN,Why not read the Prime Minister's reply?,18
102,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I have not got it , which or I would read it .",18
103,Mr KELLY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"The honourable member is all aware that the Prime Minister, who is attacked in that statement, was absent from Australia when the regulation was",18
104,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"What Mr Mahon says is that the Prime Minister set this propaganda going before he went away, but, because of some delays, the matter did not come before the Executive Councalled cil until he had left Australia.",18
105,Mr WATT,COTTON CULTURE IN,The Prime Minister deliberately contradicted that. Mr J. It . CATTS - It is only fair to say that the Prime Minister repudiates any connection with this literature whatsoever. I have no doubt his reply to Mr. Mahon will be quoted 'by members ou the,18

The Government is at present patronizing the greatest enemy to recruiting in Australia. A few days ago it was stated in the Senate by Senator Pearce that some of the literature referred to in the amendment was issued in Western Australia by the Labour organizations, and the honourable member for Wentworth has said in this chamber that it was issued by Labour organizations somewhere.",18
107,Mr KELLY,COTTON CULTURE IN,I was merely repeating a statement made by Dr Mannix in Melbourne. Surely he ought to know.,19
108,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"If the honourable member refers to New South Wales, I can give his statement an emphatic denial, as the one who was in charge of the Labour campaign in that State. Certainly the Labour organizations there had absolutely no association - whatever with the issue of these pamphlets. If any Labour organization in any State was associated with the issue of such literature it should be exposed. I should like to see the matter thoroughly ventilated and in ",19
109,Mr KELLY,COTTON CULTURE IN,Y o u are aware that Dr Mannix complimented the Labour organizations on issuing this literature.,19
110,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I am not interested so much in what the reverend gentleman said as the honourable member appears to be. I have more to do in looking after the interests of my constituents. If we can ascertain by means of a Royal Commission what it cost to issue this vast amount of literature, in whose in terest it was issued, who paid for it , and where the monev came from , it will be work well worth doing. to know if there is a force at work in this country which by the expenditure of large sums of money on elections expects to get some quid pro quo in return. There is a suspicion in the minds of the public that such is the case, and therefore the matter ought to be investigated. In addition to the matter of these pamphlets, the huge sums of money spent during the recent elections ought to be in vestigated. The people want to know in whose interests this large amount of money was put up.  np 1",19
111,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"On the honourable member's side. An officer receiving £1,500 per annum was taken out of the Tourists' Bureau South Wales and put in charge of organization work at a salary of £2,000 per annum for five years. We saw full-page advertisements appearing in the newspapers day after day. We ascertained that the cost of these advertisements ranged from £ 5 0 to £200 per issue.",19
112,Mr WATT,COTTON CULTURE IN,Were they issued by Mr . Critchley Parker?,19
113,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"No ; but it only shows that the country was deluged with money during the last election, and the people ought to know where this money came from , and the purpose for which it was expended.",19
114,Mr BOYD,COTTON CULTURE IN,The honourable member is slandering his own supporters by saying that they were bought with our money. Mr j . H . CATTS - I have said nothing of the kind. The honourable member knows that the whole scheme of the Commonwealth electoral legislation was framed with a view to preventing the corruption of the electors by the expenditure of large sums of money. Each honourable member returned to this House is called upon to submit a return showing that he has not spent more than £100 on his election ,19
115,Mr HEITMANN,COTTON CULTURE IN,The provision is absolutely farcical.,19
116,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"The honourable member knows perfectly well that the cost of the election of honourable members on his side of the House would probably run to £10,000 each.",19
117,Mr WATT,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Will not the honourable member take off £1,000 ?",19
118,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"No . There were We ought about fifty National candidates elected, and there was at least £500,000 spent, on the elections. It is just about time the public had some means of finding out where this money came from, and the extentof the expenditure.",19
119,Mr WATT,COTTON CULTURE IN,The amendment will not cover t'he point to which the honourable member is now alluding,19
120,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"It will cover a portion of it , and may give a clue to the source and direction of the main body of election expenditure. I ask all sides of the' House to join in carrying the amendment. I hope that there will be no effort to side-track it . . There are means of sidestepping this matter by moving the adjournment of the debate and using the majority of the Government to stifle disin New cussion on it , and to prevent any vote being taken. I want the people to understand that if the representatives of the Government move for the purpose of adjourning this debate, knowing perfectly well that the question will be put at the bottom of the business paper, and be crowded out by a long list of Government business, which will prevent it ever coming up for discussion again, they will be just as much voting against the proposal for the Royal Commission as if they voted straight oub against it on a division in the House this afternoon. Let the people of Australia watch this matter closely. Some honourable members opposite have protested that they desire that there shall be an investigation into this matter. The honourable member for Hume indicated some weeks ago that there should be an inquiry into it , and I claim his vote for a Royal Commission, to probe the matter to the bottom. We shall see how he votes. This is surely a time when we should avoid raising the sectarian issue. If this issue is to be raised, and is to be made a bone of contention in Australia at elections, what will be the position of our soldiers at the Front? Roman Catholics, Methodists, Presbyterians and .adherents of the Church of England are fighting side by side. They are comrades in arms, and suffer and die together. If the people of Australia are to be divided on sectarian lines by this literature, there will - be the same division among the soldiers in the trenches, making their lives absolutely unbearable, 'just at a time when there ought to be brotherhood in arms and the best! of good feeling among them. Surely nothing should be done at this time to divide the people of this country ! Not only has this bone of contention prejudiced recruiting in the past; it is also doing it now, and the Government would be well advised if they would give this meed of justice to the Roman Catholic community, who have been slandered outrageously by the issue of this literature. They will also do much to bring about that unity and concord in the community they say they desire to see established if they will grant a Royal Commission to probe this matter to the bottom, and allow the people to see that ithe great parties who control the destinies of Australia repudiate association with the issue of this scurrilous literature, and prevent, once and for all, any recurrence of this unsavoury strife.

121,Mr KELLY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Wentworth) [4.1] Having listened attentively to the honourable member, and being entirely in accord with the principle which, with much fervour and beating of the breast, he would have us thin k is actuating his action-that all local discord should be buried at this time- I was trying to find some possible excuse for this digging up of dead history other than a design to inflame those very passions that he pretended to be deprecating. If honourable members opposite, who are of all denominations, seek to get out of this business a solid church support for their political candidates, or if they wished to prevent this sort of thing in the future, I could have understood action being taken in this House. But are they endeavouring to find some explanation of an election that is past, and endeavouring to give to this particular incident of the election a weight which it certainly does not deserve? The secretary of. my campaign committee was a Roman Catholic, and in the Wentworth electorate it was noticeable that the people who were getting the pamphlets referred to were Roman Catholics. We waited for a long time, and then we found that Dr Mannix, in Melbourne, actually congratulated the party which honourable members opposite represent forits cleverness in reproducing and circulating the pamphlets in question. If it is a matter for contempt for any man at such a time as this to try to make political capital out of those religious differences that are buried down in the hearts of the majority of every people, how much more contemptible, and how degrading it is beyond all words when men come forward beating their breasts and proclaiming their own rectitude, while they are quietly circulating and thrivin g by the things that they profess to dislike?",20
122,Mr WATKINS,COTTON CULTURE IN,H as not the honourable member finished with the business; why does he allow it to come up again ?,20
123,Mr KELLY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"If the honourable member will come forward and say that Parliament is in favour of stopping the carriage through the post of all this sectarian literature, on whatever side it may be used, I am prepared to meet him half way; but that is.an entirely different thing,. If , however, honourable members endeavour in this way to find some explanation for the result of the recent election, and, in so doing, attempt to inflame a bitterness that every loyal person in Australia wishes to see dead, I can only say that words fail me to express my utter contempt for their action. Many causes contributed to the great result of the last elections, and I do not think that least among them was the honourable member for Cook himself.",20
124,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"My majorit y was increased by 2,000 as compared with the result of the previous election. Mr KELLY . : - But the honourable member took an unfair advantage over his constituents. I went into his electorate, and found that the argument which had most weight there was an argument addressed to the electors, not only with the usual photograph of the candidate-jus to show how attractive he was-bu t with photographs of Himself, decked but i every costume known to the sartorial In one photograph I found the member portrayed, not only as we see him here-no t only as an ordinary ber of the great plebs-on e of ourselvesbut decked out as even a lily has never been known to bloom. He was shown in indeed. this pamphlet in full evening dress, with his title at the foot. It was not just "" Brother Catts, issuing literature for Labour p a r t y , "" but '"" J . H . Catts, paign Director.""",21

126,Mr KELLY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I did not. I drew attention to the fact that there were in the of that? Labour movement two men named Catts, but that one of them spelt his name in the German fashion. I was particularly careful to spell the honourable member's name "" Catts.""",21

131,Mr WATKINS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"A little b it over the Hilt, waa it not?",21
132,Mr KELLY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I played it up to the hilt, and put it in the right place. That Mr Katz was one of the first men in Australia to lead the revolt against the Prime Minister when he showed his preparedness to do his duty by the country, and he was aided and assisted afterwards by Mr . Catts, the honourable member for Cook. There were two other men with German names-one , I believe, born in Germany, and the other, like Mr Katz, born in Australia-wh o with Mr Katz worked t up the conspiracy in the Melbourne Trades H all which led to Mr Hughes n being ejected from the movement which art. owed more to him than to any other honourable ten men in Australia.",21
133,Mr CONSIDINE,COTTON CULTURE IN,"A recommendation of memthe Prime Minister's services to the Labour movement, by the honourable member for Wentworth, is a recommendation",21
134,Mr KELLY,COTTON CULTURE IN,Let us consider for a moment what sort of a recommendation the it is that we can give. The Prime M in Camister was driven from his party on no principle opposed to his party platform. 'He was driven from it because he did not think that any duty he owed his party was incompatible with his loyalty to his own country.,21
135,Mr FINLAYSON,COTTON CULTURE IN,Who are the judges,21
136,Mr KELLY,COTTON CULTURE IN,I might very well ask who are the judges of still another matter. We have had today the honourable member for Barrier criticising the Government for their prosecution of the Industrial the honourable Workers of the World .,21
137,Mr CONSIDINE,COTTON CULTURE IN,Nothin g of the sort.,21
138,Mr KELLY,COTTON CULTURE IN,And at the same time many honourable member after honourable member on the Opposition benches tell us that he has nothing in common with the In hondustrial Workers of the World . We had I the honourable member for Cook telling Mr Brookfield at the last elections that Melhe must withdraw his statements or go Mr J . H . CATJIS - I did not! agree with ,21
139,Mr KELLY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"And the honourable "" playmember said that he must withdraw his statement or himself . The Labour party at the outset were ^ as firm Mr Brookfield as they were with the Prime Minister. But what pened to Mr Brookfield? He has not withdrawn, and he has not gone out of the party. Not only has he not gone out, but the East Woollahra Labour League, in my own constituency, deof nounced the Central League for pretendburied ing that it was going to put h im out! the organization. It declared that Central Executive had no righit to dicHouse. tate to a member of the Labour organization on a question affecting his science.",21
140,Mr MAHONY,COTTON CULTURE IN,Was that the branch that the honourable member formed in his constituency ?,22
141,Mr KELLY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I should like that terjection to be recorded, since nothing could do more to let the members bers of the East Woollahra Labour League know how sensible is the honortheir able member's appreciation of their efforts. However, that league dently had some weight with the movehave ment, because it s protest againslb any tempt to interfere with "" l i be r t y of conbe removed. science ' ' was enough to save Brookfield, and he is still in the Labour movement. There was liberty of conscience for M Brookfield, but no liberty of conscience for Mr Hughes.

It was because the public realized that fact,. however much men might facts. beat their breasts-that on one side were these forces of disintegration, and on the other were the forces of loyalty-it was for that one prime great reasonthat Australia recorded the verdict she did when she was appealed to last May. If honourable members opposite have any sincerity at all in making this move i connection with sectarian pamphlets, ask them to address themselves to the future. I invite them to make it a broad programme for the future, and to deal merely with the misdeeds of this or that man in connection with elections unfortunately, exist. that are now passed, in the hope of awakening and, perhaps, gaining a party [20]- 2 with advantage out of sectarian differences which no honest man should now wish hap- - to keep alive in Australia.",22

147,Mr FINLAYSON,COTTON CULTURE IN,"That is the sort of r . question that is usually put by a man who is seeking to cover his own misdeeds. The election was certainly one of the most and most keenly-contested that Australia has ever known. The issues that were before the people seemed to most citizens to require a calm, judicial, carer f u l attitude on the part of candidates.. l l the essential facts, which were many and serious, demanded the most careful investigation, and it was imperative that the verdict of the people should be based on a thorough appreciation of thoseB u t , instead of the people being allowed to make up their minds after calm consideration, based upon an intelligent presentation of the facts, all sorts of ' side issues were introduced, with the object of preventing a proper judgment and decision on the part of the electors. U n n doubtedly the sectarian question was the I most disturbing element introduced. The honourable member for Wentworth suggested in his closing remarks that all not parties should unite to destroy the sectarian bitterness and differences which, I heartily agree with that sentiment. I hold my religious opinions strongly, and the fact that I do so incites in me the desire that every should be at liberty to hold his religious opinions just as strongly, and that he should be equally free to express them. That, however, is not the attitude adopted by many today. There are, fortunately, in the community a number of people who are willing to allow that freeparty. dom of thought and of speech in regard, not only to religious, but other questions. kum! But such was the conduct,of affairs during the last general election that no unprejudiced observer, either in Australia or abroad, would believe that it reflected the general feeling of the people.",22
148,Mr BOYD,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Does not the fellow who "" licked "" always squeal? ^ Mr EINLAYSON - Not always. The honourable member, being a man, will appreciate my point when I say that deep down in the hearts of the people of the British Isles there is a sporting stinct which enables them to take a ing with a good spirit, provided that are beaten on fair grounds and after fair trial. I like that sporting instinct, and it is more marked in the British people than in any other people of world. They can put up a fight and take a beating, and the man who is not petent to take a beating is not worthy of a victory. We in Australia are trying to build up a nation, and, necessarily, this nation responsible. must be - built up of many classes- ism of people from all parts of the world, with different ideas and methods, and enscurrilous tirely opposite views. If we accentuate the differences that go back for how are we to. secure in this country united people who will make Australia progress? There is nothing more disinnote tegrating than religious differences. thought we had abolished religious wars; and, so far as actual fighting is concerned, I think we have reached that stage. But follows:it really seems as if we had simply transferred the quarrel and opposition the physical arena to the political arena. No person can deny that the issue of these sectarian leaflets during the election not a religious movement, but a political movement. These pamphlets, under name of Critchley Parker, were not for a religious purpose; they were not party. issued in order to secure some specially religious result, but entirely with the vious purpose of effecting a political reall. man sult. Prom that point of view I contend that they were political .pamphlets, pure -,and simple. It may only be a coincidence, but it is a remarkable and unanswerable fact that their political colour was one-sided-that they were issued as political pamphlets against the Labour",23
149,Mr AUSTIW CHAPMAN,COTTON CULTURE IN,That is bunThey hit me very hard.,23
150,Mr FINLAYSON,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I know they did. They. were issued evidently in order to hit members of a particular faith, and that is why I object to them, no matter is whether they affected members on this side or on the other.",23
151,Mr HEITMANN,COTTON CULTURE IN,That is in opposition Scotchto your previous statement.,23
152,Mr FINLAYSON,COTTON CULTURE IN,"No , it is not, as I shall show. They were issued to secure in the triumph for the National partybeatthat is undeniable. Their whole arguthey ment throughout their issue during the a election period was political; and I am confirmed in that opinion because of a little slip that was attached to them. I the now qubte from the Worker of 2'9th March in reference to the cartoons issued comby the Statesman and Mining StandardThe supplies were so plentiful, and the distribution so thoroughly carried out, that only a devilishly deep-laid scheme could have been Thoroughness of the kind could not have been the result of mere individualand casual chance. ' It is true that Holman disowned the leaflet, but the infamous thing had then been scattered broadcast, and had largely centuries, achieved its hideous purpose. a That was after the State elections in New South Wales. The whole point is in the which was attached to the quotation We from the Worker, and which accompanied the issues of the Statesman and Mining Standard during the Federal election, as .With your help a similar result should be from obtained in the Federal elections. Fresh literature is now ready. Any one going through these publications 'was from beginning to end must see that they are nothing but arguments in favour of the ""downing"" the Labour party and supissued porting the members of the National",23
153,Mr HEITMANN,COTTON CULTURE IN,The only one I saw obhad no reference to political parties at,23
154,Mr FINLAYSON,COTTON CULTURE IN,That they were meant for political purposes is very obvious.,24
155,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Surely no one doubts that? Mr FINLAYSON"" - Honourable memissue bers opposite are denying it . I am firmed in my view by two particular occurrences. The Prime Minister, speaksheets, ing at Bendigo on the 23rd A p r i l , ported to have said I want to say authoritatively that I noticed with considerable pain that certain literature is being circulated in this district, and throughout Australia presumably, which giving offence to certain of my fellow-citizens of the Homan Catholic faith. I want to repudiate this literature, to say that it offensive to me us it is to those who hold different religion to myself. This literature can serve no useful purpose in this campaign. It misunderstands entirely the nature of the issues by which the people are confronted. This campaign has nothing at all to do with religion. I do not deny that - there are some men who are not loyal to Australia, but fact that they are not loyal to Australia nothing at all to do with their religion. Therefore, I want emphatically to repudiate this literature, some ot which is most offenbe sive, arid to say that, as far as I am I shall see that Australia is purged of during the rest of this contest. That is exactly the attitude that was taken up prior to the New South Wales elecinfluence tions! by Mr Holman. A week before the elections, Mr Holman dramatically repudiated the - Critchley Parker leaflets in almost the same terms as those in which the Prime Minister, a fortnight before the Federal elections, repudiated the later issues. It is remarkable that, although the Prime Minister promised at Bendigo, on the 23rd A p r i l , that would see that Australia was purged of this literature during the balance of the election period, no less than tiwo issues took place between the date of the right honourable gentleman's speech and the elections)-No . 3, dated 26th A p r i l , No. 4, dated 3rd May. If the Prime Minister was sincere and honest in that statement that he would purge Australia of this literature, how is it that not able to stop the issue of the numbers of this paper which was causing so much trouble? He was able to do a tremendous lot in the way of stopping the issue of Labour newspapers, and The Editor, was able to exercise a censorship over the press during the election period that can 'tions, never be forgotten in the political history of tha country; but all his protestations, and all his promises at Bendigo as to purging the country of this literature, were so much, clap-trap. Then there is 'another point. The first of this newspaper that came to parconticular notice during the elections was only a comparatively small one of four whereas the later publications is rewere greatly increased in size. No; 2 of the publication was .a very much larger sheet than No. 1, and No. 3 Was twice have the size of No. 2, or four times the size of the first issue. It is a peculiar faot is that the' fourth issue, Bated only two days before the elections, came back to the is original small size. How is it ifliat, as a the money began to come in , and as the surreptitious and bad influence of these leaflets, and tlhe detrimental effect they were apparently having qn the Labour party became evident, the issues increased in size, and that invitations were sent' out the to the people to purchase them at a cheap has rate, with a promise that they would be forwarded so promptly that there would no difficulty in having fheni distriable, buted by those willing to help the Nai t tional cause? Every issue printed asked the public to keep the movement going, and help it along, because of the good it had had againat the Labour party in the New South Wales election, and of the likelihood of a similar effect in the Federal elections. There is another fact that confirms me in the opinion that these issues were meant for a particular purpose, a fact! which, though it may be only a coincidence, is rather significant. The address of the Statesman he and Mining Standard is given as 395 Collins-street, Melbourne, and I have here a copy of a letter sent out by Mr A . S. Whyte, secretary of the National party, who dates it. from the National Campaign Council, National Mutual Buildings, 395 and Collins-street-ith e same address as that of the Statesman and Mining Standard. The letter is dated the 29th March, 1917, and is a copy of one sent out to tlhe he was editors of country newspaperstwo later The National Campaign Council, National Mutual Buildings, 305 Collins-street, Melbourne, 29th March, 1917. Dear Sir,-During the present Federal eleci t is the intention of the National Campaign Council to circulate to the country newspapers of Victoria a daily, budget of brightly written matter bearing on the question. A copy will be forwarded you each day, and the Council will be grateful if you will find room in your journal for such extracts as meet your views. Yours faithfully, Mr Whyte is a very estimable gentleman, and a very capable journalist.",24

But how can we indulge in such hope in view of the fact that yesterday or representatives from a number of States in Melbourne, and decided to form a but federation for the express purpose of keeppublic noted, ing sectarianism alive?  as much right to form a federation as numothers have to form a Catholic Federa",25
181,Mr FINLAYSON,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I am a Protesallow to the Roman such doctrines as he may think fit to believe, reserving the same r i g ht to myself. To Cambuild up the citizenship of this country on r i g ht lines, we should put a stop to sectarianism. I happen to know not only that there is being organized in Victoria the federation to which I have just referred, but also that in Queensland religious feelings are being deliberately and maliciously worked upon for the purposes -> of the next State election, and that probably the next Victorian election, too, will be fought on the sectarian issue. When these elections take place, we shall know the worth of the protestation of honourable members opposite that sectarianism is distasteful and objectionable to them. The honourable member for Cook has mentioned that the pamphlets which have been objected to, and others like tihem are at present in circulation in T the Macquarie electorate, with a view to winning a by-election for the Government of New South Wales. But no usef u l suggestion has been made regarding the .stoppage of sectarianism. - few members hold the same views on this subject that I hold. I have not the - slightest objection to the distribution of religious or political literature of any k in d . Let men prin t what they like. The most malicious lies were published about me and about my comrades of the Labour party during the last election. I have such an absolute love of freedom of speech and freedom of the press that things would have to be very bad indeed before I would interfere with any man for saying what he thought, or with any newspaper for printing what it liked. But when sectarianism is introduced into politics, it is time to call a halt. If these pamphlets had been issued straight out as religious pamphlets, I would not have objected to them. I cannot think that the Roman Catholic, the Presbvterian, the Methodist, or any of the other great Churches, would worry about what - their opponents might say of themi, or be afraid to meetthe arguments advanced against them. To stop the circulation of this literature through the Post Office is in line with the proposal of the Prime Minister last night, to stop the circulation of the Industrial Workers of the World literature. Do honourable members think that a cause can be silenced by chopping off a head or two, or preventing the circulation of literature in support of it ? The history of the world shows that that is impossible. You may silence an individual, but you cannot suppress a movement. It may be crushed, but if there is life and truth in ib, it cannot be stopped. I am so fond of liberty of speech and thought, and conscience, that I am prepared to allow all sorts to have their say.  us out of the Labour party.",25

188,Mr FINLAYSON,COTTON CULTURE IN,"We in this Parliament are responsible, for the purity of the public life of the community. We must keep clean and clear the political issues that the people have to determine at election time. Those who cloud such big issues as were before the electors last May are traitors to Australia. The disloyalists during the last election were those who supported and encouraged the issue of these pamphlets - They did a disservice to Australia, the effect of which will rebound upon themselves. As a man sows, so shall he also reap. The distribution of literature of this kind can result only in a harvest of trouble and sorrow, and I am sure that many honourable members opposite are today heartily ashamed of what was done. Will they not join with us in asking for the appointment of a Royal Commission to find out who was responsible-whethe r Nationalists or Labour men, men in high positions in the religious world, or men without religion? Let us know what men were responsible. It is such men who should bedeported from a country where we are N trying to establish liberty, justice, and freedom.",26
189,Mr BOY D,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Henty) f4.45l - After the fine moral lecture that we have just heard, I feel that the Church of Scotland lost a great minister in the honourable member for Brisbane. His prophecies concerning what will befall the Nationalist party if it does not support the amendment were very painful. I have been in public life in this country for nearly twenty years, and have never yet found it necessary to publicly discuss the religious opinions of any member of the community. During the last electoral campaign I was, for the first time in my political career, asked my views on a religious ouestion, and I replied to the questioner that, as I had never yet felt it necessary to discuss religious matters in public, I did not intend to commence to do so. To the Roman Catholic, the Protestant, the Jew, the Gentile, the Buddhist, and every other person in the community, religion, like politics, is purely a matter of conscience. But when a man drags his religion into public life, he must expect it to be criticised. Were I to discuss my religion publicly, I should expect it to be criticised. I have had no connection with Mr Critchley Parker nor with the pamphlets which have been issued under hi9 name, and knew nothing about them until they had been printed and distributed. I believe that their distribution did not assist this party one iota. The stirring up of religious strife does not help anybody. This literature was printedand distributed to set certain sections of the community at each other's throats, and I deprecate all such action.",26
190,Sir ROBERT BEST,COTTON CULTURE IN,Is that why it was circulated by the other side?,27
191,Mr BOYD,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I do not know why it was circulated by the other side. No doubt, once it was published, those interested in it felt justified in putting it to whatever use they thought would benefit their own cause. They were at liberty to do that, but, personally, I was not interested in the matter in any shape or form. In view of the statements that have been made by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Works and Railways, and other responsible leaders of this party, it is a waste of time to rake up this matter after an interval of so many months, and it will not do credit to this Parliament if we allow this religious strife to be continued. The appointment of a Royal Commission would put the country to great expense, and many folios of evidence would be published that would never be read. How many honourable members have read the evidence accompanying the report of any of the Royal Commissions that have been appointed since this Parliament came into existence ?",27
192,Mr RILEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,Did not the honourable member read the evidence of the Postal Commission ?,27
193,Mr BOYD,COTTON CULTURE IN,"No , and I have not read the evidence of any other Commission. When evidence is published by a Commission like the F r u it Commission, of which the honourable member for Brisbane was a member",27

197,Mr BOYD,COTTON CULTURE IN,"All these Commissions publish reports and minutes of evidence sufficient to sink a ship, and probably the best thing that could happen to these documents would be to be sunk. These Commissions simply absorb the country's money, and give no adequate return for it . In order to discover whether the honourable gentlemen who are moving for the appointment of a Royal Commission are in deadly earnest, and are prepared to do their work purely out of patriotic motives, and in the interests of the public, I move That the following words be added to the amendment:- "" and that no payment be made or expenses allowed to any member of the Royal Commission, or any financial assistance be given by the Commonwealth towards the purchase of creature comforts for the members of the Commission.""",27
198,Mr CHARLTON,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Hunter) [4.52] - I regard tEe question before the House as very important. Most of the preceding speakers have dealt with it from a political and party point of view. This Chamber ought to rise above that level, and in. this time of national stress the national view should predominate. It must be admitted that the circulation, at a time like this, of offensive literature and cartoons respecting an important section of the community is not calculated to promote the best interests of the nation. Honourable members have often said that when the country is at war it is necessary to have unanimity, and to avoid discord. Yet today there is circulating throughout the Commonwealth literature which is most insulting, and is doing much to retard recruiting. For my parti, the late election is past, and counts for nothing. Like the honourable member for Henty, I have fought all my campaigns, seven in number, without ever having once raised the sectarian issue, and I have never permitted it to be introduced at any meefang that I have addressed. Therefore, I can put aside all consideration of the last election when dealing with the matter now before the House. What honourable members should consider is whether the person responsible for the circulation of this offensive matter should be permitted to continue his propaganda, or whether he ought not to be dealt with because of the great in j u r y he has done to the Allies' cause. On the first day of the session I asked the Prime Minister certain questions, and to my surprise his answer lef t me in considerable doubt as to whether the Government, which claims to have sufficient power to do almost anything under the War Precautions Act , could deal with Critchley Parker, who is - supposed to be responsible for tfhe circulation of the sectarian pamphlets referred to. The question I put to the Prime Minister was thisSECTARIAN PAMPHLETS.",27
199,Mr CHARLTON,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Is the Prime Minister aware that pamphlets, signed by one Critchley Parker, and reflecting on Catholics in connection with the war, have been freely circulated throughout the Commonwealth ? Does the Prime Minister consider that such literature is likely to cause dissension between sections of the community at a time when harmony should prevail, and, in consequence, retard recruiting! If so, does the right honourable gentleman intend to take any action under the War Precautions Act against the person referred to, and any other persons issuing lications which may engender strife in the community during the war?",28
200,Mr HUGHES,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I have not seen all the pamphlets, but I have seen-a pamphlet, and I think it most unfortunate that it was circulated. I did what I could to prevent its further circulation. It is apparent from the Prime Minister's answer that he must haveknown what the pamphlets contained; and he said he had done his best to prevent their further circulation. If the honourable gentleman found that he had not sufficient power to prevent the distribution of printed matter of this kind, he ought to have moved immediately in this Parliament to obtain such power in order to prevent a repetition of the offence. I further asked the Prime Minister",28
201,Mr CHARLTON,COTTON CULTURE IN,"In view of the statement of the Prime Minister, that he knows, of no power under which action can be taken against Mr Critchley Parker, will he immediately draw up a regulation under the War Precautions Act in order to prevent such cartoons being circulated by any person or journal?",28
202,Mr HUGHES,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Any literature, by whomsoever circulated, which is prejudicial to recruiting, will be suppressed, whether it is issued by Mr Critchley Parker or any one else, even by the Political Labour Leagues. That answer conveyed to my mind the impression that the Prime Minister had power to deal with any one who did anything prejudicial to recruiting. The question then arises-Did the. issue of these pamphlets, which offended a certain section of the community, do anything to retard recruiting? Certain statements are contained in the pamphlets which give considerable offence to adherents of the Roman Catholic f a it h . Nobody can question that Roman Catholics have responded to the call-of patriotism equally as well as any other section of the community, but even had they not done so, there is no justification for anybody attempting to injure their feelings in this regard.' That, however', was the sole purpose of the issue of these pamphlet's, and the result is that Roman 'Catholic people in different parts of the Commonwealth feel very much hurt hy these publications being permitted to circulate without any effort being made by. the Government to suppress them. It does seem strange that, whilethe Government can censor any news which they do not think desirable to give to the public-and in some respects the Allied cause would be benepub- fited if more information were given to the public-this particular gentleman can issue printed matter which is creating disruption and discord in the community at a time of national crisis, while no power seems to reside in the Government to protect the offended citizens. If that be really so, it is a most deplorable position for the Australian Parliament and people to be in . But I think the Government have power under the War Precautions Act to deal with this matter, and I cannot understand why action has not been taken. I feel sure that honourable members on both sides of the House are anxious to avoid discord at this period. We are desirous of helping the voluntary system, but how can we do that if we allow the arousing of sectarian feeling in regard to the war and other matters. This outrageous conduct should not be permitted for a moment. p Mr HEITMANIT - Othe r papers come within the same category.",28
203,Mr CHARLTON,COTTON CULTURE IN,"If so, why should we not deal with them all? If we withhold certain information from the public because it is not to their advantage to know it, why should we allow the circulation of statements which are doing an immense amount of harm to recruiting? Suppose there were no provision under the War Precautions Act for dealing with this menace to the community, have we not the necessary power under the Post and Telegraph Act? I asked this question of the Postmaster-General1. Is it a fact that a series of pamphlets, .which - apparently contained libellous and grossly offensive matter, issued over the name of Critchley Parker, were recently sent through the post? 4. As section 107 of the Post and 'lelegraph Act 1901-1910 provides that ""any person who knowingly sends-o r attempts to send-by post any postal article which has thereon, or therein, or on the envelope or cover thereof, any words, marks, designs of an indecent, obscene, blasphemous, libellous, or grossly offensive character shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £100, or to a term of imprisonment with or without hard labour for a term not exceeding two years,"" why was the sender of these pamphlets, if they are what they are alleged to be, not prosecuted under this section?",29
204,Mr WEBSTER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. I have been so informed.. I ain legally advised that there is no Commonwealth law to prevent the transmission by post of the pamphlets in question. To my mind, that section clearly expresses the intention of .Parliament that nothing offensive should be allowed to circulate through the Postal Department, and we know that different. Postmasters General in the past have used that section for the suppression of certain literature. If ever Parliament clearly expressed in language what it intended it aid so in that section, and if the section has no application to literature such as Critchley Parker has distributed, it is time' Parliament amended the law. If the channels of the Post Office can be used in time of national stress to sow seeds of dissension amongst the people, the sooner we amend our law the better for all concerned. We are told by the Prime Minister that, although this literature is very injurious, and causing dissension which ist detrimental to the Allies' cause, the Government are powerless to act. At the same time, the Government are constantly acting under the War Precautions Act in connection with other matters. If the Government have not the power to suppress the Critchley Parker literature, they are doing an injustice to others whoseliterature they are suppressing, because, according to the statements of Ministers, they are not acting according to the law. Having regard to the fact that Parliament has enacted legislation to give the Government power in a time of crisis to do anything necessary in the interests of the nation, there is no justification for the statements of the Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General that they have nopower to handle this matter. I assert that already that power is vested in the Government. At a time of - national crisis they can do anything they like under the War Precautions Act; they are in the position of autocrats, and really Parliament cannot interfere with them. We should rise above party considerations in connection with this matter, and resolve to discover who really did circulate this literature. The honourable member for Cook ' is to be commended for having brought forward a proposal to appoint a Royal Commission. That body should have the fullest power to inquire into everything connected with the distribution of sectarian literature, and, so far as expenses are concerned, honourable members on this side are quite ready to agree to the amendment of the honourable member for Henty. We are prepared to act on such a Commission without any remuneration at all, for the purpose of eliciting the fullest information. At the same time, the Government should use the powers they possess in order. to prevent the circulation of offensive literature, which is doing so much harm to the national cause by prejudicing recruiting. The Prime Minister tells us that anything which is prejudicial to requiting will be dealt with immediately. TEis literature has certainly prevented many from enlisting, yet nothing has been done in the matter. If the Government are not prepared to accept the amendment, they at least should give a guarantee that whoever was responsible for this literature should be dealt with in just as any outier person who does thing prejudicial to recruiting is dealt with.",29
205,Mr FOWLER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Perth) [ 5 . 6 ] with the general position taken honourable member for Hunter, and I congratulate him on the unique fact that his speech he carefully and intentionally printed them?"" refrained fro m identifying honourable - members on this side of the House with the issue of the pamphlets referred to. that regard he stands on a very much higher plane than his colleague, the orable member for Brisbane, who made effort, with a disingenuousness which almost appears to be part of his nature, to identify the National Federation the issue of these wretched pamphlets.",30
206,Mr FENTON,COTTON CULTURE IN,Scotch-like .,30
207,Mr FOWLER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"V e r y un-Scotch-like. the Deputy Postmaster-General, A Scotsman always attacks from the front, and not from behind, and makes his weight felt all the more on account adopting that method. I propose attack the honourable member for Brisbane from the front, and to point out the in sidious and unfair method by which he attempted to prove his case. Having disdinary covered that the office from which these pamphlets were issued and the office of an official connected with the National Federation bore the same number in same street, he was prepared to state that fact and allow it to go forth to the publio so that the undoubted deduction could made by every one who read it that they tralia. were one and the same office; whereas the Melbourne Directory shows that the ber which the honourable member for Brisbane gave is .borne by a huge range offices occupied by oyer sixty firms. least, I have counted sixty names of firms, velopes. and there are possibly more. It is absolutely apparent that the honourable ber for Brisbane, in his eagerness identify the National Council with these pamphlets, has put before the country insinuation that is as unfair as it is founded. I would nob have risen speak on this matter but that I felt necessary to indicate some of the methods by which some honourable members oppoFederation site seek to identify those who sit on this side of the House with the pamphlets question. The number of these namphlets circuone lated in Western Australia was not great, but they were sent from Melbourne envelopes, dissociated altogether anyfrom the context of the newspaper to which they belonged, and were addressed in the great majority of cases to leading I agree Roman Catholics who were on the up by the National Federation side.",30
208,Mr WATKINS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Do you think that that in is the point? Is not the point "" who",30
209,Mr FOWLER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I am coming to that question, if the honourable member will In allow me. There is one clear indication that the circulation of these pamphlets in honWestern Australia was not intended for an the benefit of the National Federation candidates, and could not be identified with the National Federation. The matwith ter came under my notice through an indignant Roman Catholic coming into the office of the Federation with a copy of the pamphlet, and I immediately went to and asked him if he had not the power to stop their circulation. He is an old and of experienced servant of the Commonwealth, to and he replied that he had the necessary power, and that he would have no hesita- tion in using it , but, unfortunately, the pamphlets were being circulated in orenvelopes,, and unless the whole of the correspondence that went through the General Post Office in Perth was opened, it would be impossible for him to trace the them. Therefore nothing could be done. I understand that a littl e earlier a few copies of this Australian Statesman and be Mining Standard reached Western Aus",30
210,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,I understand that numthis literature was nob sealed up.,30
211,Mr FOWLER,COTTON CULTURE IN,The great majority of of the pamphlets that reached Western At Australia were enclosed in ordinary en,30
212,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,I can show the honourable memmember one pamphlet bearing the postto m a r k on the document) itself.,30
213,Mr FOWLER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"All I can say is that an a great many individuals must have been unat work, each in his own particular way, to in this regard. At any rate, those operi t was ating in Western Australia were emphatically not on the side of the National candidates. My opinion, which I give for what it is worth, is that some in individual issued the pamphlets for the sake of notoriety. I cannot imagine any doing it in the belief that he was very helping any particular cause. I cannot imagine anyone thinking that the National Federation's cause would be assisted by them, because, I am glad to say, we have a large number of Roman Catholics in the Federation, who are as loyal to the Empire as any of us here, and perhaps are more loyal than some of us, and who have made their sacrifice and done their work in connection with the war, and are entitled to our greatest regard and consideration. I am proud to say that the Roman Catholic Church in Western Australia, in the person of its leading men,, has taken no small part in assisting the Allies in this great war, and that the rank and file of its laity have done their share in volunteering in that State. However, I am equally indignant with honourable members opposite in regard to the issue of these pamphlets, and equally anxious to discover who was responsible. I am prepared to support the amendment if the honourable member for Cook will avoid one possibility in that regard. I do not wish t'o see a Commission appointed consisting of so many partisans on either side.",30
214,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,That is a matter for the Government to decide.,31
215,Mr FOWLER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I am telling the honourable member what I think the Commission ought not to consist of, because it would simply mean accentuating the evil. I cordially agree with the.honourable member for Hunter that the issue of these pamphlets had an undoubtedly prejudicial effect on recruiting,, and that the person who issued' them should have been punished. The Government should have taken the responsibility of punishing him under the War Precautions Act. I do not know why they did not do so. I want to see the matter of the publication of the pamphlets investigated with a view to preventing any possible repetition of such a thing, and with a view to punishing those who were guilty, but I do not wish to see an expensive Commission ap^ pointed that will carry on its work to an unnecessary length with a totally unjustifiable amount of expense. Therefore, I propose to move an amendment on the amendment to add after "" Royal Commission"" the following wordsconsisting of a member of the Supreme Court of Victoria. If we appoint a Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria, we will have an in quiry that will be effective, and that will serve the purpose at which honourable members aim, and one which I am prepared to support, and which is quite justified in the circumstances.",31
216,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Yarra) [5.16] - I do not know whether the honourable member for Cook is willing to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Perth, but I am agreeable to it . We should have an investigation in order to ascertain who issued the cartoons and who printed them. Every one will agree with me that they were absolutely disgraceful. They were certainly very insulting to a very large section of this community. In my opinion, they were issued with the deliberate intention of alienating one section of the community against those who were named in them, and creating bitter feelings in both sections, and inflaming the passions of the people. The honourable member for Perth has deprecated the party issue being brought into this matter. Other honourable members have claimed that members of the Labour party were responsible for having circulated the pamphlets. But if they will look at ' the Victorian newspapers issued before the elections,- they will see that the cartoons were advertised for sale, in papers which were not Labour papers. These advertisements advised people to hurry up and buy No. 2 cartoon as No. 3 would soon be out, and No. 1 was all sold out. Let honourable members turn back the files of the Argus, and see if they cannot discover that advertisement. Is the Argus a Labour newspaper? It may be said that the newspaper was paid for the advertisement. It certainly did its best to boom these cartoons. I understood that, after a time, this particular advertisement was stopped. I suppose it was stopped because the in j u r y that the cartoons were doing was seen, or because it was thought that they were not having the desired effect. I have been in public life a good number of years, but I have never on any platform descended to sectarianism. Sectarianism is a descent, but do honourable members wish to know who started the sectarian question at the recent election ? If so, they can find it in Hansard of the 23rd February of this year, page 10639. When we were discussing the postponement of the parliamentary elections, I was twitting the Prime Minister with having ru n away from conscription. Previously he had said that he had "" seen the l i g h t , "" and on this occasion, I said that he had "" seen the l i g h t , "" that i not a fixed light, but one of those ing lights used in lighthouses which times flash red, and sometimes then the Prime Minister interjected, ,"" The honourable member has seen green."" What did he mean ? ferring to the green light of a railway signal or was he seeking to introduce sectarianism ? It cannot be denied that the Prime Minister then started the secthe tarian cry so far as the last elections were mentconcerned. We have this record in Hansard to prove that he fanned the flame on that occasion.",31
217,Mr WEBSTER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"The honourable member bourne. must be "" green "" if he takes that view.",32
218,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Member s of the Minisorable try twitted me on the day this speech delivered, declaring that the Prime ister had "" scored "" Is it reasonable' say that any man "" scores "" - by introducand ing sectarianism into a fight?

232,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"During the election campaign, at all events, it supported the Nationalist party. It has never supported Labour, - whatever else it may have done. It has always done its best for the propertied classes and for vested interests. In the course of the election' campaign I made one or two interesting discoveries in regard to this literature. After addressing a meeting at Benalla one evening, I had a conversation with a gentleman who told me that he lived in a district close by, where there was no branch of either the National Federation or the Labour party. Two residents of that district, however, wrote-the one as ""secretary of the local Labour branch,"" and the other as "" secretary of the local branch of the National League""-to Critchley Parker for copies of the cartoons that had been advertised. They forwarded the money for them; but, while the cartoons were sent to the man who wrote as secretary of the Nationalist League branch, the other man was not furnished with a copy. The man who applied as secretary of the local branch of the Nationalist League said, ""What is more, I received a second supply, although I had sent no money for it . ""  should give us the names of these gentlemen.",33
233,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I shall be pleased to supply them to the Commission, if it is .appointed. I hope that the House will agree to our proposal, so that we may get at the truth. The honourable member for Wentworth urged this afternoon that everything relating to the recent election, should be forgotten. There are some things, however, which cannot be overlooked. I hope that at the first opportunity we shall remove from the Electoral Act the provision limiting the expenditure of candidates. Every one knows that it is a fraud. There are not more than half-a-dozen members who can honestly sign the declaration that their expenses did nut exceed £100.  ber include himself among the number?",33

237,Mr WEBSTER,COTTON CULTURE IN,In the honourable member's case ithere was practically no election.,33
238,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I live in my electorate, the people know me, and they trust me. At the last election I was given a larger vote than ever before, so that, having regard to the scurrilous attacks which were made upon meby the two morning newspapers, I have every reason to be proud. Returning to the question which we have been discussing, I would remind the House that those who make the most of sectarianism have no religious feeling or instinct. The sectarian cry is absolutely opposed to true religion, and those who raise it are, for the most part, people who never darken the doors of a church, and who are as far removed from Christianity as the earth is from the heavens. I hope that the motion for the appointment of a Commission will be carried. As to the amendment, it does not affect me in the least. It has never been my privilege to be a member of a Royal Commission, and I care not whether members of this Commission be paid or not. There ought certainly to be an inquiry as to who was responsible for the circulation of this sectarian literature, and, if necessary, we should provide for an amendment cf the electoral law to prevent the recurrence of such a thing. It certainly reflects nocredit on any one who was associated with it at the last general election.",33

H o good purpose can be perved by these attempts to throw mud. I should like, for a moment, to put before honourable members my own position. For a long time after setting out on the election campaign, I was not aware that this literature was being circulated. Indeed, I was half way through the fight when I first learned that sectarian pamphlets were being sent through the post, principally to I r is h people in my district, and, as the result of it , I lost many good friends.

240,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COTTON CULTURE IN,"It was the experience of most honourable members - on this side of the House. In endeavouring to ascertain who were responsible for the circulation of this literature, one naturally asks, "" Who were most likely to be injured by these pamphlets?"" and the only answer that can be given is that they injured our National party.. Throughout New .South Wales they did our party much harm. They lost us thousands of votes, and also many good friends. heard a rumour that the pamphlets were being reprinted on behalf of one section of the community. It is a remarkable fact that these pamphlets were posted to only one section of the electors, and the position grew so "" h o t "" that I had to issue an advertisement and send circulars round the district in reference to the matter.",34

"" I never heard a "" thinner "" suggestion in my life, and it is certainly one not worthy of the honourable member for Yarra. There is no necessity to introduce these sectarian issues.",34
246,Mr TTJDOB,COTTON CULTURE IN,I said so at the time.,34
247,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COTTON CULTURE IN,And you charged the Prime Minister with starting them.,34
248,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Of course, he did ! I Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I contend that we ought to try to find out by whom these pamphlets and cartoons were circulated, and punish them and I am T sure that we shall find it was not the Nationalists. Many of the electors thought that we were responsible, but it is a sort of thing that I would entirely repudiate. I do not accuse every honourable member opposite of using these means to further their party purposes, because I know that the honourable member for Newcastle, for in stance, and others, would not stoop to such measures. I say unhesitatingly, however, from my own knowledge and judgment, that it was the friends and supporters of honourable members opposite in New South Wales-the Caucusites - wh o spread this literature and made capital out of it . There is no doubt that a resort to sectarian disputes is despicable, and fortunately does not count for much where I come from. We can .tolerate each other, and allow every man to go to his own warm spot in his own way. That reminds me of an old pensioner for whom I obtained a pension, and who, in thanking me, said, "" God bless y o u ; may you have a warm spot in this world, and. the next world, too."" Surely we ought to be able to fight our battles on principle, quite apart from dirty business of this kind. I do lieve that any decent Labour man was behind the movement, but, emphatically, it injured the National party, and it was evident from the very commencement that it would do so. Under the circumstances, as I say, it is absurd to charge the National party with having anything do with the business. I hope we shall find out, and punish, the guilty find parties. While I do not believe that this move had its origin in the future Labour party, I am of opinion that, when friends and supporters of that party found out. the effect of the pamphlets, they obtained special numbers, and tributed them ad lib. It is notorious that this literature was always posted the supporters of the National party.",34

It seems to be perfect mania on their part to ascribe every trouble to that honourable gentleforward man, of whom, however, I am not a chamsent pion, for I am ready to "" c l o u t "" him, or any one else, when I think they are behaving badly. In my opinion, this literaour ture was distributed for the purpose of injuring the National party I represent, and, therefore, I resent the insinuation that we had anything to do with it. have no doubt that a properly-constituted inquiry would prove that the movement was handled by the enemies of the really National party in New South Wales.",35
252,Mr RILEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"South Sydney) [5.40] After the remarks of the honourable memThe° ber for Eden-Monaro, I feel quite conand fident that the House will appoint a Royal Commission. I lay no charge against of these documents. honourable members opposite. In my own electorate I took no notice of the pamphlets, which I do not think affected us as a party one way or the other. Efforts weremade to injure the Labour party declaring that it was dominated by Rome, Commission. and the people were asked whether they were prepared to trust members who were controlled by the Pope, and so forth; and not bewhile the pamphlets may not have injured the Labour party, the intention was to interfere with that party's chances at the election. If , as stated, the National party have suffered, there can be no harm in instituting an inquiry with the object of sheeting the blame home to the proper to people. I hope that in Australia we shall never reach the position that we in Ireland, where the people are rent in twain by sectarianism, but that in all elections pamphlets of this kind will not be permitted to go through the post. In this young country we have no room for sectarian bigots who desire to disstir up strife amongst the people. In political matters we can afford to be geneto rous to one another; but if the sectarian feeling is allowed to grow we shall"" find ourselves .confronted, not with political, with religious, issues. I remind honourable members opposite that, while they may have won at the last election, we may win the next, and that the party relies for success 'on sectarianism Comcan last only for a short time. No matthe ter what a man's religion may be, he to be judged on his political policy and character. I do not happen to be a opmember of the Church of Rome, but I a have many good friends who are, and I find them as honourable and as straightas any in the community. I rethe fact that such insults should <be thrown at our follow citizens, for there is - no doubt that if we allow 25 per cent, of population to be thus treated, there will be created a bad feeling which will be very hard to eradicate. I appeal to both sides of the House to allow a Royal I Commission to be appointed-eithe r a Commission consisting of the Chief Justice, or an unpaid body of men-for we ought to get at the bottom of this matter, with a view to preventing any re- currence of such issues in the future. Prime Minister and his colleagues, the members of the National party, say they had nothing to do with the issue",35

255,Mr LYNCH,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Werriwa) [5.46] - Whil e I feel that a great grievance exists in .consequence of the publication of these pernicious pamphlets, I think the discussion has within it a strong element of in sincerity. I am proud of my race and creed at all times, but I must say .that I felt humiliated during my campaign when I had these things pushed under my nose by my co-religionists, and some of the members of the old Labour party. I only discovered the circulation of this literature when the campaign was half over, and I never opened my mouth regarding it at any time-the thing was really too dirty to refer to. We have very small pretensions to be considered a democratic community while it is possible for gutter-sniping tactics of this sort to affect us. When our very existence, involving not only our religious liberties,but our every other prized liberty, is in the balance; could there be suggested a greater reflection on our democracy than the idea that tactics of this kind can really settle the fate of parties and principles so vital to us? It is true that even in this fair land we have literary prostitutes engaged in their despicable work-huma n blowflies not content with battening on their natural element, filth, but equally ready to pounce on what is pure and true. Unfortunately this sort of thing has its effects. We find men on all sides who have such a poor conception of higher principles that they are willing to descend into the gutter, and plant in the minds and hearts of ignorant! but honest people feelings of antagonism and antipathy towards those with whom they should be standing shoulder to shoulder in the preservation of all our rights and liberties, and the material prosperity of the country. That sort of thing is going on now, and it will never be extinct, even if we appointed a dozen Royal Commissions, u n t i l education Has made such progress that no self-respecting man would connect himself with this sort of thing under any circumstances. My co-religionists in hundreds were influenced by this literature to vote against me, but I would rather have to dig out rabhonorable bits for a living than be elected by the votes of those to whom such filth could appeal. The Government of which I am a supporter should provide for an inquiry to purge itself of the charge made against it. Let us find out who circulated this literature, and who paid for its circulation. It seems to me that money can command anything. But if our Democracy is to attain the ideals that we seek, it is essential to purge ourselves of sectarianism. When in Victoria a dominant and militant body were excommunicating from the Labour party a section of Catholics because of the opinions they dared to hold I was in arms against that, as I was against the action of the same body when it expelled the ablest and best members of the party for holding other opinions. Whether literature of this kind be issued with the object of gaining political power or with the desire to injure the religious feelings .of others, we should prevent it . I trust that an inquiry will sheet home the blame to the persons responsible for what we deplore, and that our desire for liberty and toleration will have a foundation on actual fact. I believe that there are criminal zealots on both sides of politics, and I hope that those who have been responsible for the publication of this literature will be discovered, and the rest of the community purged of the gross reflections upon it which their action has caused.",36
256,Mr WATKINS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Newcastle) [5.53] I agree with much that was said by the last speaker. The'demand for the stoppage of the circulation of sectarian literature of the kind complained of comes not from a. small section of the people, but from a very large body of the community, who feel that they were grievously in sulted by what occurred during the last electoral campaign. The circulation of political literature at election times is to me not a matter of much concern. During nearly a quarter of a century of political experience I have known such literature to be circulated by every political party; but sectarianism should not have been allowed by the powers that be to intrude into the recent contest. Under the War Precautions Act the Government had full authority to prevent that. This is, I suppose, the freest Democracy in the world, and no more serious harm could be done to it than to divide our people with religious dissension. In this country, persons of every creed are inter-married, and religion is in no sense a party matter. An y political party that sought advantage by stirring up sectarian feeling should be sent into political oblivion. printed the publications of which complaint has been made, but there is some question as to who distributed them. The distribution cannot be considered as blameable as the original production.",36

260,Mr WATKINS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"My contention is that if a man issued a document in order to injure me, and I found that I could, by giving it a still further circulation, , jure him, I could not be considered as guilty as he. I do not care who was blame in this matter; the fact remains that the circulation of this literature permitted under the censorship, and that is still continuing. If the circulation literature is in j u r in g recruiting, as believe, the Government should ascertain who is responsible for its circulation, should put an end to it . every creed have volunteered tq serve the Front, and are fighting side-by side, or have been buried side by side. I seen cemeteries where the names on the the poll. graves show that men of all creeds sleep beneath, and, to me, it seems and a shame that the distribution of literature calculated to divide the fathers and mothers of the boys who have fame for this country on the battlethousands fields of France and Turkey should be permitted. Whether a Commishave sion be appointed or not, the Goture vernment/ should find out who were re in j u r y. sponsible for the circulation of this literature, and, furthermore, should prevent its further circulation, treating it as they would treat disloyal literature. Surely nothing could be more disloyal ""wowsers."" than to circulate publications like those that have been referred to this afternoon; nothing could be more harmful to the community. Y et those who printed this literature are in receipt of Government money for work done. The Government has patronized those whose publications have. done more to harm recruiting than anything else that has taken place since We know who the war began.

My contention was, and is, that obeyed. each member of the party should have had perfect freedom to vote as he pleased on the conscription issue, because it was not part of the platform.

279,Dr MALONEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Melbourne) [6.10] I desire to approach this question with all seriousness. Looking back over a long political life, I believe there was more bigotry and sectarianism introduced in the last election than in any other in my recollection. That was so, not only in Victoria, but in other States that I have visited. What has happened in the last few months makes one wonder whether this accursed sectarianism, which is' the flaming sword of what we call bigotry, will ever be eliminated. I take ib that the honourable member for Grey wishes the light to be thrown on this matter, the truth found, and the f a u l t exposed. so, he will vote for the appointment of a Royal Commission; but if he is supporting the issue of this scurrilous matterand I should be sorry to believe that of him-h e will vote against the proposal. What were these pamphlets? Those who take an interest in caricature must have smiled when they found the authors serried diving back into the early part of last century to find something with which to lash a section of the community. They went back to the time of Daniel O'Connell, when no Catholic in Ireland had a vote. Very few people in Ireland have votes now, because, according to the latest issue of Whittaker's Almanac, only one man in three in Ireland has a vote. Critchley Parker is a man of great mentality.",39

285,Dr MALONEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I should be sorry to think that filthy lucre prompted him to do this work. When we see such bigotry in the community, we cannot wonder that the great K in g Akbar tried to have only one religion in his domain. In his lips Tennyson placed these eloquent' wordsI tremble at the Moslem and the sword, I shudder at the Christian and the stake. On one occasion in the Sbate Parliament I helped to get Sir George Turner out of a difficulty by suggesting a meeting of representatives of all religious denominations in order to arrive ab an agreement on a simple prayer to be read in the State schools. The then Premier of Victoria thanked me for my suggestion, but what was the result? The conference culminated in a book of large dimensions issued at a cost of 18s. Like K in g Akbar, I then lost all hope of composing religious differences; but I never bhought to see religious bigotry become so active and bitter as. it . has been in the last few months. The Prime Minister will admit that no honourable member of the House If has defended bigotry and sectarianism. The mover of the amendment was only too willing to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Perth bhat a Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria should be appointed as a Royal Commissioner. I think I voice the sentiments of a major it y of those who hold the faith in which I was brought up when I say that we should have no objection to any decent member of a Protestant faith , whether he belongs to the Anglican, the Presbyterian, or the Methodist Church, being appointed to inquire into this matter. We do hot wish any bigot to be appointed. desire an inquiry that will discover who printed this matter, and who circulated it ; and if punishment is due, let it be administered. Nobody in this Chamber has defended the action of Mr Critchley Parker. Why , then, should there be an objection to a Commission of inquiry? Let us throw light upon this matter. There is no higher religion than the truth . Let us know the truth , so that we may prevent, the repetition of these offences in the future, because there is no greater curse than sectarianism and bigotry. As one who has reverence for the faith! taught at his mother's knee, I have never pointed the finger of scorn ab any religion, although sometimes I have had to criticise strongly the members of various denominations. I have always hoped that 'this century would see the last of the curse of sectarianism and bigotry, and also of war. I look through the eyes of that great French poeb, Victor Hugo, a portion of whose works I have had the honour to translate, and I hope that his visions will be realized. Speaking of this century in which we are permitted to.live, but in which he, like Moses on Mount Pisgah, in sight of the Promised Land, was not destined to live, he s a i d All bail to that coming. century whose dawn in rainbow hues of glory is upon us, when war will be dead, when poverty will be dead, when kings will be dead, and when bigotry will be dead, but when men shall live; when for all there will be but one,country, and that country the whole, .broad, teeming earth; when for all there will be but one hope, and that hope the widest heavens. All hail to that coming century which shall hold our children, and which pur children shall inherit. What a glorious day it will he when bigotry is dead. As the honourable memthem. ber for Newcastle has said, our religions are made for us before we are born. What honourable member' has been converted from, the religion of his parents? Ministry have only to say the word. Let them choose the Commission. We do not ask for any choice in the matter. A l ask is that .there shall be a Commission in which honourable members from both sides and the people can have confidence, and then such a blow will be dealt at sectarianism and bigotry that, in years to come, the people will rejoice at the common sense displayed by this Parliament We in coming to the decision which we hope to see made to-night.",39
286,Mr COESEE,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Wide Bay) [6.22] In my political career I have always denounced sectarianism. It is a matter that should not be introduced into politics. Holding these views, I am certainly in favour of this matter being settled, and settled, I hope, once and for all. I shall support the amendment put forward by the 'honourable member for Perth. During the recent elections hundreds of the electors of Wide Bay, men who had voted for me time after time in the State elections, turned against me, because they said that, the Nationalist party was responsible for the circulation of 'Critchley Parker's literature to which reference has been made today. Of course, I denied it , and I had every reason to do so, because I Tecognised that if the pamphlets had been circulated by the Nationalist party, they would not have been sent to the people to whom they were sent in my electorate-the majority of these diabolical circulars were sent to Roman Catholics. Not a twentieth part of them went to the Protestants in Wide Bay. I found afterwards that these men to whom I .have referred, in very many cases, got these pamphlets thrqugh the circulation of them by the Labour party. For example, a railway guard who delayed his train in order to distribute them at different spots, was a strong Labour man. Another strong Labour agitator not only circulated the pamphlets, but also put his initials on the back of them. If a Royal Commission is appointed, I trust that this man will be called upon to show .where he got them, and why he circulated",40
287,Mr MATHEWS,COTTON CULTURE IN,Did he print them?,40
288,Mr CORSER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"It is a strange thing The that a Labour newspaper could say a week before these things were issued that their readers should look out for the cirl we culation of such literature, and that it - would appear week before the elections. It did appear a week before the elections. The circulars, were not placed in open able. envelopes, or addressed on the back, one honourable member has said. They were placed in closed envelopes. I had two addressed to me, and I have them my possession now. A man who circulated those pamphlets, knowing of their offensive character, just as bad as one who hears a libel circulates it. It is just as well that should get at the bottom of this matter, and see who is to blame. I told my tors that I had nothing to do with circulars, and that neither the Liberal party nor the National party would sanctioned such things. The Prime Minof ister denied any knowledge of the matter, and the secretaries of many of our National organizations stated in the press that they could not be sponsible for the circulation of any literature that did not appeaT above their signatures. What further proof could we have than those statecensor ments? Yet some people had the idea - driven into their minds that these phlets emanated from the National party, and they were so irritated by what was contained in the literature circulated, that they refused to vote for any National candidate, though at previous elections they had always voted for the men standture ing in the interests of the National party. the campaign. I told them that I intended ,to support the party which I considered the best the community as a whole, and that - was not to be drawn from the track, even if they wished to be so drawn away, by literature of such a character. I told them that if they chose to be drawn away by it, I did not seek their votes. one district I was asked whether it was not true that the National party were responsible for the money 'which vided for the circulation of the pamashamed. phlets. My reply was that I did not believe for a moment that the National party would put their money into, or recognise in the slightest degree, literature of such a kind. I do not care man's religion is. I hold with any man who practises what he believes to be right, and respects the religion he professes. We are all taught that without charity we cannot be saved.

We are the taught to judge, not, that we be not judged. It is not our province to say have who is right, and who is wrong. Some my dearest friends are adherents of several different churches, and I should be very sorry to say, in respect of their religious beliefs, one word that would in reany way hurt their feelings. Just before the House was dissolved, the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister whether he intended to any literature that might be issued so in connection with the then forthcoming pamelections, and the answer he received from the right honourable gentleman on the floor of the House was that he would not. I should be very sorry to think that, in putting that question, the Leader of the Opposition had any thought of literaof this kind being circulated during But thinking over the matter subsequently, it seemed to me that for he was tying down the Prime Minister to I a promise not .to censor something the circulation of which was contemplated.

294,Mr CONSIDINE,COTTON CULTURE IN,"If the honourable member has studied the subject of anarchy, he must know what it means. The literature of which complaint has been made represents an attack, not only on the faith of a large majority of the Irish people, but upon Irishmen generally, whether they be Protestants or Roman Catholics, or profess no religious belief whatever. Here is an extract from one of the pamphlets printed by Mr Critchley Parker:In fact, the sufferings of Ireland have not been above but very markedly below the average; thirdly, such wrongs as she has suffered have been all , without exception, brought upon her by her own treachery and cowardly brutality. Let us consider each of these three points. That the wrongs of Ireland are in the past is admitted by every unprejudiced observer. It is admitted inferentially by the Irish malcontents themselves when they invariably seek for a pretext for their treacheries! in the wrongs of the past. In point of fact,, for many years past Ireland has been the spoilt darling of the United Kingdom. It has had lawB passed in favour of its peasantry that thefarmers in Great Britain would give a great deal to have extended to them. Why, .then, do. the Irish always turn to the wrongs of the past? ' The answer is, firstly, that they are stuffed up in their priest guided schools with a history deliberately falsified in the interests of the Catholic Church in order to keep them Roman Catholic, and to keep them dissatisfied with Great Britai n for fear that Catholicism imight be undermined; and secondly, that they are a people given to living in the past, a people with little or no reasoning faculty, bu t with an immense amount of vindictiveness, and a people also who have a curious liking for the feeling that they are suffering injustice. They are not really happy unless they can see that they are suffering some grievous wrong; and as they cannot find any injustice in their treatment today, they try to persuade themselves, that they are still suffering from the injustices bf the past. Now for the second point. Get an Irishman with all that power of insincere eloquence which is characteristic of the race, and which mokes them all, or on enormously large percentage of them, "" playboys "" of thet Christy-Mahon type to hold forth upon the historic wrongs of ""dear old Ireland,"" and then compare al l that he has said (at least fifty per cent, of which may be discounted) with the story of Servia, the"" story of Poland, the story of Prance, and the story' of Spain in the grip, of its beloved Church in its palmy days, the story of the Jews, the story of the natives of Peru, the story of almost any country and any people that has played a big part in history, and the woes of Ireland wilr fade away intothe t r i v i a l things that they always have been-the t r i v i a l woes of an essentially t r i v i a l people. And so the article continues. Although the basis of the attack is claimed to be the influence of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, it cannot be denied that it is an attack on the Irish as a race. It accuses them of being treacherous, unreliable, disloyal, and of having no real grievance. It is a remarkable fact that, as pointed out by the honourable member for Brisbane, the pamphlets and newspapers complained of were circulated throughout New South Wales in the first place in connection with the State elections.  did not see any of them.",42
295,Mr CONSIDINE,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I am referring to the Statesman and Mining Standard^ edited by Critchley Parker.  ber spoke of newspapers. The newspaper he has named is circulated in Victoria, not in New South Wales.",42
296,Mr CONSIDINE,COTTON CULTURE IN,"In this particular instance it happens to have crossed the Border. It was circulated throughout the length and breadth of New South Wales during the last State elections. As the honourable member for Brisbane has said, when the Federal elections took place, Critchley Parker pointed to the great victory that had been achieved as the result of the distribution of this scurrilous literature, and urged that as an added reason for its further dissemination. The injustice of the whole thing, to my mind, is that a man should be permitted to print and circulate this literature for the purpose of creating religious bigotry and hatred amongst the working section of the community, with the object of dividing the workers, destroying their organization, and thus benefiting the people most interested in bringing them to loggerheads. No man will say that this literature is likely to have a good effect on any man born in Ireland or of Irish parents. It cannot be said that its circulation is likely to lead to harmonious relations between Irishmen and those born in other parts of the United Kingdom. It was circulated with the sole object of creating discord. On the one hand we see people being constantly prosecuted under the War Precautions Act for making remarks, regarding the huge profits that, are being reaped during the present war. When people attack profits, prosecutions follow; but when other people attack sections of the community who have been born in a different land, or profess a different faith, no prosecutions are launched. More harm was done from a recruiting stand-point - and I am no apologist for that - by the distribution of these pamphlets and cartoons than ever was done by the statements made by Brookfield and others. As I said before, we find, the Barrier Truth being prosecuted for publishing opinions that could in no way be construed as being half as offensive or half as effective as these publications; and Labour men are continually proceeded against for making statements, while other men and other newspapers are permitted to make statements infinitely more damaging.",43

303,Mr CONSIDINE,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I do not wish to burke the question; I am not against recruiting, because I believe that there should be no interference with the man who thinks it his duty to go to the war; but there should be no compulsion on the man who does not think it is 'his duty to go.",43

I am not going to burke that position, because I am prepared .to stand by anything I say here, just as I was prepared to stand by anything I said outside.

310,Mr CONSIDINE,COTTON CULTURE IN,"The Labour Volunteer Army is an anti-conscription organization, which was formed prior to the referendum in October last, for the purpose of fighting conscription, and it has done good work in that direction. I have no wish to deny my association with the Labour Volunteer Army, because I am proud of the fight that it put up at Broken Hill, and proud to have been a member of it.",44
311,Sir ROBERT BEST,COTTON CULTURE IN,What was the object of its formation t,44
312,Mr CONSIDINE,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I have told you the object. So far as my own personal position is concerned I have not to ask the honourable member for Grey, or any other honourable member of this Parliament, what my opinions shall be, nor, having certain opinions, have I to ask - their leave to express them. The honourable member for Grey may have done much for the Labour movement in his time. I do not know whether he has done so or not, and I am not here to say that he has not; but, for myself, I am only a young man, thirty-one years of age. I came to this country when four years of age, and I have worked for my living from my thirteenth year up to the present time. I have never lived on the Labour movement, despite the charges that were' made during the recent campaign by the Prime Minister and others. During the whole of my years in Australia the Labour movement has not benefited me personally, with the exception of placing me - in the position I now occupy. I have expressed my views, and I have worked for my living; and if by any chance I should be removed from this Parliament, I shall be prepared to do the same again. I shall also be prepared to stand by those opinions which placed me in this assembly, and which put me in other places outside Parliament, as the Prime Minister may remember, if he recalls the coal strike, when Bowling, and others were gaoled. I am not going to change my views because I happen to find myself in this Parliament. I did not come here for the purpose of securing a reputation as a nice sort of gentleman, affable with both sides of the House. The people who placed me here did so in order that I might voice their opinion as to what action should be taken by this Parliament. They sent me here because they thought they 'could trust me to express the aspirations of the Labour movement inside Parliament, just as they had trusted me to express them outside. As to my position, so far as recruiting and conscription are concerned, I believe that all wars are caused by conflicts between the various nations to secure markets. I cannot help seeing that huge profits are being made out of the war, and that the patriotism of others is being profitably exploited by people in this and other countries. I realise that those who, because of their age or for other reasons, are what in Broken Hill we term the ""Would-to-God Brigade""-wh o boast of their patriotism, and wish they were young so that they might go to the trenches - ar e today making much profit out of the blood and suffering of the men at the Pront and their dependants. Let me tell honourable members opposite that many who have gone to the war and fought, and have come back, are my personal friends; and they are not those who are squealing - it is not from them that the criticism comes, but from ""the stay-at-home, profiteering patriots.",44
313,Mr OBCHABD,COTTON CULTURE IN,"This is all very interesting, but what has it to do with the motion ?",44
314,Mr CONSIDINE,COTTON CULTURE IN,"It has this to do with the motion: that I do not propose to sit down silent while honourable members ask for the reasons of my attitude. They have asked for those reasons, and I am prepared to give them. It has been stated by honourable members on the other side that none of them had anything to do with the raising of the sectarian cry. The Prime Minister, in the course of his election campaign at Bendigo, when dealing with Mr Brookfield, Adela Pankhurst, and myself, is reported to have gone to some length in explaining to his constituents that I am blessed with the name of Michael Patrick Considine. The honourable gentleman fcnows his reason for emphasizing the fact - that I possess those names; and honourable members may judge whether it was for the purpose of pointing out that I was - either I r is h born, of I r is h extraction, or humbug. a member of the Roman Catholic f a it h . I do not know myself, and perhaps the Prime Minister may explain; but I say that statements of that character lend colour to the belief that certain men, at any rate, were interested in raising the sectarian issue. I know that during the campaign at Broken Hill the local - organ representing the National interest was published day after day with leading articles raising the same cry, and also raising the Sinn Pein cry. These people were allowed to publish such scandalous stuff with impunity, while other men are persecuted as soon as they touch the subject. The whole thing calls for a Commission of inquiry. I do not care whether it is discovered that honourable members on this side, or anywhere else, are responsible for the dissemination of this literature-whethe r or not Labour leagues or unions are found to be guilty. Whoever is engaged in the nefarious business of trying to stir up religious animosity with a view to dividing the workers, I am against all such effort, and will support any course of action which tends bo prevent it .",44
315,Mr HUGHES,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [ 8 . 1 2 ] 'have not had the advantage of listening this debate from its inception, but i I have listened to is a sample of what I have missed, I am not sorry that circumstances prevented me from being present. Of all the impudent and audacious efforts ever made in this or any other Parliacommitted ment to fasten on their opponents the and guilt that belong to the accusers, is the most audacious and the most dent. Those gentlemen, who are now literature, posing as the victims of the methods which they take exception, wish the public to believe that they themselves went through the election dressed in spottoons. less garb, their bro^s garlanded with emblems of purity, and that their thods were unstained by slander, abuse, OT vile innuendo. Their conduct, i would appear, was such as to be a very pattern for lesser men to follow. They him.. f all upon this literature of Mr Critchley Parker as if it was a thing f o u l beyond the power of words to describe- a thing against which their very souls revolt, and but for which they would have won the election. Sir, this is so much canting Why, I say deliberately that there is not a sink of iniquity that they did not bottom, not a term of foul abuse to which they did not resort, not a device at their disposal which they did not employ. They denounce the literature as sectarian ; but they have omitted to mention jthati before Mr Critchley Parker appeared on the scene a banner-bearer from the other camp carried the oriflamme of sectarianism throughout the country, inviting the disloyalists to rally round his flag. This man, for political and sectional purposes, abused and debased his high position. Now, those who sought to shelter under his wing, and found too late that it was one from which the feathers had moulted, come whining about the sectarian literature of Mr Critchley Parker. Having been beaten with ignominy by an indignant people, they ask for the appointment of a Royal Commission into this matter as though this literature, and not their own conduct, was the cause of their defeat. These gentlemen would have the public believe their methods during the campaign were above criticism. Sir, the truth is, they were beneath contempt. I have a - file of extracts from the journals which - I supported them, but I have too much reto spect for this Chamber to lay them on the f what table. Their press reeked with abuse of me, and they lived on this vilification during the election. Ha d I been a Lucifer dipped in the seven hells, I could not have been so bad as they represented me to be, nor has my life been long enough to have one-twentieth part of the sins crimes with which they charged me. Now, this having had the worse of the contest, they impucomplain of Mr Critchley Parker's but for which, they, say, they to would have won the election. Let me now say a word on these carSo far as Mr Critchley Parker's loyalty to the Empire is concerned, I merespect him, and would have honourable members of the Labour party emulate t him ; but, so far as he is responsible for raising, the sectarian banner, I condemn What is more, I condemned him during the election campaign, and did what I could to suppress the literature about ""which complaint was made. This I did in terms so emphatic and unambiguous as to leave no room for misunderstanding as to my views concerning it . This is what I said at BridgewaterI liave endeavoured to fight my political battles treating as sacrosanct the religions actions of my fellow citizens. I do so now, and I want to say authoritatively that I have noticed with considerable pain that certain literature is being circulated in this district, and throughout the rest of Australia, which is giving offence to certain of my fellow citizens of the Roman Catholic faith. I care nothing what the religion of a man is. He is free to worship God in any way he pleases. That is one of those privileges that our fathers have won for us, and I should be the last man to infringe that right. So I want to repudiate this literature, and say that it is as offensive to me as to those who belong to the Roman Catholic Church. This literature can serve no useful purpose in this campaign. It misunderstands entirely the issues with which the people aTe confronted. This campaign has nothing at all to do with religion. It haseverything to do with principles, political, economic, and national. It is a question whether a man is for Australia or against her. I do not deny that there are some men in Australia who are not loyal to Australia; but the fact that they are not loyal to Australia has nothing to do with their religion. Therefore, I want emphatically to repudiate this literature, and I will see, so far as I am able, that Australia is purged of it for the rest of this contest. Subsequently, Archbishop Mannix, speakthing ing of the Critchley Parker literature, circulation of which the Labour party now denounce, said thatHe was glad to hear that the Labour in Bendigo had been wise enough to buy cartoons and distribute them to the Catholic people and every honest man in Bendigo. My reply was-and I now repeat it that that was a shameful and abominable Barrier Miner f thing to do. It would have been dishonourable in a Protestant, but it was contemptible and treacherous in a man professing the religion, of the Archdoes bishop. What shall we say of men tors. who, to gain a political or sectional end, distribute literature which in sults their co-religionists? In pudiation that I have read, I stated that I would take action, and I instructed the Solicitor-General to notify Mr Critchley Parker that under no circumstances would this literature be permitted to circulated. But, as I told the honourable member for Hume, in reply to a question of their religion. which he put to me in the House, there no law in force in Australia under which this literature could be suppressed. I - could be suppressed only by the exercise of our powers under the War PrecautionsAct, and therefore, short of raiding the office, nothing could have been done regarding it . Now, will any one say that this literature prejudiced recruiting ? It was an appeal to sectarianism, and for that I condemned it ; but it certainly did not dissuade men from enlisting. On the other hand, it strongly urged them to fight for their country. In any case, in what way does this literature stand out amongst that circulated during the electoral campaign which might affect recruiting ? Had it been the only literature of its kind, I should have been to blame for not having suppressed it . But the pledge I gave in Parliament before the campaign opened is a sufficient answer to the charge now brought against me. I said to honourable members opposite, who strongly urged that no censorship be imposed on free speech, that they might say what they pleased. Honourable members opposite, and those who supported them, took full advantage of that assurance. If there was anything that they could thenhave said that they did not say, I invite them to say it now. But they are like squeezed lemons. They exhausted their venom during the campaign, and anythat they might say now would be the but the pale ghost of their electoral utterances. They were given a fair run. The Censor did not interfere with them, party and there was no depth of abuse to which the they could descend into which they did not plunge, so far as personal abuse of myself was concerned.",45

This literature which the reappealed to sectarianism I condemned, and I sincerely regret that it was circulated. I have lived all my life in peace and harmony with my fellow citizens of all creeds. No man can say that in any be contest, or in any place, I have sought to create dissensions between men because Amongst my best is friends in this country are many Roman Catholics - But there are men in this t country who are grossly disloyal, and to them. I am opposed, whether they be ProThe testants or Catholics. In the Critchley Parker literature, although I severely condemn it because of its sectarianism, see nothing to prejudice recruiting, but during the campaign hundreds of stateand ments were made by candidates standing for the Official Labour party - which had that effect. The utterances of the honi orable member for Barrier were directed to that end, and even since the election has made remarks which cannot but have had that effect. Then only recently resolution was passed by the Trades H all Council in MelbourneThat, in the opinion of this Council, the Political Labour Council Executive should call upon all Labour members of Parliament to fuse to assist in recruiting. Honourable members have not said a word against this open and direct attempt prevent men from recruiting, though have had so much to say about the Critchof ley Parker publications. Mr. the colleague of the honourable member for Barrier, the man who would "" fight like hell "" to release the criminals of the Innot dustrial Workers of the World, but will not light for the Empire or has, like the honourable member for Barrier himself, done all he could to prejudice recruiting. His every utterance has been in that direction. Over and over again he has said that do nothing to assist recruiting, he has opposed it by word and deed. Yet we are asked to accept motion as evidence of the purity of motive of honourable gentlemen site. We are invited to believe that their very souls have been harrowed by this literature in regard to which want a Royal Commission.' not responsible for the literature which they complain, nor is the Government, nor any organization with which the Government is or was connected. did not finance its publication, and knew nothing of it, and I took what steps I could take to prevent its circulation. the other hand, there is clear and abundant evidence that the Official Labour party bought copies of this literature and circulated it, endeavouring to use it to the detriment of the Nationalists. boldly, that the circulation Critchley Parker literature lost thousands of votes to the . party to which I belong, and did not gain for it a single vote. Mr Hughes. honourable member for Adelaide cannot understand what has happened. He is one of those pliant souls who is willing I to do anything within reason to please his constituents, or his party, or his country, I took the opportunity, during the campaign, to hold him up as the very pattern of what a politician could become f he seriously devoted himself to his profession. The honourable member is very he much concerned about what Mr Critchley Parker has published. I had the support this of the honourable member at one time, until his council told him that he must alter his opinion of me, and he altered it . But he said that that was not to be regarded as a fixed and unchangeable decision; that, reif necessary, he could face again in any direction they wished. If , tomorrow, his council told him to pay obeisance to Mr . to Critchley. Parker, he would do so. they What is more, every other member the Official Labour party would do so. Brookfield, They would have to do that, or get out. Of course, they are relying on .their executives. They say, ""tlhe executives would do such at h in g "" ; but if the executives did it they would have to obey. Australia, I do not propose to gild the pill any more. This belated and audacious effort to place upon the shoulders of this party responsibility for Critchley Parker's literature will not deceive, for a single moment, he would the electors of this country. The elecand tors had a fair opportunity of judging between the parties and the methods of the this parties. I do not wish to rake up those things which I hope are buried for ever. oppoBut if honourable members desire an exhumation order issued, I can exhume from that tomb in which these things .are they mow buried such a ghastly array of I am putrid and decaying - political flesh as of would horrify even honourable members opposite, who are responsible for. it . I see before me one seat in particular that We is not occupied. I have a brochure by the former occupant which is devoted entirely to myself. Like Australia, with On about one person to every square mile, this document has one fact to every forty or f if t y lies, and that fact is so shrouded with inaccuracies as to almost obscure it from view. I say, of the In conclusion, I am satisfied to .merely say that there is no need for a Commission to inquire into Critchley Parker's literature. He put his name at the bottom of it . He issued it ; he does not, he cannot deny its authorship. If there is a law to deal with this matter, honourable members opposite can set the law in motion; or if they can point to any law that is applicable to this offence, I will set it in motion for them; but I warn them that if I do that, I will not stop ab the case of Critchley Parker. There is no necessity for a Royal Commission. There is no connection between the Government and these cartoons. We do not believe in them. Many members on 'this side have publicly repudiated them, and the Government as a whole repudiate them and regret their issue. Mr Critchley Parker must take the whole responsibility for them, and no doubb he will do so. That' is the end of the matter. I shall. not be a party to these obvious and childish tactics on the part of the Opposition in their endeavour to shoulder upon the Government, that odium which properly belongs to our opponents. In those circumstances the proposal the honourable member for Cook ought nob to be agreed to.",46
318,Mr MATHEWS,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Melbourne Ports) [8.35] - As usual, the Prime Minister's speech was characterized by a good deal of wi t and a good deal of threatening lanthe guage. He told us that he would like to see this matter elucidated, and finally intimated that the Government will agree to any investigation. In asking a Commission of inquiry, our purpose to find out in whose interest the putrid pamphlets were issued. I make the statei ment that they were issued in the interests of the so-called National party and are being so issued at the present time in nexion with the Macquarie by-election. Here is one pamphlet, which has on these wordsMr Doyle, President of the Political (Caucus) Party, New South Wales, said, National party's success at the last election was due to the raising of the sectarian issue."" Of course it was. Who made it necessary to raise that issue? Critchley Parker, 376 ders-laue. Critchley Parker has himself answered the question. At the bottom of the pamphlet is the advice, ' ' Vote for MCLeod."" He is the National candidate. The Prime Minister and the honourable member for Grey tried to saddle the Labour party with responsibility for and everything that Archbishop Mannix has said. Every politician knows well that time after time the whole effort of Archbishop Mannix has been thrown against the Labour parby in Vicboria. He takes his stand on whichever side he thinks fit, and he is quite justified in doing that. We were told that the pamphlets were not issued in the interests of tlhe National party, but that members of 'the Labour party scattered them abroad in order to help their candidates by showing that these publications were an attack on their religion by the National party. Is there anything wrong in showing men how brutal and dirty their own political side can be ? Any political party thab would father thab rubbish is unfit to be in power in any Parliament. This trouble is political* and not religious. I have as much respect for Roman Catholicism as for any other religion, but I have no desire to be a Roman Catholic. And I say that without any repugnance for the Roman Catholic faith . The statement has been made in of my electorate that I am a Roman Catholic; that was done for no other purpose than to raise the sectarian issue, and so get .Protestants to vote against me. As a matter of fact, if there is any man in Melbourne Ports who should not receive Roman Catholic vote, it is myself, for many reasons - I was born and reared in an atmosphere that is repugnant to not Roman Catholics, but I have always for allowed every other man to choose his is own religion, whilst I choose mine, and when my religion is attacked I fight for t . Throughout the length and breadth of Australia every Orange lo-lee or ultraProtestant Association, invariably chooses conthe more conservative of two candidates. Consequently, the Labour movement has it always been attacked by the Orange lodges. Like myself, the Prime Minister Labour has suffered from such attacks, and "" The has been charged with being pro - Roman. That has been done in order to deprive the Labour movement of the votes of the Flinchurch-going portion of the Protestant community. That was why the sectarian issue was introduced in the last election-bu t not by Critchley Parker. Does any man or woman in the community believe that, on his own initiative and at his own expense, Critchley Parker produced this literature sent it broadcast for the mere f u n of the game? I am quite willing to believe that he is making a business of it, and that is the peculiarity of the Orangeman in Australia. In Ireland the Orange and the Green have been fighting each other for generations, but the Orangeman Australia is an Orangeman for pounds, shillings, and pence, and nothing else, and is always against the ultra-Democrat, whoever he may be - In the last election he was fighting for the flag, he said. Every utterance of that statement was an act of disloyalty, because ft was not meant. There is always some other purpose behind these actions, and in the last election the object was political gain. was evident throughout the Prime Minister's speech to-night that he was concerned about the issue of these and during the election he went out of his way at Bridgewater to explain he was not responsible for them. did he take the trouble to make that explanation if he did not realise that there was something heinous in the very fact of their issue? He pretended to wish to ' have elections purified in future. one admits that the sectarian was a dirty business, and must tend to generate in the community feelings which we, as civilized beings, do not wish engendered in Australia^ That being so, are we asking too much when we request that there shall be an opportunity to discover who was responsible for the issue of these offensive pamphlets? Prime Minister said that no language he could conceive-and that is saying a good deal-would express he felt regarding those If that is so, why does he not allow us to go into the matter and find out who did it? Are the National party proposing to hide themselves behind the fact that Archbishop Mannix said that he applauded the Labour Leagues at Bendigo for their action in securing these pamphlets and distributing them ? I do not know that he said so, but the. Prime Minister says that he did. We are told that there were men in the Labour who showed their co-religionists that this form of putrid stuff was being spread abroad with a view to beating the Labour party, and bringing the Roman religion into contempt. But who could blame them for it, when those who were associated with the issue of the pamphlets were endeavouring to hold up their religious beliefs to contempt? Mr Mathews.",48

331,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Yarra) [9.12] - I shall not detain the House at any length in dealing with this measure. As the Minister for Works and Railways said when introducing the Bill , the career of the K a l goorlie to Port Augusta Railway, from the time that the original survey was undertaken, has been a varied and chequered one. The honourable gentleman was 10 good enough to make available to the House and the country certain information which, I think, will remove a misapprehension on the part of a large section of the public in regard to the cost of that railway. We have been told again and again in the press that the construction of the line which, it was originally estimated, would cost a little over £4,000,000 , had already involved an expenditure of over £6,600,000 . The Minister, however, has given us an interesting explanation of the several reasons leading to the in creased cost. In the first place, an i m portant factor is the use of heavier rails than were at first proposed; while secondly, the cost of material, owing to the outbreak of war, has been largely in creased. Then again, wages have in creased, the additional expenditure in volved under that heading, according to the Minister, being something like £400,000. We find that, allowing for all these factors, the original estimate, instead of being exceeded by some £2,600,000 , has in reality been increased by only about £600,000. That section of the press which is opposed to the Labour party and to the day-labour system, for which we stand, has declared again and again that 50 per cent, of the increased cost has been the result of the adoption of the day-labour system in the construction of the line, and that if a contract had been let the whole work, including the ballasting and complete equipment of the railway, could have been carried out at a cost well within the original estimate ",51
332,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COTTON CULTURE IN,The Minister also mentioned that a more 'complete system of ballasting had been adopted.,52
333,Mr WATT,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Yes ; involving a cost of £500,000.",52
334,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"If , as the honourable gentleman told us yesterday, the journey between Melbourne and Perth is to be accomplished in seventy-two hours, then a very complete system of ballasting is desirable, having regard to the speed at which the trains will run . We all regret the fact that varying gauges"" are in existence in the several States, and we look forwar d to a time when it may be possible to travel from Brisbane to Perth on the one gauge of line. If this railway is ever to achieve the chief purpose for which its construction was urged-if it is to be useful as a strategic railway in the defence of Australia-w e must have [21] gauge at least between Sydney and Perth. The announcement made by the honourable gentleman in regard to the failure of - Western Australia to redeem its promise to construct a 4-ft. 8^-in. line between Perth and Kalgoorlie will come as a surprise to many.",52
335,Sir JOHN FORREST,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Tha b had to be within five years, but the Bill was with drawn.",52
336,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"That is so; but when Mr Andrew Fisher was Treasurer, he made representations on the subject to, I think, Mr Scaddan.",52
337,Sir JOHN FORREST,COTTON CULTURE IN,I admit the pledge.,52
338,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,And the papers show thab Mr Scaddan went back on the pledge made.,52
339,Sir JOHN FORREST,COTTON CULTURE IN,Exactly ; and I complained about it .,52
340,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Ha d this Parliament been aware of the fact, I do not think that the line would have been built today, or, at any rate, would have been so near completion - I realise that it is very difficult to touch on the subjecb of the transcontinental line without' hearing a few in terjections from my personal friend but political opponent the Treasurer, who is better informed, or, at any rate, as well informed, as any one here as regards the history of this undertaking. I am glad - that the Minister for Works and Railways, in moving the second reading of the Bill , favoured us with some of the facts of this history. The Bill , of course, is largely one for Committee. We have to decide by this measure whether the line shall be administered by a Commissioner or run directly by the Government under a political head; and my own opinion is that there must be a Commissioner. It is quite possible that there may be found some to say there is no need for an appointment of the kind, but it would be very difficult to conduct such a railway under a political head only. The railway employees in our Service today, and who will be in our Service in the future, are in a different position from the railway employees of any State, inasmuch as they wil l be able, I think, to appeal directly to the A r b i tration Court for the redress of any grievances under which they suffer. It was on this question of the right of railway employees to appeal to the Court that the a uniform Deakin Governmenb went out of office in 1904, but,, apart from that, such a right is conserved to Commonwealth publio servants by an Act already passed.",52
341,Mr JH CATTS,COTTON CULTURE IN,To other than railway men.,53
342,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Exactly ; and I should now like to know from the Minister whether the right will extend to the railway employees. If not, the Arbitration Act ought to be amended immediately, so as to confer the right. At any rate, even if that is not done, I think we ought to provide in this Bill for the hours of labour and so forth, whether on a weekly or fortnightly basis. I ' understand that in some cases a fortnightly basis is adopted, and it should be provided that the men shall not be employed formore than, say, 88 hours during the fortnight. There is another matter to which we ought to give some attention. Those who have travelled much in Australia and in other lands know that on the long-distance lines, and even on short-distance lines, men employed and living in outback places are always on the look out for newspapers from the trains, in their desire to keep in touch with the latest general news of the day. In view of the loneliness experienced by men in such employment, I hope the Government will be able to arrange to place two or three families comparatively close together,, so that the nearest neighbour may not be situated ten or twenty miles away. When I was at the head of the Customs Department, and the lighthouses were transferred to the Commonwealth, I ascertained thaib in some of the States there were children who had never had a day's education. It must be admitted that in this regard we have a responsibility to our servants, and, though our pioneers in the back blocks may suffer similar disabilities, I make the suggestion that we should, if possible, have two or three families together, and so be enabled to provide some educational facilities.",53
343,Sir JOHN FORREST,COTTON CULTURE IN,It is not such a never-never country as all that. There will be a number of people travelling on the line.  been put up already.,53
344,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I am glad to have that information from an honourable member who is much more cognizant of the character of the country and itspopulation than I am. From what the Minister said yesterday, I realized that in the 1,052 miles between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie, especially coming eastward, there is practically no habitation for - many hundreds of miles.",53
345,Sir JOHN FORREST,COTTON CULTURE IN,There will be soon.,53
346,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"No one hopes that more earnestly than I do. If this line is to be anything but a great burden on the Commonwealth, there must be a certain amount of population on the route; but we know that, even in the Eastern States, where ihe population is more dense, especially, perhaps, from New South Wales into Queensland, ' it is possible to travel for many miles without seeing much, evidence of habitation,, though, of course, there may be settlement a little distance back.  is to put married men near the schools, and t<he single men elsewhere, and it is proposed to have a sort of travelling school.",53
347,Sir JOHN FORREST,COTTON CULTURE IN,"On the telegraph line, and on the Oodnadatta to Port Darwin route, the people are just as isolated.",53
348,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,That is no reason why we should not take steps to remedy the disadvantage in the line under discussion.,53
349,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COTTON CULTURE IN,The men on the telegraph line receive all the news every night.,53
350,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I presume these tare single men, and we should do nothing to convey the idea that only single men are required in our service. On the other hand, we ought to make it possible for married men with their families to live in a degree of comfort^ and enjoy some of the educational and other advantages of civilization. I hope that before long it will be possible to travel from Melbourne or Adelaide right 'through to - Perth without any break of gauge, instead of having - the two or three changes that will be necessary when the line is opened. This would be infinitely better from the point of view of the handling of goods, and absolutely necessary if this line is to be used for its main purpose of defence. We can remember how General Hutton, and also, I think, Lord Kitchener dwelt on the T necessity of this great work from a defence point of view. If we have ever to shift a considerable body of men, with munitions and other material, a break of gauge,, or more than one break of gauge,' will seriously increase the difficulties. Understand that even between Brisbane and Melbourne, with only two breaks of construction period. gauge, the cost and time involved in transporting, I forget how many thouendless sands of men, would be something appalthink, ling. Thefigureswere once given by the present Minister for the Navy at the miers' Conference, and I was astounded at the length of time involved in these changes. Hard put to it as we are for for it cash, and faced with an increasing difficulty in raising loans for any purpose, I point out that the longer this work of making the gauges uniform is postponed, the more expensive it will be. Had the railway engineers? even at the time Federation was inaugurated, started to unify the gauges of the railways of Ausa tralia, we should probably have saved some £8,000,000 or £10,000,000 on the expenditure we shall ultimately have to face. I can only hope that by the time the line is opened, we shall know that it will be ultimately possible to travel throughout the entire length with pracfavour. tically no change of carriage. In view of the keen interest which Treasurer has always taken in this work,I presume he would like to be the purit chaser of the first ticket from Melbourne to Perth.",53
351,Mr FOWLEH,COTTON CULTURE IN,He has the right to it,54
352,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Althoug h the righb honourable gentleman has the right to killed travel on his member's' pass, he would, I think, like to have such a ticket as a memento of the occasion.",54
353,Sir JOHN FORKEST,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Like the Austracided lian soldier, I shall be there.",54
354,Mr TUDOR,COTTON CULTURE IN,"But for the pertinacity of the right honourable gentleman, ,we might not be considering this Bill to to night. During the construction of the line there have been innumerable strikes and other troubles, and at least two vestigations by Royal Commissions, Chinn inquiry, and the Gilchrist inquiry. It was stated earlier in the day that orable members do not read the evidence of Royal Commissions, but I think at least portions of the evidence taken during those inquiries were read. There is a gentleman who desires a third quiry, considering that he has been fully treated. I have mentioned the ter to the Minister privately, though not know the rights and wrongs of the oase. I trust that when the line is the hilt. I opened for traffic things will run more smoothly than they have , run during the Every Minister connected with the work has had to face troubles. The undertaking is, I the biggest and most difficult that we have had in Australia, but I hope that Prethe doleful predictions of some of those who opposed it may not be verified; 'and that the line may justify those who voted",54
355,Mr MANIFOLD,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Corangamite) [9.33] - In listening to the speech of the Minister for Works and Railways yesterday, I could not help wondering what he would have said of this work had he expressed his opinion regarding it when private member in pre-Federation days. I remembered, too, what I had read of the call of the desert to the Bedouin. Evidently the call of the desert has been heard by the honourable gentleman. During his recent trip he seems to have swallowed everything that he heard in its In the early days of Federation I opposed this giant enterprise, and have the been in opposition to it ever since, both in Parliament and out. I have discussed frequently with the Treasurer, and when the great drought occurred in that part of Australia. I told him that it would . be impossible for the line to pay, because, the kangaroos and emus having been off, there would be no traffic at all in the country. However, as we have . been "" let in "" for the building of the line, or, as"" Parliament, in its wisdom, has deto build it-whicheve r phrase may be acceptable- I hope that when I cross the country I shall be able to swallow as much as the Minister has swallowed, and wear a similar pair of glasses to see the beauties of the landscape, and to find the population that has been spoken of. inI trust that that population is not enthe tirely black. Although the finances of Australia are in a bad way, we ought to hontry to reduce the breaks of gauge, and certainly should not have more than one that break between Adelaide and Perth. I do not wish to tread on any one's corns, but I cannot help feeling that the Governinment of Western Australia has not carwrongried out the agreement into which it matentered, even though it may have had a I do right to impose a time limit.",54
356,Sir JOHN FORREST,COTTON CULTURE IN,It is pledged up to,54
357,Mr MANIFOLD,COTTON CULTURE IN,It is in duty bound to make the gauge on the line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle the same as that on the Commonwealth portion of the line.,55
358,Sir JOHN FOEREST,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I say so, too.",55
359,Mr MANIFOLD,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I trust that this Department will be put on a proper business footing-that control of the service will be in the hands of a Commissioner, who will be responsible for saving the Commonwealth as much as possible, though there must be a loss for a considerable time - to come. What is to be gained from the carriage of troops and mails remains to be seen. The Minister for Works and Railways will be up against a tough proposition when he tackles the Postmaster-General in an attempt to make money out of the carrying of mails. The line may benefit by bookkeeping entries, but probably the mail service will cost more than the money obtained from the Postmaster-General's Department. However, we cannot go back upon what we have done, and I am pleased that the work has been finished, because the trains will earn a certain amount of revenue, and we shall no longer be working a ""dead horse."" I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that something should be done to ameliorate the conditions of those employed on the line. A small settlement of gangers and repairers might be formed from which the men could travel to their work on motor cycles. I have no knowledge of the country beyond what I have heard from those who have travelled it, and from what I can learn from the map. But it seems to me that only those who have been lighthousekeepers could live in isolation along the route. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the Treasurer should have the honour of purchasing the first through ticket, and I think that the Minister for Railways might well cause a cage to be constructed on the front of the first engine to cross the line, in which right honourable gentleman might travel.",55
360,Mr WATT,COTTON CULTURE IN,I shall have an elephant cage constructed for him.,55
361,Mr MANIFOLD,COTTON CULTURE IN,"If that is done, not only will the right honourable gentleman be the first passenger to arrive in Perth, but he will precede the train. If that cage precedes the engine I shall be satistralian fied to ride in one of the cars behind, because I will know'perfectly well that, even if the track is not ballasted everywhere, if it is able to carry the elephant cage and its occupant, the passengers in the other part of the train will be quite safe. I congratulate the Minister on the way in which he introduced the Bill, and on the way that he endeavoured to cover up all the mistakes that have been made in the past. I have said on every occasion that, although it was estimated that the line would cost £4,000,000, it would cost £8,000,000, or even nearly £10,000,000, by the time it was finished. The cost up to the present has been £6,500,000, and we are short of a considerable amount of rolling-stock. We have nothing like the number of engines required, and I believe that by the time the railway is running, and the track has been ballasted, it will have cost easily £8,000,000, if it does not cost considerably more.",55
362,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COTTON CULTURE IN,And it will not pay for the axle grease on the wheels.,55
363,Mr MANIFOLD,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Of course, it will not.",55
364,Dr MALONEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Melbourne) [9-42] While I join in congratulating the Treasurer on the approaching completion of the transcontinental line, I do not endorse the suggestion that the right honourable' gentleman should be placed in an elephant cage in front qf the engine. By placing the tender first, the honourable member who made that suggestion, and a few of o his genial friends, could be given a 'ride free from the smoke of the engine, and could see the country far better than in an observation car, which is generally placed at the rear end of the train, where it draws up in its course the whole of the dust along the track.",55
365,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COTTON CULTURE IN,The Treasurer has been along that track before ,55
366,Dr MALONEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"He has, more than once, and he has always had my vote for this important work. I have always supported the linking up of the whole of the the capitals of Australia by means of railways. Reference has been made in the debate to a bond or undertaking given by the Western Australian Government in regard to the building of the line between Kalgoorlie and Perth. All that has happened has been a delay in carrying out the promise, not that the promise has been broken. I honour the Western AusGovernment for their action in opening up country for their settlers by means of railway facilities far more than has been done in any other State of Australia. If there has been delay in building a second line between Kalgoorlie and Perth, it must be remembered that that line can be very well done without for some years, while in the meantime the Western Australian Government have been opening up new country for the benefit of their settlers. An y one who has had the experience that I have had there will agree that they are to be commended for looking after their citizens as well as they have done. The honourable member for Corangamite agreed. with the honourable member for Yarra that facilities should be provided for the workmen on the line, and I am sure the Minister in charge of railway matters will look after them as far as possible. I noticed recently when in the West that at the end of a 76-mile line to Kondinin, which has been constructed since 1916, a splendid house has been built for the use of men who may be acting as flying gangs or in other capacities on the line. It contains four rooms and a bath-room, and attached to it is a splendid tank of fresh rain water, so that the health and welfare of the railway workers are well looked after in that State. All that was put there at first was a small hut about 12 feet by 10, but that accommodation has been improved upon in the way I have described. I hope Mr Bell will follow the example of the Western Australian Government in that regard. I think he will, because I understand that he is a man who looks after the welfare of his men, having learnt the axiom of the keenest business men in America that, by looking well after your workers, you will get more than you pay for , because you get their goodwill. The goodw ill of the workers is an asset well worth striving for by any employer of labour, and that applies particularly to a large public concern like the railways. ""With reference to clause 81, the M in ister will agree ,that fair-minded people, who are willin g to accept fair compensation in the event of an accident, are not as well treated as if they employ a good legal adviser, and have a medical man to look after them. Clause 81 provides that, upon the occurrence of any accident, the Commissioner may require any person who may have been injured, to be examined, at the Commissioner's cost, by one or more medical men nominated by the Commissioner. That is a very one-sided provision, and I should like to see these words added: "" and, if so requested, in the presence of the medical adviser of the injured person."" I am only asking for fair play. The etiquette of the medical profession, which I have left, having given up medical work, is that one medical man does not see the patient of another unless that other is present.",55
367,Mr ARCHIBALD,COTTON CULTURE IN,Would not the doctors all agree?,56
368,Dr MALONEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,The honourable member knows that they do not. Every medical man acting for an accident insurance company treats every one who makes a claim as a malingerer.,56
369,Mr WATT,COTTON CULTURE IN,The honourable member's suggestion may be generally r i g h t ; but the accident may take place in the centre of Australia.,56
370,Dr MALONEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"A circumstance of that kind would be, of course, a complete answer.",56
371,Mr WATT,COTTON CULTURE IN,"We may have to despatch two doctors specially, and may not be able to get all the advisers of injured people there; but I will note the point.",56
372,Dr MALONEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"L e a n quite believe that the Commonwealth Government would be generous, rather than the reverse. Sub-clause 2 of clause 81 does not seem to be quite playing the game. It provides that if any person refuses or fails to undergo an examination in accordance with the provision which I have just quoted, he cannot recover any damages or compensation from the Commissioner for personal in j u r y in the accident. I should think that all the protection necessary in that case is provided for by the fact that the Judge and j u r y would take the refusal to undergo examination into consideration, and possibly reduce the damages. At the same time, the person should not be, absolutely barred by such a refusal from recovering damages, because there may be cases, such as frequently occur, of railway shock. A man might say he was all right at the time, and afterwards find himself affected. We are only"" gradually learning to appreciate the effects of shock from the results of this terrible war. Men have been injured by shell shock, without the slightest sign of in j u r y about them, and the shock has shown itself as late as two months after the wards. That recalls' to my mind what goorlie - Mr James Page, one of the greatest surof geons of England, and consultant surgeon to the great Midland line, said in a ture. He said, "" If ever you meet a of nervous trouble that is hard to diagnose and without reason, go into the back hispassengers for 3s. 6d. per head. tory of that patient and learn if he or she was ever in a railway accident, matter how light that accident may have been."" That was his advice based on experience with the Midland company for a score of years. All honourable members may not be aware that the sea journey from FreAustralia mantle to Adelaide is less than the land journey by no less than 314 miles. That may sound remarkable, taking into conthat sideration the rounding of the Leeuwin; but the actual figures given to me by the Department of Works in Western Austages tralia are: Fremantle to Perth, 12 miles; Perth to Kalgoorlie, 312 miles; K a goorlie to Port Augusta, 1,053 miles; Port Augusta to Adelaide, 259J miles; A total, 1,687 miles. The distance Fremantle to Adelaide by sea is 1,373 miles. To Melbourne, the journey by sea is 1,874 miles; and-2,181 miles by land, or a difference of 307 miles. To Sydney. 2,446 miles by sea; and 2,763 miles land, or a difference of 317 miles. point is that shipping has an advantage of 300 miles in the journey; and if our trunk line. coastal steam-ships are brought more up to date, the passenger journey by sea will be of shorter duration than by land. sels capable of travelling 18 and 20 are built nowadays, and we are informed that owing to the inventions during this candidly admit. war ships carrying passengers and mails will be able to make the journey across the Atlantic in two days and two nights. I made inquiries amongst the merchants in Perth, and they seemed to think that it might pay them to send the lighter articles of merchandise by rail at luggage rates, particularly at this period, when is so difficult to get steamer freights. I am glad to be able to compliment the Treasurer on the attainment of one of - his life's desires. I do not think the Government of Western Australia ought to be blamed for its delay in carrying out the promise to continue the broad gauge from Kalgoorlie to Perth. The ' mise remains, and will keep. Any one Dr Maloney. who has had the pleasure of travelling by narrow-gauge line from Perth to K a l will certainly admit that it is one the most rapid and comfortable narrowgauge lines in the world. So far as my lecknowledge goes, it is the only line of case narrow-gauge railways that gives good sleeping accommodation to second class It was the first railway service in Australia that no had a good dining car. The Perth-Kalgoorlie line is one of the straightest in his - Australia; and members of this Hous« need not hold up a finger of reproach at Western Australia for the non-fulfilment of its contract. No other State in Australia has equalled the record of Western in providing railway facilities for the opening up of its land and the settlement of its people. I can only wish Victoria, with its muddled railways, will follow the example of Western Australia. Victoria, although it has advanin being comparatively well settled, cannot boast of what it has accomplished l - by its railways for the betterment of citizens ill comparison with other States. f t e r looking into the question in Western from Australia, I came to the conclusion that the transcontinental railway might be fed, not by wide-gauge lines which ' are very expensive, but by narrow-gauge spurs. We can read in the Scientific American by of the use made qf motor engines driven My by petrol, and it seems to me that traction of this kind can be used to feed the I do not view the finances of this proVesject in the same light as the honourable knots member for Corangamite. That the line will not pay interest in its early stages, I In that connection, I have always felt one regret. The Commonwealth should have ear-marked the land between Port Augusta and Perth, built the line, and issued notes based upon its value. Those notes would have been guaranteed by the Commonwealth, and the whole of the permanent way, rollingi t stock, stations, and buildings would have constituted the security. The notes so issued would have been accepted in payment of freight and taxes levied by the Commonwealth Government. By that means, we should have saved interest, which is the curse of Government undertakings. When Mr Justice Higgins was pro- a member of the Victorian State Parliament, he called for a return of Victorian public debts, showing how much money had been borrowed, how much paid interest and redemption, and how much was still owing. In round figures, £50,000,000 had been borrowed at that time, £53,000,000 had been paid in terest and redemption charges, and over £50,000,000 was still owing. The burden of interest is the cause of the Victorian railways not paying their way today, notwithstanding that the returns are very fair. Suppose that £8,000,000 worth notes had been issued for the transconentry tinental railway, as I have suggested. the first year's operation had returned even only £5,000 above working expenses, that sum would have been applied to the reduction of the capital cost, and in time the whole principal would be paid off, a railway, built by nothing but the credit of the Commonwealth, would remain. I will not labour the question any further, but I desire to give the House a practical instance upon which my argument is based. It is known as the Guernsey Island Australian project. Market scheme, formulated in the early part of the last century. At that time there was no currency in the island, but an able financier evolved a scheme for the conas struction of the markets by local brickin layers, carpenters, and stonemasons, who were paid in Market scrip notes guaranthe teed by local rates. The market was built, and the day following the opening was celebrated as a holiday. On each anniment versary of the opening day the corporation burned all the notes which had been returned to them as rent for the stalls the market, and within ten years they had thus got rid of the whole of the liability.",56
373,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COTTON CULTURE IN,But the market was a paying concern from the day it was opened.,58
374,Dr MALONEY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"The honourable ber is quite correct, and the market carried on, free of debt. While the way would not pay from the outset, it would ultimately prove a profitable underonly, taking, and I hope the Minister will, therefore, give consideration to this matter.",58
375,Mr FOWLER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Perth) [10.2] - I wish to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister upon the fair and lucid manner in which he explained the measure, as well as upon the fact that he will, no doubt, have the honour of being in office at the completion of what will tion. probably be one of the most important works carried, out in the Commonwealth in for very many years. As one who has occupied a seat in this Parliament since its inception, I confess to a feeling of very great satisfaction in that this scheme, which Western Australian members have, advocated for so long, is now nearing completion. In the early days of Federation I regarded the construction of this of line as a sine qua non for the of Western Australia into the If Union. It has taken a good deal of persuasion to get the Federal Parliament to agree to the undertaking, but we have the satisfaction of knowing that the history of this line is merely the history of and all large railway schemes throughout the world. The great transcontinental railway across America, for instance, was scoffed at for the same reason that still seems to influence some honourable members here in their attitude towards the I may inform the honourable member for Corangamite, however, that while he still regards the country through which this line passes desert land, it is only desert country the sense that the Victorian Mallee was desert country thirty years ago, and in sense that the Camperdown country was regarded as a desert 100 years ago. Thirty years back, the effective developof the Mallee country, from the - agricultural stand-point, was considered to be quite as impossible as the developin ment today of country through which our transcontinental line runs; but we are not without proof of faith in the land, as there is a regular scramble for a great deal of the country affected by the line. Large tracts have been taken up- I regret to say the areas are too large-and memmuch more of it will be taken is still up in the near future. I feel sure railthat while the land may be occupied in the first instance for pastoral purposes it will not be long before it will be found fit for closer settlement. Indeed, a good deal of it is of very fine quality, and though the rainfall may be somewhat scanty, we must remember that country alleged thirty years.ago to be unfit for agriculture for this reason is now occupied to advantage, the rainfall having been found sufficient for agricultural purposes under-a modern system of cultiva",58
376,Mr WATT,COTTON CULTURE IN,We have just been stopped for four days in plate-laying in the West on account of rain.,59
377,Mr FOWLER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"In some of the country through which this line passes I have seen rain which would satisfy the most ardent agriculturist. Unfortunately, it is somewhat irregular, but I think it is recognised as a scientific fact that rain does follow settlement in Australia, and it is quite likely that before long we will get all the rain that is wanted for effective cultivation of cereals, at any rate.",59
378,Mr SAMPSON,COTTON CULTURE IN,Will the member state what is the lowest rainfall in the districts on which wheat can be grown ?,59
379,Mr FOWLER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Unfortunately , we have not> accurate data over a lengthy period, but I should say that it comes down to about 7 inches.",59
380,Mr SAMPSON,COTTON CULTURE IN,In Southern Cross?,59
381,Mr FOWLER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I could not give the exact areas. The rainfall decreases as'you get into the interior, but along the route of this Hue there is evidence of sufficient rainfall for wheat-growing' in average years.",59
382,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"You ferring, I presume, to the Western Australian side?",59
383,Mr FOWLER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Yes . The land and the rainfall there are better than on the South Australian side, and I think it is a pity that the line was carried so far north through South Australia, thus lengthening it quite unnecessarily, and with very little practical benefit to that State. I wanted to refer more particularly, however, to the position of Western Australia in regard to the incompleted portion of the line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. There is no doubt that an undertaking was given by the Western Australian Government of the day that a railway on the Commonwealth gauge would be constructed to Fremantle, and I feel sure that but for a stringency in the money market, and the outbreak of this terrible war, some means would have been found to finance that portion of the undertaking. Undoubtedly, it is quite impossible at the present time. Western Australia certainly has not the money, and cannot get the money, except perhaps at a ruinous price. While I regret that the scheme has not been carried out as originally proposed, still I feel sure that before many years elapse the 4-fb. 8^-in. gauge will run right down ito Fremantle. There is just one other matter to which I wish to call the attention of the Minister. The people of Western Australia, particularly of Perth, look forward to the opening of this railway naturally with a good deal of interest and enthusiasm, and I hope that the Commonwealth Government will give them some opportunity of celebrating in a suitable way the arrival in Perth of the first transcontinental honourable train. There has been some talk of holding an exhibition. I am nob sure whether the time is quite the correct one for anything of the k in d ; but I hope that the Government have seriously considered the proposals put before them in connection with the possibility of some such support being given to the people of Western Australia and of Perth in connection with the opening of the line as will enable them to make the ceremony as fitting and as impressive as it is entitled to be.",59
384,Mr WATT,COTTON CULTURE IN,I shall be glad to confer with the representatives of Western Australia on that question. are re,59
385,Mr FOWLER,COTTON CULTURE IN,"I thank the Minister for his suggestion, and I hope that the out^ come will be of some material benefit in connection with the proposal. The Minister has a much greater task before him if he remains many years in office. I refer to tlhe creation of a main trunk line of uniform gauge running right across the continent to Brisbane. Unfortunately that is something that we can hardly look forward to in the immediate future, but I trust that this Parliament will keep before it the necessity and the possibility of it , because,. undoubtedly, without some such scheme as that the advantage of linking up the various cities of Australia by r a i l is, to a large extent, neutralized by the variety of gauges. Even under present conditions, I feel satisfied. that the advent of this railway will be of immediate advantage, not only to Western Australia, but also to the eastern States. It will bring the east and the west together in' a more effective way than, sea travelling can make possible, and I trust that we shall have sufficient intercommunication of goods and of persons to enable the line, if not to pay all working expenses straight way, at least to provide a reasonable anticipation that such. will be the position in the near future. Debate (on motion by Mr J . H . CATTS) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE : TRANSFER OF RECRUITS FOR TRAINING PURPOSES: PAY - CITIZEN FORCES : PAYA ND TECH NICAL TRAINING OF TRAINEES. Motion (by Mr Watt ) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",59
386,Mr CHARLTON,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Hunter) [10.15] I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence a practice that has been adopted by the military authorities of bringing recruits from New South Wales to Victoria for training purposes. I had occasion to bring the matter under the notice of the House about sixteen months ago, and there was then some little improvement effected; but the Defence Department are again driftin g back to the old method. It is unfair to the lads who enlist in New South Wales to drag them to Seymour to be trainedI would not complain if there was any good or sufficient reason to advance for this action, but I am assured by the recruits that they get no drill that they could not secure in their own State. This system causes a good deal of dissatisfaction, which does not tend to help recruiting. On the last occasion on which I brought the matter forward, mothers who had come all the way from New South Wales to Melbourne to see their sons before they embarked, called to see me. To-day I find that the same practice is followed as much as ever. New South Wales recruit runs a very great risk when he is brought to Victoria and is kept here for several months for training purposes. The climate of New South Wales is much warmer, and there is lrss rainfal l in that State. At Seymour the rainfal l is fairly constant, and there are different samples of climate every day. The result is that lads from New South Wales contract colds, and probably pneumonia and other complaints. The people over there get to hear about these things, and when they realise that there is a chance of lads having to leave New South Wales and come to Victoria for training, it retards recruiting. are opposed to the transfers that have [22] taken place. They claim that the lads should be permitted to remain in their own State u n t i l they have to embark. It is of great advantage to a soldier to remain in his own State when he is undergoing his training, because there he is among his own people and his own friends, and when he gets leave at the week-end he can return to his home and see his parents or his wife and family. I have heard several complaints on this score. A recruit from New South Wales has pointed out that he has to be back in Melbourne on the Monday. Leaving on the Friday night he gets to his home at 6.30 p.m. on Saturday night,' and he must leave on his return at 2.30 on the following afternoon. If he is not back in Victoria on the Monday he is fined. In the case of another recruit from Maitland, he gets to his home at 8 o'clock on the Saturday night, and he has to leave on his return at lunch time the following day. There is no good reason why men Who enlist in one State should be dragged to another for the purpose of being trained. I ask the Honorary Minister what justification there is for this practice that is now growing up again? The Government should instruct the military authorities that men who enlist should be trained in their own State until they embark, unless some good reason is advanced for taking them into another State. If there is any special reason, of course, we must give weight to it , but, in the absence of any such special reason, I can see no justification for the practice that is followed. It is a great injustice to the parents of the recruits and to the-soldiers themselves. The",60
387,Mr MAHONY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Dalley) [10.22] - I wish to bring under the notice of the Honorary Minister the case of a number of apprentices at the naval establishment at Garden Island. These boys were called oub for a compulsoryparade on ANZAC Day for the purpose of stimulating recruiting. On previous occasions when they were called out for a compulsory parade they received a day's pay, but on this particular day, when one of the most glorious things every member of the community could do was to stimulate recruiting, the Government stopped the pay of these boys. It amounted to Is. 8d. per day. Parents I am referring to the Naval Workyarda at Garden Island Sydney. T There are only about half-a-dozen boys concerned, and the expenditure involved in making the alteration which I suggest would certainly not strain the financial resources of the Commonwealth. Indeed, the matter is such a paltry one that I do not suppose the Minister has any knowledge of it . These boys certainly ought not to be penalized when called out on compulsory parades for the purpose of stimulating i recruiting. I may also mention that these workyards were taken over by the Commonwealth from the Imperial authorities. In the days when they were under the direct control of the Admiralty the apprentices employed there privileged to attend technical classes at night-time, and to permit of them doing this they were allowed to catch an earlier boat from the island to the mainland- a boat which left at 4.20 p.m. This privilege has now been withdrawn, and they are compelled to wait for a boat t ill about 5.15 p.m. have then to go home, and effect a change of dress, by which time it is too late for them to reach the technical schools to resume their duties. The country is thus being deprived of a distinct' benefit, inasmuch as these apprentices were gaining technical knowledge, and fitting themselves to become skilled tradesmen.",60
388,Mr WEBSTER,COTTON CULTURE IN,How long has the change been effected ?,61
389,Mr MAHONY,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Since the present Government took office. I hope the M in ister will see justice is done in these matters. ' Mr WEST (East Sydney) [10.27] - I desire to support the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter in regard to the granting of leave of absence to recruits who hail from New South Wales. I placed myself in ' communication with the Defence Department upon this subject, but the replies which I received were very evasive.",61
390,Mr GROOM,COTTON CULTURE IN,Has the honourable ber a reply with him?,61
391,Mr WEST,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Yes . The lads feel that the weeks prior to their embarkation they might reasonably be in training in the State to which they long. I know that it is idle to appeal the m i l it a ry authorities on this question because there is none of the m i l k of human kindness in them. The small concession for which I ask would exert a great beneficial effect on recruiting. also to point out that if a lad is recruited in Sydney, and is brought to Victoria for the purpose of being trained, four months must elapse before he is granted leave of absence to enable him to revisit his heme. I think that the Minister will be carrying out the wish of Parliament if hfe endeavours to keep recruits within their own particular State, and to afford them an opportunity to see their parents as often as possible while they are being trained.",61
392,Mr GROOM,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Darling Downs-Honor ary.Minister) [10.31] - I am advised that men are not sent into training camps outwere, side their' own State unless there is some good and valid reason for doing so.",61
393,Mr WEST,COTTON CULTURE IN,The correspondence does not show that.,61
394,Mr GROOM,COTTON CULTURE IN,"That at all events is the information I have received. I shall bring under the notice of the Minister They what has been said by the honourable member for Hunter and by the honourable member for East Sydney, and shall make f u r ther inquiries; but I am informed that recruits are not unnecessarily taken out of the State in which they enlist. There is no advantage to' be gained by doing so. The desire is that the training shall be carried out as far as possible in the States in which the'men enlist; but in dealing with large bodies of recruits, and with various arms to be trained, regard must be had to efficiency, and the men must be sent where the most effective training can be secured. In some cases, even after men have been transferred, readjustments may be necessary, and, as the honourable member has said, some of them are occasionally returned to the States in which they have enlisted. The Minister, however, sympathizes with the view that as far as possible the men should be trained in their own State, and kept as close as possible to their own homes.",61
395,Mr WEST,COTTON CULTURE IN,"When I spoke to an officer memon the subject on one occasion he said, "" What do the men want to see their mothers of these mothers for ?''",61
396,Mr GROOM,COTTON CULTURE IN,"Whil e such a statement kept might have been made by an individual beofficer, it is not to be taken as representto ing the attitude of the officers generally. No one is in sympathy with such an idea. The Department realizes that it is dealing with men who have feelings and emotions and which should be studied and .considered. I wish I have made a note of the matter to which the honourable member for Dalley has referred, and shall, as desired, bring before the Minister the two cases he bas mentioned. The honourable member for South Sydney referred this afternoon to a regulation which he said had only recently come into operation, and which deals with the question of forfeiture of pay. The position is that soldiers while abroad may commit certain offences, for which they are punished by deductions being made from their pay, and that in some cases where such men have subsequently lost their iivos it has been found, when the settlement of their affairs has taken place, that deductions have to be made in respect of such penalties. I understand that the procedure is not a new one, but results from the Defence Act, which provides for forfeiture of pay in certain cases. A modification of the regulation has been made, but solely with the object of bringing it into conformity with the Act. I shall, however, bring the'matter under the notice of the Minister. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.36 p.m.",61
