5,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,CLOSINO DOWN OF WORK IN SOUTH,"My attention has been directed by nearly all the representatives of South Australia to the newspaper statement to which the honourable member refers.

25,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No definite conclusions have been arrived at in that regard; but inquiries, so far as they have gone, tend to show that the extent to which the Department of the Postmaster-General can placeorders with the Small Arms Pactory at Lithgow for telephone parts is so small that in moat cases it would not pay to make the necessary tools with which to carry out the job.

I did so, and reported arrange for an appointment the arrangements to Mr Storey; and, on the 23rd January, 1920, he wrote me a (Signed) letter, in the course of which he statedI shall be very much obliged if you take up the direction of the work, according; to those arrangements, on Tuesday, 27 January. (Signed) JOHN STOREY. A f t e r the campaign was over I received an official letter, dated the 15th A p r from the Premier's office, signed by the Premier's private secretary, Mr Gordon Childe, in the course of which he wroteiMr Storey asks me once more to thank you for the tremendous assistance you gave in the recent campaign . . . .

Yours very sincerely, (Signed) JACK STOREY. In 1921, after Mr Storey's return from England, what is known in New South Wales aa the Propagandists and Organizers Union was formed to combat Tammany in the Labour movement, and to protect the individual members against the victimization of Tammany. There was a pledge drawn up in connection with this new organization. Mr John Storey youHereunder joined this anti-Tammany organization and signed that"" pledge. It is as folPLEDGE OF MEMBERSHIP.

Following this came the recent State elections in New South Wales. I received an official letter from the then SolicitorMr Storey General, which readsParliament of New South Wales; Sydney, 3rd January, 1922. Dear Mr Catts, . Cabinet unanimously decided to ask you to take the position of Labour Campaign Director the ensuing State elections, and I would to be glad if you would be good enough to with the Premier.

I informed him that, upon arrangements beting made for the proper control of the will finances-to meet objections which I had raised in Sydney, and in this House also th - and upon the Australian Labour party executive agreeing with the request of the Government, I would accept the position. Mr Dooley went to the Australian Labour i l , party executive, aud made the request to that body;, and, with only two dissentients out of thirty-four, the following motion was carried: ",20

57,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,A contradiction of statePrivate Secretary. ments in the form of debate.,21
58,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is not so. I the am showing that on Eriday last a serious himcharge was made to the effect that the lata Mr John Storey had stated, in the late Parliamentary Labour party, that the Federal party should not have such a help man as myself withi n its ranks. I am demonstrating by these official documents which I have before me, and which are available for inspection, that that assertion is a fabrication. The motion which I was about to quote is as followsAustralian Labour Party, State of New South Wales, MACDonell House, Sydney. 12th January, 1922 Mr J. H. Catts, M.H.R., Commonwealth Offices, Sydney. Dear Sir, I have much pleasure in giving a copy of the resolution passed by the last meeting of my executivo: That Mr J. II . Catts, M.H.R., be appointed Campaign Director. Yours faithfully, (Signed) W. CAKKY, General Secretary. Those documentary facts complete refutation of this fabrication by the honourable member for West Sydney, namely, that Mr Storey had made the statement which has been alleged. Tfae late gentleman could not possibly have done so, and, at the same' time, have written the letters which I have just quoted. Furthermore, the attitude of the Labour Ministry and the Australian Labour party executive up to a few months ago shows that they all sought to be associated with me before the public as their campaign leader. The next misstatement by the honourable member for West Sydney was that the executive which expelled me was the same executive in regard to which he had quoted some remarks of my own in the course of his speech. It was not the same executive at all , because a number of the members had retired in order to become candidates at the State elections. Under the rules of the party, this course was imperative. The vacant positions upon the executive were thereupon filled by runners-up who had failed to gain a majority vote at the conference; and these new individuals altered the character of the executive altogether. Thereupon, as soon as the Tammany crowd realized this altered position, and that ir. gave them a majority, I was expelled by eighteen votes to thirteen..",21

Mr J . H . OATT.S - If you, sir, think that my explanation is too lengthy, I shall endeavour to curtail it . The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Lambert) said that I had been expelled for turning traitor aud being disloyal. The Labour 2sews of 3rd form a June last, which contained the report of the General Secretary of the Australian Labour party, stated that my expulsion was on account of an article in the Sunday Times on 2nd A p r i l ; and I shall leave the matter there.

I sent a reply next day that I was prepared to make a statement at the Conference; and I endeavoured to obtain permission from the Chairman (Mr . Lambert) to get the call in order to do so. The apology was drawn up in order to get a categorical statement of the damaging facts before the Labour Conference, but no statement was allowed to be made. The relation of the facts was so damning to Mr Bailey that he and Mr Lambert, upon the advice of their solicitors, refused to allow it to be read to the Conference. The issue of the w r it followed.

We have in the Speech a reiteration of by promises that have been made over and over again. Promise after promise has We been made by the Government, but nothing has been accomplished. These - promises are renewed periodically, but are not followed by any progressive action on the part of the Ministry. In paragraph 18 of the Address we have the statementMy Advisers recognise that the welfare and progress of the Commonwealth depend upon primary production, and that a successful policy of land settlement is intimately associated witli the provision of means of communication, and so on. Cultivation during the last six years has been reduced in Australia.",23
67,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Doc s the honourable member say that the area under cultivation has been reduced?  wheat in Australia in 1913-14 was 9,2S7,398 acres, whereas in 1920-21 it was only 9,069,000, showing a decrease of over 200,000 acres. We have in His Excellency's Speech the further statement thatMy Ministers, recognising the great value of the primary industries to Australia, and the rapidity of tlieir expansion, have taken definite action to open up new markets and further exploit old ones. To this end they have in every way in tlieir power assisted the' producers to place their goods upon the world's market hy co-operative effort. This, again, is excellent propaganda. Abraham Lincoln said, "" Y o u may fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you. cannot fool all the people all the time."" I invite honourable members to consider the statements in the above paragraph in the light of the knowledge that we have a declining production, and that some 30,000 or 40,000 who were on the land have left it during the last decade. The Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) smiles, and seems to think he will be able to refute my statement. He may show that the amount received in respect of the reduced production is greater, but the fact that the area under cultivation has declined is a most material consideration in this connection. It would not be out of place to carefully examine paragraph 19 in His Excellency's Speech. In what way and by whom are these new markets to which reference is made to be opened up? there any evidence of a desire on the part of the Government to open up new markets? Owing to action of this Parliament during the last twelve months, revenue to the extent of millions of pounds has been lost to us. In Java and the neighbouring islands there are over 50,000,000 people who are anxious to trade with us and with whom the people of Australia wish to trade. We could very well do with their trade. As a primary-producing country, we could supply them with many of the commodities they require, but we cannot enter into trade with them on a reasonable reciprocal basis. We ask them to give us free ports, and yet our ports are closed tight to them. That is the treatment that we have extended, for instance, to the people of Java and F i j i.  are greater than our exports to it.  was opening up an excellent trade with the people of Java and the neighbouring islands, who were beginning to take and appreciate our grapes, our apples, our flour and our wheat. Quite recently commercial representatives from Java were inquiring in Western Australia as to the possibility of a regular supply of meat. It is necessary for us to export more meat in order to bring in fresh capital; but when we ask these people to give us the most favourable trade relations they at once remind us that under our Tariff there is a duty of Ss. 4d. per central on «heir bananas entering this country.",24
68,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I "" tipped,"" five minutes ago, a reference by the honourable member to that item in the Tariff.  gentleman's conscience is laden with such a responsibility, it is no wonder that he expected me to refer to the duty on bananas. Primary production and its encouragement in Australia are of vital importance ; but what is the actual position ? Because of our Tariff, South Africa has set up a reprisal Tariff on our wheat, and the United States of America is ever increasing its Tariff against us. To whom shall we be able shortly to look? To whom shall we be able to go with our produce? We have vast financial obligations, and it is not possible for us to get rid of our Is enormous national debt unless we have trade relations with other countries on a clear, well-established basis. It is mere "" flap-doodle "" on the part of the Government to talk about sending Trade Commissioners to other countries to open up trade with people whom we have offended in this way. When our Trade Commissioners seek new business in the East, they will bo reminded that we have closed our doors to their products. When we seek trade with them, we need to have something to offer in return. All sides of the House are agreed that the only immigrants we require are those who are prepared to go on the land and to increase our production. Increased production, is the need of the hour, if Australia is to progress. But why is it that the people already in our cities, who are at all conversant with the conditions here, will nob settle on the land? Why is it that we have to bring people 12,000 miles overseas to settle on the lands of Australia? The people in'our cities ancl towns will not go on the land, and many of those who have done so are forsaking the primary industries. Surely there must be something sadly wanting!",24
69,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It was only a day or two ago that the honourable member told us of the child slavery associated with land settlement.  largely due to the policy and tactics of the party to which the honourable member belonged. It would be interesting to examine the reasons why thousands of our citizens will not go on the land, and why so many are forsaking the primary industries. We are sending to the uttermost ends of the earth for land settlers, and only about 3 per cent, of those who come here go on the land. It is of paramount importance that we should determine the responsibility for this state of affairs. Every one recognises that the prosperity of a country depends on its primary production. Why is it, then, that we cannot induce people to go on the land? In the first place, our primary producers find the fight of competition in the world's market is too great for them. They are further removed from the principal markets of the world than .any - cornpefciaag country, and this .Parliament has done nothing to help them in - this direction. In no less than sixtyone countries agricultural machinery and the machinery of production are exempt from import duties; but Australia places heavy imposts on the machinery required by those who are producing for world competition. There, [14] again, Ave have another handicap imposed on the .primary producer. I am not going to deal at, present with the question of income tax, since I have an idea that the newly-appointed Treasurer (Mr Bruce) is honestly seeking to devise a .consolidated taxation measure which will be a credit to the Parliament, and not a discredit, like the amending Taxation Assessment Bill which was carried through at the close of last session.",25
70,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Does the honourable member want to exempt farmers from taxation?  for any such exemption. All that the people on the land ask is that a measure of justice shall be granted them. They ask that they be put on the same basis as other sections of the community. in so far as the income tax is concerned. At present they arc on a different footing. All parties say that primary production is of vital importance, yet the primary producers have to pay more by way of taxation than does any other section of the community in respect of the same amount of income. When the immigrants who are settling on the land discover that the incidence of our taxation is such that they are liable to pay three times more in respect of the same return than. is any other section of the community, they will wake up. At present they are too much like Pilgrim's man 1 with the muck-rake-the y have no time to look into these things. When they do become fully conscious of this treatment they will refuse to be fleeced any longer. If we are to have hundreds of thousands of people streaming into this country to go on the land, we must deal thoroughly with the whole question of taxation, and so make it possible for them to carry on. We must also take into consideration the opening up of new markets in other countries on a reciprocal basis. I fail to find evidence of an attempt on the part of the Government to do anything in that direction. It will he a mere waste of time and money to bring more peopio here, unless simultaneously with our immigration policy the Murray Waters scheme and the Western Australian settlement scheme are proceeded with, and there is a genuine desire on the part of the States and the Federal Governments to provide markets for the produce raised in Australia. W it h the exception of a few of the items we send abroad there is no stability about the price of certain commodities consumed in Australia. season we find potatoes quoted at £ 2 10s. per to n ; at another time they are sold at £ 2 5 or £ 3 0 per ton. One year onions fetch £ 2 5 or £ 3 0 per ton; next year their seriously. price may be as low as £ 2 10s. per ton.",25
71,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Of course there are no fluctuations in wages.  sented by the honourable member have so organized as to have had representation in the legislative halls of Australia for many years past, and to have secured, by means of Arbitration Court awards, the regulation of hours of labour and rates of pay. Although there may be no guarantee that a man renders service for the money he receives, he must get a minimum wage; but there is no such assurance to those persons who wish to go on the land. They must take all the risks. In a Parliament containing representatives of all sections of the people of Australia, facts ought to be viewed as they exist, and not with the limited vision of the interests of one small section. Por instance, we find the honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis), the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), and the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), or at least two of them, getting on public platforms in their constituencies and referring to the "" littl e Country party "" as being a menace. Of course they are merely following the lead given by the Prime Minister.",26
72,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I did not make such a remark.  member says that he did not utter this remark I gladly withdraw my charge against him, but I think it can be shown that these three honourable members were really engaged in apologizing for their amended ? attachment to the National Government. Honourable members of the Country party have no occasion to make apologies. are certainly twitted from the House and the other, and the Prime Minister has made use of the long recess to visit the States, not for the purpose of setting forth a statesmanlike policy for the benefit of the people of Australia, but more than anything else for the purpose of endeavouring to damn the Country party, so that he might have a greater following, and so that he might have One more of those followers who apologize for following him.",26
73,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member appears to take himself and his party very  must regard this "" little party "" rather seriously, otherwise he would not waste so - much time on it . He said to the people, "" The Country party has done nothing for you. It was the National Government that gave you an averaging system in taxation."" The amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act , to which the right honourable gentleman referred, was an insult to the intelligence of this House.",26
74,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I think that the honourable member should stand by his own views on the matter.  reply to the Treasurer's interjection, I shall read the reply given by the Commissioner of Taxation to the request of the Taxpayers' Association for information concerning the operation of the averaging system. The Commissioner pointed out that "" the scheme does not involve the payment of tax on an average income."" Of course it does not. It is a scheme by which payment is based on a rate of income which, without any stretch of imagination, can be shown to possess greater anomalies than existed before the Act was amended.",26
75,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Then the honourable member condemns the system.  ment was before the House I condemned it , but I accepted the assurance of the M i nister in charge of the House at the time that an amendment would soon follow.",26
76,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Then why did the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) claim credit for getting the Act,26

Of course, his purpose was to forestall our moving to have our plank adopted by this Parliament. He was one of those "" as good as a Country party Nationalists. Naturally. I supported him. I want to secure the passage of legislawealth tion suitable to the people, and I care ultimately not if a motion comes from, this side or already. the other side of the chamber so long as saidwhat is sought to be enacted is just and proper. Of course, we know that polithrough tical tactics are introduced into these things, but I shall be pleased to learn that the Government will bring down a secondary just measure of taxation of primary protry ducers. These people cannot be expected to look for less than justice. If we wanty to get settlers on the land, we must treat them justly, and not throw dust in their eyes, as the Prime Minister does when claims that it was his party who gave the averaging system in taxation, cerning which the Federal Taxation Comquoted missioner states that ib is not an averagof ing on incomes. Just before Christmas I strongly criticised the GoAustralia vernment's proposal. I regarded it as a getting along. clumsy ancl worthless amendment, but I voted for it because it was an admission of the averaging principle, and I accepted the Minister's assurance that after the final report of the Taxation Commission had been received an amending Bill of would be brought forward to put the systed, tem on a proper basis. I had no intena tion of making such an extensive ence to taxation, but the present system is a deterrent toi the settlement of the land. The primary producers are unduly brought taxed.

We of Taxation have the land and the opportunities for immigrants if we only broaden our aspect, and give them a reasonable opportunity voured to make good.

Prime Minister and his Government proclaim the same doctrine, and I find Mr Gullett, a Nationalist, who is seeking to unseat another Nationalist in this Chamber, preaching it . I find, also, that "" business people are beginning to realise that the policy adopted by the Commonis no longer tenable, and must fail , if indeed it has not failed Mr Gullett, in his speech, There was only one road, and that road lay great areas of undeveloped country. 'If the Federal Parliament gave during ten years as much attention to the development of primary industries ns it had given to the industries, the wealth of this counwould have been doubled and trebled. If this gentleman happens to be returned to this House-and I can assure the honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis) that the people at Caulfield cheered him he and applauded that statement-som e furthem ther apologies will have to be made. I conwant to know why the speaker I have does not enlist under the banner the Country party at once, because all last that we'seek is to develop the whole of and give every one a chance of As I was saying, we find big business people are beginning to be perturbed about the position of affairs in the Commonwealth.

Although private individuals have, in most cases, endeato exercise economy in carrying on their unfortunately the same does not apply to Governments, who should rather set t an example than continue lavish expenditure.

That was mainly due to excessive shipments of chilled . aud frozen hoof from the Argentine to the United Kingdom. There was a great struggle between American and Argentine shippers, and until that struggle ceased, the prospects for Australia were unfavorable. If burdens continue to be heaped on Hie man on the land rather than offering him every inducement to increase' production, concluded Mr Niall, instead of being able to attract settlers to Australia, we shall see the movement from the country to the cities accentuated, and immigration schemes must fail. Those are wise words fro m a wise man, and their wisdom is proved by the fact that what Mr Nial l said will happen is happening.",26
78,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Especiall y the c u t t in g ' down of wages.  able member is astute enough to know that the solution of our problem is not to make things costly by increasing wages, but to improve the purchasing power of money. If the Parliament would set to work with that aim in view,' and make it possible for the man on the land to produce enough money for the others to spend, our troubles would be lessened. At the present time money is being spent faster than the man on the land can produce it , and at the same time he is being hampered with direct taxation, Customs duties, railway freights, and middlemen's charges, to such an extent that a situation is being created that is quite untenable, having regard to the fact that Australia's primary products have to compete with those of the outside world.",28

Government, and incidentally the Opposition, who, representing the majoritv of the population centred about the cities of Australia, have voted as dictated by the manufacturers and consumers only. Like the three gentlemen to whom I have already referred, uhlfey voted for the highest Tariff possible, regardless of appeals from those who represent the men on the land, simply because implements and machinery are manufactured near the cities. But as soon as there arises a question regarding the price of sugar to feed the people of Melbourne, those same persons display gross inconsistency. If I ask for a (heap harvester I am told that I am in favour of black labour, but notwithstanding the declaration of a White Australia in connection with the growing of a primary commodity, these people demand that it be sold to them cheaply because the price of the i mported article happens to be low. I , too, want cheap sugar, but I also want cheap machinery, and therefore I am consistent. Those others who increase the price of machinery and yet ask I for cheap primary products are inconsistent. Honourable members opposite voted for a high T a r if f to be paid by the people outside of Melbourne, but they demand that their metropolitan constituents be supplied with sugar at a low price. Bearing, in mind the fact that Australia cent, is not a. manufacturing country, the in statistics gathered at the latest cenwire sus are startling. I would like Austo be able to manufacture of the all it requires, but the time when we can profitably do that has not yet 300 arrived. We still require to purchase many things abroad as a means of trading The following statistics from Knibbs give the percentages of city population to total population in each of the capital cities of the Commonwealth and of some other countries :METROPOLITAN POPULATION. State or Country. .Metropolis. Now South Wales Sydney Victoria Melbourne 50.00 Queensland Brisbane South Australia.. Adelaide Western Australia Perth Tasmania Hobart Commonwealth . . (Six cities) Denmark Copenhagen . . England London Saxony Dresden Norway Christiania Netherlands Amsterdam . . Ireland Dublin 9.18 Belgium Brussels Bavaria Munich Those figures disclose an extremely serious state of affairs. If Australia were a manufacturing country, aud the people about the cities were producing things to sell to other countries in return for money which would help to meet our national debt, these secondary industries would be of national benefit; but under the present hot-house treatment they are actually crippling the people on the land, who alone are creating new money. It must be manifest to the House that the method adopted in the past has been equivalent to placing the cart before the horse. Give the horse a chance, and the cart will follow in the natural order of things.",28
81,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"How does the honourable member account for the high price of agricultural land in view of the conditions he is describing?  cessively high, comparatively speaking. I could take the honourable member to first class land which he may select at 10s. per acre payable in twenty years without interest?",29
82,Mr CONSTDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,How much of that land has the honourable member got ?  am working it for the benefit of men like the honourable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine).,29
83,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Does the honourable member suggest that his comparison with the city populations of other countries is fair?  significant. These countries have found it highly advantageous to distribute their Percentage populations; their factories have been so on Total of decentralized that there is no question of Stale or costly haulage to centres of consumption. Country. The whole of their economic systems, indeed, is distinctly to their material ad42.89 vantage. The Australian States, how27.80 ever, are in the reverse position. In New 51.63 South Wales and Western Australia, par47.04 ticularly, enormous distances have to be 24.54 traversed in hauling foodstuffs to the con43.10 sumers. Frequently the producers have 20.02 the experience of sending their commodi12.22 ties to market and getting nothing for 11.07 them.. Indeed, we sometimes get lessthan 9.86 nothing; for we are charged freight purely 9.54 for the honour and privilege of despatch8.77 ing our products to the points of con8.66 sumption. Such are the evils of centralization. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) made a. great mistake, in spending a considerable part of the recess in visiting the various States, when he did not give the people an assurance, of his earnest intention to bring about conditions which would conduce to the true development of Australian industries. It is regrettable that the Prime Minister preferred to occupy more time in criticising the actions and intentions of other people, such as he saw or interpreted them. I would remind honourable members of the wild promises of the Prime Minister before the last general elections. I have in mind particularly the payment of the solders' gratuities. Therewas unseemly bidding between the two old political parties concerning which would promise to give the most. The promises of both sides were that the soldiers should have their money, but without much regard to the manner in which it should be given them. The view taken by the Country party was that the Prime Minister should have considered very weightily the whole of the circumstances before making promises of cash payment. The Country party held that the gratuity should be distributed in such a way that the gift would prove of lasting advantage to the soldiers and to the country for whom they had fought. We proposed that they should be made shareholders in a huge national company, having a capital of £30,000,000, and that with that capital they should become the manufacturers and the merchants of the land for which they had fought. Thus, they would have had their gratuity in perpetuity. But the huge sum has been distributed to the soldiers in a manner which can only be described, at best, as thoughtless; and it has become as a handful of sand strewn upon a lawn-pic k it up if you can ! The whole history of the gratuity reveals a sad lack of statesmanship on the part of the Prime Minister. As for my personal views upon this matter, I moved an amendment to enable the soldiers to do voluntarily what ought to have been compulsorily done for them, without any consideration of electioneering bidding with wild promises of cash. Another of the electioneering cries heard during the last campaign was thatrigid economy should be observed in the interests of the taxpayers. Upon an examination of the financial statements of the Government last year, one is confirmed in the view that there was abso- (lutely no sincerity in such promises. The same must be said following an examination of the advance statement of the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) last week, for there are stall no indications of the promised economies.",29
84,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That does not matter. The honourable member and his party will still go on supporting the Government.  certain honourable members are scared that I am about to move a vote of want of confidence. Another of the promises of the Prime Minister during the last election campaign was in the form of a sop to Labour sympathizers. The Prime Minister makes promises wide enough to take in the world, the flesh, and the devil. The right honourable gentleman desired to cause quite a number of Labour supporters to be deflected from their adherence, and, therefore, he promised tliem the basic wage. Tho Prime Minister undertook to appoint a Commission to ascertain what was a reasonable basic wage for a man having a wife and three children. This Commission was subsequently sent forth to investigate. It examined a few of the facts, and then the Prime Minister was informed that if he carried out his promise the basic wage would ruin Australia. Such was the outcome of the Prime Minister's electioneering promise-on e which had been given without any consideration at all. The Prime Minister had to admit that he did not know how the recommendation of the Commission could be put into practical effect. A statesman would have known before ho made any such promise; and a statesman would, therefore, never have put the country to the expense of paying for the Commission. However, this business was merely in keeping with the methods of the right honourable gentleman in making promises to the public, and in using the taxpayers of the country to pay for those promises. Mr CoNsiDrNE - Then why continue to support the Government?  the Government.",30
85,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No ; the honourable member is merely making an electioneering speech.  cuts some ice."" I am. not making an electioneering speech; for what I am now saying is, to a large extent, a reiteration of what I said two years ago, when there 1 was no election in view. I warn the people of Australia to beware of the Prime Minister's electioneering promises. One of those launched for the coming campaign has to do with a superannuation for the Pulblic Service. We have in Australia today, in the States and Commonwealth combined, a Public Service numbering 248,000, and these oflicials are receiving in annual salaries £55,000,000. We are going to the bad financially. The balance-sheets of the Federation and of practically all the States are becoming more and more alarming. But an election is due, and the great army of Federal public servants is promised a Superannuation Bill. This latest promise of the Prime Minister is just auother sop, and it is being - proffered as hastily and with just as little consideration as were the other promises. Beforo the Public Service is granted a superannuation measure, one desires to be assured that a. fair return is being given for the huge salary bill. Is the Public Service rendering full and proper return'? Is it necessary that Australia should be saddled with an annual payment of £55,000,000 ? *  much.  State and Commonwealth services combined. .Since the Postmaster-General, flit* honourable member for Grey (Mr. Fuyntoii), has interjected, I desire to pay hi in a compliment. I am moved to do so, not because he has been doing much for my constituency of late. That is not the point. The Government have announced that it is their intention to make a real endeavour to bring the arrears of work associated with the postal services up to date. The House recognises that this is no party matter. Tf we are to develop and produce in competition with other countries we must be able to take full advantage of the time-saving appliances which the ingenuity of. man has devised; and the expenditure will be wise no matter what the conditions of the exchequer. These time-saving strings of intelligence must be extended to those people in the country who are creating wealth and adding to the peace and comfort of Australia; and the Postmaster General has my commendation for his action in this regard. It does appear to nie, however, that really the Prime Minister is ""Hughesing "" the people of this country. I hope that this session of Parliament will be occupied in giving consideration to those more weighty matters, such as economy, justice in. taxation, the extension of telephonic communication, and the removal of all obstacles in the way of development.",30
86,Mr LISTER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Why not economize a little time!  unwisely taking up ths time of this Chamber in making these remarks. My anxiety is to at once deal with those questions which matter most. I was ashamed when I sat here at the close of last session', and, there being a Christmas feeling in ""the House, Bills were brought in by the barrow-load and the clumsiest of work, without thought or consideration of their merits, bestowed on them. I was assured on mere than one occasion-for instance, in regard to the taxation assessment measure-that if there was much opposition the measure would be pitched under the table. I have ventured to speak at length in order so to show! that I am prepared, if the Government and the House are prepared, to deal with those measures that will really assist the progress of the country. We have been here now nearly three weeks and have done nothing; and if I have occupied a fair amount of time this afternoon, what I have said will indicate that I , ut any rate, mean business; if the Government does not mean business they know what to expect so far as I am con; cerned.

I never listen to the lamentations of this modern Jeremiah but I am reminded of a story that was told about an old farmer friend of mine, whom I knew very well. He was noted throughout the countryside in which he lived for the characteristic that no matter what happened he always grumbled. If it rained, it rained too soon or too late, or there was a little too mueh or a little too little. Another friend of mine went to see him one day when there was a wonderful season. His farm from end to end was an absolute picture of prosperity; the crops were showing over all the fences, and nothing could be better than the prospect from his verandah. My friend said to him, ""Well, what are you grumbling about today?"" He was, of course, grumbling as usual; and when asked whether anything could be better than his crops, he replied, "" Ah! but just look at what they are taking out of the ground."" ' When I hear the honourable member for Swan complaining about the income tax, I cannot help thinking that, probably, if the truth were known, it would be discovered that he is paying in income tax from the products of his land a sum which the average citizen would regard with envy if he could think that he was to receive it as his annual income. And, further, the fact that the honourable gentleman has to pay this income tax is due, and due very largely, to the policy of this Government in supporting the primary producers of the country in obtaining the prices they have obtained, I shall have occasion later on in the course of my remarks to show those gentlemen in the corner, who are never course. tired of slandering this country, and have been drawing their political lifethe blood by their defamation of the country, that, considered in its broad is not one scrap or iota of t r u th in what they are telling the public. The honorpledge able: member condemns the amending In - sion's report. come Tax Assessment Bill which was brought down in order to give effect to the averaging rate in income taxation, and his Leader (Dr Earle Page) has gone throughout the length and breadth of Australia claiming credit for that very legislation.",31

89,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable gentlekept. man has claimed credit for this measure, though the credit does not belong to him, ahead. whoever it may belong to. The Government, before the last election, and before the Country' party came into being, gave a definite promise, in the policy speech livered in Bendigo, that, in regard to anomalies which it was admitted existed in connection with direct taxation, in so far as that taxation affected primary producers, they would appoint a Comto mission to inquire into these particular questions. No sooner was the Governwe ment returned to office than it set to to form a Commission, and one of the very things in regard to which it was specially asked to report- I think the ference to the Commission was drawn i i by the honourable member for Balaclava the circumstances.

Por the Leader of the Country party, or anybody else, to claim that he originated this measure, or influenced the decision of the Government in any way, is altoHe gether astray from the facts. One canmen not help stating here that opinion amongst primary producers themselvespeople whose experience goes back very many years)-is very divided as to the right way to deal with the question of direct taxation as it aifects them. The honourable member for Swan says that he believes - that the averaging of the income is the best way, but .there'are many pro- .assisted. ducers who can show just as conclusive figures as he himself has shown that plan is quite wrong. There are many believe that the righ t way is to set profits against losses, and so arrive at a fair equitable basis; and I may say that that is what I personally believe is the right However, the Commission was who appointed, and gave the whole question most exhaustive consideration, and the Government pledged themselves to act aspects, there on their report.",32

101,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Then I will consider the matter from that stand-point. Let us look at it, first of all, from the point of big view of the Gommonwealth.

106,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I shall show presently what a vast difference there is between the proposals of the honourable member for Moreton and what we are proposing to do in the way of assisting the cattlemen. I want, first of all, to examine his remedies.",34
107,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"How does, the honourable gentleman arrive at his estimate of £100,000, which is 5 per cent, on the estimated saving of £2,000,000? Has he any basis for it?",34
108,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I took as a basis- I do not know whether it was right or wrong-the total figures in respect of production. I then took the figures as to the production of meat in arriving at the proportion between the £2,000,000 and the £100,000.",34
109,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is very fallacious, cause cattlemen in a large way of business pay at a very high rate.",34
110,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There ' must be a number of people in a large way of business in all avocations who pay at a very high rate, so the honourable member's argument does not hold water. saving to the cattlemen worked out, as I have said, at 5 per cent.; and I do not tihiiik a reduction of taxation by £2,000,000 per annum would represent a saving of more than £100,000 to the cattlemen alone. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Moreton that there should be a reduction of expenditure, brings' me to the question of whether we can look in the near futur e to a reduction of taxatian. I agree with the honourable member that we should do our utmost to get the people on the land. I am thoroughly in accord with 'him in that regard. I do not think any man has been more earnest than. I have been in my endeavours, in public life, to assist primary production. P r i m a r y production I believe to be one of the great essentials to Australia's prosperity. But what is the position today in regard to land settlement? What is the trouble that we fmd in all the closely settled areas? Is not the price of laird the chief obstacle in the way of the farmer. Is not the high price of land the greatest handicap under which the farmer labours today?",34
111,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It is one of the difficulties.,34
112,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"All who know anything about primary production and the view of the small man will admit that the great trouble is the high price of land. If the farmer could only get his land at one-half or one-third of the price at which it is available today he would be much better off. The whole trouble in this regard arises from the fact that the area of land available in those parts of Australia where there are facilities for primary production on a small scale is not equal to the demand. Proof of that statement is to be found in the constantly soaring price of land. What is the use of the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse) telling me that people will not go on the land when I know that if a block of land in any of the privileged parts of Australia, where there is a large rainfall, is thrown open for selection, there is not one applicant, but often hundreds be- apply for it . Every honourable member knows that that is true. There are hundreds of applicants for every block of land thab is thrown open in any of the privileged par,ts of Australia where there is a sumcient rainfall and facilities for getting one's produce to market. It is idle The for any one to tell me that the people will not go on the land. People are going in for land settlement. The trouble does not arise from the causes which have been suggested by the honourable member, nor does it arise from lack of suitable areas capable of carrying a closely settled rural population. There is land in abundance in this great country. I could take honourable members to magnifioent country, the equal of which I do not believe is to be found in Victoria, but a man could not live on less than about 2,000 acres of it . The reason is that it is far back, and lacks facilities for getting to market the produce which it is so eminently fitted to grow. The difficulty of getting produce to market from sueh. a district is so great that any one who has attempted farming on a small scale there has found it impossible to carry on. There are in Australia vast areas of such country, and it can be opened up only by the expenditure of money and, in many cases, by the expenditure of much money. If we are going to say that taxation must be reduced-that those who have these facilities today, those who have enjoyed all the privileges of the past-ar e not to help to open up the country, what will happen ? If we are to stop the work of developing this country by building more railways, opening up great irrigation schemes, establishing telephone and telegraph services, and providing all the facilities of roads and bridges and reasonable - means of communication, we might as well give up at once attempts to promote settlement. withstanding the great burdens resting on our people, we must, in the interests of our national progress and national safety, press on with the work of development even if it means that whilst practising economy wherever practicable we cannot in the meantime lighten the load of taxation.""",34
113,Dr EAKLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Why not encourage private enterprise to do something when it is willing to engage in such schemes the Gorge scheme?,35
114,Mr GEEENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honorablo member knows that I have given him some assistance with that scheme, but it was one that would not have put another man on the land unless we also provided railwe ways and roads and other facilities. In passing, I wish to refer to the tion of immigration. I believe that unreduced less we can get immigrants the safety of Australia in the future might be i a very parlous position. I believe tion of taxation. we must have immigration side by ber's side with the development of the tion country by the people who are already in Australia, and that we must be preparty pared to press ou with a scheme that w put .people on the land. The Commonmeans wealth Government have taken up the attitude that the task of putting people who are in Australia, the citizens of this country, ou the land is the responsibility of the States, and that it. is the through work of the Commonwealth to assist the States i u regard to works which necessary to open up the country on which immigrants are to be placed. That is the division of responsibility. The Commonhow wealth Government believes that it should got press on with a scheme of assisted i m m imovement. gration and with a scheme of helping those States who are will in g to immigrants on the land. But it will advance money to any State unless, firstly it is satisfied that the land is available and suitable, secondly, it approves of the works upon which the States spend the money provided or raised by the Commonwealth, and, thirdly, it is further satisfied that the State's scheme will provide work for the immigrant on the actual land upon which he will have the right to a block after the first year's service.",35
115,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What have the Government advanced the States up to the preNot- sent?,35
116,Mr GEEENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We have not yet been able to complete an agreement with any State except Western Australia.. We hope that in the near future that agreement will be ready for signature by the State, the Commonwealth, aud the Imperial Government. The Commonwealth are also in negotiation with Victoria and New South Wales for an extension of the Western Australian scheme, which, I beas lieve, is a perfectly sound one, and likely to produce excellent results. Now I come to the other two points raised by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt). We have seen that his hope for large reduced expenditure, if are to press on with the development of the Commonwealth in an adequate way, quescannot be realized. Expenditure may be a little, but not very much. If we are to press ou with the work of developn ment, we cannot expect very much reducThe honourable memsecond proposal was that co-operashould be extended. Long before any of the honourable members of the Country thought of politics, and particularly ill of using the primary producers .as a of getting them into Parliament, I was at work among the primary producers helping a scheme of - co-operation. No one has been a greater friend of this principle than I have been. I have lived the experience of what the application of it means to the primary proare ducer. I remember that when I was first interested in co-operation I was getting l j d . per gallon for my milk, and I know many years it took before we any real benefit out of the I applaud the honourable member on his conversion to coplace operative ideals. It is one of those not things in which I thoroughly believe, and which I realise will prove one of the greatest possible aids to the primaryproducers of this country. But there is a long row to hoe. It will be many days before the honourable member, if he preaches the gospel of co-operation to his cattle friends in Queensland, will be able to get them into line.",35
117,Mr WIENHOLT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Why ?,36
118,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am simply telling the honourable member what my own experience has been. It has taken a long time to get dairying people into line in co-operation, and it will take an equally long time to get the cattlemen of Queensland into line. In this instance, it will not .be simply a question of finding £10,000 or £12,000 among seventy or eighty dairymen. It will be a matter of finding millions of pounds to set up cooperative meat works for the purpose of dealing with the exportable beef of this country. What will be the use of purchasing works in Brisbane to help the cattle-owners north of Townsville?",36
119,Mr WTENHOLT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I suggested that there should be three works.,36
120,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Exactly . It will be necessary to get three works, and .also all the finance which will enable the cattle to be got into those works and sent overseas. It will be a colossal task, and will involve the raising of a vast sum of money. I do not know whether the honourable member is prepared to go up north and preach his gospel to the cattleowners of Queensland, together with the gospel he has preached here in opposition to the payment of the bonus which these very men have asked the Government to give them in their desperate need. Now let me deal with the last and remaining remedy suggested by the honourable member for Wide Bay, that is, to improve the breed of cattle. Here I am at one with the honourable member. I agree that we can still do a great deal to raise the standard of our beef cattle. But I ask the honourable member, who knows something about the matter, how long it will take to produce the necessary sires to have any real material effect upon the improvement of the breed as a whole in this country? One herd, two herds, or three herds, could be dealt with easily; but when it is a matter of applying the improvement to the whole industry, the production of the sires alone would mean a life-time's work, and even when we have the sires, any one who knows anything about cattle-breeding will realise, as I am sure the honourable member must, that the disappointments are almost as many as the good results. It would --be a long, long process, and very many years would elapse before any real improvement could be effected.",36
121,Mr WIENHOLT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is all the more reason for making an iinmediate start.,36
122,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I agree with the honourable member; but what would be the use of his proposal when dealing with the problem that confronted the Government? It was an immediate problem. It was not one that could be dealt with in the dim and distant future, or one that could be assisted by building up cooperative enterprise or improving the breed of cattle. Those steps would not have benefited the cattlemen of Queensland in the dilemma in which they found themselves, nor would the reduction of taxation have helped them in the very least. There were thousands, tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of fat cattle in Queensland for which there was no market. It was impossible to export them. It did not pay to drove them to the ports to ship them to the markets in the southern States. There they were, these fat cattle that could not be shipped, and for which their owners could find no market. What would have been the value of the honourable member's remedy in those circumstances? Would the reduction of taxation of £100,000 have shifted one hoof from the cattle stations? When cattle have been fed and are prime, there is an economic loss to the country if they are not shipped, because when they pass their prime they promptly lose their value. The Government's remedy was to try to give these people all the benefit we could. We called into our councils the cattle-men themselves, the shipping people, those who were in control of the meat works and the men engaged in the works. We said that if they would all agree among themselves, the ship-owners to give a reduction of £d. per lb., the managers qf the meat works to cut down their charges by Jd. per lb., and the employees to cut down their wages by Jd. per lb., the Government would give a subsidy of Jd. per lb., and thus make the advantage to tha cattle-owners l d . per lb. The immediate result was that the meat works started operations again.",36
123,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,How many works ?,37
124,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers) tells me that the bulk of them actually commenced work. I am sorry to say that as a result of the season in Queensland failing to some extent, the number of cattle treated will not be as many as we anticipated. Nevertheless, the action taken by the Government has given very material relief to men who were in a desperate position. They are very grateful for what the Government have done. But the benefit is not confined to them. As the honourable member knows well, the fact that , these f at cattle could not be sold had a depressing effect on the whole market, upon the price of weaners, stores, cows, and breeders-righ t down the line; but when the Government got this "" top hamper"" moving off, the result was an immediate improvement in market all round. Therefore, it was not merely a question of the Government giving a subsidy of £200,000 that meant a benefit of £800,000 to the cattlemen of Queensland. All the other cattle-owners in Australia benefited to some extent.",37
125,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,How long does the subsidy ; last ?,37
126,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,For this season only.,37
127,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,How much has been paid?,37
128,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"At the moment I cannot say what the position is, but the fact is that the undertaking of the Government to give this help has been of immense assistance to the cattlemen, and I believe that they are grateful for it.",37
129,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If they have a good year, will they pay back the money ?",37
130,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I should not ask them to do that. I propose to deal further with the speech delivered by the honourable mem some remarks made by the honorablo. member for Robertson (Mr Fleming). They were typical of the speeches which have been delivered all over Australia by,' I think, every honourable member of the Country party, with the exception probably of the honourable members for Maranoa (Mr Hunter), Moreton (Mr . Wienholt), and New England (Mr H a y ) . From most of the other honourable members of the Country party, including the meat Leader (Dr Earle Page), we have heard a continuous wail about the parlous condition of the primary industries of this country. It has been said, not once, but many times, by the honourable member for Cowper, his Deputy Leader (Mr . Fleming), and the honourable member for  duction is decreasing, that people! are going off the land, and that everything affecting the interests of 'the primary producers is in as bad a state as it can be. The Leader of the Oountry party said the other day that the net result of the advent of the present Government to office was a decrease of 11 per cent, in the total primary production of this country. I shall deal by-and-by with those figures, and quote others which, I think, will show that the honourable member hag never given to this question one minute's consideration, and the that he does not care "" tuppence"" about the primary, producer, except as a stick with which to flog the Government. He does not know anything about the condition of the primary industries, if one may judge by nine-tenths of the speeches that he delivers. Honourable members in the corner are never tired of saying that they desire people to go upon the land. One gentleman who listened to the Leader of the Country party and his Deputy in Adelaide recently told me something of the tenor of their speeches. There they were, he said, praying for people to go upon the land, and, at the same time, painting a.picture of the condition of the man upon the land which would frighten any individual from ever aspiring to a rura l existence. That is what those honourable members have been doingo from one end of Australia to the other. I would not so much mind audi tactics if the picture they drew were true, but, as I shall show directly, it is the very opposite to a true representation of the condition of primary production in this country.",37
131,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The Minister's' own speech is not very cheering.,37
132,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"At any rate, I shall finish more cheerfully. The honourable member for Robertson seemed the other day to exhibit almost a fiendish joy at the fact that the great steel industry at Newcastle was not progressing. We all know what are the causes of the temporary eclipse - I believe it is purely temporary 1 - of that industry at the present time. But I say with all earnestness that unless it does prosper in the near future God help tins country if it is ever called upon to defend itself.",37
133,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What are the causes'!,38
134,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I think tihey are purely economic, but I do not wish to be led into a long discussion of them at this stage. The honourable member for Robertson complained . about increased taxation, which he seemed to regard as peculiarly the sin of the present Government. I remind him that, with the exception of one taxation Bill , which passed through the House in his absence-h e was doing his duty nobly elsewhere-li e voted for every increase that was submitted.",38
135,Mr FLEMIN G,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"But the Government have placed a Tariif on top of that taxation, and destroyed the whole scheme.",38
136,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That excuse will not serve. The honourable member was not complaining <about the Tariif when he was speaking; he was complaining about the incidence of direct taxation, and I am reminding him that, with one exception, he voted for every increase. We have heard a good deaJ of coonplaint ahowt the d r if t of population from the country to the city. I do not propose to follow in detail the absurd comparison put forward by the honourable member  lations of European and Australian capitals in proportion to the total populations of their respective countries. He compared one city in Australia with London. Everybody knows that Glasgow, Liverpool, and Birmingham are infinitely , greater than any one of our Australian cities - free from blame in that respect. A little  lation of capital cities.",38
137,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That comparison as a.n argument will hold no more water than does a sieve. We are all aware that the d r if t of population to the metropolitan ai-eas is a world-wide' problem, and that its causes are mainly economic. One of the chief factors which has led to the establishment of great cities, the d r if t of population thither, and. the abandonment of many country centres cf industry, has been the fact that the .economic conditions under which industry is carried on today make it absolutely necessary to have massed production. The old fashioned order by which - a local manufacturer worked a small plant with a few workmen has passed. We must today go in for mass production, and that leads to the accumulation of people about the cities. In addition, Australia has. peculiar topographical features which, of themselves, do> very much to cause the d r if t of population towards the coastline. That is one factor that we cannot overcome - But I join issue with honourable members in the ""corner when they talk about the deserted homesteads of this country.",38
138,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Does the Minister say that there are none ?,38
139,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I do not. But where do we find the people who have deserted those homesteads? L i v in g in the city upon the losses they made upon the land - I suppose they still own, the land which they have deserted. Between Toorak and Brighton I could point to scores and hundreds of homes belonging to people who derive practically all their income from the land. There is not an honourable member who does not know that one of the causes of th© increase' of population in the cities during the last few years has been the fact that to a large extent the old squatting life has passed away, and those people who used to live upon their homesteads, with their familiesabout them, are today to be found in every fashionable suburb of the great cities to which the honourable member referred.",38
140,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Does the Minister say that that fact accounts for the in crease of the population about the cities ?,38
141,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It is one of the causes, and honourable members themselves are not while ago we heard the honourable mem terrible conditions of the man upon the laud. Why is it that his home is in one of the fashionable suburbs of Perth? And why do we find the mansion home of the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) in Toorak? I could mention similar facts regarding other honor' able members. No sooner did the Leader of ths Country party (Dr Earle Page) enter this Parliament than his name-plate - was placed with those of many other doctors in Macquarie-street, Honourable members talk about the drift to the cities, but they know that these thingsi of which I am speaking are perfectly true. When they compare the - rural population today with that of a few years ago, and when they talk about the decline of agriculture, I suggest to them that they should analyze the figures, and try to arrive at the real causes. I wonder if they have ever given any attention to mining?",38
142,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Unfortunately , have. »",39

I am dealing with the widely-scattered metalliferous mining undertakings throughout Australia. upon those 47,869 workers as having families each numbering three-whic h is a conservative estimate-and taking into consideration also those who minister to the needs of those miners' families, together with their own families, estimated to number, in all, 67,000, one arrives at a total diminution of 258,476 persons, or 5 per cent, of the population of Australia. What would have been the position if mining had held its own, or, indeed, if there had been an increase in the number of workers engaged? would have been the balance compared with those engaged in rural industries? Sydney. the people engaged in that rural industry. It is a rural industry; the shafts and poppet-heads of the great mines are not to be found about the cities, but are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth The Commonwealth Statistician, informs me that during the decade from the financial year 1910-11 to 1920-21, which provides the latest figures available, there has been a reduction in the number of workers in gold mining amounting to 1 32,S12.

145,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Most of those miners-at any rate, those engaged in Victoria-were living in cities such as Ballarat and Bendigo. They have not come to Melbourne. Now, looking Mr MASSYGREENE - They have either drifted to the capital cities or they are on the land. I am dealing with the populations of the chief cities as against the numbers in the country.",39
146,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"A good deal of that mining population was essentially urban. The workers would be largely concentrated at such places as Ballarat, Bendigo, and Broken Hill. .",39
147,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I repeat that I am taking, for the purposes of my statistical comparisons, {he chief cities as against What the country at large; and I wish to emphasize that there are certain facts which honourable members of the Country party have either lost sight of, or have deliberately covered up.",39

Whatever may be said concerning the decrease in agriculture> both with respect to quantity und area cultivated, I emphasize that honourable members of the Country party are in this matter entirely and absolutely in the wrong.",40
150,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Why did the Minister select the decade from 1910-11 to 1920-21?,40

169,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,They can grow side by side.,42
170,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes ; but the final development to which we are stretching forward-the real progress and prosperity of Australia-mus t depend upon the advance prosperity of its yeomanry. It is the small man, the farmer, the dairyman, the small grazier, the fruit-grower, and their kind, upon wEom ultimately Australia must rest for her great production from industry, and it is only by the encouragement of, not the large, but the small man, that we can secure that close rural population which Australia requires and desires. As long as there are great pastoral areas, as longas land fit for is held in pastoral areas, and the facilities for opening up such country aud putting small men upon it are withheld, we can never have a big rural population . It is by means only of the industries to which I have been referring that we can hope to secure that result. Dairy Produce (Butter, Cheese, plied to cities, i.e., milk not consumed in factories) Agricultural Products (Wheat, Barley, Oats, Hay, Potatoes, Onions, and Sugar) Fruit (Fresh-Orchard s and Fruit Gardens; Dried-Raisin s and Currants) Here we have the story in its most crete form. In 1910 the value of the prohave ducts of these three industries in tralia was £4.5,532,673. That was the total reward which this great body primary producers received in that year. Por the year 1920-21, however, their flood, total reward was no> less £145,349,829, showing an increase of £99,817,176, or approximately 225 per oent., in t l w actual reward which the primary producers over that great field production secured.  man knows that that is not a fair basis.",42
171,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is the storv I have to tell, and it is a true one. The honourable member knows that it is in almost every respect a true reflex of the state of primary production in Australia. I am not going to say that the life cf the man on the land is an easy one. I is a hard one. Unless a man has a natural bent for life on the land he had better desire to criticise the Ministry. not go in for it . Unless he delights improving natural conditions conquering them, unless he has the being peculiar characteristics, which, prima facie, fit him for tihe laud, he had much better leave the land alone. I say, however, with all confidence, that the man who goes on the land to-dav, provided that he has the facilities for getting his products to market, and prosuitable vided also that he knows how to use the land, and is prepared to work hard, make a competence, aye, and more than competence, in this great country of ours. I do not believe that the picture which I propose now to group together these three industries, in so far as the values of their production between 1910-11 and. 1920-21 are concerned.

172,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 8.15 p.m.,43
173,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Wide B a y ) [8.15] Every honourable member should be gratef u l to the Minister for Defence (Mr . Greene) for his able account of many matters adversely criticised in this House. t I think that our friends of the Country party are sometimes carried away by their When in I sat in the State House in Queensland, and .1. took up for a long while the position of a Country party member with in the ranks of the Liberal party, and I am perfectly satisfied that those associated with me in that Parliament were able to do a great deal to assist in the development of the large areas of land in Queensland for settlement. There is now a Country party in that State, and I agree can with most of their aims, but they are a merely following the footsteps of those with whom I was associated in the Liberal party in the State House, with this exception, perhaps, that they are sectional in their attitude. I do not find fault with them on broad lines, because they are no doubt endeavouring to do their best to assist in the development of their State, which contains as much as 421,000,000 acres of land. Our friends in the corner say that no arrangement has been made to assist the primary producers, of whom they claim to be the representatives; but no one in this House has ever attacked the primary productions of Queensland as the so-called primary producers' representatives have done on occasions.",43
174,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Why was not honourable member at the meeting in the Assembly Hall on Monday night last?,44
175,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"No one has been a more bitter opponent in this House of the sugar industry 'than has the honourable - member for Franklin, as reference to Hansard will prove. In regard to the question of growing produce by white, instead of black, labour, those of us who advocated the interests of the white growers of bananas in Queensland and New South Wales were opposed by some of our friends of the primary producers or of the Country party, several of whom also opposed the white production of maize, while others voted against the attempt to give protection to another primary production of Queensland, namely, timber. I cannot understand honourable members professing to be representatives of the primary producers' interests voting against them when the producers concerned were not resident in their own States. Even if honourable members are in disagreement with me, I could give them credit for sincerity if they were only consistent, but I certainly cannot congratulate the members of the Country party in this House upon having displayed much sincerity in the post for the primary producers of the Commonwealth and their in1«rests. Very few men would have undertaken the arduous trip the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) has recently had at the request of the representatives of the primary producers of Queensland in this House that he should see the great sugar industry for himself. We asked him for no pledges. We simply asked him to lay before his Cabinet what he saw and heard and then come down to this House with his policy. Our attitude was quite fair and only in accordance with the fairness the producers of the northern States have always shown. When Federation was first inaugurated they received pledges from all sections of the Commonwealth Parliament to the effect that if they would do away with coloured labour and adopt the White Australia policy they would he safeguarded to the extent of the difference between the cost of sugar produced' all over the world by black labour and the extra cost of production by white labour in Australia. We are the only people in the the world who are producing cane sugar by white labour. But what sympathy have we had ? The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), who was formerly leader of the so-called Producers party, was the bitterest opponent of sugar-growing in Queensland. He wanted the Government to respect the agreement to give Tasmania about £90,000 per annum; but he was opposed to the fulfilment of the agreement to impose protective duties sumcient to enable the sugar-growers of Queensland to carry on their industry. Speaking as a busiuess man of fifty years' standing, I think that we ought to congratulate ourselves on the fact that we have an able Treasurer in the person of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), and I cannot understand why the Country party and press in Victoria should criticise him so adversely for things for which he has been in no way responsible. ",44
176,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Not the man who has to carry out duties imposed upon him, and has no say in regard to them. The responsibility rests upon the whole of this Parliament, which authorized the expenditure the Treasurer has had to incurthrough the various Departments. He was handed his Budget after it had been in existence for months, and had to carry it out in accordance with what had been arranged by his predecessor (Sir Joseph Cook). No one seems to give him credit for the work he has done, nor can any one say that the extra unanticipated expenditure of at least £1,166,950, which I shall itemize, could have been interfered with in the slightest degree. There was, for instance, the expenditure of £32,500 upon the settlement of the South African claim for 1 flour. This was an unavoidable payment that had not been put forward when the Budget was delivered. The item of £14,500, Australia's contribution to the cost of the League of Nations, was a liability no one knew about when the Budget was prepared. A sum of £5,500 represents the excess cost of the Taxation Commission, which was authorized by this House. Do honourable members criticise the payment of the £8,500 which represented the expenses of the delegation to Washington? Can they say that this expenditure should not have been undertaken? Belated payments to New""South Wales for distress occasioned by the maritime strike accounted for £4,450, which the Treasurer .could not refuse to honour. Nor could he do otherwise than spend the £49,000 authorized by this Parliament to relieve distress in ""Europe. A sum of £12,000 was spent in the maintenance of persons in charitable - institutions. honourable members claim that we have no right to meet that obligation? There was a clamour for more and more assistance to the needy, and yet the Treasurer has been adversely criticised for carrying out an obligation of that kind. Neither could he avoid paying the £26,000 increased cost of coinage. A sum of £96,000 was paid for the investigation and purchase of the British Government's interests in the New Guinea oil explorations. The House authorized that expenditure, and it had to be met. There were items, however, which did not appear on the Estimates as passed by-the House, but were nevertheless obligations the Treasurer had to meet. For instance, the increased cost of the Health Department was £35,500; but honourable members are aware that in the latter part of the financial year, when bubonic plague was prevalent, very stringent precautious had to be taken to keep it out of Victoria. Does the Victorian press complain of that particular expenditure? Again, the anticipated expenditure on the payment of invalid and old-age pensions and the maternity allowance was exceeded by £100,000. This was another obligation that had to be met. Is the Treasurer to be held responsible because he fulfilled it ? The next item on my list is a sum of £25,000, which was advanced to returned soldiers for their woollen mills at Geelong. That was a matter authorized by Parliament at the tail end of last session, and the money had to be found by the Treasurer. Another increase in expenditure that had to be met was £378,000 for war pensions. The last item on my list is a sum of £380,000, representing the extra cost of the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. We have long agitated to secure a better set of conditions for the people outback, so that we may offer greater inducements to the immigrants whom we hope to bring from the Mother Country. The greatest encouragement we can give to immigration will be to make it possible for those who settle in the back-blocks to enjoy something like reasonable comfort and opportunities for intercourse with their fellows. The items I have mentioned total £1,166,950. I like to give credit where credit is due, and I resent the attitude of the Victorian press and some members who ought to' know better than Do toi slander a man on account .of a state of affairs for which he cannot rightly be held responsible. In regard to the injustice of which I am about to speak, I do not hold the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers) responsible, because the Tariff was disposed of before he took control of the Trade and Customs Department. On my arrival in Melbourne from Queensland, I discovered to my surprise that black-grown maize was being imported from South Africa at the low duty of Is. per central. On 19th May, 1921, when the Tariff was before us, I proposed (Hansard, page 8547) that the duty on maize should be, British preferential, 3s.; and intermediate and general, 3s. 6d.; or about 9d. per central more than was proposed by the Minister, and I explained that my reason for proposing the increase was the large production of maize in South Africa and India by black labour, and that South Africa was receiving most Favorable preferential treatment. The then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) informed the Committee that when the Tariff was passed the preference would be withdrawn. We therefore imposed a high protective' duty on the by-products of maize, in the belief that, through the protection of maize, the Australian grower would secure the local market. For instance, we imposed a duty of £12 per ton on glucose, but this duty has proved to bo not for the benefit of the white Australian grower, but for the benefit of people in South Africa who produce maize by black labour. then Minister said (Hansard, page 8551) that the duty he proposed was 100 per cent, liigher than that on the product of South Africa, from whidli country greater part of the imported maize came. The duty on maize in the South preferential Tariff was Is. per central; but the Tariff schedule proposed that the duty should be 2s., and there the proposed to leave it. In answer to my question as to whether that would mean that South Africa would have to pay the same protective duty as any other country in the world the Minister "" Yes."" On Sth July, 1921 (Hansard, page 9875), the Minister and Sir Joseph Cook were ordered to prepare and bring in a Bill tc carry out the resolutions of the Committee. The Tariff Bill was at once introduced aud passed through all stages. When it was before the Senate, Guthrie moved on 4th August, 1921 (Hansard, page 10755), tlhat the House of Representatives be requested to make the duties on maize, 2s. 6d.: and general, 3s. Gd., per central. That proposal was somewhat on the lines of the amendment which I had submitted in this House. Senator Guthrie pointed out that the annual production of maize in Australia averaged between and 9,000,000 bushels, and that grown by black labour in India, was 80,000,000 bushels, and that in South Africa 34,000,000 bushels. Senator Russell, who was in charge of the Tariff at that time, said that the real trouble of the maize-growers was caused by the reciprocal Tariff arrangements with South Africa under which maize could be imported at Is. per central; maize was grown by black labour. are not going to repeat our mistake,"" he said. "" Under the present Tariff all imported maize will have to pay 2s. per central."" The Senate agreed to Senator Guthrie's request that the duty should be 2s. 6d., and the general duty 3s. 6d. When the Senate's requests were before this Chamber, the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) moved, on 13th October, that the Senate's requested amendment be made. motion was agreed to (Hansard, 11969). Thus both Houses had agreed to impose the duty proposed by .Vr. Corser. 1 Guthrie. On pages 11939-11940 the M i nister for Trade and Customs moved that the request of the Senate for the repeal The of the South African Preference Tariff be agreed to, and said that the reciprocal Tariff with South Africa, would terminate with the assent to the Tariff Bill . The the Senate's requested amendment was made, and on 8th December, at page 14166 of African 'Hansard, Mv. Speaker reported the receipt of a message fro m the Governor General assenting to the Tariff Bill . When Government the Minister moved that the Senate's requested amendment be agreed to he did not explain to the House, nor was an explanation given in the Senate when the Bill was before that Chamber, that the answered eifect would be to enable South African maize to reach Australia at less than the Tariff rate of 3s. 6d. per central. The subsequent discovery that maize could be i m ported' at Is. per central was a great surprise to me. I think this explanation is due to myself, for there are in my elecSenator torate probably tens of thousands of acres which are producing maize, and in the course of my travels I have explained to the maize-growers what Parliament intermediate, had done to protect them against the black-grown maize of other countries. I have not been able to learn of any honourable member in this Chamber or the Senate outside the Cabinet who understood that at the eleventh hour of 8,000,000 the session this Parliament enacted legislation that repealed what we had decided, about in connection with the Tariff. I ask that this matter be taken into very serious consideration by the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers). I am sure that had it been known that the dnties we imposed upon glucose, cornflour, starch, and other by-products of maize would be enjoyed by the producers that of black-grown maize in other parts of "" We the world instead of by our own growers, we would never have agreed to them; and had we known that the Reciprocity Bill would have had that effect we would have insisted upon a further consideration intermediate of the items affected. The South African Department of Agriculture in Pretoria estimates the maize crop for the year at 12,000,000 bags, and that there will be a surplus of 2,250,000 available for export. Already some of that maize has been i m That ported into Victoria, and I understand page that shipments are on their way to Queensland and New South Wales, notSenator withstanding that most people believe that th© protective duty of 3s. 6d. per central passed by this House still applies. The local producer of maize has no protection i u regard to freights. The freight on shipments now coming from Durban fco Australia is 22s. 6d. per ton weight, whilst from the port of Maryborough, Queensland, which is only about 190 miles north of Brisbane, to Melbourne it is 40s. per ton on minimum shipments of 1,000 tons. I ask that some alteration in the law be made so that justice may be done to the white maize-growers in Australia. I introduced a deputation to the Minister last week, and it was supported by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Wise), the honourable member for Lilley (Mr . Mackay), the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford), the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), and Mr . Murphy, of Gippsland. The Minister promised to bring the matter under notice of Cabinet, and for that reason I refrained fro m speaking of it in the House earlier. I suggest that the Minister should take such steps as will carry out the intention of Parliament when it enacted the Tariff. W it h respect to War Service Homes, some arrangements should be made by which returned men could be provided with homes of their own without such delay as is general in every State. I recently gave the responsible Minister particulars of a certain case which had come under my notice in Queensland. The ex-soldier concerned had a property under offer for £ 2 8 0. He owned an acre block in the town, where he was permanently employed in a, butter factory, and he was prepared to hand over his gratuity bond, valued at £ 8 0 , together with £ 2 0 in cash, and to remove the house to his own allotment. There would remain a liability of only '£180, which he would be required to find, and he desired the Department to advance to him. However, he was through me informed by the Chairman of the War Service Adjustment Board, Brisbane, that he was not likely to get any advance u n t i l some time in 1923. To provide a new home for that returned soldier would cost the country between £ 8 0 0 and £ 9 0 0 ; he cannot get any satisfaction in respect of his proposition in volving a departmental advance of only £180. Another matter upon which I desire to touch has to do with the necessity for encouraging cotton production in Australia. Last year there were 12,000 acres under cotton in Queensland; by the end of the present year the area will be, I understand, about 40,000 acres. H u n dreds of thousands of acres could easily be planted in Queensland alone. There are, in fact, millions of acres of the right kind of land available. During the American Civil War cotton was produced in Queensland, and a number of shipments were sent away consisting of tallow for ballast and cotton as cargo. The cotton was pronounced to be as good as any sample produced in any part of the world. A f t e r the Civil War, however, cheap coloured labour in America killed the Australian industry. But it was proved that the land was there, and that a good quality of cotton could be grown in Australia. We still have the land, and cotton every b it as good oan still be grown on it . Labour costs have provided the sole hindrance, # but today the position has changed. The American labour situation is vastly different. The cost of picking cotton in the United States of America is as. high as in Queensland. Many of the negroes are now in a position to own their own blocks, and they insist on being paid white men's wages, or they will work their own land. Here is Australia's opportunity. The cotton plant grows with wonderful rapidity. Less than twelve months ago I planted a cotton seed in my own vegetable garden. In ten months I had a bush, 4 feet high and 3 feet in breadth, covered with cotton of the best quality. There had not been the slightest cultivation of the soil in which it grew. Indeed, rich soil, such as is needed for the production of sugar cane, or maize, or the like, is not required. The most suitable soil is what is known in Queensland as forest land, and there are millions of acres of it near to the ports, available for the purpose. When I was in the State Parliament, eleven or twelve years ago, I in quired how much land there was in Queensland that had not been utilized, and from which the Government got no return. I was officially informed that there were 137,000,000 acres. The reason for such a state of affairs was chiefly lack of railway communication. There will be no difficulty in making available all the land that is likely to be wanted for cotton growing, and at a very reasonable price. It is an important fact, in the light of the possibilities of cotton growth in Australia, that a heavy rainfall is not required. The Prime Minister has been criticised. for not having assisted the North torate, Burnett lancl scheme. The reason signed for the deadlock has been that Labour Government is in control in Queensland. I have known Queensland intimately from my youth. I am in a position to give the reason why nothing has been done with the North Burnett laud. There has been a deadlock because there have been three rival railway jects. Ou the one 'hand it has been posed to extend the railway over moundoing tainous country. The cost of the line would be about fl,000,000, and it would invol ve two years in building. Meanwhile, there would be no settlement on the lancl to be served. On the other hand, expenditure of £750,000 to £1,000,000, a direct line could be laid through .good agricxdfcural country where there would no Biountaius to impose engineering, diffiformed.'] culties' and unwarranted costs. The whole question .is' whether a line shall be structed for political purposes, or in best interests of the people and the State as a whole. I regret that some honourable members have been advocating a reduction in rates of letter postage. The question cheaper postage came before the Conable ference of Chambers of Commerce some months ago, in Hobart; but such strenuous objections were raised that the proposal ment. was dropped. ""What Australia wants is not cheaper postage, which would be of greatest value to people of the residents are already well catered for in respect of every service administered the Postmaster-General's Department. What is more urgently required is the cent, extension of facilities throughout country. It is all"" very well for honourable members of the Country parly to say that people are leaving the land. That is not so.",44
177,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Censu s figures indicate that they are.,48
178,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If so,, they have cerducers tainly left others there. It. isresults that was very sorry, indeed, to hear the obtell, ancl! I can only say that sincejection assistance has been given to the primary producers the total value of produce sold under Federal control has £484,000,000, of which butter and cheese aloue, from 1917 to 30th March, 1921, in shipments to the Imperial Government, represent £19,763,987. In my own elecwhich is larger than the whole of aslittle Tasmania, the co-operative coma panies have proved most successful. The original parent company has been extended, and there are now about five cheese factories. I may say that I have devoted both money and time to the promotion and support of these co-operative enterprises, and still hold shares in them. proThere are many hundreds of second and prothird sons of Victorian farmers there splendidly in the production of maize and other cereals, also in dairying. There is no doubt that the Commonwealth Government saved Australia from bankruptcy, securing, as it did, an average of 5s. per bushel for wheat as against the for an pre-war price of 3s. 9d'. Mr CoNsroiNiE - I beg. to call attention he to the starte of the House.. [Qu-orum",48
179,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Government conmade all arrangements about freight, and the in somo cases obtained the money before a good deal of the produce' was shipped. The High Prices Commission of Victoria . .proved that, as a result of the Wheat Pool, the growers had made a total gain of of £10,241,500 from 1916 to 1919 over and above the London parity, and the honormember for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , the. president of the Victorian Farmers Union, concurred in the Pool arrange",48
180,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I do not agree with that city. City s la temen t, anyhow'",48
181,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It is on record. As to by wool, the report of the Commission says that the price received was about 55 per liigher than that obtained beforo tin? the war. Somebody, nmst be credited with this, and it may he supposed that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), while at Home, aud in Australia with his Cabinet, arranged' the terms on which wheat ancl wool were sold overseas, and the wholebusiness carried on without any fear of bankruptcy or any necessity for the pro\o realise on their properties. I c raised by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt) to the arrangement made with the cattle-growers, been for a bounty of £d. per lb. on meat to be exported, who certainly regard it as a great blessing. Of course, to men with, small holdings the price of cattle today means life or death. The men in affluent circumstances who sold largely before the drop in prices came are in a different position; there is a chance for them to buy from those to whom they originally sold. Personally, I 3peak for the small cattle-owner, who approves of anything that will give him a chance of getting his fat stock off his small ru n so that the ground may be ready for the calves. To retain such men on the land is to retain an asset which otherwise might be destroyed. I tell the honourable member for Moreton that cattle will keep f at only for a certain time, and will certainly lose their f at in >the winter, when the cost of fattening becomes an asset lost. If , however, a man can realise when the cattle are fat, room is lef t for the calves to follow. x I notice that the subject of wireless communication is mentioned in the Governor General's Speech. Criticism has been levelled at the Government for having entered into an agreement authorized by this House, providing that the Royal Commission reported in favour of it . Apparently, there are honourable members who regard the business investors in this enterprise as fools, but I have a list of the shareholders which discloses that amongst them are the smartest business men in Australia. If it is good for such men to hold shares in this company, it is certainly good for the Commonwealth Government to have control, and in the conduct of the business the Government have a majority of one as a casting vote. Many people consider that the Government, should appoint some one out of the Public Service to manage this business, holding that otherwise we have no cont r o l ; but it would be foolish for the Federal Government to attempt to do such a thing. We must have the best brains in this scheme if it is to succeed, and men for a business of this kind are not to be found in the Public Service, so that the Government had to go .outside. MT . PRATTEN - The publication of ilist of 'private shareholders may help - the Government scheme. Mr COKSEB, - T believe it will. Many of those men have large interests in the Commonwealth, and they do not desire the Government to lose money. Some honourable members, principally, I believe, from our friends of the Corner party, contend that no good has resulted from the protection given our secondary industries. However, we have only to look at a return issued by the Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, Melbourne, where it is pointed out that the number of industrial companies registered in 1920 was no less than 2,082. The nominal capital of the new companies was £148,270,614, and the increase of the nominal capital of existing companies, £36,937,302, the total nominal capital registered being £185,207,917. These secondary industries must mean employment for large numbers of people, who have to buy the products of the primary producers. How could these people be replaced ? If there were any trouble-overseas, where would our market be? It is no use shutting our eyes to the facts. We are told that people must be settled in this country, which could easily support 200,000,000. Australia is larger than the United States, and, considering the area from the north of Queensland to the south of Tasmania, is capable of a greater variety of products. There is .no doubt that we shall not be allowed to hold this territory if we do not populate it . Where is the justice of 5,000,000 ' people monopolizing a country when there are other countries which cannot find room for their surplus populations ? Since I was president of the Federal League in 1S99, no man has been a stronger advocate of a White Australia; aud from that time. I have f a it h full y done all within my power to support the policy. I see no reason to depart from it ; but it certainly is the duty of the Government to see that our products are protected against the products of the coloured races of the world. There i.s just one other matter about which I should like to say a few words. As to the sugar industry, I shall probably deal witli that at length when the question of the renewal of the agreement is before U3. In the report of the Royal Commission on the Sxigar Industry which was pmblished in 1950, it is set out that t'he the capital ""ratee of improved cane fanna at that time was £5,-541,496*; that thevalue of raw 'sugar - mills in Queensland was £4,500,0©9; and that 14,500 persons were* employed in cultivating sugar cane. There are at least 100,000 people directly and indirectly interested in the sugar industry in the northern State, and at least 4,000 of those engaged in cane-cutting come from States south of Queensland. Prom time to time we hear statements to the effect that either the Federal Government or the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are making huge profits as a result of the sugar agreement. I would remind the House, however, that that agreement was made between the Queensland Government,, the cane-grower, the crude cane sugar manufacturers, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. All parties met, and in entering into the agreement saw to it that no one section should receive an advantage over the others. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company was called upon to lay all its cards on the table, and it agreed to undertake the manufacture, refining, storage, aud handling of the sugar, together with all the risks of sales, at absolutely cost price. It was agreed, further, that the company should allow the Auditor-General's officers to examine its books whenever they pleased, in order to ascertain what the actual cost price was, and that it should receive f l per ton over and above the actual cost price for refining, selling, guaranteeing, financing, insuring, delivering, and taking all risks in connection with the scheme.",48
182,Mr NICHOLLS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,An additional f l per ton?,50
183,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It was agreed that the company should receive f l in excess of its actual out-of-pocket expenses. The company secures no other return. If I viere to consider my own interests and tliose of other merchants I should say, "" Put an end to any interference with the ordinary course of trade and lot us return to what we were doing in respect of the sale of sugar before the Government stepped in."" In the interests of the consumers and producers alike I hold, however, that the present system should be continued. Under the old arrangement we had perhaps twenty or twenty-five firms-my own amongst the number-sell ing sugar to South Australia, Tasmania, and elsewhere and charging 5 per eent. on 'sales and guarantees. It would be impossible to get any firm to do this for less at the present time. I invite honourable members to seriously consider whether it would be better for us to .pay 5 per cent, to twenty or tAventy-five agents throughout Australia rather than to continue the payment to one company of f l per ton for this work. If the sales of this product were carried on as before larger commissions would have to be paid, and either the consumer would have to pay a higher price to meet the extra cost or the grower would have to take less for his product. I am out to see that neither the consumer nor the grower suffers. In their interests I favour the handling of our sugar in the cheapest possible way, and that is what is now being done. ""We are anxious, as we always have been, that other industries, in whose manufactures sugar is used, tehall not suffer. I can safely assert that during the war the arrangement made by the Government enabled the fruit-growers and manufacturers, of jams and preserves in Australia to do an enormous export trade which otherwise would have been impossible. But for the sugar industry in Queensland and the selling of its product, not at the world's parity, which was then £100 per ton, but at f30 6s. Sd. per ton, this export trade could not have been carried on. The sugar-growers of Queenslaud at that time did not clamour for world's parity. They did not say that they were out to get all they could. They asked simply for n. fair deal, and the reasonable stand taken by them enabled manufacturers of jams and preserves in Australia to carry on an export trade against all competitors, and to make huge profits which otherwise would have been impossible to them. When we were selling sugar in Australia at 6d. per lb., the prico in Great Britain was Is. 6d. per lb., and in the United States of America Is. 5d. per lb. Not only did we give the local manufacturers this enormous advantage over their competitors abroad, but we allowed them a rebate of £20 per ton in respect of sugar used in the manufacture of jam for export. Because the sugar produced in Australia was insufficient to meet local requirements, supplies had to be obtained from abroad, and for these imports we had to pay about £100 per ton. Sugar for which that price had been paid could not be sold for 6d. a lb. without great loss, and the Government, by means of the low-priced sugar that they are obtaining from Queensland, are now gradually wiping out the loss sustained on the importations of black-grown sugar from Java.",50
184,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Does not the honourable member think we should have from the Minister himself a statement of the actual position.,51
185,Mr COESEE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am not going to dictate to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Eodgers). He has told us that he will submit to the House within the next day or two a full statement of the position, and I am sure that he will do so. I would remind honourable members that, having regard to the magnitude of the industry, it is impossible for the Minister to obtain at a day's notice all the information required by the House. As an answer to those who suggest that an undue preference was given to the Colonial Sugar Eefiniug Company under the agreement made, I would point out that the company's only other competitor, the Millaquin factory, which is i u my electorate, is by no means satisfied with the price it receives, although it is cess of that paid to the Colonial Sugar Befining Company. As a matter of fact, it recently turned down an opportunity to refine, at the price fixed, 3,000 tons of sugar which I had obtained from the north.",51
186,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What is the area under cane in Queensland ?,51
187,Mr COESEE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The area now under cane is 43,000 acres in excess of the area so cultivated last year. What we need to do is to stabilize the industry. If the growers receive au assurance that the agreement will continue, and that they will continue to receive something about the present price, which is only a fair one, they will undertake to produce sumcient to meet Australia's requirements. In Queensland t here are ten a of thousands of acres of land that are as quite suitable for growing as is any of the land now devoted to that purpose. The industry, however, has met with reverses. For instance, after the Dickson award was brought in many men went out of the industry finding that it was impossible to carry on and pay the rates of wages so fixed. At Innisfail, for instance, a large number of sugar farmers sold out to Italians, who have since been working their farms on co-operative lines. Only last month 200 Italians arrived there to engage in the industry. These men believe in co-operation. They are not paid per day for their labour, and I am convinced that the sooner our fanners cooperate the better will be their returns. Above all things, it is necessary that we sliould stabilize the industry, so that those who put their money into it will know that they will obtain a failreturn for their labour. As the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) said last week, only about 2\ per cent, of the sugar-cane growers of Queensland pay income tax. They are not wealthy men. On the contrary, they are struggling to make a living, clearing their land, fertilizing and working it as best they can, and looking to the future for a reward.",51
188,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yarra) [9.27] - I wish to draw the attention of the House to still another proposal on the part of the Government to take a serious action without first consulting Parliament. Statements made by the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) during .the last two or three in exweeks, and a definite statement made by him two days ago, and published in the press,"" show that the Government intend to take a very serious step-on e that. I think is only the beginning of further grave action in the same direction-with out giving this House an opportunity to express an opinion with respect to it . I propose, however, to give honourable members an opportunity to test the matter. The statement to which I refer as having been made by the Minister for Defence is as follows: The Ministry had made up its mind that it would not use the mills at Geelong for competition against private trade, and, therefore, sale was the best alternative. Parliament sanctioned the establishment of the Commonwealth Mills at Geelong. In 1910, when the Fisher Labour Gocane- vernment was in"" power, provision was made on the Estimates for the establishment of the woollen mills at Geelong, the Commonwealth Harness Factory, the Commonwealth Clothing Pactory, and other industrial enterprises. I am convinced that there is not an honourable member in this House-no t an intelligent member of the community-wh o will not freely admit that durinsr the war these factories served the country well, and stood by our soldiers in their trying time in the trenches. Parliament was consulted as to their establishment, and if , following the traditions of this One-Man Government, a Government without any responsibility to Parliament, all these terprises are to be thrown aside-becaus e this, I believe, is but the beginning of a general policy of shutting down Commonwealth factories-it is time that Parliament intervened. Honourable members will have an opportunity to record their opinions with respect to this matter. I want specially to direct my attention to the Country party, members of which have had much to say in recent years about "" Flinders-lane "" and the profits it rakes off the primary products of this country. They will have an opportunity to cast a vote on this question, and we shall take more notice of their votes than of the speeches which they deliver in this House. In 1910, as I have said, provision was made on the Estimates for the establishment of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong. Operations were commenced in 1911, and the mills started to manufacture cloth in 1915. At the present time about 350 persons are employed there. It cannot be said that the Government are abolishing or proposing to sell the mills because they are not making a profit, or because they are inefficiently managed. The mills are efficiently managed. The manager and the whole staff of the mills are absolutely the best one could get in this country. I have not ibeen able to get recent official reports, and I do not know why the Government have held them back so long, but by inquiries in many ways I have been able to get an estimate of the profits made by the mill. They have been more than sufficient to wipe out the capital cost of the establishment. I have been informed that it will show a surplus of approximately £250,000. Yet with a burden of debt on the country the Government propose to sell mills that are paying not only interest on the money invested in them, but also an accumulated profit of £250,000.",51
189,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is not' so. Mr SCLTLLIN"" - Ver y well, the Minister will have the opportunity of giving the total profits. If we had a Government working in the interests of the community - I know it is not, and that it is the worse Government Australia has ever had - it would not be talking about selling Geelong Woollen Mills, but would be making provision to increase their capacity, and taking steps to establish other mills throughout the country districts, for en- instance, at Bendigo, Ballarat, Warrnambool, and other centres. In that way the Government could carry out an extensive decentralization policy, and at the same time accumulate profits that would help to reduce the taxation about which honourable members in the Country party talk so much. Australia is not manufacturing more than .15 per cent, of its woollen requirements, although its manufacturers have at their command, locally produced, the best wool in the world. ""Seeing that Australia imports five-sixths of its woollen goods, and that there is a vast field for the expansion of the woollen industry, opening up markets for our primary producers, and providing employment, not only for our own unemployed, but also for people of our kith and kin overseas, the Government should be laying down the foundation of a splendid manufacturing industry, instead of proposing to sell the only woollen mills they possess. This is but the beginning of one of the worse jobs the Ministry have ever undertaken. The honor told us that we should go in for a policy of extension of markets. I have indicated one way in which we can do this, and I shall be interested to see how the honourable member's vote will go on this question. We are told by the supporters of the Government, and by the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) that there will be no trouble in selling the Geelong Woollen Mills. I should say there would not be. I do not mind prophesying that already buyers are in sight. I would not be surprised to learn that the Government know exactly where to put their fingers on the people who are going to buy the mills. Interwoven with this question are all the interests of those who are the masters of the Government. We are told by Senator Guthrie, one of the Government's supporters, that it will be a splendid advantage to Geelong to have the mills sold, and that a company will come along, of which, if it be possible, he will be a shareholder, to extend the mills and carry them on. If a company is so eager to undertake the manufacturing of woollen cloth in Australia, why does it the not get its own machinery and establish its own mills at Geelong, employing more labour there and proI ducing more manufactured woollen goods in Australia? ""What is the significance of the statement that a company is eager anxious not to hurt. to buy these inills? We are not told the price at which they are to be offered. information is given as to the sweet pick1918, ings some one is about to get; because it is not one of those cases in which can be a lot of competition. There not too many supporters of this side of the House who can submit tenders f o this plant. Competition will be left to a few of those who have a good deal of net this world's goods; they will get together and put in a tender. At this stage I want to call attention to a remarkable somerthree sault on the part of the Government, and to investigate the reason for it . On 12th May, 1920, the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville E y r i e ) , in answer profits to a question in this House, saidThe Government have approved of additions to existing plant and machinery, to enable the preBent output of the Geelong mills to bo particularlydoubled. On the Estimates placed before Parliament last session, a sum of £45,000 was provided for the purpose of duplicating the plant at the Geelong Woollen Mills. What change has come over the scene since this time last year? What influyond ences have been at work?",52
190,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,There is,53
191,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There is probably some significance in that fact. refer honourable members to something which may suggest the change of poliey on the part of the Government. In trade supplement of the London Times, profits. which appeared about the time Lord report Northcliffe visited Australia, and picked not sell direct to the retailers. up a lot of information honourable memgoods bers did not get, appeared the followinfluence of Flinders-lane that ing:An organization of Australian business terests, the Private Industries League, been formed in Melbourne, the express aims' which are (1) to combat State Socialism' competitive trade and commerce, (2) to give fits private enterprise the control necessary foi; method, adopted by the mills. the construction of railways and other enterprises to develop and commercialize sources of Australia. The right of the Governwho ment to function as tradesman or merchant is filter to be assailed. We are told by the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) that the Government w not compete with existing private mills. wish to direct the attention of honourable members to the class of people whose tender feelings the Government are so The Inter-State Commission's report on clothing was preNo sented to this House on 13th December, shortly after the war closed; but the investigation of the Commission had there been made during the war period. In are one part of their report the Commissioners set out a table showing that the r total capital employed in the woollen mills in 1914 was £1,144,385, and that the profits for the three years, 1915, 1916, and 1917, amounted to £1,197,095. It will be observed that the profit for the years exceeded the total value of the capital invested, and the Commissioners' comment upon this fact wasThe greater proportion of their excessive were derived during the period in which they were engaged in supplying material for 1 the clothing of our soldiers', I want honourable members to notice this and when they vvere acting in unison. How nicely they put it . The report states that the profit earned in 1916 was 39.452 per cent., and the Commissioners sayThe foregoing figures need no comment be the somewhat obvious fact that they refer to a period of grave national changer and a new emergency. These are the sharks who during the war profiteered at the expense of this comI shall munity, and with whom the Government say they will not compete, and for whom they show such tender regard that they a will do nothing to interfere with their The Inter-State Commission's also indicates that these people will Their go: to Flinders-lane, and it is the has prompted the sale of the Geelong Woollen inMills. A question was asked in the press has the other day as to how Flinders-lane of could benefit by the sale, of these mills. in I shall proceed, toshow how it will beneFirst of all let us. examine the They the rerefuse to sell direct to the people 1 retail goods. Everything must through Flinders-lane No matter what parcels the retailers may be prepared to purchase, the mills will ill have nothing to do with them, and the retailers are obliged to buy from the wholesale people-thos e people who throw out their chests and talk about private enterprise, the wonderful efficiency of their system, and the wonderful blundering of public enterprise. For many years I lived in Ballarat, where there! are woollen mills. These mills place their output on lorries and send it to tihe Ballarat West railway station, where it is railed 75 miles to Melbourne, and thence conveyed to the warehouses in Flinders-lane. Immediately a parcel of clothing arrives in a warehouse, its travellers board a train at Spencer-street, journey 75 miles to Ballarat, and go up and down Sturtstreet selling to the retailers and tailors the very goods which have been turned out in the mills scarcely half-a-mile away. That is what these people term their eificient system, and from which tihey absolutely refuse to depart. The one thing that Flinders-lane will not stand for is the selling of the output of woollen mills direct to retailers, and that is the "" milk in the coconut"" in this very question of the sale of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong. The Inter-State Commission, reporting upon the profits of the wholesale warehouses during the war, says:The total amount of profits of the soft goods houses in 1U.17 in the aggregate were more than double those of 1911. It mentions that the profits in 1914 represented "" satisfactory returns."" during the war period satisfactory returns were doubled by patriots who waved the flag and sooled their fellows on to fight while they themselves remained at home enjoying their profits and robbing the people. The latest report of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills I (have beeu able to secure is dated 9th February, 1921, and in it I find the following: A new departure in the issue of tweed for returned soldiers in nice styles of serviceable materials at 50 per cent, of the current market value is keenly appreciated by the returned men. These mills in 1920 commenced to supply returned soldiers' needs with tweeds, these tweeds were retailed by the League to their members and their members' dethey pendents at a profit of Is. 6d. per yard. The League commenced with a profit of Is. per yard, but afterwards found necessary to increase the charge to Is. per yard. The difference, therefore, tween the mill price and the retail price of this tweed is Is. 6d. per yard, but Mr Scullin. when cloth comes from the other mills and filters into the hands of the retailers through Flinders-lane the difference is from 15s. to £ 1 per yard. Here we have the reason why these people are now fighting to abolish the Government Mills. They are not game to say to the Returned Soldiers' League, "" We will not allow you to trade in competition with Flinderslane and private traders ' ' ; because they play the soldiers for political interests and votes; but they ai'e proposing to do it in a subtle way by wiping out the only mill that will supply the soldiers directly with the tweed. They propose to cut off the source of direct supply, and that means the k ill in g of the whole proposition. In 1920 this mill entered into a contract with the Returned Soldiers Associations of Australia to provide them with 480,000 yards of their output of tweeds and twills. In Victoria 130,000 yards was to be supplied. In that State alone there are over 300 branches of the Returned Soldiers League retailing this material; aud it will be understood that when the soldiers and their friends went about the countryparticularly when prices were at their peak and we were paying from £10 to £12 for a suit-and they could say to people, "" The suit I am wearing was made up by my tailor from cloth made at the Commonwealth AVoollen M ill and retailed by the Returned Soldiers League at a profit Thus of Is. 6d. per yard; it has cost me £-6,"" people would say that that material should be available to everybody, and that would be the best way to bring down the price of clothing.",53
192,Mr ROBERT COOK,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Coul d not this be done by co-operation?,54
193,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member mouths co-operation; but this was cooperation of the best ancl most complete kind. The Commonwealth with its own m ill was assisting co-operative returned soldiers; and with the same system of cooperation amongst others the people could and have saved £3 or £4 on every suit of clothes, and £ 1 on every blanket which required to keep themselves warm in the winter. I have here samples of the output of the Geelong Woollen Mills, and it they are marked with the prices at which 6d. the material is retailed to the returned besoldiers at ANZAC House, and through the various associations of returned soldiers. I have reccive'd these samples from a soldier friend, and the marked prices, Which run from Ss. 6d. to 10s. 6d. per yard, include Is. 6d. per yard profit for retailing. A suit length costs 30s. to 35s. It can be made up by a good tailor with first-class trimmings for from £4 10s. to £5, making the total cost of the suit about £6, and I defy any honourable member to get as good an article at any tailor's shop for less than £10 at the present time. The distribution of this cloth to the Soldiers League is exposing the whole profiteering policy of the Flinders-lane gang, and is compelling them to keep prices lower than they wish; but let this m ill be abolished and they will again' "" work in unison "" as they did before, and up will soar the prices higher than ever. But there is another reason for the agitation to have tins m ill sold. In 1910, when I was sitting in this House as a supporter of the Labour Government, we established a factory for the manufacture of military uniforms. That Clothing Factory received its supply' of tweeds, twills, and cloth direct from the Geelong Mill.",54
194,Mr GKBKJTE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It first produced cloth in 1915.,55
195,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Clothing Factory commenced operations in 1911, and subsequently was able to get supplies of cloth direct from the Commonwealth Woollen M ill . It is dependent on that mill today. Since the Armistice there has been a decrease in the demand for military uniforms, and in order to keep going, the factory has been manufacturing for State Departments. It has beeu tendering for the uniforms of railway men such, as guards, stationmasters, and porters; aud attendants in public institutions, policemen, and others. In so doing it has toi the quality of the material to be sup - entered into direct competition with Flinders-lane so efficiently that it has undercut prices by at least 10 per cent. Consequently Flinders-lane has been howling for the last two years in the press and otherwise for the Commonwealth Clothing Factory to be closed because it was said to be competing unfairly. The crime that it is committing is not that the workers are practising the Government stroke, not that it is inefficient, but that it is too efficient, and is carrying on its operations better than private enterprise is able to do. I have here a report that appeared in the publio press on 11th June, 1920, of a deputation from the Chamber of Manufactures to Senator PearceThe Commonwealth Clothing Factory, a Government-owned concern, was carrying out contracts for the State Governments at prices 1.0 per cent, lower than the prices at which private manufacturers could do the work. This was unfair competition. Those are the people who always talk about the inefficiency of Government concerns; yet they admit that the Factory was operating at 10 per cent, lower than private traders could do the work. A similar deputation waited upon the State Premier of Victoria on 6th May, 1920, and urged for the same reason that the State Government should not give their tenders to the Commonwealth Clothing Factory. In letters to the press, private merchants complained that the Clothing Factory procured its cloth direct' from the mill, and that private enterprise had no hope of ever getting a contract when the Federal Factory tendered in competition with them. The Commonwealth Factory was able to undercut private enterprise by 10 per cent., andothat, they said, was not fair. At that time the Clothing Factory was making a complete suit for railway stationmasters, on public tender, for £ 3 9s., from the best of material turned out by the Commonwealth M ill , and made up in good style, yet private manufacturers said that the Factory should not. compete for State requirements. Only a. few months ago tenders were called by the State Government for uniforms for attendants in the mental hospitals. The Commonwealth Clothing Factory's tender was 5s. 6d. per uniform lower than the nearest private tender, that of Bowley and Company, but the latter was given the contract. There was no question as T plied by the Commonwealth Clothing Factory. It was the same as, and in some instances better than, that of the private tenderer, but the State Government is acting in unison with the Federal Government in this private industries protection stunt, in order to put an end to everything that interferes with their masters keeping up prices and continuing to make profits. Not only did the Commonwealth Woollen M ill make a good deal of profit, but u "" to date the accumulated profits of the Clothing Factory amount to £158,000. These figures may not mean much to honourable members opposite, who are prepared to spend £8,500 in sending a Minister to Washing12s., ton; that was a scandal, and details such expenditure by Ministers when they now £ 4 . go abroad should be made public. That £158,000 was in addition to approxivants mately £250,000 profit made by the M ill , and enterprise that can give such results should not be curtailed in this country. But that is only part the story. It is nothing to what the len Commonwealth saved during the war by particularly in the Senate. having that enterprise in existence. only did it provide cheaper cloth and forms, but it acted as a check upon the greed of the profiteers. I shall give one tember, 1910illustration out of scores that could be given. I have followed this matter that closely ever since these establishments were .started., because I was in the House at the time, and I took a share .of the responsibility .for bringing them into istence. I noticed that when the first tenders were called for cadet unithe forms in 1911, at the inception of the compulsory training scheme, tender for one line of breeches was 17s. 9d. In 1914, when enterprise the war broke out, tenders were called for large quantities - f breeches, and prices ranged up to 30s. per pair. Commonwealth Clothing Factory exister amined the tenders, and advised the Goexpressed vernment not to accept them. A f t e r ing into the whole of the factory costs the management offered to make the breeches at a certain price, and private traders were given an extra 10 per cent, for profit. When the Armistice was signed, in 1918, the peak price of men's, not inefficient, youths', breeches made on the flat rate plus 10 per cent., was l is . 2d. per pair. Yet private enterprise was asking for per pair at a time when wages and prices were not so high. Upwards of 1,000,000 pairs of ""breeches were ordered by the fence Department, and I venture to estimate that on this line alone the Commonfitable wealth Factory sawed, the community be launched. £250,000. T can quote another item 'to show how - the 'Government mills are hurting people in Flinders-lane, and I say that surely as the sun will rise morning, if the Woollen Mill is sold the Clothing Factory will be closed. men have to pay for their own uniforms, and the price charged them by Bowley and Company in 1920 was £7 10s. Mr Scullin. Through the Clothing Pactory they were able to get their suits for £ 3 but on account of some increases of that have taken place the price is The police as a body are amongst the lowest-paid publio seri n the country; but Flinders-lane was ringing with protests, and that was the beginning of the agitation to wipe out the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. When of we were proposing to establish the WoolM ill , in 1912, there was a protest, Senator Not Simon Fraser spoke on behalf of private unienterprise, and the then Minister for De. fence (Senator Pearce), said, on 9th SepTbe honourable .senator's old fashioned idea the 'State cannot do anything ho3 been bowled out long ago. His colleagues in Flinders-lane are howling about the State entering into competition witli private enterprise. exThose words are applicable to-da.y, but his "" colleagues in Flinders-lane"" are in Cabinet with Senator Pearce, doing the sort of thing of which I complain. the Senator Pearce continuedyouths' The fear which is expressed that State will not prove payable finds its best answer in the fear of the capitalist generally to be subjected to State competition The At that time Senator Pearce was a Mini n a. Labour Government, and he the truth that we express now, gothat the great fear of the capitalist is not that State enterprise will fail , but that it will succeed and compete with private enterprise. There has been no argument in favour of the sale of the Woollen M ill at Geelong on the ground that it is or that it will not pay. On the contrary, it has proved a splendid paying proposition, both directly and in 30s. directly, and such enterprises, instead of being curtailed should be extended. Senator E . D . Millen, speaking in the DeSenate on 9th September, 1910, saidIf these factories can be shown to be prothere is no reason why they should not My answer is that these factories have proved profitable, and there is no 'valid the - reason why they should not be retained as and extended. The profits made by the tomorrow Woollen M ill , =Clothing Factory,, and the Harness Pactory are net after allowing 5 Policeper cent, on the capital invested, and proper depreciation ou plant and machinery. And those profits are substantial. They represent something in the direction of easing the burden of taxation upon the people. When it is proposed to part with such a, concern-on e which is paying full interest upon capital, and is assisting indirectly to reduce the burden of taxation- I want to know where stands the Taxpayers Association. What is that body doing ? What is it saying about the jjroposition to part with such a profitable public tax-reducing concern 1 And where are honourable members of the Country party who have had so much to say about taxation ? Here i9 a chance to reduce taxation by extending this enterprise in order that it may make larger public profits. But the Taxpayers' Association says nothing. The Country party makes no protest. What conclusion can one come to other than that both bodies would prefer the continuance of high taxation rather than there should be any interference with private enterprise. Both organizations are out for economy. But if one may take their spoken word, or accept the written word of the press which represents them, it would appear that their sole idea of economy is to reduce the wages of the workers. I was amused this afternoon when the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) was giving the cane to the naughty boys in the Corner. The Minister talked largely about "" no competition with private traders,"" but he evidently believes in any amount of competition with the working classes. He cried, "" Press on with immigration."" The Minister informed the Hoxise that for every block of land having the necessary facilities and available for settlement there were hundreds of applicants waiting. Within ten minutes of making that statement, | the Minister said, "" We must press on with immigration."" Then he proceeded J to explain the Government's policy. Be said, in effect, that the settlement of Australians on the laud was the work of the States alone, but that, when it came to settling immigrants on the land, the Commonwealth Government would assist the State Governments. Two conditions were laid down, among others. I noted i them. They were that the Commoni wealth Government would assist if work in preparing the land was given to immigrants and if the blocks of land were made available to the immigrants. PreI ference for immigrants! No money or assistance to States if they propose to settle more Australfans 1 [15] The Minister for Defence said there were hundreds of applicants waiting for every available block; and, almost in the same breath, he cried, "" Press on with immigration,."" All this means that immigrants will be dumped into the cities to become competitors with our working men. That, however, will be all right from the point of view of the Government so long as there is no competition with the private traders of this country. Is this House going to allow the Government to sell the Commonwealth Mill at Geelong? Is there to be no protest from honourable members on the Government side who, when the enterprise in question was established, offered up their cheers? Members of the Coumtry party have been making speeches throughout the land, talking about the prices realized for their wool, and comparing them with what they have to pay for their clothes. What are they going to do about this matter? If the House fails to record a vote against the Government, and if the people at large do not protest, the mill at Geelong will be sold. The only source of supply at a cheap and reasonable rate' which the returned soldiers have will be cut off; the only'competition with the private trading profiteers will be abolished. And the Harness Factory will follow. Ite activities have already been reduced to a minimum. In pre-war times that factory employed eighty men; today it is finding work for eighteen. It will be the next to go. Then the Commonwealth ships will follow. And, if the people do noti protest, as sure as I live, the Commonwealth Bank will be handed over to private enterprise. The Government have stated that the mill at Geelong cannot be carried on except during three months in the year unless it conipetea wibh private enterprise; and that, the Government will not permit it to continue to do. The Commonwealth Bank has so successfully competed with private banking institutions that its profits total more than £3,700,000. Is the Minister for Defence prepared to say that the Government will not continue that profit-making public institution in competition with private banking companies 1 The Minister does not answer. I ask the House to note that I have put the question direct. Does the remark of the Minister to the effect that the Government will not compete with private trading apply to the Commonwealth Bank ?",55
196,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,There is no competition between the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks.,58
197,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I invite the honourable member to ask the private banking companies and their champions whether such is or is not the case. They would wipe out the Commonwealth Bank tomorrow. The Commonwealth Bank was the only institution of the kind which, during the war, did not raise its rate of interest on overdrafts. The trouble is that the Commonwealth Bank is too efficient. It has beaten private enterprise wherever it has entered into competition with it . As for the immediate proposal of the Government under review, I put the question direct to honourable members as a personal matter: Would they propose to sell the Commonwealth mill at Geelong if the enterprise were their own private business? Would the Minister for Defence, if he had a good paying proposition, 9uch as that mill, airily wave his hand and say, "" I will sell it to somebody who is eager to buy from me "" t Would the Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), sell some Flinderslane concern in which he might ba interested if it were providing him' with profits such as are produced by the Geelong mill? Not much! When it is a public concern, however, and one which is making profits for the people, the Government do not hesitate to say, "" Pass it over to a company which is very eager to buy it . sees in this issue the dictation of the ters of the Government. The Prime Minister says that honourable members on this side are in the web of the unions. We are not controlled by the moneyed interests of the country, who are the masters of the Govermnent, and keep them fettered. Not only the Commonwealth Government, but the New South Wales Nationalist Government also are pursuing tha same end, acting on the same principles. The same old Nationalist party stands for the private' profiteers. Scarcely are the New South Wales Government seated in the saddle than they begin to sell every State enterprise that is showing a profit.  member name the State enterprises which have been profitable?",58
198,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The State brick works are among them. Why are these works to go? At the dictation of the Brick Combine, they must be sold. The Government timber yards in New South; Wales are up for sale. Can the honourable  deny that? ",58
199,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I repeat that they are up for sale. The New South Wales Government are limiting or selling every enterprise. The State motor garage, which has been working at a profit, is being limited in its scope of activity. The State drug stores, which have been supplying medicines at cheap rates to hospitals, and conferring benefits upon the poor, have now been limited entirely to Government concerns. All theee signs are part of the general scheme in the interests and for the welfare of private traders. The war furnished opportunities for this country to get on with State enterprises, which have proved successful; but the Government, speaking for those whom they represent, say that these activities must no. longer continue. It is not as if the management of these various public institutions had proved a failure. The managers have shown themselves to be excellent business men. Labour conditions at that factory are better than those to be found in an average mill in any part of Australia. The mill has saved the Government thousands of pounds indirectly, besides making direct profits. It has shielded returned soldiers "" One from exploitation, and it would save masmoney for the civilian population, too, if it were permitted to extend its operations so as to cater for the public generally. Its successful operations have had the effect of exposing and hurting the profiteers, for which reasons the mill is to be handed over to private enterprise. Competition must he stifled; Flinders-lane must be freed from this irksome competitor. All the private traders will soon be able to act in unison again. What a happy hunting-ground there will be for the profiteers! In disposing of the mill the Government will be merely doing the behest of their masters, of those men who subscribe to the party funds, of those who have given their tips for the benefit On this side of the House honourable members are doing the work of the people. Here is a clear dividing line as between Labour and anti-Labour. Honourable members on this side stand for the people and their interests. Members behind the Government, supported almost entirely by honourable members in the Corner, stand for the profiteers. I intend to make this inatter a test question in the House, and the party to which I have the honour to belong intends to see to it that it is made a test in the wider field of public opinion. I move That the following words be added to the proposed address"" but we declare that any action by the Government to dispose of the Commonwealth Government Woollen Cloth Factory at Geelong will hot meet with the approval of this House.""",58
200,Mr EODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Wannon--Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.13] - I do.not propose to deal with the amendment further than to say that, if .there could he placed before the country a clear-cut issue as between the value of the conduct of trade by private enterprise-properl y regulated and controlled-and under State control, there would be no doubt concerning the outcome. Personally, I welcome tie amendment, because it may provide that clear-cut issue. The public will bear freshly in mind the experience of Government activities in that glorious land of Kussia, which has strewn its wreckage around the world. Surely we do not wish to emulate Bussia! My purpose is to devote some attention to a matter raised by th^honourable mem. ber for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), having to do with the duty on maize. The presentation of the case put hy the honourable member is substantially correct up to the stage at which this House accepted an. amendment made in another place fix-' ing the duties at Is. 6d. preferential, 2s. 6d. intermediate, and 3s. general Tariff. The statements of my colleague Mr Greene were made in perfect good faith, as will be shown hy what I have to say. Following on those statements, cable communications were opened up between the South African Government and the Commonwealth Govermnent. It was the intention of the Commonwealth Government at that particular stage to place South African manse in the same position as maize from any other country, and then to negotiate terms for the future relationship of South Africa and the Commonwealth, so far as maize and other commodities are concerned, on a reciprocal basis. I remind the House very briefly that, in 1906, the Commonwealth Government negotiated an agreement with South Africa in respect of many items, of which maize was one, and under that arrangement the duty wasfixed at Is. per central. That position South Africa has enjoyed since 1006. It is only fair to say at this juncture that, while South Africa was not prepared to accept the position in which we placed her in the general Tariff, as approved by this Chamber and another .place-namely , that South Africa, until we negotiated other terms, was .'to pay the same duty as any other countTy-the balance of trade, in the year prior to the telegrams sent by my colleague, was overwhelmingly in favour of the Commonwealth. The figures show £3,900,000 of trade from Australia to South Africa, as against £400,000 of trade from South Africa to Australia. So important was the position that I venture to say that not even the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) would suggest that we should have imperilled an agreement so overwhelmingly in favour of Australia, and all for the sake of this one item. Therefore, at the eleventh hour of the session, as the honourable member, far Wide Bay (Mr Corser) mentioned-whe n my colleague received the intimation from. South Africa that, unless she were allowed to denounce the whole of the H906 treaty arrangement, she was not prepared to accept ' the position with respect to maize-he , in the interests of this country, effected an amendment in the Bill on a jnessage from the Governor General. As a resulfr we have the position in which we fiad ourselves today, and that - position I , personally, very much regret. The matter was, however, so serious for Australia-that it would neverhave done for us to imperil a trade treaty under whioh Australia enjoyed preferential treatment in respect of the volume of trade I have mentioned.  made in this Chamber?",59
201,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes . As I have said, the assurances were given by my colleague in .perfect good faith, and I regret that those assurances should have been relied upon by certain honourable members. All I can say is that the facts do not speak too - well for sameof . the manufacturers of cornflour, starch, and glucose, who, on ""the strength of their utilization of thp Australian raw products, received a greatly increased duty on their secondary produit.. The intention of the House was that those manufacturers should use Australian maize, and thus assist a prim ary industry; but. at a time when they could got the maize a little cheaper elsewhere, they threw ever the local producers and obtained it from outside. I certainly do nob regard that as in keeping with their attitude on the question when they were granted an increased duty. A number of returned soldiers are growing maize; and I must repeat that, in my judgment, the attitude of the manufacturers was not a commendable one. However, the Government are opening up negotiations with South A f r i c a with a view to a reconsideration of the trade relations of the two countries. The whole question of the T a r if f relations will be reviewed, and the maize question gone into thoroughly. In the meantime, however, I am considering very carefully another alternative which is at the disposal of the Government. Of that I will say nothing f u r t h er to-night, but I hope that the warning given will show those who asked for protection for the secondary in dustry of which maize is the raw material that it is "" up to the m "" to stand hy the men who grow it here. Debate (on motion by Mr MOW . IL I-IAMB) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. NORTHE RN TERRITORY ADMINISTRATIO N. Motion (iby Mr MASSYGREENE) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. Mr Charlton. (Hunter ) [10.24] have received the following telegram from Messrs. H . Nelson and P. Brennan, on behalf of the residents of the Northern Territory, asking me to ventilate the subject of their communication in this House. The telegram is as follows:On behalf people Territory we enter emphatic protest against future development Territory being dependent on Vesteys Bros, aa per recent statement by Senator Pearce. Considering general concessions being granted Vesteys they should be compelled faithfully carry out conditions their leases re fencing well sinking &e. We request that no leases land Daly River be granted individual until such lands are'publicly advertised and gazetted as open selection. We urge immediate necessity Government diverting their steamers now calling Java and Singapore so as call Darwin and not leave place for ever mercy profiteering monopoly of Burns Philp who still charge highest, war freights and fares though subsidized by Government. Isolation is strangling this place' and Burns Philp are twisting the Tope. We further urge the immediate starting of Katherine-bridge which cannot be effected by battle of routes and would absorb most of Territory unemployed. We protest against the system of government rations for unemployed as degrading when plenty of necessary and useful work that requires immediate attention would provide them with employment. The unemployed situation here is damning evidence of Government's wilful neglect or utter inability to handle its own estate intelligently. We also direct attention to statements recently made from Bench by resident magistrate alleging interference by Administrator and others with the course of justice. There are some important statements in that telegram, and I hope that the Government will take them into considertion.",59
202,Mr GREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Richmond-Minister for Defence) [10.27] - All I can say is that I will bring the telegram under the notice of m y colleague the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator PeaTco) and let the honourable member know the result. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.27 p.m. - I,60
