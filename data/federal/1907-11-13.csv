1,Mr REID,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether the endeavours of the Government to recover the penalty of ,£25,000 guaranteed in connection with the late abortive mail contract have got to the length of beginning an action in the Courts of England for the recovery of the amount ?",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In the absence of my honourable colleague the Attorney-General, the last information received by me is that our legal advisers in London feel confident about the recovery of the money, and are taking the steps necessary to obtain it. I am not clear as to whether their .procedure has reached the stage mentioned by the' right honourable member, but I think that it has. MAIL SERVICE TO EUROPE.",14
3,Mr REID,Unknown,"Does the Prime Minister think that he is within measurable distance of the day when he will be able to .make an announcement to the House with reference to the negotiations. which, have been proceeding for some time in connection with the new mail contract?",14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"We are waiting only for the intimation on one point to which I referred yesterday. EveTy other matter has been settled, subject to an agreement on that point NA",14
5,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Does the Postmaster : General recognise that the choice of a design for the first Australian stamp is a matter, of such importance that he should give the House an opportunity to consider the matter upon the Estimates before a selection is finally made?",14
6,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"As soon as the report on the subject, is ready, it will be laid"" on the table.",14
7,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,^-What I wish to know is whether the Postmaster-General intends toadopt any design before the Estimates for his Department are considered?,14
8,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I propose to call for competitive designs, so that there is nochance of the matter being settled before the Estimates have been dealt with. INTERNATIONA L REPLY COUPONS.",14
9,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I hold in my hand an international reply coupon lately sent to mefrom England. In accordance with the instructions printed upon the back of it, I applied at the General Post Office, Melbourne, today, for the stamp which it represents, and was told that the Stamp Office did not know anything about'the matter. I understand that the international reply coupon system was proposed and formulated by the representatives of Australia at the recent .International Postal Congress. What I wish to know from the Postmaster General is how much longer will the public of Melbourne, have to wait for the putting into operation here of a reform proposed by Australia, and already adopted and in operation in England?",14
10,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Instruction s in connection with this system were issued three or .four weeks ago. I shall inquire why they have not been carried out. EXCISE TARIFF (AGRICULTURAL. MACHINERY) ACT.,14
11,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In view of the announcement in this morning's newspapers, that the Government have given notice to Mr H . V. MCKay, the harvester manufacturer, that he must pay Excise upon the harvesters which he has made since the ist January of this year, I ask is it really intended to enforce the provisions of the Excise Tariff Agricultural Machinery Actin respect to wages paid , during the period! before which certain rates were determined to be unfair and unreasonable, when the manufacturers concerned could not ascertain STAMP. what rates would be regarded as fair and reasonable ?",14
12,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"In .accordance, with the promise made yesterday, .1 - now lay on the table a copy of the notice served on Mr H . V. MCKay, and a copy of a general notice sent to.all the manufacturers .of agri-' cultural implements in the Commonweattlv The notice sent to Mr H . V. MCKay cludes in this mannerYou are further notified that, in decision above noted, the provisions of the said Act have been in force in regard to your since ist January, 1907; and further take notice that, in accordance with the said Act, it w i necessary for you to pass proper entries for all dutiable goods before delivery from your factory from the date hereof. We also require Mr MCKay to account for the whole of the machines manufactured since ist January of this year. In the of the notice sent to manufacturers genethis vear. rally, the amount of security to be required is not stated, a blank being left; but in notice sent to Mr MCKay an amount of ,£5,000 is fixed as security.",14
13,Mr TILLEY BROWN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If the money is difficult to collect as the mail contract antee, the provision is not worth much.",15
14,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"As Mr MCKay is carrying on business in Australia, while the guarantors of the mail contract are domiciled on the other side of the world, the cases are not the same. If Mr MCKay thinks the demand made On him inequitfacturers able in any particular, or that there grounds upon which he can ask for considuty deration, it is for him to make them known. Should he do so, it will be the duty of Government to consider his application.",15
15,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The law will have to be altered before he can obtain a remission the Excise.,15
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,Will the Prime Minister cause the judgment in this case be made a State paper ?,15
17,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Havin g regard to the sider circumstances and the importance of the finding in relation to both present and prospective legislation, it is highly desirable that the judgment .should be printed in extenso. As soon as a copy of it is availcase able, I shall lay it on the table of the House, and move that it be printed.",15
18,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"Is the collection of the import duty on harvesters at the rate £16 each to be conditional on the Excise Act being held by the High Court to be within the legislative powers of the monwealth Parliament? If it be 'found that the Excise cannot be levied, will import duties remain at £ 1 6 per harvester? Have the Government thought out what they will do in the matter?",15
19,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,The import duties will remain as they are until altered by Parliaextraordinary ment.,15
20,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I suggest that the ment in this case be not printed until conschedule of wages which Mr Justice Higgins is having prepared is complete, view of the - and can be published with it.",15
21,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I do not know factory that I quite understood the Prime Minister's reply to my question. If I followed l l be him rightly, his remarks amounted to this: that unless any of the manufacturers affected can allege circumstances of a special character, entitling them to a particular indulgence, the law will be strictly enforced copy against them as from the ist January of MiDEAKIN-Yes . The first parathe graph of the notice to which I referred impresses upon the manufacturers the fact that they will be required to pay Excise as upon all dutiable goods comprised within guarthe schedule, and delivered from their factory since ist January, 1907.",15
22,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"What will be the policy of the Government if the Excise Act be found to be invalid ? Parliament has determined that the protection given to manushall be £ 1 0 per harvester, that are being the difference between the import of £ 1 6 and the Excise duty of -£6. What will be the position if the High the Court decides that we cannot, by imposing Excise, regulate the rates of wages? Will the import duty of £ 1 6 per harvester remain for the protection alike of those who of pay good wages and those who pay bad?",15
23,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If the High Court to should determine that the Excise Act is invalid, the Government will have to conto do the situation, but we are not bound so in anticipation.",15
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"If the Excise is collected, will it be paid info the Consolidated Revenue? If it is, in what better will the employees be who bave 'been declared to be so shockingly underpaid?",15
25,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,".Before paying the money into the Consolidated Revenue, we of shall take into account the circumstances to which the honourable member refers.",15
26,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"I desire to ask the ComPrime Minister whether, in the event of the High Court ruling that the provisions the of the Excise Tariff Agricultural Machinery Act are unconstitutional, the Government will reduce by proclamation the duty placed upon manufactured articles?",15
27,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE,"That would be a. very power for the House to in' trust even to this Administration. This judgGovernment may have exceptional claims the to consideration, but I do not wish even to suppose for a moment that the legislation we have passed can be held to be unconstitutional. It would take a great deal to satisfy us on that point. If the Act were TTela to be unconstitutional, it would probably be because of our adoption of some method not essential to the task we have to perform.. We should then take other measures to make sure of giving effect to our intentions. The step to which the honourable member has alluded, after all, represents a counsel of despair. NA ENCOURAGEMENT BILL.",15
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,When will the Manufactures Encouragement Bill be introduced and dealt with?,16
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Tru e to my promise, as I always am, I shall introduce the Bill today, and set' it down to be read asecond time tomorrow; but I do not propose to proceed with the second reading until the Committee of Ways and Means plied has dealt with Division V. of the I intend to proceed with the Bill before Division VI . is dealt with. NA - MINES.",16
30,Mr JH CATTS,NATIONALIZATION OF COAL,"Will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of ing in a Bill to provide for a referendum for the alteration of the Constitution, to enable the Federal Government to nationalize coal mines and other public utilities?",16
31,Mr DEAKIN,NATIONALIZATION OF COAL,"The industrial conditions of Australia have already obtained a good deal of attention from this Parliament. We have now on the statute-book two measures, the second of which is running the usual gauntlet of legal tests, and until it is disposed of, I do not think the honourable member can expect us to make any larger essay.",16
32,Mr JH CATTS,NATIONALIZATION OF COAL,"I do not think that the Primfe Minister understood the question which I put to him. I asked not that the State should regulate the conditions under which men are employed in coal mines, but whether the Prime Minister would consider the desirableness of bringing in a Bill to enable a referendum of the electors of the Commonwealth to be taken on the question of amending the Constitution to enable the Parliament to nationalize coal mining and other public utilities.",16
33,Mr DEAKIN,NATIONALIZATION OF COAL,"The Government already have under consideration more than one project which, if they are to be given effect to, will require to be dealt with by a referendum at the next general election. They are not prepared on any ground which has yet been disclosed to add to such an extension of Federal powers as the honourable member proposes. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",16
34,Mr LIDDELL,NATIONALIZATION OF COAL,"I wish to make a personal explanation. I do not complain of the lack of courtesy shown by the Postmaster-General in replying! to questions, but I certainly do object to having my veracity impugned. I wish to explain the facts connected with certain questions which I put to the honourable member upon a previous date. Commenting on an article which appeared in the Argus in regard to the employment of hands in the Sydney General Post Office, I said I desire to know whether it is a fact that the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney has apfor 600 additional hands, of which number Tariff. only one-half has been allotted? The reply which I received was as followsThe honourable gentleman is again wrong in his facts. The Deputy Postmaster-General did not apply for 600 hands In reply to a question which was put to the Postmaster-General by the honourable bringmember for Lang, on 17 th October, namelyDid the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney ask that provision should be made in the Estimates for 1907-8 for a considerable increase in the staff of his Department, to insure the efficient administration and working of the same in New South Wales? The honourable gentleman said, "" Yes."" The second question put to him by the honourable member for Lang, wasI f so, how many additional officers did he estimate were required? The Postmaster-General replied, ""600."" The third question wasFor how many additional officers has provision been made in the Estimates? The answer was, "" 267."" I think that I have shown conclusively that I was right, and not wrong, in my facts as the Post-. master-General alleged. Since he said, "" The honourable gentleman is again wrong in his facts,"" I presume that he was alluding to a previous question which I put to him, namely- ' I desire to asf the honourable gentleman if the Department has taken upon itself to reduce the fee which was fixed for holding a conversation over the trunk lines from Sydney to Melbourne. . . . On inquiry at the Department this morning,. I was informed by one of the officials that the original charge was 6s., and that that charge has since-been reduced to 5s. I , therefore, think that I have conclusively proved that the Postmaster-General, apart from his discourtesy, was altogether wrong in the reply which he made, and that t was right. TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES: ADVERTISING.",16
35,Mr MALONEY,NATIONALIZATION OF COAL,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Is it the intention of his Department to let the advertisements in the telephone books to private firms? 2. Will tenders be called for in each State respectively ? 3. Will the Minister inform the House why his Department cannot manage such advertisements, and thus retain the f Department ?",17
36,Mr MAUGER,NATIONALIZATION OF COAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. No. 2. See answer to No. 1. 3. When any action is taken in this direction, the Department will undertake the necessary work, and itself manage such advertisements, and retain the full receipts derived therefrom. ARGENTINE REPUBLIC: NA",17
37,Mr GLYNN,IMPORTATION OF AUSTRALIAN,"the Prime Minister, ufon notice Whether he has communicated with the vernment of the Argentine Republic in reference to the unnecessary embargo on the importations of Australian cattle into that country; and, if so, with what result?",17
38,Mr DEAKIN,IMPORTATION OF AUSTRALIAN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsYes. The Colonial Office was asked on iSth May last to communicate with the Argentine Government, for the purpose of procuring the Temoval of the prohibition. The Argentine Government has intimated its preparedness to consider the. question, if it is officially notified that Australia is free from cattle disease. Replies of a satisfactory character have been received from five State Governments to my inquiry in this regard. The Government is now awaiting the receipt of advice as to the condition of the herds in the remaining State before giving the desired assurance to the Government of the Argentine. BACCHU S . MARS H POST OFFICE.ing",17
39,Mr MAUGER,IMPORTATION OF AUSTRALIAN,"On the 6th November, by 3.the I promised to obtain information for the honourable member for Corio in the work of the staff of the Bacchus Marsh post office, and the business there. The following replies to the questions-Hansard , page 5601-whic h he then asked have been supplied by the Acting Deputy Postmaster General, Melbourne1. The staff at the Bacchus Marsh Post Office consists of a postmistress, assistant, and telegraph messenger. ' The following are their hours of duty :Postmistress -8.1 0 to 8.20 a.m., 9 a.m. to. 12.30 p.m., 1 to 3 p.m., 5 to 8.10 p.m., and to receive mails 9 to 9.20 p.m. Assistant -8.1 5 to 1 p.m., 2 to 6 p.m., 7 to. 8 p.m. Messenger -8.1 0 a.m. to 12 noon, 1 to 5 p.m., 6 to 8.10 p.m. On Tuesday and Thursday the Assistant ceases duty at 6 p.m. The Assistant and Messenger are off duty on alternate Wednesdays from 1 p.m.. to 6 p.m. 2. For the half-year ended the 30th June, 1906, the revenue increased at the rate of u l l receipts for the per annum. 3. On the 24th ultimo, an application was sent to the Public Service Commissioner for the appointment of an additional assistant, (letter carrier) at Bacchus Marsh, whose services are to be utilized indoors after completing delivery, ir» order to enable the hours now worked by the staff to be reduced. I am advised that the proposed appointment has now been approved by the Public Service Commissioner. TYPEWRITING MACHINES : TELEGRAPHISTS.",17
40,Mr MAUGER,IMPORTATION OF AUSTRALIAN,"On the 5th November the honourable member for Lang asked two CATTLE. questions-Hansard , page 5520-wit h reference to the supplying of typewriters to New South Wales telegraphists. The reGoplies since made available are as follow1. A report has now been obtained in the matter. 2. In all future cases, officers of the New South Wales Branch of the Department will be accorded the same consideration as officers in the other States. TELEGRAPH INSULATORS: KAOLIN CLAY AT HEATHCOTE.",17
41,Mr MAUGER,IMPORTATION OF AUSTRALIAN,"On the 26th September the honourable member for Bass, on behalf of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, asked the following questions1. Whether his attention has been directed to> reports published concerning immense depositsof kaolin clay in the Heathcote district, suitable for the manufacture of white telegraph insulators? 2. Will he cause inquiries to be made respectthe suitability and availability of such deposits ? What number of new insulators are required' Department every year? 4. What is the average price paid for insulareference to tors by the Department? 5. What would be the cost of the machinery and plant necessary to enter on the manufacture of insulators in the Commonwealth? The replies since made available are as follow1. Yes. 2. I consider that the best way the suitability and availability of these deposits is to invite tenders for insulators made' in tralia, and instructions to do so have been ready given, and specifications ticulars of the Department's requirements are now being prepared. 3 and 4. The following information has furnished by the several Deputy Postmasterswhich General as to the number of insulators of the standard kinds, estimated to be used by this partment in the respective States, in the twelve months, and the price last paid for insulators :QUANTITIES AND COSTS PER INSULATORLarge White Porcelain. Small. N.S.W. .. 60,000 .. 4|d. 200,000 .. l t j d . 18,000 . . 0.78d. Victoria . . 45,000 .. 4Ud. Queensland 48,000 .. 4jd. 29,000 .. 2jd. 2,000 .. 0.75d. S.

Probably approximately equal to those paid in lor similar articles. NOTE - Small quantities of other insulators are purchased at times, but the above represent standard patterns. 5. It is estimated that the cost of machinery and plant necessary to enter on the manufacture of insulators in the Commonwealth, would about ,£5,000 upwards, according to the output of the kilns. It is, however, understood that there are certain firms in Australia who already have the necessary facilities for tors, with very little, if any, new expenditure on plant. I may add that I have given instructions Bill? for tenders to be called for 100,000 insulators of Australian manufacture.

I trust that honourable members will not exbeen pect me at this stage to make a speech may give rise to discussion. I proDepose to introduce the Bill today, and to next move that it be read a second time as soon such as we have disposed of the division of the Tariff with which we were dealing last night.",18
43,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,Does this motion relate Button. td the iron bounties?,18
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Yes .,18

46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Thre e Bills of 466 1.25d. r this kind have been before the House, and that to which this motion relates follows, other States with one exception, much on the same lines.",18
47,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,In connection with iron? the most usually employed,18
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Yes . The schedule relates to pig iron, puddled bar iron made from Australian pig iron, steel be made from Australian pig iron, galvanized iron, wire-netting, and wire. The addition of the item "" wire "" is a departure from the making insulaprovision of the last Bill.",18
49,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,Is iron wire the only class of wire dealt with in the,18
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"The Bill relates to iron and steel wire, but not to copper wire. The schedule also includes - PAPERS. iron and steel tube pipes, except riveted or of not more than 4 inches infernal diameter. I have likewise included, as before, a provision relating to a bounty on the production of reapers and binders. I and find that reapers and binders are not made at the present time to any extent in Australia. I do not know that they are made. I have made inquiries, but have not yet discovered that they are. That being so, I have allowed the item to remain in the schedule. I do not h wish the consideration of the Tariff to be interrupted for a long time in order that this measure may be passed, and on moving No - that the Bill the read a second time. I shall ask that a test vote be taken. Whether that vote be favourable or unfavorable, I shall know exactly what to do with regard to the Tariff. I am sure that honourable members are'just as anxious as I am that the Tariff shall be dealt with by this House before Christmas. I have duced the Bill at this stage in order to obtain from the House, before we deal with Division VI . of the Tariff, an intimation of whether or not a Bounties Bill will be accepted. .",18
51,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,Hav e the Government the necessary fund for the purposes of this Bill ?,19
52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Some honourable members have said that the Tariff will yield a revenue of ^12,000,000 per annum. If it does I shall have plenty of money.",19
53,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,But the honourable gentleman says that it will not.,19
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I do not think that it will ; but in any event, I believe that I shall have sufficient revenue available for the purposes of this Bill .",19
55,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"East Sydney) [z.46] - If all in with the desire of the Treasurer that we shall have no discussion at this stage, but I see at once that the intrusion of this Bill at the present time may have a most unfortunate effect bn the progress that we shall make with the Tariff. involves a number of most important considerations.",19
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I merely wish to obtain a test vote upon it.*,19
57,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"I rather deprecate the introduction at present of anything that will take away the mind of the Committee, f any length of time, from the Tariff. I think, however, that we might certainly allow the Bill to be introduced, so that we may see what its provisions are.",19
58,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,"Wide Bay) [3.48] presume that this is a Bounties Bill . On the last occasion that such was before us many of us were somewhat surprised, because we did not see the scope of the Governor General's message. this occasion, however, the message is of the widest possible character, and anything relating to the encouragement of manufactures may be dealt with under it .",19
59,Mr TILLEY BROWN,MANUFACTURES,Is this an official intimation ?,19
60,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,"I am guided by the Gomotion vernor-General's message, which has been iron ? read to the House, and under which,. it seems to me, we can make whatever provision we please in regard to the encouragement of manufactures in the Commonwealth.

62,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,That is practically passing the Bill .,19
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"It is ; but at the same time the taking of a test vote will not occupy very much time, and my desire is to get on with the Tariff. If honourable members are in favour of a Manufactures Encouragement Bill , that fact will affect some of the duties in division VI .",19
64,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,What about Division VI.A?,19
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Las t night I suggested Division VI . A , but other members pointed out that there were items in division VI . which will be affected.

78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,The motion is just as vague as it could be.,20
79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I desire to place the Bill before honourable members so that they may see what its scope is. In fact, the scope has been somewhat curtailed.",20
80,Mr BAMFORD,MANUFACTURES,"Herbert) [3.6] - A little while ago we had before us a Bounties Bill in reference to Australian products. It was then found that, although this Chamber did not pass many of the items and reduced some of the proposed bounties, we were not able to apply, as we desired, the amounts thus saved to any other purpose. I desire to know whether, under the present Bill, there will be power to do what we desired to do under the last Bill.",20
81,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,Gwydir) [3.7] - Is there any provision made for a bounty for wire-netting ?,20

84,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.8] - I have already read the items to honourable members. I have added wire, because we ought to be able to produce not only the wire-netting, but the wire; in fact, I understand that wire can easily be produced here. In reply to the honourable member for Herbert, I may say that the Governor General's message is quite comprehensive enough to permit of our doing almost anything in the way of varying the bounties proposed.",20

The Tariff is so framed that we have to be sure that when omitting any articles we are not placing them, as I say, under some other heading which means a higher duty. I desire the assurance of the Minister that the do effect of this amendment will be that inf o r etended, namely, to omit the item altogether from the dutiable list. This is an item of enormous importance, representing as it does ,£3,300,000 worth of imports.",20
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"It is the largest item we have, and the ' duty paid is ^io 6,ooo. H",21
91,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,I should - like to know from the Minister what proportion the value of the cotton and linen bears to the value of - the whole of the imports embraced by paragraph E.,21
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The cotton and linen imports are practically the whole.,21
93,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"There are so many enormously high duties producing such a very large excess of revenue, even, beyond the expectations of the Government, that my disposition, whenever I get the chance, is to vote for making items free. When I find honourable members, who, no doubt, from conscientious motives, have been voting for high duties on other lines, disposed to vote for lower duties, I am inclined to take advantage of their assistance.",21
94,Mr TILLEY BROWN,MANUFACTURES,This is not an honest proposal ?,21
95,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,Why not ?,21
96,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"I almost invariably give way to the suggestions of the honourable member for Indi, because of his vast practical experience, but I desire the honourable member to realise my view. If this were a symmetrical Tariff",21
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"That is just what it is - Kingston, C. C. Kelly, W. H .",21
98,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"If this were>a symmetrical Tariff I admit that the omission of items might destroy its harmony. My view, however, is that there is nothing symmetrical about this Tariff. The rates imposed upon many articles which are necessary to the whole community are so high; the chance of getting a line like that under consideration admitted free- a line which is almost universally used by the poorer classes-is so rare; and the proposed reduction, if carried, would throw such a gleam of light upon the whole Tariff that I will cordially support such an amendment.

99,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Trea surer) [3.26] - The honourable member for Parramatta wishes to reduce the 10 per 3° cent, rate levied upon the items enumerated in this paragraph to 5 per cent., with a view to admitting the manufactures of Great Britain free. As I pointed out last night, the annual imports under this heading are valued at £3,300,000, of which Great Britain supplies over £3,000,000 worth. It will thus be seen that only a very small proportion of these goods comes from other countries. If the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta be carried, the bulk of our imports under this heading will be admitted free. I hope that for the sake of the revenue that is involved honourable members will not agree to that proposal.",21
100,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"South Sydney) [3.27]. - I cannot understand why a Government which is professedly protectionist should cling so limpet-like to revenue duties - to duties which have no other object than the collection of revenue from the people. If any question of encouraging local industries were involved-of affording them an opportunity to stand against foreign competition- I could understand the attitude of the'Ministry, and could sympathize with it. Personally, I could give them every possible support",22
101,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"As upon the question of rice, for example?",22
102,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"I objected to the collection of revenue duties upon rice. The Treasurer knows full well that the imposition of high protective duties must for a considerable time involve a certain amount of sacrifice by the people. Higher prices are inevitable until our industries are in a position practically, to supply our own requirements. But, in addition to this load, this sacrifice that we are asking the people to bear for the benefit of posterity-for the future of Australia-the Government ask them to pay revenue duties upon such articles as moleskins and calicoes, which we cannot produce in the Commonwealth. I want honourable members who are protectionists to recollect that a protective policy is supported by men and women throughout Australia who have nothing but sacrifice ahead so far as they individually concerned - by in the districts of Western Australia, by miners, shearers, and others in Northern Queensland, who will derive no direct benefit whatever from such a policy. these persons look to the larger issue. They ask themselves, "" What will this policy do for the development of the country ? Will it make us self-contained and self-reliant?"" It is because of the answer which they give to that question that they are willing to make sacrifices in the meantime. Butis it fair to ask those who are prepared to throw aside their own selfish interests to bear a burden which has no possible connection with a protective policy - the burden of revenue duties, which are imposed with the single object of saving from taxation the' landed proprietors of Australia? That is the only object of such duties. They are being levied merely to save from taxation those who are well able to pay, but who are selfishly unwilling to pay.",22
103,Mr TILLEY BROWN,MANUFACTURES,They are sufficiently taxed already.,22
104,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"Are not the poor men with whom the honourable member was so sympathetic a short time ago sufficiently taxed? The honourable member for Indi is ready to increase by a few shillings a year what the poor man must ""expend on moleskins, but he declares that the land-owners are already sufficiently taxed. We can understand the measure of sympathy'with the working men felt by honourable members of his stamp. The crocodile tears which they are perpetually shedding can be gauged at their true value this afternoon when they are asked to choose between imposing a duty on moleskins and admitting them free. The working men of Australia are willing to make a sacrifice for the future of their country; they are willing that prices shall be raised so that goods may be manufactured in Australia. But an unnecessary and unjustifiable burden will be piled on them if we saddle them with the payment of revenue duties, the incidence of which can benefit only those well able to bear taxation in other forms.",22
105,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"Forty-fiv e per cent, on apparel !",22
106,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"I imagine that the honourable member for Swan has some sympathy with the girls employed in the whitework industries of our large cities. These industries he must know to be the worse are sweated in the civilized world. If any of miners our industries are to be protected, we should extend the most liberal protection to what are known as the white-workers ot .Australia. I am quite prepared to give But more consideration to sweated industries such as theirs than to other industries. But I urge protectionists not to continue to vote for revenueduties which impose unfair and improper burdens upon the working classes. I ask them to be satisfied with giving effect to the policy on which they were elected, leaving it to the Government to shoulder the responsibility of providing revenue.",22
107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Trea surer) [3.34] - I cannot allow the speech of the honourable member for South Sydney to pass without replying to it. He says that these proposals have been put forward with a view to preventing the imposition of land taxation. He should know perfectly well what are my opinions on the subject of direct taxation.,23
108,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"The Minister should speak for the Government, not for himself.",23
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I am in charge of the Tariff, and I absolutely deny the accuracy of the statement of the honourable member for South Sydney that these duties have been proposed with a view to preventing the imposition of land taxation.",23
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,The Government is breaking its compact of last night.,23
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I regret that the honourable member for South Sydney has imported so much heat into the discussion. Does he expect me, as Treasurer in charge of a Tariff like this, to forego all revenue duties? I cannot do it. I do are not. not pay much attention to revenue duties, but I must obtain a fair amount of revenue, and in this item £166,000 is involved, striking out linens and cottons, about £150,000. I do not think that it be very judicious or creditable to throw away revenue in the manner the honourable member proposes. I cannot do it, because I must have money with which to carry on. The statement of the members of the position that the Tariff will increase the revenue by £2,000,000 a year is absolute nonsense. The returns are now becoming normal, and will not amount to much more than my estimate; that is, to something tween £800,000 and £900,000 a year. .Therefore, we have to be careful. Whilst those who are opposed to revenue duties may not like to see them carried, I hope one. that it will not again be attributed that I have proposed them to prevent imposition of direct taxation.",23

I have to vote for duties of this kind. But what is rate proposed in this instance? Only 5 per cent.",23
114,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,This is not the only revenue duty; there are many others in the Tariff.,23
115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I intend to meet the honourable member in regard to some of the items, but in this case the duty is only 5 per cent., so that I do not think an individual purchaser will feel it, since it will affect"" prices so slightly. But there are revenue duties which I feel very much disposed to forego, because they are purely revenue producing, and not protective in their incidence.",23
116,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"The proposed duty, if carried, will make it 5 per cent, harder for the working man to live.",23
117,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I do not think so. I have replied to the honourable member for South Sydney because I cannot allow any one to say that I am not in favour of direct taxation.,23

Probably we shall have to impose taxation of another class before we can establish a pensions system; but unless we can by remitting duties effect some great good, we should not forego a below duty like this.

130,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,What does the item include besides flannelette?,25
131,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Nothing . When I was administering the Customs Department, I had material brought to me, presumably flannel; and some of it, though flannelette, was most difficult to distinguish from the pure article; and the-wording of this item has been prepared by the Department with the intention to embrace all classes of flannelette. If we use the word -""flannelette,""we shall not 'be able to check the importation of many spurious flannels, and, as I have already indicated, it is scarcely possible, sometimes, to distinguish between flannel and flannelette. Sir PHILIP FYSH"" (Denison) [4.3] After the division which has just been taken, I think it would be most invidious to single out this article, which is mostly - used by the poorer classes. I disregard altogether the objection taken by the medical fraternity to the use of flannelette. We must allow the people to exercise their own judgment and discretion; and the phraseology of the item shows how difficult it is for the Customs Department to distinguish what is really a flannel. I observed that the honourable member for Melbourne yesterday, when referring to various dress stuffs which - are sold at 3s. or 4s. a yard, showed one which was distinctly a flannelette ; and under the item as proposed by .the Treasurer, anything of a cotton nature which resembles aflanneletteis to be called a flannelette. I have lately had occasion to call the attention of the Department to various kinds of cotton goods which are not flannelettes, but which are imported as plain gingham. This material has been rolled over the hot rollers on one side only, and the other side is left with the fluffy, appearance of flannelette, as though it had been teased. An ordinary print is run over the hot rollers on both sides, and in the process all the soft and fluffy hairs are removed. If for cheapness of production, or other reasons, material is rolled only once, there is left on the other side the raw character of the manufacture; and under this item, that would be deemed by the Customs Department a teased article, and, therefore, a .flannelette. This sort of material gives rise to a great number of difficulties as between importers and the Department. We have already dealt'with cotton and linen goods in a liberal spirit; and I suggest to the Treasurer that he permit this item to be banished from the Tariff so that it may remain amongst the piece goods which we' have already made free. It is unusual, I know, for one who always votes for a revenue Tariff to make such a request. But I know the difficulties which have arisen between importers and the Department; and in view of the fact that this material is used, not by the well-to-do, but by the poorer classes, the proposal of the Treasurer is, in my opinion, an invidious distinction.",25
132,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"Lang) [4.8]. Flannelette is chiefly, if not exclusively, used by the poorer classes. It is imported extensively for tihe manufacture of women's blouses, and for underclothing and nightclothing for both children and adults. It is found warmer than calico, and cheaper than flannel, even of the lightest description. Flannelette of ordinary qualities can be purchased at from 2^d. to 6d. per yard, whereas the cheapest"" flannel costs about 9d. per yard. As to the Treasurer's statement about the injury which flannelette does to children, it may be described in the expressive word "" flam."" Flannelette is said to be very inflammable, but, as a matter of fact, blacksmiths use it in preference to other materials, because they find that if a spark does lodge on it, it can be very easily brushed off, and that other cotton materials have, been found just as inflammable. I find that in 1903 there was imported from the United Kingdom £181,849 worth, and in 1906, £203,669 worth. From Belgium in 1903 there was imported £2,312 worth, and in 1906, £768 worth; from Germany in 1903, £13,209 worth, and in 1906, £33,784 worth; from the . Netherlands in 1903, £2,128 worth, and in 1906 the value was £ 8 , 9 6 5 ; from all other countries, in 1903, £4,091 worth, and in 1906, £6,467 worth. The total importations in 1903 amounted to £203,589 worth,' and in 1906 to £253,653 worth. In 1903, the British imports were 89.3 per cent, of the whole, leaving a little over 10 per cent, of imports from abroad; and in 1906, the British imports amounted to 80.3 per cent, and the foreign imports to 19.7 per cent. If this duty be imposed, the cost of a material for underclothing, which is chiefly used by the poorer classes, will be increased; and the evidence given before, the Tariff Commission, and the report of the Commissioners themselves, supports the view I have < placed before honourable members. Mr. Kirkland, a witness, state'd that the duty had not reduced the imports of flannelette, but had only lowered the quality, while Mr Sharp, a blouse manufacturer, said that if the duty were reduced, people would get better value for their money. In reply to another question, Mr Sharp submitted that the duty, with profits added, constituted a heavy tax upon wage earners, and said that there was scarcely a family amongst this class of the community whose dress was not largely composed of flannelette. The evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission showed that a reduction in the old rate of duty would cause a better material to be placed upon the market, and that, as a result, the masses of the people would secure wearing apparel of superior quality. I would futher point out that the importing charges-apar t from the duty-repre sent a natural protection of 18 per cent. Before I proceed I should like a quorum to be present. [Quorum formed.'] In proof of my statement that the importing charges, apart from the duty, amount to 18 per cent., I wish to quote the follow-ing copy of an invoice for twenty-one cases of flannelette:Invoice value f.o.b. 2i cases-59 4 feet ^419 7 11 Casing ... ... ^13 19 o Freight 45s. per ton, men's ... ... 33 8 Primage, 10 per cent. 3 6 10 Marine insurance on £480 1 6 6 Cartage to ships (on part) ... ... o 12 6 Ship canal dues --- 1 2 11 Cartage from ship 1 1 o Wharfage ... 2 12 6 Stacking ... ... 0 7 0 Buying commission ...

133,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,I wish to call attention to the .state of the Committee [Quorum formed.],26
134,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"I have had to remonstrate with the Treasurer on several occasions previously against his perpetual interference with me when I rise to address the Committee. I do so again, and if he persists in his interruptions, I will prolong my speech accordingly. I regret that my right to address the Committee should be challenged by the Treasurer upon almost every occasion that I rise to my feet. I trust that this will be the last occasion upon which I shall be subjected to that experience. If it is no.t, I shall have to assert my right to speak much more frequently than I have done. At a later stage I shall move that after the words, "" 20 per cent.,"" paragraph F, the words, "" and on and after 14th November, 1907 (General Tariff), 5 per cent. (United Kingdom), free,"" be inserted.  test against the attempt which has been made to prejudice the votes of honourable members by raising the bogy that the use of flannelette is dangerous. As a matter of fact, about 75 per cent, of the children of the Commonwealth wear underclothing made of this material. It is a cheap material, which is largely used by the poorer classes of the community - Probably, if the matter could be probed to the bottom, it would be found that some of the woollen mills are behind the endeavour which is now being made to levy a prohibitive duty upon this article. I am not aware that any more burning accidents have resulted from the use of flannelette than have resulted from the use of' any other material. It seems a piece of absolute villainy to attempt to exclude this article merely because it resembles woollen goods. I ask honourable members to vote upon this paragraph on its merits. S",26
135,Mr EDWARDS,MANUFACTURES,"Oxley) [4.25] - It is not at all clear why the Treasurer wishes to amend the wording of this paragraph. It is well known that it refers exclusively to cotton goods-to flannelette. Why does the Treasurer desire to impose a prohibitive duty upon that material, which is used more by the working classes than by any £S7 »6 8-13.4 3 per cent. other section of the community ? Evidently 2.50 per cent. he desires to penalize those who cannot afford to purchase an article of better quality. Under the old Tariff the duty imposed upon flannelette was 15 per cent., and even that rate was too high. .This material ought to be treated in the same way as other cotton piece goods.",26
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I would prohibit its importation if I had my way. It is an absolute crime to let it come. in.,26
137,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"It is a much greater crime to levy a duty of 25 per cent, upon it.",26
138,Mr EDWARDS,MANUFACTURES,"I am desirous of expediting the consideration of the Tariff in every way that I can, and that is the reason why I have abstained from speaking upon many of the items which have engaged the attention of the Committee. But the Treasurer does not wish to get the Tariff out of the way for a few months yet. He dasires to allow honourable members to uselessly occupy the time of the Committee. Of course, I do not imagine for a moment that we shall complete the consideration of the Tariff by the end of the present year. Our task will more probably be concluded by the middle of next year. I wish to emphasize the fact that the items enumerated in this paragraph refer only to cotton piece goods-to flannelette. Why the Treasurer should desire to levy a prohibitive impost of 25 per cent, upon that article I cannot understand. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of only a 5 per cent. duty. That I think would be a very fair rate. Those who are accustomed to handle flannelette say that it is a fabric composed entirely of cotton. They addThe Tariff Commissioners recommended to include this item in the 5 per cent, list with all other cotton piece goods. We strongly support this recommendation, because cotton piece goods are not made in Australia, nor are they likely to be for long years to come. Flannelette is largely used by the 'workers of Australia, especially in the warmer latitudes, on account of its cheapness and general suitability for shirts, underwear, dresses, &c. Ordinary flannel .worn next to the skin during the hot summer is uncomfortable to large numbers of toilers, and it tends to irritation and skin troubles. The proposed highly increased duty will discourage local making up of the garments. As cotton piece goods have already been placed upon the free list, I claim that flannelette ought to be included in the same category.",26
139,Mr JOHN THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"Cowper) [4.30] - Havin g had considerable experience ih the handling *of piece goods in the warmer districts, I should like to say a few words upon this proposal. Flannelettes have been spoken of as forming the clothing of the poorer classes; but while some kinds of flannelettes are sold very cheaply, and even at as low as 2^d. per yard, the better qualities used for blouses are sold at much higher prices than those which have been mentioned, and are used by all classes of the-community. Flannelette is a cotton material which cannot be palmed off as woollen, and every one knows its nature. As to its use being harmful, and justifying the prohibition of importations, I prefer to take the opinions of housewives to those of medical men, and the best housewives who come into my establishment buy flannelettes all the year round. Flannelette is a material which is used at all times and for all purposes, and I fail to see why it should be dutiable [210] at higher rates than those applying to other cotton goods. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Denison. Flannelette has now come into such general use for children's underclothing, men's shirts, ladies' blouses, and a hundred and one other things, that it can.scarcely be done without.",27
140,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,-The information which we are now getting is so valuable that there should be a quorum to hear it. [Quorum forme<F\.,27
141,Mr JOHN THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"I do not understand why the recommendations of the Tariff Commission on this subject have been disregarded. The importations of flannelette come chiefly from the Old Country. I do not intend to go into figures on the subject, seeing that that has been done by the honourable member for Lang; but of thetotal importations, £253,653, only a comparatively small quantity comes from foreign parts, £49,669, the balance coming from the United Kingdom. I wish to emphasize the recommendations of the Tariff. Commission, which weresigned by all the members, protectionists and free-tradersThe chief reasons which induced your Commissioners to recommend the reduction of the duty on flannelette from 15 per cent, to 5 per cent, were(1) The great irritation to importers caused by the opening up of cases containing flannelette and other cotton goods; (2) The suitability of flannelette as a material for wearing apparel, especially in the tropical portions of the Commonwealth; (3) The fact that no special import duty is placed on kerosene, methylated spirits, celluloid, or firearms, because of the danger attached to the careless use of such commodities. As to the statement that the article should not be imported because it is inflammable, I do not think that, because a few accidents have been caused by the ignition of flannelette clothing, we should discriminate between flannelette and other cotton goods in the rates of duty. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [4.36] We have had during the progress of these discussions some very anomalous situations, and the present is not the least curious of them. I feel that the reason given by the Treasurer for imposing practically prohibitive duties on flannelette is altogether unsatisfactory, and I agree with the last speaker that the best judges of the value of a material of this kind are the housewives of Australia, who use it largely fov clothing, especially for the night clothing of children. The fact that they use it so largely shows that they consider it a valuable fabric, and is a reason why its importation should not be prohibited, because we cannot make it here. As between allowing flannelette to be imported free and imposing duties of 20 and 25 per cent, on it, I would choose the former course, for the reasons which I have stated. this instance I am influenced by the consideration which prompted me when voting on the last item, the need of revenue on the part of the smaller States. Honourable members who represent States whose revenues have enormously increased as the result of Federation may lightly brush aside a consideration of this sort, but it is a serious one to those who represent States whose revenues have materially diminished since the Union. As the honourable member for Bass interjected not very long ago, in this instance the interests of one's own State must be considered first. It may be objected that the revenue needs of a State like Queensland need not be greatly regarded at the present time, because it is enjoying a surplus : but these surpluses are due to a series of exceptionally good seasons, and when bad seasons return the revenue will f all , as it did two or three years age, when, as I know from mv experience as a Minister, the Queensland as well as other Governments were hard pressed to obtain monev to pay their way. and huge deficits resulted. While I would vote to admit flannelette freerather than impose prohibitive duties .upon its importation, I think that we might reasonably impose duties of 10 and s per cent., and therefore I shall vote against the amendment to make the general rate 5 per cent., in the hope that, if it be defeated, I shall have an opportunity to move to make the general rate 10 per cent., and that against the United Kingdom 5 per cent.",27
142,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,"Perth) [4.41] - I do not agree with those who hold the opinion that flannelette is a harmless and beneficial dress material, nor am I in sympathy with the Minister in proposing high duties to prevent its importation. Flannelette is such a cheap material in comparison with flannel that the only effect of imposing duties upon it must be to increase its price; while the argument that the housewives and mothers of Australia must know what is the best wear for themselves and their children has no weight with me, because, in my opinion, the wives of working men must often consider first of all the state of their purse, and, finding in flannelette an article having the appearance of flannel and pleasant to the touch, they do not inquire closely into its hygienic qualities. In a hot climate the only safe wear for underclothing is material composed largely of wool, which will absorb perspiration and prevent chills. I attribute the pneumonia and similar diseases which are so frequent But in in Victoria to the general wearing of flannelette in a climate where changes are very sudden. Undoubtedly flannelette was invented and named, to convey the impression that it is a woollen fabric, although, as a matter of fact, it is made wholly of cotton, with a teased surface, which does not add to its wearing qualities, and almost entirely disappears on the first washing.",28
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Does the honourable member say that flannelette is not warmer than ordinary cotton?,28
144,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,"It is not warmer, because it is only cotton. For many years I have given attention to accidents arising from the ignition of clothing, many of which proved fatal. One or two of these have come closely under my own observation, and in all cases in which I could obtain positive information as to the clothing worn, I have found that it was flannelette that had taken fire. A new piece of flannelette, on a match being applied to it , flares up like gunpowder. It is little short of criminal for women to clothe their children in this particularly inflammable substance, and to allow them when so clothed to stand near a fire, or to play with matches.",28
145,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,But they do it.,28
146,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,"I know that they do. The parents of a child who is burnt in such circumstances are guilty of criminal negligence. The trouble undoubtedly lies in the fact that flannelette is bought by many women under the impression that it contains a percentage of wool. I have met many women who held that 'belief, and have even heard of shopmen who recommended its use, inferring that it was a mixture of wool and cotton. I should be glad to see its use restricted as much as possible; but I recognise that a hish duty, unless it approaches a prohibitive - rate, will not shut it out. It is so cheap that even if a duty be imposed, it will be used to almost as great an extent as if it were on the free list. I should like the name of this material to be altered from "" flannelette "" to ""cottonette."" Certain firms manufacture a flannelette which, as the result of chemical treatment, is practically inflamuse mable. If a duty is to be imposed, Aye ought to differentiate between flannelette of that class and the more dangerous variety.",28
147,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,I made that suggestion three years ago.,29
148,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,I am glad to hear it.,29
149,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,What is the difference between the prices of the two kinds flannelette ?,29
150,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,"It is insignificant. of whom have ""fads."" The chemical' process is not expensive, results, I believe, in making the article much safer than it would otherwise be ",29
151,Colonel FOXTON,MANUFACTURES,Eve n after the flanwithout nelette has been washed?,29
152,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,"I cannot say. That wise is a question which would have to be vestigated by the Customs authorities. is possible that the non-inflammable qualitv given to this material by the chemical cess to which I have referred, would disappear after washing. I would, at any warmer. rate, commend to the Government the desirableness of insisting on an alteration the name, and, if a duty is to be imposed, of differentiating between the two classes flannelette which I have mentioned. I am certainly with them' in the desire that use of flannelette in Australia shall stricted as much as possible, but I cannot agree with them that the relatively high duty which they propose would achieve desired object.",29
153,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"Boothby) [4-49]-- arguments It is now too late to talk about altering the name of this material. It is universally known as flannelette, and although it might be imported as "" cottonette,"" it would tinue to be sold to retailers and the general public under its old name. We have no power to follow up importations to prevent their being retailed as flannelette, and. a matter of fact, I believe that very people are misled by the term. Almost every one knows that is consists only cotton. In my ignorance, I was impressed with the statements made during the sideration of the last Tariff as to the jurious nature of flannelette, and went home fired with an enthusiasm to prevent its use. When I mentioned the matter to to have said my wife, however, she very quickly told me that I knew* absolutely nothing about it ; present. that, from her experience in rearing a familv, she had no hesitation in saying that flannelette, in many cases, was suitable for children's wear, and that its [210]- 2 should be encouraged rather than prohibited. It is a low-priced article, largely used for children's clothing, is easily cleaned, and, generally speaking, is not injurious.",29
154,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,That is not the view of medical men.,29
155,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"In regard to some of these matters I would sooner be guided of by the views of the mothers of our families than by those of medical men, many No sufficient and ground has been shown for imposing such a high revenue duty as'25 per cent. The duty will add to the cost of the material causing its use to be reduced. It will simply mean that the very poorest sections of the community, who would otheruse flannelette, will have to use other incotton goods that have not a teased surI t face. The effect of the teased or rough surface is to make the material slightly prowarmer than ordinary cotton goods are.",29
156,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,Flannelett e only feels,29
157,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"If we can enable of the people to obtain, at a cheap rate, air article which, at all events, feels warm, and of cannot be said to be injurious, we shall do well. We shall act wisely in dealing with the flannelette as we have with other cotton be regoods, by providing. that imports from foreign countries shall be dutiable at 5 per cent, whilst those coming from the United the Kingdom shall be free. The honourable member for Denison advanced some strong as to the difficulty of differentiating between one class of cotton goods and another. By adding to the difficulties of interpreting the Tariff, we run the risk of conlosing a good deal of revenue, and I cer* tainlv think that no sufficient reason has been adduced for imposing this high duty.",29
158,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea as surer) [4.56] - Havin g listened to this infewteresting and somewhat anomalous discussion, I propose now to quote a statementof made by the right honourable member for Adelaide, showing the reasons which actuconated the Government of which he was a inMinister in proposing a duty on flannelette under the first Federal Tariff. At page 8223 of Hansard, Vol. VI . . he is reported",29
159,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,There is not a quorum [Quorum formed.],29
160,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"The right honmost orable member for Adelaide saidThe reason is that flannelette is a fraud. It is an imitation of wool, and is disposed of under circumstances in which many people mistake for the more valuable article, with results gether to be deplored. The Government sympafifteen years. thize with all the observations which f e l l from the honourable member for the Grampians. Flannelette is hirdily dangerous, and half deaths from burnings are occasioned wearing this material. So far from possessing the quality of flannel in regard to warmth and comfort, flannelette after being washed no warmth, but exposes the wearer to danger disease due to changes of temperature.",29
161,Mr HUGHES,MANUFACTURES,Why not keep it out altogether?,30
162,Mr KINGSTON,MANUFACTURES,"There is a great deal be said in favour of keeping it out, and step in that direction is to subject it to a higher duty. The Comptroller-General speaks warmly in support of the duty, pointing out nelette largely competes with our staple production here, V sold to people who believe it to be wool, ancl is so dangerous again coroners have emphasized the risk of wearing it, especially to young children and infants. Anybody taking a portion of flannelette setting a light to it wil l be astonished rapidity with which it blazes, and the difficulty of extinguishing the flames before absolutely consumed. Under the circumstances, the Government are justified in going to length they propose, if not in adopting more dustry. stringent measures. - I have made this quotation in order to show why we differentiated in the first Federal Tariff between flannelette and ordinary cotton piece goods",30
163,Sir JOHN FORREST,MANUFACTURES,"The Treasurer proposes an increase pn the Kingston Tariff. Sir ^ y . ILLIAM LYNE - Yes ; and I agree with what has been said by coroners in very many cases, namely, that the use of flannelette ought to be prohibited. This duty is not proposed with a view, to protecting any industry, but only with a view to restricting importations. Mr BATCHELOR This is sentimentalism run mad !",30
164,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Nonsens e ! The duty, is proposed on the recommendation of those who know, perhaps, more than do any honourable members here on the subject. So far, the only opponents of the duty that [ have observed are those who are interested in the trade-thos e who are interested in the business of importing. I allude to the honourable member for Denison.",30
165,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,Is the Treasurer in order in imputing dishonourable motives to honourable members by saying that they are interested in a business way in connection with the importation of flannelette?,30
166,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I did not sav anything of the kind.,30
167,Mr EDWARDS,MANUFACTURES,"I wish distinctly to saythat I am not interested in the flannelette business. The Treasurer pointed at me, and mentioned the honourable member for it Denison. Let me say that I have not been altointerested in any business for the last",30
168,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,I must ask the the Treasurer to withdraw the remark which is through considered offensive.,30
169,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I withdraw the gives 'remark. Honourable tnembersi who make and speeches in favour of flannelette are mainly those who have been, or are, interested in the business; and I was under the impresto sion that the honourable member for Oxley one was still interested. I have read what the honourable member for Adelaide said when that flanMinister of Trade and Customs.",30
170,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURES,Is he an authority on that over and over flannelette ?,30
171,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I know that the honourable member for Adelaide then spoke and on the authority of professional men; and at the if he could he would have prohibited the the article is importation of flannelette.,30
172,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURES,For the reason that the the importation interfered with the flannel in,30
173,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Surely the honourable member does not say that that was the motive of the honourable member for Adelaide ?,30
174,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURES,He said so in the extract which has just been read.,30
175,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member forAdelaide was then quoting the Comptroller-General, and the duty was then proposed, not to protect any industry, but to protect the public. Statistics show that there are more childern destroyed by fire through wearing flannelette ",30
176,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,That is really because nearly all children wear flannelette. More people die in their beds than anywhere else.,30
177,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"A little while ago I had a conversation with Mr Mark Foy in Sydney, and he, who has had : great experience, told me that flannelette was one of the most dangerous materials imported.",30
178,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,He is interested in the trade.,30
179,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I know, but he is interested in promoting the importation of flannelette. Mr Foy, moreover, told me that if there was a Tariff to check the importation of this material we should find the'importation of flannel increase.",30
180,Mr TILLEY BROWN,MANUFACTURES,What duties does the Treasurer want-1 0 and 5 per cent. ?,30
181,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"This is different from the protective duties for which I have fought in this T a r if f ; and I am quite prepared to accept a lower duty if the Committee so desire. Personally, I should like to see the duty kept high for the reasons I have given; but, if the Committee wish for a lower duty, I am prepared to meet them-, though I hope it will not be proposed to have a duty of 5 per cent. The revenue derived from this duty is about £40,000 per annum.",30
182,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,"Hunter) [5.9] - There are many things which the Treasurer can do graciously, but if there is one that he can do more graciouslv than another it is to back down on his proposals. If he should stand to his guns on any item, it is on this item, from his own point of view. The honourable gentleman tells us that this is a deleterious article, and dangerous to life, and, therefore, should bear a high duty; and yet he tells us that the high duties he proposes will not be by any mean's prohibitive.",31
183,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I did not say anything of the kind.,31
184,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,"That was my impression from the Treasurer's remark?. On turning up the report signed by both sections of the Tariff Commission, I find a very strong argument in favour of the imposition of this particular duty-that is, from the Treasurer's point of view. Mr Williams, who is managing director of a Victorian woollen mill, said in his evidence that the duty on flannelette should be doubled, for the purpose of prohibiting material which is dangerous and unhealthy. He further said that in the beginning flannelette was made with the object of so resembling flannel that the general public could not tefl the difference. The honourable member for Adelaide, when Minister of Trade and Customs, told us exactlv the same thing-tha tflanneletteis a fraud and a deception. The witness, Williams, regarded flannelette as a source of danger to the wearer on account of its inflammability, and pointed out that, in the opinion of medical men, those who use flannelette for underwear are very liable to catch cold. This witness further said that those who wear coloured flannelette run great risk of blood poisoning from, the dye if the skin beoomes broken. Notwithstanding this evidence, the members of the Commission actually recommended that the duty on flannelette should be reduced from 15 per cent, to 5 per cent. The honourable member for Perth has so clearly and distinctly placed the case before the Committee that I need not say more from the point of view he presented. I quite recognise the fact that 1 - flanneletteis dangerous, owing to its high inflammability; and we can realise the risk which is run when a small child is surrounded with a material which, when ignited, goes off like gunpowder. 'Three years ago, on the 7 th December, I asked the then Prime Minister, the honourable member for East Sydney, the following questionWhether in view of the fact of the alarming prevalence of burning accidents caused by the wearing of a highly inflammable material known as "" flannelette "" he will bring the matter under the notice of the Tariff Commission, and recommend that a flannelette rendered non-inflammable by special treatment be admitted at a reduced rate of duty, in. order to discourage the use of the highly inflammable material so generally in use? Honourable members will note that his reply was very different from the replies I am accustomed to receive from the Treasury Benches to-dayI beg to say, in reply to my honourable friend, that this matter will receive attention. Flannelette is dangerous to life much in the same way as are cheap pea-rifles; and if I could I would prevent, to some extent, its use. I recognise, however, that it is not our duty to tinker with the matter, which is one that might be more satisfactorily dealt with by the States themselves. I see no method by which we can absolutely prohibit the use of the material, because a prohibitive duty would simply encourage the manufacture of flannelette here. As a consistent free-trader, I shall support a duty of 5 per cent, under the General Tariff, and will vote in favour of admitting the manufactures of the United Kingdom free.",31
185,Mr HANS IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"Grampians) [5.15] - I should like the Treasurer to agree to the suggestion of the honourable member for Brisbane to make the goods enumerated in this paragraph dutiable at 10 per cent, under the General Tariff, and at 5 per cent, under the Tariff of the United Kingdom. * I recognise that if we desire to encourage the use of flannel in preference to flannelette, we should have reduced the rate levied upon the cheaper kind of flannel. I think it may reasonably be urged that fully 70 or 80 per cent, of the working classes use flannelette, and, under these circumstances, I fail to see why it should be taxable at 25 per cent., which is practicallv a prohibitive impost.",31
186,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"Yarra) [5.18] - If the Treasurer persists in retaining the duties levied upon this item, I shall support him, because I believe that, from the stand-point of its inflammability, flannelette is a dangerous material to wear. Mr % JOSEPH COOK - Does the honourable member think that its use is dangerous from any other stand-point?",31
187,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"Yes . I believe that if children get wet, the wearing of flannelette next to the skin is' much more dangerous than is the wearing of flannel. I shall support the proposal of the Treasurer, and, if it be defeated, I shall vote in favour of admitting these articles free.",32
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Parramatta) [5.19] - It is all very well for the honourable member for Yarra to affirm that it is better to wear woollen garments next to the skin than it is to wearflannelettegarments. Nobody will seriously question that statement. But the honourable member must know that the great majority of the poorer classes cannot afford to purchase woollens for their large families. That is the whole point at issue. It is not a question as between the use of flannelette and that of flannel, but as between the use of flannelette and other kinds of cotton. As the honourable member for North Sydney reminds me, the position taken up by the Treasurer is quite an illogical one. If the use of flannelette be dangerous, and if the article is a fraud, as is alleged, why does the Treasurer propose to admit it at a lower rate than that which has been imposed upon woollens? Of course, he has told us that the duty proposed is a revenue duty, pure and simple. It is because it was a revenue duty that I proposed a reduction in the last paragraph, and it is for that reason that I shall support a reduction on the duty now_Jjpfore us. I have no sympathy whatever with the rhorJomontade of the honourable member for South Sydney, who has declaimed against the imposition of revenue duties, and who has affirmed that the object of levying them is to avert direct taxation. The fact is that we have an overflowing Treasury just now, and if the Tariff be passed in anything like its present form, that elasticity and buoyancy will continue.",32
189,Mr STORRER,MANUFACTURES,Fro m where shall we obtain the money with which to pay old age pensions?,32
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,I would remind the honourable member that in voting against this duty we are not casting the revenue which would he derived from it into the sea. It will still be available for the purposes of old-age pensions if we should require it.,32
191,Mr STORRER,MANUFACTURES,Will the honourable member support the imposition of special duties for the payment of old-age pensions ?,32
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"I am under the impression that the honourable member voted for the Bill authorizing the imposition of special duties for that purpose in the last Parliament. I do not at all sympathize with the tirade which was indulged in by the honourable member for South Sydney. I wishthat he were in the chamber now, because another speech of the kind that he delivered this afternoon might possibly bring the Treasurer to heel. However, in his absence we must endeavour to impress the Treasurer with the reasonableness of the reduction that has been suggested. My experience is that flannelette is superior in every way to cotton. Of course, nobody has ever asserted that it is equal to woollen goods. But the point that we have to remember is that the poorer sections of the community cannot afford to purchase it. I shall support the imposition of a lower rate of duty thanthat proposed by the Treasurer.",32
193,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,Lang) [5.25] - I understand that the Treasurer has insinuated that in moving for a reduction of this 'duty some honourable members upon this side of the chamber,32
194,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,Order 1 The honourable member must not pursue that subject.,32
195,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,My attention has been called to the fact that the Treasurer has inferred that I am interested in flannelette. I wish to say that I have no interest whatever-financia l or otherwisein the production of that article.,32

202,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Never .,34
203,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MANUFACTURES,"I shall point out a specific instance in which this power has been so used. In the comparative table circulated amongst honourable members, we have the statement that this item was free under the ""Tariff of 1902 and amending Acts."" Even if that be so, it was not free under the regulations issued by the Department. Section 138 of the Customs Act provides that if an article can be classed under two headings in the Tariff the higher of the duties applicable shall be charged. Where an article is free under the Tariff, that provision cannot be applied; nevertheless an instance-whic h perhaps is only one of many to which reference might be made - ha s come under my notice, where a Minister, acting as a strong protectionist, availed himself of this provision to almost prohibit the importation of an article which the Parliament of 1902 had declared should be absolutely free. I allude to the collection of duty on wadding. Wadding appears among the list of special exemptions in the Tariff Act of 1902, and was so dealt with in order that manufacturers of clothing should be able to obtain it free of duty. When my opinion was asked by the Customs Department as to what was the definition of an article that was put before me, I at once declared it to be "" wadding,"" and said that as such it should be free. Almost immediately afterwards, however, the then Minister declared that it came' under the denomination of ""cotton piece-goods.""",34
204,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,Whic h Minister did that?,34
205,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MANUFACTURES,"That point is immaterial. It is absolutely necessary that the Minister of Trade and Customs should have the power conferred upon him by section 138 of the Customs Act; but I hope that the present Minister of Trade and Customs will not be induced to avail himself of it in order to impose a duty on an article which has been placed on the free list. In the Tariff of 1902, wadding appeared in the list of exemptions, yet under a regulation issued by the Customs Department duty has been collected on it as cotton piece goods.",34
206,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"It is very doubtful if the collection of the duty was legal. Sir PHIL IP FYSH - Ver y doubtful. During the last few months we have had collected in Western Australia a lower duty in respect of certain goods than has been collected in other States, this differentiation being due to their having arrived at Fremantle the day before the new Tariff came into operation. Honourable members will recognise how. difficult it is for the mercantile community to protect themselves against such idiosyncrasies without instituting legal proceedings against an all-powerful Government. Although right mav be on the side of the mercantile community, the power remains in the hands of the Ministry by subsequent enactment to .declare the act complained of to be legal.",34
207,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,It is unfair to force them into protracted litigation.,34
208,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MANUFACTURES,"It is. I have called attention to this fact in the hope that the Ministry will exercise more discretion with respect to the operation of the section of the Customs Act which I have mentioned. I am glad that the Treasurer proposes to make this item free. I had made a note of the fact that it ought to be on the free list, and I thought that, in the absence of a statement, that under the Customs regulations wadding has been dutiable, the statement in the comparative table that, under the Tariff of 1902,- and amending Acts, it has been free, would be misleading.",34
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Hume-Trea surer) [5.55] - I do not know to what Minister the honourable member for Denison has referred; but my experience is that a Minister in dealing with such matters always acts on the recommendation of his officers.,34
210,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MANUFACTURES,The decision to which I have referred was contrary to the recommendation of the officers of the Department.,34
211,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I would far sooner trust my own officers than an interested partyI do not know to whom the honourable member refers.,34
212,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,He did not refer to the honourable member.,34
213,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"When I was Minister of Trade and Customs I always acted on the recommendation of my officers'. I do not know the exact nature of the case to which the honourable member for Denison has referred, but if the regulation was published during my occupancy of the office of Minister of Trade and CusGermany. toms, it was upon the strong recommendaton tion of the officers of the Department. presume that whatever Minister was responsible, lie was guided by the recomhere? mendation of his officers.",34
214,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MANUFACTURES,No .,35
215,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I repeat that whilst Minister of Trade and Customs, I never took action without having behind the strength of the recommendation of my bear expense. officers. What does a Minister know as to the particular heading under which tain goods should be classed? I do not know anything about fabrics, and when I free. have had submitted to me various articles with a request that I should determine out Mr. under which heading of the Tariff they ordinarythat were dutiable, I have always, or nearly always, acted upon the advice of my officers. When I have not done so, it has been because there seemed to me to be good reasons for adopting a different course.",35
216,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,"Hunter) [5.58] - I draw a marked distinction between wadding and cotton wool, and wish to know how cotton wool is to be classified. Wadding is used chiefly for padding dresses and other clothes, but there are various of cotton wool used in surgery. We have the ordinary cotton wool, and sorbent cotton wool which is specially prepared for use in surgical, operations. wish to know whether ' absorbent cotton wool is to be free or is to be dutiable at. 10 per cent, under the heading of "" surgical appliances,"" in which ""medicated agreed to. wool"" is included. Medicated wool is nothing more nor less than cotton wool.",35
217,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I propose to make this item free, and if there is any doubt as to the classification of medicated it would be better for the honourable ber to discuss the matter when. we come to the item dealing with it ",35
218,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,The question is wheoutput ther or not the item with which we now dealing covers cotton wool used for remedying. surgical purposes.,35

220,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,"Nearl y all our supcamels-hair plies of surgical wool are obtained from - foreign countries: the English manufacknow turers being unable to supply the local . market. We obtain a great deal of our supof plies from the United States of America I am speaking of surgical cotwool, which, I am sure, will not be I made in Australia for many years to come.",35
221,Mr STORRER,MANUFACTURES,Why cannot it be made,35
222,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,"Because it has to be prepared in a way which at present is impossible in this country. It is wool used, in many instances, by poor people at a time me when, owing to sickness, they are unable to",35
223,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"This is not a protective cerduty if the cotton wool cannot be made here. The Minister has agreed to make it LIDDELL - What I desire to point is there is a distinction between wadding and surgical cotton wool. Amendment agreed to. Item 126 (Bunting, etc.) agreed to.

227,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Perhaps it would be better if the honourable member were to let me have the list. I have not heard of it before, and I should like to have it analyzed, in order to see what effect the placing of these articles on the free list might have, and where, if it be so desired, they could be placed in the Tariff.  with which I submit this list to the .Minister.

Canvas and Duck, Tent Sail and Tarpaulin Makers', Free.",36
228,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,North Sydney) [6.13] - I suggest that rugs for covering cattle ought to be included in this item.,36
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Thos e rugs are made of canvas.,36
230,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"Tents , sails, and tarpaulins are made here, and the object of this item is to free the materials of which these are made. I make the suggestion in order to bring about equality; and, as tarpaulins are used to cover goods, so are canvas rugs to cover cattle, and I desire to free the canvas of which they are made. I do not altogether approve of this method of exempting goods from the payment of duty, because I recognise that it is a dangerous principle to make an article dutiable 'Or free according to the use to which it is to be put. But if we are to make any Exemptions, it is absurd to place upon the .free list material which is used for covering goods, and to subject to duty material which is used for covering cattle. I suggest that after the word "" s a i l "" the word "" rug "" be inserted.",36
231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume- Trea. surer) [6.18] - I move That the words "" tent sail and tarpaulin; - tinkers'"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" not suitable for apparel.""",36
232,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,I will accept that amendment.,36
233,Mr STORRER,MANUFACTURES,Bass) [6.19] - I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that the same allowance should.be madein the case of rugs used for stock that ismade in the case of tarpaulins. But it seems to me that so many articles are being; placed upon the free list that we might with advantage frame an entirely newTariff. If the Treasurer agrees to the suggestion of the honourable member for NorthSydney he will probably lose more revenue than he. anticipates. I think that he proposes to give away altogether too much.,36
234,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,Melbourne Ports). [6.20] - Do I understand that the Treasurer has agreed to place canvas which isused for wearing apparel upon the freelist?',36
235,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,No .,36
236,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,"I would point out that canvas is not made in the Commonwealth. Certainly we shall manufacturecotton goods in Australia before we shall produce canvas. Consequently, I fail to see why the wearers of canvas should bespecially penalized.",36
237,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,"Corangamite) [6.21] I would point out that it is not desirable to add any words to this item. Canvas andi duck are largely used in the making of sails, tarpaulins, rugs, waterbags, &c. Inaddition, certain qualities of this material 1 are used in the manufacture of clothing, and these, I think, should be placed upon the free list. They are merely used to> dress clothing, in order to make it stiffer. * The item, as it now stands,' will meet therequirements of all the trades which usecanvas and duck as their raw material.",36
238,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"North Svdney) [6.25] - The amendment of the Treasurer, if adopted, will involve practically no loss of revenue, because, underthe old Tariff, canvas and duck were admitted free, with the exception of thecanvas used by tarpaulin-makers.

242,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"South Sydney) [6.26] I support the inclusion in this item of book-' binders' cloth. I do not think that it should be limited to that kind of cloth which is akin to hessian. We admit books free, and it seems very hard that a man who wishes to produce a book in Australia should be required to pay duty upon his raw material.",37

244,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,"Corangamite) [6.28] - I would point out that certain kinds of coverings used for the decoration of furniture, and which are not manufactured in Australia, come under this heading. They consist generally of fringes, and are used chiefly by upholsterers. Perhaps the honourable member for Bass is in the position to give the Committee some information upon the subject. Item agreed to.",37
245,Unknown,MANUFACTURES,"Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 7.45 p.m. Item 133. Socks and Stockings, Woollen, with or without Silk or other ornamentation, ad val. (General Tariff), 30 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 25 per cent.",37
246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Trea surer) [7.45] - The Committee will see that items 133, 134, and 135 all deal with socks and stockings, and, as it has been represented to me by importers and the Department that this differentiation causes great expense and confusion, I propose to make all socks and stockings dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent. This can be done by negativing items 134 and 135, and making item 133 readSocks and Stockings of all kinds for human attire, ad val. (General Tariff), 25 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 20 per cent. The rates which I suggest are lower than the average of the rates now being levied, the rates for woollen goods being 30 and 25 per cent.; for silk goods, 30 and 20 per cent.; and for cotton goods, 25 and 15 per cent. It has been found extremely difficult in some cases to distinguish cotton from woollen socks, and generally the differentiation causes trouble to both importers and the Department. I produce samples of stockings supplied to the Railway Department by Messrs. Yule and Company, of South Melbourne. ' I move That after the word ""stockings"" the words "" woollen, with or without silk or other ornamentation "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof. the words "" of all kinds for human attire, ad val. (General Tariff), 25 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 20 per cent.,"" be inserted.  Minister has forestalled me in this matter, as, in accordance with a request from the trade in Sydney and in Adelaide, I intended to move to bring all classes of socks and stockings under the one heading. I think, however, that the rates proposed by the honourable gentleman are altogether too high, seeing that under the old Tariff the duty was only 15 per cent. Although socks - and stockings are manufactured in Australia, I do not think that silken goods of this class are made here. In 1903 the industry employed 10 males and 197 females; whereas in 1906. it - employed 20 males and 223 females. In view of those facts, it does not seem to need more protection, and therefore I wish to move to reduce the rates to 20 and 15 per cent.",37
247,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,"To give the honourable member an opportunity to do that, I shall simply put the first part of the Minister's amendment: That the words "" of all kinds .for human attire"" be inserted.",37
248,Mr EDWARDS,MANUFACTURES,"Oxley) [7.54] - I am glad that the Treasurer proposes to bring all kinds of socks and stockings under one heading. By doing so he will simplify matters for - importers, and make things easier for the Customs officials, it being now very difficult to discriminate in some cases between one class of goods and another. Queensland importers have suggested to me that socks and stockings should be all put in one item, and made dutiable at 15 per cent., except that knitted woollen goods, which can be made in Australia, should be dutiable at. 25 per cent. I regard the rates proposed by the Ministeras too high, and shall therefore support the suggested amendment of the honourable member for Grey.",37
249,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"Illawarra) [7.56] - The rates proposed by the Treasurer are altogether too high in view of the state of the industry, but the honourable gentleman is absolutely ignorant of the position of affairs. That is a strong declaration, but if he objects to it I invite him to justify his proposals. Probably, as on other occasions, he will take no notice of my challenge, because he is not prepared to take the action which I suggest. He knows nothing at all about these matters, and, as he gives the Committee no information, I feel bound to put before it the findings arrived at by the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission on the sworn evidence which they heard on this subject.",38
250,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,We all have copies of the Commission's reports.,38
251,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"No . 66 Bourke-street' has been remarkable for the protectionist ideas with which it has been associated, but the honourable member is unable to justify these duties. I invited him last night to justify other duties when the Treasurer was unable to do so.",38
252,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member has been sufficiently insulting.,38
253,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"I do not wish to be inmission continuessulting, but I am bound to be outspoken, so that the Committee and the country may about know exactly how matters stand. The obvious exaggerationTreasurer cannot have read the recommendations and conclusions of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission, because, had he done so, he would not have the proposals which have been put before us. On this subject they found thatThe requests' for higher duties on woollen socks and stockings were largely based on the alleged industrial disabilities in Australia compared with importing countries. When, however, specific proof of this was sought, the Commission was supplied with the usual cut-and-dried general statements regarding' wages and hours - of labour. These, on cross-examination, were supplemented with statements which, on account of their conflicting nature, are of little value as evidence. A remarkable feature of the investigations of the Tariff Commission was that a very large number of manufacturers who were - examined by us, and complained that they laboured under certain disabilities, absolutely failed to justify their position. The Minister should be prepared to explain the reason for the proposed increase. If the Committee intends to vote for this dutyon a statement made by the Treasurer, which really throws no light on the subject, our position as legislators is a hopeless one. Surely honourable members on all sides areentitled to know why they are asked to vote for this duty. Is any honourable member prepared to support a position taken up by the Treasurer, which he himself cannot justify. He knows nothing about the matter, and even with the assistance of his officers, who are at hand, can offer no reasonable explanation for his proposal. The treatment meted out to me in this connection as a member of the Tariff Commission is on all-fours with that which all the free-trade members of it have received at the hands of the Ministry. Are the reports of the Commission, the preparation of - which involved such a great expenditure of time and money, to be set aside as so much waste paper? It appears that they are. Like the Treasurer, the Postmaster-General, who certainly ought to be able to offer some justification for the position taken up by the Government, as well as the Minister of Trade and Customs and the Government Whip, remain silent. Have we reached a stage in our history when a Ministry, by mere force of numbers, can carry any proposal that it chooses to make without offering any reason for it? The report of the free-trade section of the ComOne witness declared that the wages cost was 50 per cent, of the value of the goods-a n Any honourable member who knows anything about the hosiery trade will recognise that made it was an obvious exaggerationAnother stated that it cost 16 per cent, more to manufacture here than in England, and 12 per cent, of this total was accounted for by the difference in wages. The same witness said that the proportion of wages to output in his factory was roughly about 25 per cent. A third witness said that if his firm sold ^3,000 of goods, wages would approximately run to ^1,000. In the absence of carefully prepared figures and solid facts, which would probably have been readily adduced in support of the request for higher duties had they been available, we are obliged to deduce the labour cost in this, as in many other cases, from definite statements made in relation to other phases of the general subject Taking the manufacturers' price of the lower class goods referred to as averaging 8s. per dozen and that of the superior as 15s., and the weekly wages of the worker as 15s., which is a. decidedly nigh figure (see Factory Inspectors'' reports), a simple calculation shows that the labour cost of knitting these goods works out in respect of both classes at 12 per cent. If we allow another 6 per cent, for the additional labour of finishing, & c , .it will be seen that the present duty almost covers the entire labour cost. Since the old duty almost covered the entire labour cost, how can it be contended that a higher duty is necessary? The principal claim made by those engaged in various industries was that duties should be imposed to make good the difference between the labour cost in Australia and in the competing countries. If the Treasurer is not prepared to show that a higher duty than 12 per cent, is necessary to cover the difference between the labour cost in connection with this industry in Australia and other countries, we .shall, be fully justified in. voting for a lower duty than he proposes. Opposition desire that Australian industries shall flourish and prosper; but surely we insult the workers of Australia when we suggest that even if we protect them to the extent necessary to make good the difference between the wages cost, they cannot compete with the workers in England and Europe. In view of these facts, the Cofn. mittee should seriouslv consider whether it is necessary to impose this duty.",38
254,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"Yarra) [8.10] - The honourable member for Illawarra has quoted from the report of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission, but has failed to deal with the other side of the question. In 1906, woollen socks and stockings of the value of ^311,4r2 were imported into Australia, whilst our importations of cotton socks and stockinrrs were valued at £150,000. In round figures, £ 4 6 0 . 0 0 0 worth of cotton and woollen socks and stockings were imported last year. honourable member for Illawarra, like other honourable members, is unable to state what is the output of the hosiery trade in Australia. He has referred us fo the report of the Chief Inspector of Factories in Victoria, and assuming that it correctly sets forth the rates of wages paid in the trade, and that the employees work all the year round, we find that the whole of the operatives in this State last year received ,£.15,000 by way of wages. If the wages cost represents one-third of the total cost of production, then the output of hosiery in this State last year was of the value of only £ 4 5 , 0 0 0.  in making certain apparel, as well as and stockings.",39
255,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"That would show that the output of socks was even less than 1I have suggested. Victorian hosiery manu facturers alone appeared before the Commission, and I do not know that the industry is in existence in the other States. ] understand that at least 95 per cent, of the woollen hosiery used in Australia todav is imported. The Treasurer was ill advised in reducing the duty on imports from the United Kingdom to' 20 per cent. That will practically be the duty collected on all woollen hosiery imported into Australia, since out of a total importation of £3.11,000 worth last vear, .£305,000 worth came from Great Britain. On the other hand, two-thirds of our importations of cotton socks and stockings came from GerThe many. I trust that the duty will not be further reduced. .There is another aspect of this question which. certainly deserves consideration, and particularly in connection with the new protection proposals. I refer to the fact that warehousemen and large shopkeepers in Victoria import large quantities of yarn for distribution amongst home workers. This results in some of the worse sweating conditions that could possibly exist in any industry.",39
256,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,In Victoria?,39
257,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"Yes , in Victoria. We have had a case before the Law Courts in connection with home workers in the clothing trade, in which there is a"" Wages Board, and it was proved that the work was being done at less than the Wages Board rates, but there is no Wages Board in connection with the industry under discussion.",39
258,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"Is there any reason for that ? The Mr TUDOR - The reason is the presence of a number of honourable members in the State Legislature who would probably support the right honourable member, opposing the introduction of Wages Boards into every trade.",39
259,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,Is there any necessity for that sort of personality ?,39
260,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"Eve n if there were a Wages Board, there is always much greater - difficulty in seeing that a determination is carried .out in the case of home workers than there is in the case of factory workers. We ought to give fair protection to this industry, and, if possible, see that, under the new protection proposals, the. workers obtain their share of the benefits. This socks particular line is bound up with the question of varns.",39
261,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,Ge t the Government to collect the Excise now.,40
262,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,I wish we could; and I hope we shall have the support of the honourable member in this connection.,40
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Hav e our support to close up factories?,40
264,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"Yes , if fair wages are not paid. On the hustings I said I would do my best to obtain protection for workers; and I hope that in this industry the workers as well as the manufacturer will be considered. Consideration to the workers can only be obtained, as the right honourable member for East Sydney adwho mitted the other night, by means of such proposal as that suggested by the Labour Party.",40
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,How do we prosell tect industries if we shut factories up?,40
266,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"The factories will not be shut up for very long. I regret that the Treasurer has decreased the protection on the item under our consideration, seeing that at least 95 per cent, of the woollen iery used in Australia is imported. We in the dark as to the quantity produced locallv, compared with the quantity imadvertisement, ported ; and a proper conclusion as to the operation of protection cannot be arrived at until we have the figures. The Treaany surer's proposal will leave the industry a slightly improved position; and I hope that honourable members will not support any suggestion to reduce the duty still further.",40
267,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"Illawarra) [8.20] - Ac cording to the Statistical Register of toria, there were in 1889, in Victoria, factories and 109 employees; in 1900, there were five factories and 146 employees; and in 1901, there were five factories and 131 are sewing machines. employees. The last was the year when the Federal Tariff was brought into exprices istence. But what do we find in 1905 under the smaller duties of the Federal Tariff? There were then sixteen factories with 374 employees. Under the circumfor stances, what justification is there for increased duty ? It is perfectly clear from the figures that the decreased duties have given those concerned the opportunity to develop their industry, and I think we entitled to some explanation from the Treasurer as to his reasons for the produty posed increase.",40
268,Mr SPENCE,MANUFACTURES,"Darling) [8.22] - Ther is a phase of this question which is not disclosed in the 'figures relating to the number of hands employed in the factories. There has recently come into operation a system of employing home workers who are sold knitting machines on a similar plan to that on which sewing machines are sold. Advertisements appear in the newspapers announcing that agents are prepared to sell these machines; and, in consequence, there is a considerable amount of home work done, though how much we do the not know. One of the machines on the market is sold only in Melbourne, but they find their way to New South Wales, and there some who have become expert in the manufacture of socks give lessons to others are desirous of doing home work. I some think, with the honourable member for Yarra, that probably, under this system, a good deal of sweating goes on. Those who the machines are supposed to make their profit entirely out of the sale, but they have also a profit on the yarn which they supply to the home workers. The advertisements declare that a woman can make £ 1 a week by purchasing one of the mahoschines ; and purchasers, if they choose, are may sell their work direct to the warehouses. This system is being pushed by and is introducing a business quite apart from the factories; and, under the circumstances, it is impossible to obtain figures as to the output. For instance, in in one of the big buildings in Melbourne the machines are sold in an office upstairs, and in an adjoining room the machines are working. Although the Victorian Factory Inspector exercises supervision, there can be no doubt but that the real object is the disVicposal of machines with the idea of giving four home work. One of the most advanced knitting machines costs £ 1 0 - ios., while others are sold at £ 7 ios., on terms, as This system, of course, may not be a bad thing if fair are - paid; indeed, it might prove very advantageous to many persons. But we know that where work is done at horne there is a tendency, in the present struggle existence, to cut down prices; and there any are many, notably women, willing to work all hours, day and night, to keep body and soul together. This is a phase of the question of which we ought not to lose sight. I are do not say whether or not a duty would better the conditions, but the idea of a is, of course, to enable people to get better prices for their work. I do not know e that the machines have so far come into use in this way to any large extent, but it is a branch of industry that is certain to grow, in view of the fact that it gives women an opportunity to work at home. A considerable number, of course, are already at work in this way, and they ought to be added to the number employed in the factories.",40
269,Mr HANS IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"Grampians) [8.25] - I think that the Treasurer's proposal is a fair compromise, which practically falls in line with the recommendation of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission. On item 397, n.e.i., it is provided that there shall be a duty of 5 per cent, on hose yarn; and the proposal of the Treasurer practically gives what has been asked for. We may congratulate the Treasurer on falling into line with the views of honourable members who do not. desire prohibition, but reasonable protection. I hope the Treasurer will take the same attitude in regard to other items, and so assist the speedy passing of the Tariff.",41
270,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"Illawarra) [8.29] - In reference to the remarks of the honourable member for Darling, I may say that the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission suggested that any falling off in the production of the factories was to be accounted for by the labour of the home workers, who have been equipped with machines and materials at the instance of warehousemen desirous of saving factory proprietors' profits. If the proposal of the Treasurer be carried, it wil 1 give those warehousemen of Flinders-lane, York-street, and elsewhere, a further opportunity offleecingthe factories, the public, and the people who work for them; and this is a matter which we ought seriously to consider in connection with this duty.",41
271,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"Yarra) [S.30] - The honourable member for Illawarra quoted the Victorian Statistical Register to show that the number of operatives in this industry had increased between the years 1902 and 1905. It is well known that that was a period of prosperity and improvement in trade generally. The honourable member did not read from that portion of the Tariff Commission's report which shows that the imports of cotton socks rose from £93,000 worth to ,£150,000 worth between 1903 and 1906, while the imports of woollen hosiery increased in value from ,£187,000 to £311,000. Inother words, the imports increased in a greater ratio than the number of workers, clearly demonstrating that the measure of protection afforded to the industry was not sufficient.",41
272,Mr WYNNE,MANUFACTURES,"Balaclava) [8.32] - The honourable member for Illawarra implied that the introduction of these machines for the manufacture of socks and stockings had "" led to sweating.",41
273,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,I never uttered a word about sweating.,41
274,Mr WYNNE,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member suggested that the manufacturers gave out work and thus got it done at a reduced price by means of the home worker.,41
275,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,Le t the honourable member confine his attention to the Victorian mills. What are they doing?,41
276,Mr WYNNE,MANUFACTURES,"I know a widow who attempted to earn a livelihood by teaching music. She was unsuccessful, and she then procured one of these machines, by the use of which she is able to earn .£3 weekly, and thus to support her family. If a woman can earn that amount, surelv the industry is one which should be as'sisted, seeing that it may prove so helpful to widows and others who are in necessitous circumstances.",41
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Parramatta.) t -34]--lf > under the operation of the old 8 rate of duty, a widow is able to earn ,£3 per week at home, is there any necessitv for so large an increase in the duty as that which is proposed?",41
278,Mr WYNNE,MANUFACTURES,I did not deal with the question of the increased duty at all.,41
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"But incidentally the honourable member supplied us with the best proof that this is not one of the strangled industries. If by means of these machines women can earn as much as .£3 per week at home, it seems to me that the industry is doing very well, and does not need the assistance of the high protective duties proposed by the Treasurer. - Mr STORRER - The honourable member for Balaclava did not tell us the number of hours worked by the widow whose case he cited.",41
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"No . Is the honourable member for Balaclava able to inform us whether she worked only eight hours per day? I have heard nothing during the course of this debate which would warrant the imposition of the excessively high duties proposed. I think that those indicated by the honourable member for Grey are quite sufficient for all purposes. Certainly they afford any protection that may-be requisite to make the industry prosper. Amendment agreed to.  point out that under the old Victorian Tariff cotton socks and stockings were admitted free, whilst woollen socks and '.stockings were dutiable at 25 per cent., yarns being free. Under the New South Wales Tariff both lines were admitted free, [n Queensland, hosiery was dutiable at 15 per cent., and yarns were upon the free list or J5"" per cent: In South Australia, the former line was dutiable at 20 per cent., and the latter was admitted free or at 15 per cent. 'The protectionist section of the Tariff 'Commission recommended the imposition of a duty of 25 per cent, upon woollens either with or without silk, and of 15 per cent, upon the other lines.. I think, therefore, that my proposal will be in conformity with the conditions that existed in the various States prior to Federation,, whilst closely approximating to the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. move That after the words ""30 per cent."" the words "" nnd on and after 14th November, 1907 (General Tariff), ad val. ao per cent.,"" be inserted.",41
281,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURES,"Macquarie) [8.40] - It seems to me that upon this item we have an opportunity of encouraging that best possible form of industry amongst our wo""men folk, namely, home work. I happen to know that the remarks of the honourable member for Balaclava in regard to women working these machines are substantially correct. Throughout New South Wales our women folk are employing them. But their complaint is that they cannot dispose of their product-the socks and stockings which they make-o n account of the retail system which obtains, and because of the introduction of foreign goods. The regular channels of supply are so closed to them that it is difficult for them to obtain an entrance to the market. The merchants' are in the habit of dealing directly with the importers, and will not depart from their business routine in order to oblige these women who are in a position to supply socks and stockings at less than the importers' price. The honourable member for Parramatta, with characteristic facility, has seized upon the fact that one woman earns £ 3 per week by the use of the home knitting machine for the purpose of proving that the industry does not need assistance. If it could not be shown that anv one was making these goods, the honourable member would have argued from that that a duty was not necessary. But I would point out that there may be peculiar circumstances which enable the individual in question to earn that sum. Possibly she happens to be in the good graces of the merchants who, out of their kindness of heart, have broken away from the established rule by providing her with employment. That is an argument in favour of making it compulsory that our local traders shall deal with those persons in our midst who make these socks and stockings. This is the simplest form of industry that we can protect. To embark upon it does not involve - any large outlay. Further, there is no danger of a combination being formed amongst the thousands of persons who use these machines. The great factor wanting in connection with this industry is the exhibition of that patriotism which induces persons to use goods of local origin.",42
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,I will guarantee I that the honourable member is wearing imported socks.,42
283,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURES,"I challenge the honourable member for Parramatta to produce as many home-made socks as I can. I have been in the habit of wearing them. I know that they are cheaper than is the imported article, and that they last a good deal longer. I challenge the honourable member to show that he .has been equally patriotic.",42
284,Mr JQHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"Lang) [8.45] - An instructive commentary .upon the high duty levied upon socks under the old Victorian Tariff is furnished by the evidence of a manufacturer who appeared before the Tariff Commission. In answer to questions 51,751 to 51,754, and also to questions 61J45-6, Mr Woolnough, in explanation of the fact that cotton socks are more largely used in Victoria than in any other State, saidThe great popularity 'of cotton socks in Victoria results from the old Victorian Tariff, which, if I remember rightly, imposed a duty of 27^ per cent, on woollen socks, while cotton socks were free From that does it not appear that the protective duty, which was intended to develop woollen sock making, only drove the people to utilizing imported cotton socks ?-Ye s : I do not think there is any doubt of that. It made the woollen sock dearer, and, the cotton sock being cheap, people used it. The effect of high duties in Victoria, the home' of protection and of coddled and sweated industries, has been to make the public buy cotton instead of woollen socks, because they are the cheaper.",42
285,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-rTreasurer) [8.48] - Referenc e has been made to the duties on these articles in force elsewhere, and, to prevent misunderstanding, I wish to point out to the Committee that the rate proposed by the honourable member for Adelaide was 25 per cent., whilst the old Victorian rate was 25 per cent., and the New Zealand rate is 20 per cent., and the Canadian rates 25, 32^, and 35 per cent.",42
286,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"But the manufacturers themselves asked for 25 per cent. only.

293,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,"The free-trade section of the Tariff' Commission recommended a duty of 15 per cent.  not taken notice of the recommendations of the free-trade section. PAIRS. Sir WILLIAM LYNE - We have done so on this occasion.  duty on cotton piece goods by 5 per cent., we have already given assistance to the local makers of tents, tarpaulins, and sails; because there are more tents made of cotton than of anything else. If the Minister in originally imposing a duty of 15 per cent, thought that a fair margin would thus be allowed the manufacturer, he should be pEepared now to reduce the item by at least 5 per cent., since the duty on the raw material has been reduced.",43
294,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,It is only a small item.  section of the Tariff Commission must have had some reason for recommending that the duty should be only 5 per cent.,44
295,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Le t it go.,44
296,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"North Sydney) [9.1] - I think that the Treasurer might agree to let the item go. When the raw material of the local manufacturer was not free, only .£142 was paid by way of duty on these goods. This shows that the great bulk of those used in Australia are locally made. The manufacturers have now secured a. reduction of the duty on their raw material, and I fail to see why the Minister should not agree to reduce the duty to 10 per cent, and 5 per cent., under which rates those engaged in the trade in Australia would have more protection than they enjoyed under the old Tariff. Item agreed to. Item 137. Trimmings and Ornaments n.e.i. for Bonnets, Hats, Shoes, and other attire, not being in part or wholly of gold or silver; including Buckles: Clasps; Slides; Buttons; Badges n.e.i.; Fringes n.e.i.; Braids n.e.i.; Piping; Gimp n.e.i.; Crowns and Bandeaux for Hats; Natural, and Imitation Birds and Wings; Tinsel Cloth; Tinsel Belting and Thread; Frillings; Ruffling; Pleating; and Ruchings, ad val. (General Tariff), 25 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 15 per cent. - Mr JOHNSON"" (Lang) [9.4] - The usual difference between the duty on imports from the United Kingdom and those in the General Tariff is 5 per cent., but in this case we have a difference of 10 per cent. Under the old Tariff these goods were dutiable at 25 per cent, and 15 per cent., whilst some of them were free. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 15per cent., whilst the free-trade section proposed a duty of 10 per cent. Will the Treasurer explain why the duties have been increased to 25 per cent, and 15 per cent. ? I move That after the'words ""25 per cent."" the words "" and on and after 14th November, 1907 (General Tariff), ad val. 15 per cent.,"" be inserted. If this amendment be carried I shall move that 'the duty on goods from the United Kingdom be reduced to 10 per cent.",44
297,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Trea - Belts; surer) [9.6] - There are several reasons the difference of 10 per cent, between general Tariff and that relating to the United Kingdom, the principal being that the balance of trade under this item is against Great Britain. We are making a'n attempt by means of a substantial preference to divert some of the present trade-' into another channel. Under the firstFederal Tariff the principal duties on the goocls included in this item were 25 percent, and 15 per cent., although some of them were free. We have practicallyadopted the old duties.",44
298,Mr EDWARDS,MANUFACTURES,"Oxley) [9.8] - The Committee is losing sight of the fact that nearly all the goods mentioned in this item are required for manufacturing purposes, and are not made within the Commonwealth. ^ They are the raw materials for the milliner, and should not be subject to these high duties. I hope that the Treasurer will accept the amendment.  trade has asked that a number of lines be added to the item and made free. Most of the goods enumerated in it are used for manufacturing purposes, and the Sydney Chamber of Commerce suggest that these should be free, or at most pay a revenue duty of, say, 10 per cent. They suggest thatThe following braids (not for ornamentation)should be free-plain , mchair, llama, worsted, silk, lacing, Milan, cotton, vandyke, cordon,. French, Lacet, Russia, French, Feather stitch, crochet, antimacassar, corded and brush edging, and similar edgings used for the bottom of dresses to resist the friction of the street.",44
299,Mr STORRER,MANUFACTURES,"Bass) [9.10] - I hope that the Government proposal will be accepted. The honourable member for Oxley said that these goods were the raw material of the milliners.' That is true., but we shoufd not lose sight of the fact that a large profit is made on trimmed hats and bonnets, and since we have already this afternoon reduced duties which will involve a loss of revenue amounting to ,£200,000 per annum, I hope that the amendment will not be agreed to. We should not lose sight of the revenue aspect of the question. Amendment negatived. Item agreed to. Item 138. Bayonets, Swords, Scabbards, and"" attachments; embroidered Cap Peaks; Waist Medals; and all Accoutrements, Badges,.

300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [9.12] - I move That the words "" embroidered cap peaks"" be left out. The words proposed to be omitted will then go under Division XVI .",45
301,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,No duties are mentioned.,45
302,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"If this amendment be agreed to, I propose that the rest of the item shall be placed on the free list. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [9.13""! I should like to know why waist belts are included in this item, whilst cross belts are not. Both are made of the same material.",45
303,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"Dalley) [9.14] - The honourable member for Bass told us a few moments ago that an item relating to - ladies' millinery was a good revenue one. In this case we are dealing with an item relating really to millinery for men. A good deal of this gold embroidery, and so forth, is neither more nor less than man millinery for members of our Volunteer Forces. If we are looking for revenue, here is an item to which we might very well direct attention. On female millinery there is a thumping duty of 25 per cent., and I think we might have an equally thumping duty on man millinery. The soldier who is most embroidered is usually the least able in time of trouble.",45
304,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURES,The Government have to pay for the embroidery.,45
305,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,That is not so; the officers have to pay for it themselves.,45
306,Mr WH IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,The bulk of these articles are imported by the Government.,45
307,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"The items referred to by the honourable member for Flinders are, under departmental regulation, made free, but there are other items of personal adornment for many of our drawing-room soldiers, who can well afford to pay for the luxury. Amendment agreed to. Amendments (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) agreed to. That after the word "" be l t s "" the belts"" be inserted. That the word "" badges "" be left out; that the word "" f r e e , "" in the last line, be left that the word "" f r e e "" be inserted in the first and second columns. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 139 (Artificial plants, &c.) agreed to. Item 140. Wigs; hairnets; and articles of natural or imitation hair, ad val., 30 per cent.",45
308,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"Lang) [9.21] - I think this is a cruel impost; and the Treasurer, if he has no consideration for the public outside, might have had consideration for some of his own immediate followers. Under all the circumstances, I think we might agree to a reduction of this duty. Under the old Tariff the duty was 20 per cent., and that was the highest duty recommended by the Tariff Commission. I move That after the words ""30 per cent."" the words "" and on and after 14th November, 1907, ad val. 20 per cent.,"" be added. Amendment agreed to. Postponed item 121. Gloves n.e.i. of all materials, including mittens and flesh gloves (General Tariff), ad val. 30 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 20 per cent.",45
309,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"North Svdney) [9.27] - Unde r the old . Tariff, bandages, elastic stockings, leggings, knee caps, wristlets, and other surgical appliances were free; but in the present .Tariff these have been made dutiable. I should like the Treasurer, before we come to that portion of the Tariff in which these articles have been placed, to give us some reason for the change, and also tell us if they are made in Australia.",45
310,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [9.28] - I propose to divide this item. Honourable members will see that the old Tariff was 20 per cent., and that that is the duty recommended by the A division of the Tariff Commission. I propose to substitute for the item as it appears the following(A) Gloves made from kid (General Tariff), 30 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 20 per cent. (li) Gloves n.e.i. of all kinds and materials, including mittens (General Tariff), 15 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 10 per cent. This will bring the duty down considerably below that in the old Tariff on the latter class of goods. The imports from the United Kingdom, in 1905, amounted to £[100,070 in value, and from foreign countries to. £'114,256 in value.",45
311,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"Were those the words ""cross manufactures of Great Britain?",45
312,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"They were imout; and ported from Great Britain. In 1906 the imports of gloves from Great Britain were valued at £[80,981, and those from foreign countries at £141,698. I therefore propose that the duty"" levied upon these articles under the general Tariff shall be 30 per cent., and that under the Tariff of the United Kingdom, 20 per cent.",45
313,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"Lang) [9.30] - I would suggest to the Minister the desirableness of inserting after the word ""materials"" the words '' except Lisle, cotton, cashmere, and knitted wool."" These are the materials of which all the cheaper gloves are made, and the adoption of my suggestion would still leave kid gloves subject to the higher rate of duty. Mr TILLE Y BROWN (Indi) [9.31] It seems to me that the duties proposer! by the Treasurer are altogether too high. Even under the operation of a duty of 20 per cent., a revenue of £46,000 was collected upon gloves. I think, therefore, that we should adhere to the old rate of duty. Sir WILLIAM LYNE^-Treasurer) [9.34] - Upon reflection, I do not purpose proceeding with the amendment which I have already outlined, but I intend to substitute for it a new proposal, which I think will better accord with the wishes of the Committee. I therefore move That all the words after ""gloves,"" line 1, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the folio wine words :"" (A ) Men's gloves, of all kinds and materials (General Tariff), ad val. 30 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 20 per cent. (B) Gloves n.e.i. of all kinds and materials, including mittens (General Tariff),' aa val. 15 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 10 per cent.""",46
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Parramatta) [9.35] - The present proposal of the Treasurer is a decided improvement upon its predecessor. But I should like to direct his attention to the fact that 30 per cent, is a very high rate to impose upon men's gloves. We must recollect that, no matter what duty we may levy upon them, some of these gloves will still have to be imported from abroad. They cannot be manufactured in the Old Country, ancl some of them will require to be imported from Germany, France, and other parts of the Continent. Their manufacture has been specialized, and, under the circumstances, I ask the Treasurer whether it is worthwhile to impose such an excessive rate as 30 per cent, upon them.",46
315,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,I have allowed a large margin in both cases.,46
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"I should be glad to extend even a larger preference to the Mother Country, if these gloves could be manufactured there. But since they cannot, where is the use of piling up duties upon goods which must be imported from the Continent, in spite of whatever we may do to exclude them. I suggest that the duty proposed under the general Tariff should be somewhat reduced.",46
317,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"Dalley) [9.38] - I heard an interjection just now to the effect that men's gloves are a fair subject for revenue. I hold that opinion too. The Treasurer has made a very graceful concession in that he has allowed the duty on gloves worn by women to be reduced by 10 per cent, under the general Tariff, and 5 per cent, 1 under the Tariff for Great Britain. The honourable gentleman is pretty wijy. He thinks that his action in this connexionwill go a long way towards capturing the women's vote. it will be recollected that some time ago the honourable member for Robertlson bombarded the Treasurer with questions as to whether gloves were made in Australia. The first reply of the honourable .gentleman was that they were, but later on he had to admit that they were not. I think that the Treasurer is justi-. fied in endeavouring to secure a large - amount of revenue from gloves which are wom by men. These are sold today as a matter of fashion",46
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,As a matter of comfort.,46
319,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"The fashion of wearing gloves is a dying one, and those who wish to indulge in it will not be deterred from so doing because of a slightly increased duty.",46
320,Mr LIDDE LL,MANUFACTURES,"Hunter) [9.40] Apparently the Treasurer would like to make it an offence for persons to wear gloves. But my chief concern is for those who sell these articles, and who feel the incidence of this duty very keenly. If the impost is intended to be merely revenue producing, all I have to say is that the gloves which are sold in Australia will produce a very small revenue indeed. It would only be a graceful act on the part of the Treasurer to reduce the duty upon men's gloves. I also wish to know whether boxing gloves will be included under this item? We know that Australians are a sporting people, and certainly the manly sport of boxing should be encouraged. Every form of manlv sport should receive our encouragement, and consequently I am opposed to the imposition of a high duty such as is proposed unon this item.",46
321,Mr COON,MANUFACTURES,Batman) [9.43] - I rise for the purpose of correcting the statement of the honourable member for Parramatta. He has affirmed that .gloves are not being made in Great Britain.,46
322,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,I did not make any such statement.,47
323,Mr COON,MANUFACTURES,"Unfortunatel y gloves are being made in Great Britain under sweated conditions. Men's kid gloves are being manufactured there for is. 9d. per dozen. Amendment agreed to.

324,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"Yarra) [9.47] that the Minister will agree to an amendment of this item, which would make it read as follows(A) Wool Felt Hats, in any stage of manufacthan ture, per dozen (General Tariff), 16s.; Kingdom), 12s. (B) Fur Felt Hats, in any stage of manufacto ture, per dozen (General Tariff), 25s.; (United Kingdom), 20s.

As a rule honourable members take more terest in the industries with which they or have been connected than in other indusdisposed tries, and, because of my connection the hat-making industry, I take more interest in it than in any other. Practically every European country, with two excepthree tions, .has agreed to fixed rates of duty imported hats.",47
325,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,Can the honourable member give the average prices of ported hats?,47
326,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"It would be impossible for me to get the prices at which most the warehouses import, but I can give the price of ait least one of the lines would be dealt with at the higher of the two rates I propose ",47
327,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"How do the honourable of member's proposals work out ad valorem""!",47
328,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"On very low-grade hats, the rates will be slightly higher than those opportunity to which we have agreed for apparel and attire, but on hats of average quality they will not be higher than those rates.",47
329,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"How do they cently, compare with the rates proposed by the Minister ?",47
330,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"They are an increase on those rates. But, as no doubt the members of the Tariff Commission will admit, more is spent on felt hats than on apparel and attire. The hat cluties imposed by the last Tariff have been referred to as prohibitive; but the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Cbrnmission shows that they have not prevented importations.",47
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Why does the honn.e.i., orable member propose the adoption of fixed rates?",47
332,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,To prevent the flooding of the market with end-of-the-season goods at slaughter prices.,47
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,It is intended to I trust get nearer to prohibition?,47
334,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"The rates which I propose will, if adopted, prevent persons from importing hats from Great Britain at less they are produced for in that country. (United As our season commences when that of countries in the northern hemisphere comes an end, we get their end-of-the-season goods. There are in Great Britain, as I free. stated when the last Tariff was under disabout eighty manufacturers of felt Forms, hats, with an output ranging from 500 (United dozen to 1,000 dozen hats per week. He is a pretty clever man who can work to within a week of his turnover during a inseason, and consequently there are always are a number of end-of-the-season goods to be of, and the result is they are with dumped here very often.",47
335,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"The imports of the last months were greater by ,£40,000 than on those of the corresponding - period of last year. Mr TUDOR; - Honourable members imgenerally have complained that only manufacturers went before the Tariff Commission, but in this industry the workmen of did come forward, and give evidence. Let me read an extract from the North Cheshire which Herald of March, 1907, the newspaper which has the largest circulation"" in the hatmanufacturing districts of Great Britain. Denton is one of the villages where most the hat-making is done- 1 The present activity of the industry is due to the English Manufacturer having an unusual for sending large shipments of Hats to the Colonies. Australia and Canada are among his biggest customers abroad, and the opening for an exceptional amount of business being done with them has presented itself rewith the result that for months Denton has been a very busy place, with work going on at full pressure in all its factories. Possibly English makers are not securing much larger profits from the boom, for the advance in materials has, of course, affected them, but they are strengthening their position in the markets, of the world, and even if they cannot show a* profit at all, it is better to lose a little money and keep machinery running than to lose a great deal through having plant standing idle. Then, too, the use they make of the present chance, will influence their trade for some time, and in the end no doubt they will obtain substantial benefit from it. It is there admitted that, although the mills are running full time and trade is booming, probably no profits are being made; the surplus stock is sent to Australia and Canada, to the advantage of the British manufacturers, but to the injury of the manufacturers here.",47
336,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"The British manufacturers, like most others that we hear about, seem to be living on their losses.",48
337,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"The importations of hats have increased, and last year more felt hats were imported than were manufactured in Australia There were more imported from Italy alone than would have kept the Denton Mills going full time for twelve months. been said many times that the woollen mills cannot supply their orders, but that cannot be said of the hat mills, because during the last six months the journeymen at the Denton Mills have not averaged thirty-two hours per week, while in other factories a similar state of things has existed, on an average not more than four days per week having been worked.",48
338,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,"Still , the Denton Mills pay good dividends.",48
339,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"That fact has been spoken of as a reason for not increasing the duties, and even for reducing them. But, according to the Draper of AustralasiaThe Adelaide Hat Manufacturing Company held their first annual meeting of shareholders on 25th September, Mr C. H . Goode, chairman of directors, presiding. The statement of the accounts, embracing the period from 9th February to 30th June, showed that a profit of £86 3s. gd. had been made. That was the profit on a capital of about ,£20,000. I admit that the Denton Mills have paid a dividend, arid I am glad of it ; but I do not think the profits of the other six Australian mills, taken together, are .equal to those of the Denton Mills.",48
340,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,Because the Denton Mills have practically a monopoly.,48
341,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,They do not do onevalorem third of the trade.,48
342,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,They do the bulk of it.,48
343,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member is strong on statistics, and if he investigates the subject he will find that my statement is correct.",48
344,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,Perhaps the honourable member includes the straw hat trade?,48
345,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"No ; I am dealing only with felt hats. According to the Customs statistics, the men's, women's, boys', and children's felt hats imported into Australia last year were worth ,£129,000.",48
346,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,Does not that include materials for making up?,48
347,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"I think it is the value hat of hats alone. There is a large trade done in ladies' felt hats. The total duty paid was £[38,000, and about £[170,000 would have to be paid altogether before the hats could be landed here, so that, allowing for charges of one kind and another, the warehouse value of the hafs would be about ,£200,000. Unfortunately we have no bureau of statistics, but I am confident that ,£150,000 worth of felt hats was not made in Australia last year. It has",48
348,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,What factories are there in addition to the Denton Mills?,48
349,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"The Stockport Mills, the Austral Mills, the Union Mills, the Fairfield Park Mills, the Adelaide Mills, Anderson's Sydney factory, and a small factory at Leichardt; but, as I have said, I believe that the Denton Mills have made more profit than all the others put together. No doubt some of those who are in the industry thought that there was a gold mine in it ; but now they would be glad. to get out of it again if they could recover the capital which they have sunk. Honourable members have spoken of the large profits to be made in the industry; but if the profits were large would not other mills have started? There are not more hat factories in Australia now. than there Vere before the duty was raised to 30 per cent.",48
350,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,On e factory has been closed since.,48
351,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"But another has been started. The two Adelaide mills amalgamated, so that the number of factories is the same now as it was when, the Kingston Tariff was passed.",48
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,What are the ad equivalents of the fixed rates which the honourable member proposes?,48
353,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"On . the average wool hats imported into Australia the fixed rates would equal from 35 to 40 per cent. ad valorem. I intend to give the prices which Woodrow charges to retailers here, and the prices at which he compels the retailers to sell.",49
354,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,The wool hats are cheaper than felt hats.,49
355,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"Yes . I have heard soft and hard felt hats referred to as made of different materials, but the material is same in each case, though the proof or stiffening is of a different strength.",49
356,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,If the honourable member's proposal is carried it will be pretty hard to get a new hat.,49
357,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"When the first Federal Tariff was under consideration the honourable member for Dalley said that the imposition of a duty of 30 per cent, would cause prices to increase. As a matter of fact, Hats in New South Wales-and . indeed, in Australia generally-ar e as cheap after the imposition of the Federal duty as they were before.",49
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,That is not so.,49
359,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,Not a warehouseman 01 retailer can show that hats in New South Wales today are dearer than they were when they came in free.,49
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"The wearers can. Mr 'TUDOR - Ha d the retailers been able to make out a case against the imposition of this duty-ha d they been able to show that the imposition of the duty had caused prices to increase-the y would have done so. The hat-making industry is natural to Australia. We produce wool and fur of first class quality, and have workmen equal to those in the trade in Other countries.",49
361,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,Wh v is it that such an Unfortunate prejudice exists against the 'Colonial article?,49
362,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"I do not know, but I would remind the Committee that we have heard honourable members in this House 'declare that Australians are a decadent race.",49
363,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,Is it a fact that the Government have accepted the honourable member's amendment?,49
364,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,I hope that they will do so. Tf they are as wise as I believe them to be they will.,49
365,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,If they wish to retain the honourable member's support.,49
366,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"I shall sunport the protective features of this Tariff whether mv amendment be agreed t'o or rejected. am not a one-eyed protectionist, nor do I take up the position of the honourable member, who has said in this House: "" I am. after a bit of loot for my electorate, since other honourable members are doing the same. I am going to vote for the iron bounty, because there is' a shipbuilding yard in my electorate.""",49
367,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"I say that I am going for it, but do not get it ; whereas the honourable member, although he says nothing on the the subject, is going for it all the time.",49
368,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"I wish to see our industries increase and expand. There isone matter to which I am loth to refer. A Mr Lane, an importer and seller of hats, wrote to the Melbourne press a little while ago that Australian .workmen would not hold their own if they were called upon to do the best class of work carried out in an English or an American factory. As ar rule such a statement may be made with some degree of safety since there are not many Australian artisans who could controvert it. Most of our workers are satisfied' to remain in Australia, and refrain fromtravelling to any extent; but as a journeyman hatter I have held my own in English and American factories. After five years abroad I returned a greater believer in Australia than ever I was before,, and if I lost ray seat in this House tomorrow, I believe I could earn my living once again in the hat mills. The'Denton HatMills have been denounced on the ground that they refuse to sell direct to the rer tailers. In that respect they take up the same position as do the great majority of English factories. They will not serve a retailer, for the reasonthat if they did they would have to make inquiries as to his banking account, and lose a lot of time in doing work which can be more satisfactorily dealt with by the warehousemen. When I was in England I noticed that, according to the trade journals, those in the retail hat trade who failed generally owed a large sum to the manufacturer who served the retailers. Nearly all the English manufacturers do business through the warehouses, who, since they have to supply them with a number of other lines, are in a better position to trade successfully with the retailers. I do not propose topraise or condemn any factory, but in passing I would mention that Mr K02minsky, of the Austral Hat Mills, who served direct to the retailers, advertised throughout I Australia of his intention to do so, but was, in the end, nearly ruined. The retailers themselves do not care to do .business direct with the manufacturers. Some honourable members of the Opposition have denounced manufacturers who are not prepared to sell direct to the retailers. should like them to say whether John Darling and Company, who deal largely in wheat, would be prepared to sell a boy 3d. worth of grain for his pigeons, or whether any one would think of applying to Howard Smith and Company for one cwt. of coal. Certain lines of business naturally must be confined to the retail trade, whilst others must be left to the wholesale houses. I propose to compare the prices at which an English firm sells hats in Melbourne with those at which they sell them at Perth.",49
369,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,They will not let the retailer sell for less than a stipulated price.,50
370,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"That is so. If a'Melbourne manufacturer adopted that attitude, there would be a howl of indignation on the part of the Opposition. Let me give some figures from Woodrow's price list. Their wholesale price for hard hats at Melbourne is gs. 6d. each, or 114s. per dozen, as against 117s. per dozen at Perth. In other words, they charge 3s. per dozen more for the same hats at Perth than they do in Melbourne. The reason for this is that there is no hat factory in Western Australia. It should cost less to ship hats from England to Fremantle than it does fo ship them from England to Melbourne, and I presume that the increased price at which Woodrow's hats are sold ih Western Australia represents the freight which a Melbourne manufacturer would have to pay oh hats shipped from here to Fremantle. The retail price fixed by Woodrow's for the hats to which I have just referred is 13s. 6d. in Melbourne - o r a profit of about 43 per cent - and 14s. 6d. in Western Australia. The Woodrow's Dunbar hat- a soft hat-is sold wholesale in Melbourne at irs. 3d., whilst the price at Perth is 12s. The retail price jn Melbourne is 15s. 6d., and in Perth 17s. 6d. These figures will - give honourable members some idea of what the people of this State would be subjected to Tf we were left to the tender mercies of the importers. Those who supplied me with this information requested me not to disclose their names, saying that if I did so, Woodrow's agent would not supply them. Some honourable members have spoken of the combine in the confectionery trade, and of the treatment the retailers receive from the manufacturers. What have they to say to a statement of this kind? If necessary, I can give the names of my informants in confidence to any honourable member. When the first Federal - Tariff was under I consideration in the Senate, the late Senator Sir Frederick Sargood said, according to Hansard of 8th May, 1902, page 12405In passing, I may say that while the duty in Victoria has been up to 160 per cent., the duty in New Zealand has never been more than 22% per cent., and yet the factories there are doing well. I may add that my firm has just established a very large felt hat factory in New Zealand undeT the 22^ per cent, duty.""",50
371,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,That factory is now shut up.,50
372,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"It is. The secretary of the Tariff Committee of the Australian Association of Felt Hatters, writesReferring to the statement that "" The duty in Victoria had been up to 160 per cent.,"" I find that from October, 1892, to December 31st, 1900 (the periods when the duties were highest), the value of Felt Hats imported to Victoria was £S5^^2 , and the. amount of duty collected ,£27,665; this is a shade under 50 per cent, ad val., and not 160 per cent. In reference to the rate of duty operating in New Zealand, in 1902 it was 25 per cent, ad val., collected on invoice price with 10 per cent, added, making 27^ per cent, and not 22^ per cent, as Sir F . Sargood stated. The following extract from the "" Otago Daily Times"" of February 20, 1907, demonstrates the success attained by this firm in New Zealand under a 27^ per cent, duty :- "" The Industrial dispute between the Otago Felt Hatters' Union and the Felt Hat Manufacturers of Dunedin, was proceeded with in the Arbitration Court at Dunedin. Mr Scott appeared for the D . H . M . Ltd., Ross & Glendinning, and the Otago Felt Hat Co. (Messrs. Sargood's). Mr W. Scott said ' that this was a case which should never have been brought before the Court, and certainly not at the present time. Thousands of pounds had been spent and lost in endeavouring to develop the felt hat making industry, which should have been one of the foremost in the colony. That the industry had been disastrous to the employers, was shown by the fact that the M i ll in Auckland had to be shut down. In Wellington he would be surprised to hear that there were three men engaged; and in Dunedin, the largest factory (Messrs. Sargood's) had practically closed its doors, and of the other two Mills, one had never declared a dividend, and had not got anything like the number of men employed today they once had, and the other had not declared a dividend for three years. Fifty per cent, of the men who had been engaged in the trade had had to leave New Zealand. The Union had taken a time when the bottom had fallen out of the industry to come to the Court and endeavour to tie the employers down to rates of payment and conditions of labour that would only be justified were the business on a> sound financial basis and thoroughly established.'"" There is evidence that in New Zealand, under a duty of 25 per cent., plus 2 perL cent., every factory has closed its doors. In Canada, prior to the preferential Tariff with Great Britain, there was a duty of 33 per cent., and Canada is not in the position that we are, seeing that their seasons run concurrently with those of Great Britain. There has never been a felt-hat industry in Canada, or I should have gone there to work as a means of seeing the country. Honourable members may think that in asking for a fixed duty in the case of felt hats I am asking for something exceptional. I would point out, however, that there is a fixed duty on all classes of spirits, the value of which is considerably greater than the value of felt hats - Then, in the case of wines, tobacco, and cigars, there are fixed duties, and even the free trade section of the Tariff Commission recommended the abolition of the mixed duty in favour of a fixed duty. Then there is a fixed duty in the case of cigarettes, biscuits, and confectionery, though we know that in the case of the last-mentioned commodity the value varies from 3d. to 3s. per lb. There is nothing like that margin between the lowest quality wool hat and the highest quality wool hat. Further, there are fixed duties in the case of fruits, pickles, sauces, and other commodities; and I trust the Government will accept the amendment I have suggested. There can be made in Australia any felt hat that can be made in any part of the world, provided the material and trouble is put into the work. I admit that where labour is cheaper, a greater amount of time can be spent over each particular hat. But what wages do Woodrows' pay ? I had a chance of going to Woodrows' to work at 33s. per week of 56^ hours, but I did not think the terms good enough. According to the Victorian Factory Inspector's report, no charge of sweating can be made against this industry. I find that adult males, last year - includin g the making of caps, which, of course, lowers the average-earne d on the average ,£2 18s. 9d. a week, and females, 19s. iod. a week. I am positive that if this industry had not been established before Federation, a duty of 30 per cent, would not have established it. In support of this, we need look for no further evidence than the fact that not one factory has been started since , the Federal Tariff came into operation. Importations are increasing. In New South Wales, according to the report signed by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, there was imported, in 1900, ,£203,525 worth of hats of all sorts, while last year there was imported £193,727 worth. If honourable members take the trouble to read the reports, they will see that the imports have either remained stationary or have increased. A fixed duty would stop the swamping of the trade at the end of the British season, and before the season here has started. Honourable members for Queensland have voted cheerfully-and I with them-for a duty of 50 per cent, on sugar. The Excise duty enables us to see at once the amount of sugar imported, compared with that manufactured in Australia; and I can say that if the same conditions applied to the sugar industry as apply to the felt-hat industry, we should have found, not 200,000 tons, but only 100,000 tons of sugar manufactured within the Commonwealth. I contend that there ought to be a Statistical Bureau, whereby all information could be obtained, so that we might know precisely where we are in connection with these matters. Honourable members in the Opposition corner have stated their belief in effective protection, and I think they will admit that there is not effective protection when the imports amount to more than the manufactures within the country. I have said that practically there is no felt-hatting industry in the Southern Hemisphere ex=cepting in the Argentine Republic and in - Brazil; but in the former place there is a duty of 50 per cent., and in the latter, of 60 per cent. According to the evidence given in the Arbitration Court in New Zealand, the industry there has been wiped out simply because of inadequate protection. I appeal to honourable members not to allow prejudice to influence them,- but to deal with this industry as they have dealt with other industries. A fixed duty will not increase the cost .to the consumer, and will have the effect of placing the industry on a better footing than in the past. I"" move, with a view to submitting the amendment of which I have given noticeThat the words "" 35 per cent."" be left out.",50
373,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,Dalley) [10.25] - I should like to know whether the Treasurer is prepared to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Yarra?,51
374,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Yes .,51
375,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"I had a suspicion that that was so, riot only from the remarks of the honourable member for Yarra, but also-from the way in which the amendment has been prepared and circulated. In common with many otherhonorable members, I have no - technical knowledge of this industry, and certainly no objection can be raised to the speech of the honourable member for Yarra from this point of view, or to his earnestness in the cause of protection. But the honourable member has not yet convinced me as to the necessity for a high duty. I may say that the machinery for the making of hats is admitted free, as are also the leathers used in the industry.",51
376,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"I think that the machinery should be taxed, as it is in the case of other industries.",52
377,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"I am merely showing the advantages which the hat-making industry has, and which the honourable member forgot to present to the Committee. The materials used in the making of hats are common in Australia. I understand that the felt hats are of three kinds, namely, the cheap wool hat, the wool hat veneered with fur, and the hat made entirely of rabbit fur. Now, all these materials are of Australian production, and the only weakness in the position, if there be any, is that the demand is not so great as in other parts of the world. But are we to supply a market for the Australian manufacturer by infposing a high duty? The honourable member asked why we did not read the reports of the Tariff Commission. I maysay that I do read the reports of the Tariff Commission. But th,ere are reports by two different sections of that Commission, and I intend to refer to the report of the free trade section, which contains the following significant wordsUnder cross-examination, however, certain statements were made, which, supported by official statistics, enable us to arrive ing conclusions :That the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff has neither been harmful to the industry as a whole, nor any particular portion of it, in Australia, except that it may have slightly curtailed profits by the imposition of duties on materials which in some States were free prior to Federation. The honourable member for Yarra spoke about the wages paid, and it appears that there is a difficulty in getting the labour necessary in the making of hats. The report of the Commission statesThe Commission was unable, largely through the unwillingness or want of knowledge of the witnesses, to obtain precise information^ as to labour cost of production. Certain evidence was given that the wages of skilled workers were in England about 40 to 50 per cent, less than in Australia, but the factory returns of Victoria show that the actual average wage of males was 39s. 2d. per week, and of females, who largely preponderate, 15s. per week, while a witness representing the Victorian mills under cross-examination admitted that the actual wages and all salaries' paid by his own firm did not' exceed 29s. per week. That is the evidence of an employ^ in a Victorian mill. The honourable member for Yarra refers me to Caesar, and I go to Csesar, to find that the wages in the Victorian mills are at the low standard I have quoted.",52
378,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member will see why that is-it is the loss of time which reduces the piece-work average.,52
379,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"On that point the report statesA ereat deal of the work is piece-work, but according to the best evidence procurable the. proportion of ""wages and salaries to the value of the manufactured articles, i.e., felt hats, was 36 per cent., and, assuming that the cost in England is one-half, it follows that the 18 per cent, would be sufficient to more than adjust the labour conditions. The last portion of this extract is not evidence, but the conclusion of the free trade section of the Commission. In regard to felt hats, I am reminded of the statement made by the honourable member for Yarra as to slaughtered prices. I can quite understand slaughtered prices being applied to the straw-hat trade, but I cannot understand it as applied to the felthat trade.",52
380,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"It applies to felt hats, too.",52
381,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,The Postmaster-General must admit that the orders for straw hats are invariably given six months ahead of our season.,52
382,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,So are the orders for the at the followother classes of hats.,52
383,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"Then , what becomes of the argument of the honourable member for Yarra that felt hats are sold here at slaughtered prices?",52
384,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"The season in the Old Country closes just at the time that our season begins, and thus we get the dregs of its season's goods.",52
385,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,The orders have to be given for hats at a certain price,52
386,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"Some of the leading, houses in Flinders-lane have sent Home buyers who have purchased a lot of cheap Italian stuff within the past three months.",52
387,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"I am not concerned with what the houses in Flinders-lane do, but I am concerned with the interests of the consumer. When I asked the honourable member for Yarra what ad valorem rate his proposal would represent, he said ""about 40 per cent."" That is a very unsatisfactory reply.",52
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"It isan obvious attempt to mislead the Committee,",53
389,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"I will not say that. But, as an earnest protectionist, the honourable member desires to get as heavy a duty as possible without disclosingits true in-, cidence. The people of Australia cannot afford to pay such a high impost as 40 per cent, upon hats. The wages paid in the industry are not sufficient to encourage us to vote for such an excessive duty. The material of which hats are made is produced locally. Every assistance which can be given to the industry, both by nature and by the Tariff, has been extended to it. The honourable member for Yarra has said that he wishes to place hats in the same category as apparel.",53
390,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,But apparel does not enjoy anything like the measure of protection that is proposed upon hats. There is the duty upon piece goods to be remembered.,53
391,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"That is so. The piece goods of which apparel is made bear a very heavy duty. I have already referred to the different classes of hats. Those made of wool comprise the cheapest line. The second class consists of hats made of wool and veneered with rabbit fur. The veneering process consists in "" dusting"" a woollen hat with a fine covering of fur. The resultant hat looks well, but does not wear.",53
392,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,Where is that process employed ?,53
393,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"In the Denton Hat Mills, which paid a considerable sum for the right to use this veneering process.",53
394,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,That was over twenty years ago. - Mr Wilks-The Tariff Commission says that the cost of hats to the consumers is unduly enhanced by the method of distribution.,53
395,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,That is not correct.,53
396,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"That is the statement of Mr Ogden in reply to question 13749. The Postmaster-General says that his assertion is.not true. Here, then, is a witness who, according to the honourable gentleman, has perjured himself.",53
397,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,The statement was made with a lack of knowledge.,53
398,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"If the Postmaster-General has so much knowledge of the industry, why did he not appear before the Tariff Commission ? He declined to do that, and yet he fights in this House for an increased duty. The fact of the matter is that those who desire an increase in the old rate feared to face the Tariff Commission, because they shrank from undergoing a searching cross-examination. If the Denton Hat Mills are not flourishing, why did not their proprietors plead before the Tariff Commission for encouragement to be extended to their industry ? The - fact - that they declined to do so is conclusive evidence that they were satisfied with the old rate. I trust that some honourable member will move for a reduction of this duty. If the honourable member for Lang will do so I shall be found supporting him, because I hold that the proposed increase cannot be justified.",53
399,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.42] - I ask the honourable member for Yarra to withdraw his proposal, to enable me to submit a prior amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the following words be inserted after the word ""'bonnets"" :- "" (A) Wool felt hats, in any stage qf manufacture, per dozen (General Tariff), iGs.; (United Kingdom), 12s.""",53
400,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"North Sydney) [10.44] - This is another proposal to secure an immense duty for this favoured hat industry, which is always making attacks upon the Treasury. Surely the rate levied, under the old Tariff was sufficiently high, ""not only to protect the industry, but to assure good profits to the manufacturers ?",53
401,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,The fact remains that thousands of pounds worth of cheap hats are being imported.,53
402,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,Ye t it is actually proposed to levy an enormous fixed duty upon the cheap hats which are worn by the boys and girls of the poorer classes of the community.,53
403,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,And they will get them cheapef.,53
404,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,What nonsense.,53
405,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member does not know anvthing about it.,53
406,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"The Postmaster-General had better improve his manners, or leave the chamber. He is very lax in his arguments, though he is very ready in making remarks which are not arguments, but are offensive to opponents. He says that I do not know anything about this matter. I shall not say that of him. He knows about it, and has raided the Treasury very often in the interests of the industry: He has been the champion mover- I shall not say log-roller - in endeavouring to obtain from the Government, not reasonable protection, but absolutely prohibitive duties. The honourable member for Yarra gave it as a reason for his amendment that the protection in respect to hats ought to be as high as that in respect to apparel. I think that he confuses protection with rate of duty. On apparel, the rates of duty are 40 and 35 per cent., but the protection given to the local manufacturers is much less than the Minister proposes to give to the local manufacturers of hats.",53
407,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,That depends. facturers of apparel may use Australian tweeds.,54
408,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"In many cases the materials used by the makers of apparel have to be imported, and are subject to rates of duty going as high as 25 and 30 per cent.",54
409,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,I am sorry that I made the remark to which the honourable member took exception just now. I did not intend any personal offence.,54
410,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"Of course, I accept the Minister's withdrawal. I should have no right to speak if I knew nothing about the subject. I do not profess to know as much of the inside working of this industry as is known by the honourable member; but we have to. make up our minds as to what is legitimate in the requests made by those connected with it. The actual protection given to makers of apparel is considerably less than the Minister proposes to give to makers, of But why should we give the larger protection to the latter? As has been pointed out, practically everything necessary for the making of felt hats-excep t a few.odds and ends, such as bands, which were allowed to come in free-is produced in Australia. If we fix the rate of duty at 30 per cent., the actual protection to the manufacturer will therefore be very considerable. The importation of felt hats last year, according to the Customs statistics, was valued at £128,000. which, I venture to say, is not a large proportion of the value of the hats made in Australia.",54
411,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,It is more than half the value of the hats made in Australia:,54
412,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"I do not think so. I understand that the hats worn in Australia are worth nearly ,£400,000, though, of course, at times, as fashions change, straw or other hats come more into vogue, and lessen the use of felt hats. The largest hat mills in Australia, which, according to the honourable member for Yarra, turn out more than one-third of the local output, pay an excellent dividend, returning to their shareholders 10 pgr cent., after making provision for depreciation, and reserves of one kind and another. In the year 1902, the dividend fell to 8 per cent., but it has in. each succeeding year been 10 per cent.",54
413,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,It was only in 1902 that the dividend fell to 8 per cent. Prior to that it was 10 per cent.,54
414,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"In the reManu- cord which I consulted, 1902 was the first year mentioned. The Kingston Tariff certainly did not reduce the company's - dividend. I agree with the honourable member for Yarra that it is impossible to work out the average cost of the imnorted hats, because we do not know the number of hats imported; but the wool felt hats on which he proposes a duty of 16s. per dozen would have to cost 53s. per dozen, or 4s. 5d. each, at the port of shipment, to give the result obtained from the duty of 30 per cent.",54
415,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"My foreign rate is 16s. per dozen, whereas the Minister's rate is 35 per cent, ad valorem.",54
416,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"At 12s. per. dozen the hats would have to cost 40s. per dozen, or 3s. 4d. each. But manv of the hats imported are cheap hats, while the small hats worn by children are also very cheap, their average cost being often ""not more than 18s. per dozen at the port of hats. shipment, so that the duty in many cases would be nearly 100 per cent.",54
417,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,Such hats are not imported.,54
418,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"A great many hats of that kind are imported. They are worn by children whose parents cannot afford to pay high prices. In most cases, I prefer fixed to ad valorem duties; but I cannot support rates which mean such an enormous impost on the cheap hats worn by children. That is why I accept an ad valorem duty on hats. It is impossible otherwise to make a. distinction. If it were possible so to describe hats as to make the cheaper kind pay a lower duty than expensive hats, I should be willing to accept a fixed duty.",54
419,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"In Victoria, when the duty was 24s. a dozen on felt hats, there was no complaint on account of their dearness.",55
420,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,They were selling for is. 1 id. each in Victoria when the duty was 30s. a dozen. I sold hundreds at that price.,55
421,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member always lays it down as a principle that the .duty adds to the price.,55
422,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member is absolutely wrong. What I have said is this-that in my opinion there is a tendency for the duty to increase the price to nearly the full amount of the duty, ancl that in some cases that is the result. I admit, however, that in some cases this does not happen. I also say that a high duty gives an opportunity for the formation of a combination to increase prices to nearly the full amount of the duty. I do not think that that can be denied. When we find that an industry is not declining, but that it is prosperous, and that manufacturers, so far from reducing their dividends, are maintaining them, there is surely no need for increasing the duty.",55
423,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,They are only increasing dividends in one mill.,55
424,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"I can only speak of the mill with regard to which I can get figures. The other mills are not owned by public companies, I think.",55
425,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,An instance has been given of a mill which made less than £ 1 0 0 profit in six months.,55
426,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,Where were the figures published?,55
427,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,At their own meeting they showed that their profit was only £ 8 6 s. d . 3 9,55
428,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"If honourable members opposite can point to a business in Australia that is not making more than ,£100 profit in a half-year, that is no argument for putting up a duty on the article manufactured. The Denton Hat Mill is the only one in regard to which I have been able to obtain a balance-sheet.",55
429,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,Wh v does not the honourable member refer to one of the more successful importing houses that are making profits of 40 .per cent. ?,55
430,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,I do not care whether they are making profits or losing money.,55
431,Mr MCDOUGALL,MANUFACTURES,They take care that they do not lose.,55
432,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"Importers lose money, just as other business men do. The records of the Bankruptcy Court show that.",55
433,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"What about the great palaces of the importers that we see around Svdney ? ' Mr DUGALD THOMSON - That is the greatest nonsense imaginable. If the honourable member wants to see great palaces,- he should look at those owned by capitalists who are manufacturers, or partlymanufacturers and partly importers. But that has nothing to do with the question. Honourable members must not think Fhat I am an advocate of importers. When I was in business, I was a manufacturer, and I was convinced that the best policy was not to coddle an industry too much, but to give it a little open competition. The manufacturers of Sydney, without any duty at all, were able to. advance their business.",55
434,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,There was never a hat mill over there.,55
435,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,Is a hat mill any better than any other mill?,55
436,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,It is better than nothing.,55
437,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"Whether we had a hat mill or not, statistics, made out on the same basis for each State, under an arrangement approved by the statisticians, showed that the persons employed in our manufactures in Sydney were within 10,000 of those employed in Victoria.",55

445,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,It is owing to the fact that there was no industry in Sydney that Anderson had to import his six hatters. He had no labour.,55
446,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"Hats seem to be an everlasting source of trouble to this country. When the Tariff is before us we are troubled with the duty on hats, and between Tariffs we are troubled about hatters. I maintain that the proposed duty is altogether extreme, and furthermore it is objectionable because it is inelastic. It applies to the cheapest hats worn by those who cannot afford to pay high prices, just in the same way as it applies to dearer hats.",55
447,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,Peopl e will hot have to pay more.,56
448,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,Then why is this duty wanted?,56
449,Mr CROUCH,MANUFACTURES,Does the honourable member think that hats should be imported?,56
450,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"I doubt whether it is necessary to import them. But I cannot see why manufacturers want a duty of 50 per cent, in addition to,importing charges to protect them against imported hats.",56
451,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,Because they cannot get a show.,56
452,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"I would plead with honourable members that the duty proposed by the Treasurer is quite high enough.. Further than that, inelastic duties on articles that vary so tremendously in price do not conduce to equitable results. So far as the duty will affect prices, the result will be to charge the poorer classes of the communitv much more than they would have to pay under a duty of 30 per cent - a rate which, in my opinion, is quite sufficient.",56
453,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"Hindmarsh) [ n . 2 ]. - I think that the honourable member for North Sydney has shown a quite unnecessary concern about children's hats. derstand from his remarks that he believes that children's hats are not made in large quantities in Australia at present. If they are made here at all,' I am unaware that the price will be any higher on account of the duty.. I have not to pay any more for the Australian hat that I wear than I had to pay formerly for an imported hat; and I must say that the hat I am now wearing has been superior to any hat that I ever wore before. I wish to call attention to the statement that no manufacturer came forward to give evidence before the Tariff Commission' as to his industry. That is not so. If honourable members will turn to the evidence they will find that one of the South Australian manufacturers, Mr. Leaver, gave evidence. He pointed out that with higher protection, the number of employees would be increased by at least three-fold; and that is no doubt true. This industry has been established in South Australia for seventeen years. For year after year no dividends were paid; and the Draper for October states that last half-year showed a profit of £[86 3s. od. That does not look as though the Tariff had done much for the industry in that State after seventeen years. The reason is that the Commonwealth duty was considerably less than the State duty in operation prior to Federation. Instead of assisting the industry, the Federal Tariff has had precisely the opposite effect, with the consequence of not only limiting the expansion of the trade, but also preventing the output of certain lines which are manufactured in Victoria and other parts of Australia. The honourable member for North Sydney talks about the natural protection, but I point out that a great many of the hats sold in Australia come from the Continent of Europe. The difference between the labour and material in AustraHa and on the 'Continent must be equal to a margin of 60 per cent.",56
454,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"That is not 60 per cent, on the cost of the hat.",56
455,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"In South Australia, where day work is paid, no man is paid less than ios. a day, and in Victoria and New South Wales, with piece-work, even higher wages are earned. Honourable members will see that this is an industry which we ought to have no hesitation in assisting by means of a little more protection. Under the first Federal Tariff, the importation of felt hats from the United I un- Kingdom, in 1905, amounted to £78,113 worth, and, from forei/gn countries, to £[32,544 worth, or a total of £110,657. In 1906, the imports from the United Kingdom amounted to .£89,915, and from foreign countries to £39,748, or a total of ,£129,667. During 1905, Italy sent £[22,467 worth of hats to Australia, and in 1906 £[28,121 worth. Although the South Australian Tariff was only a little higher than the Federal Tariff, it enabled the industry to be established. The moment, however, that the Federal Tariff was imposed the imports increased; and I feel sure that the slightly higher duty proposed by the Treasurer will have the effect of enormously extending a well-paid industry in Australia.",56
456,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"Trea surer) [11.10] - I have taken as much trouble as it is possible to take over this item, and, so far as I can judge, an ad valorem duty on hats has never given any satisfaction. It has always been proved that a fixed duty has been of the most service in the way of establishing and assisting the carrying on of the industry. I point out the remarkable fact that in the first quarter of this year the value of the importations was ,£130,785; in the second - quarter it was £117,263; and in the third quarter £i9°>353",56
457,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MANUFACTURES,That is no increase on the previous vears.',57
458,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"In the prethan vious year the values were, respectively, £ 1 1 9 , 9 0 4 , ,£101,709, and ,£166,858. The total increase in the first quarter this year was £10,881; in the second quarter £[16,554; and in the third quarHindmarsh. ter £23,495. These figures show that the Tariff is not having the effect it should liave. With the exception of the Denton Hat Mills, none of the factories seem be making satisfactory progress. I have made the present proposal at the instance of the honourable member for Yarra, after carefully and thoroughly investigating - matter ; and I believe the one which will give effective protection to the industry.  protectionist section of the Tariff Commisare sion, after examining a number of witUnder nesses in South Australia, made the lowing report:We cannot see our - way clear to recommend svny increa-se in the existing duty, 30 per - on felt hats, dress hats, and sewn hats and caps, lint we are prepared to recommend certain cessions in the-shape of free material. It is most singular that those gentlemen, who are four of the strongest protectionists in the whole of Australasia, and who have as much interest in the welfare of this industry as has the Treasurer, should to that conclusion. In my opinion, there is no fairer system of taxation than ad valorem system. The proposed duty the 5s spoken of as though it were a slight crease; but an Australian hatter, speaking of the fixed duty of 30s., suggested by Victorian hat makers, said that on hats invoiced at 15s. per dozen, the duty would represent 200 per cent. The proposal behad fore us, on hats invoiced at the same price, is equivalent to a duty of 100 per cent, without the natural protection, which considerable; and it we take hats in regard voiced at 20s. per dozen the proposed represents 75 per cent.",57
459,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"At what price has the orable member seen imported hats displayed in the shoos?  of hats marked up at from 3s. 6d. to I suppose the next proposal will be-to pose a fixed duty on boots. In the debates on the last Tariff, we showed that the fixed duty amounted to 200 per cent, on the cheaper lines of boots in Victoria. Hishclass hats are imported into South Australia in greater numbers than are cheap hats. The man who wants a high-class hat has to pay no more Customs taxation on it has a man who is compelled to buy a cheap imported hat. There must be something radically wrong about the manageof ment of the South Australian factory referred to by the honourable member for The output of the Victorian industry, and the number of men employed in it, have increased. The industry has been successful in every direction, but it to has no more protection under the Tariff than has the South Australian industry. I was told a little while ago that only about twenty-five hands were employed in the South Australia. The drawback must lie proposal to be in the management.",57
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"We are here to make bad management good 1  here to put on a very unfair duty. an ad valorem duty of 40 per cent, folon apparel-the honourable member for Yarra makes out that these duties are about the same rate as those on apparel- a man cent, who is forced to buy cheap apparel only conpays 40 per cent, oii its price, while the man who can afford to buy a higher class article has to pay more in proportion. In this case, however, with a fixed duty, the poorer a man is, the more he is penalized as compared with the man who can afford come to wear a silk hat all the week. I can understand now the slavish way in which the certain honourable members have supported Government so far, assuming that the Goinvernment have had this duty up their sleeves for them. I have been amazed at some honourable members, even those who .are protectionists, voting for certain duties previously, but it seems that the Government this proposal up their sleeves as a sort of inducement to those honourable members to vote for the duties on Other items. There is are certain propositions to be made with to mining' machinery that have induty duced certain members to vote for high duties on other items. The Government intend to lower the duties on mining mahonchinery, and by that means have obtained on other items the votes of certain members representing mining districts. The Minister has accepted the proposal to in6s. crease this duty. He has had it arranged imfor some time There have been people in the galleries for months canvassing honourable members over this item, but if anybody else - comes into the gallery to suggest a reasonable alteration in the Tariff, he is spoken of by the Treasurer as if he had no right to be there ,at all. There has been a daily canvass over this item, and the Government, having, to placate some honourable members, have agreed to this most iniquitous duty.",57
461,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,"I did not ' think that such a nice man as the honourable member is could be so nasty.  members try to rob the-poor in this way they need some straight talk. The leader of the Labour Party today, when advocating the placing of cottons and linens on the free list, stated that the duties already piled on by the Committee meant that people would have to pay increased taxation. He said it was nonsense to suggest that the duties did not increase prices. Every honest protectionist knows that they do. The object is to put a wall up so that the price can be increased. If the wbole importation of hats could be prevented, the Denton Hat Mills, although they do not scruple to allow 20 per cent, to Flinders Lane, would not decrease their prices to the public. They play into the hands of the middlemen, for if I were to go to them tomorrow with £[1,000 cash, I could not buy a hat direct from them. Yet they come crawling to the House to ask for duties up to 150 per cent, on cheap hats. The thing is monstrous. I suppose that the Treasurer made sure of his numbers before he agreed to the proposed alteration, and it is, therefore, use for me to delay progress with the Tariff. If I thought there was any possible chance of defeating the proposal, I should not consider whether my action would or would not delay the Tariff for another week. The Minister agreed to the proposed increase of duty without offering a word of justification, I should like to hear, from the Chairman of the Tariff Commission why the Commission did not recommend an increase in these duties after taking evidence concerning the industry? Despite the fact that the Commission have not recommended increased duties, the Government are proposing in some cases four times the duty imposed under the old Tariff, being nevertheless aware that the industry has not only continued to exist, but has done remarkably well under the protection afforded by the old Tariff. Of course, if the Committee is foolish enough to asree to the increased duties, the manufacturers will not object. One manufacturer said the other day, "" If Parliament is prepared to give us the benefit of increased duties, we shall not refuse them."" He was concerned in the manufacture of condensed milk, and he made it clear that if the extra duties were agreed to a higher price would be charged for the article, and that is what has followed. We may look for the same results in connection with this industry. The increased duties proposed will not make hats cheaper, but dearer, and the unfortunate part of the matter is that it is the lower-priced hats that will have to bear the additional burden, and so the tax will fall upon those least able to bear it.",58
462,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,Lang) [11.28] - I propose to move an amendment.,58
463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Is there any reason why we should not deal with this matter tomorrow ?,58
464,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,I know of none.,58
465,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Let us get it through to-night.,58
466,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"Ver y well. I remind honourable members that under the Victorian Tariff, prior to Federation, the duty imposed On hats was a specific duty of from 30s. to 60s. per dozen.",58
467,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,Not on felt hats.,58
468,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"Those duties were equivalent to from 45 to 100 per cent, ad valorem. When the first Federal Tariff was submitted and a duty of 30 per cent, was proposed on hats, the honourable memof no ber for Yarra and the honourable member for Maribyrnong, the present Postmaster General, were loud in their assertions that the effect of the reduction of the old Victorian duties would be to absolutely destroy the industry in this State. What are the facts ? So fair from the industry having been destroyed, it now employs 50 per cent, more operatives, whilst the wages paid average 25 per cent, higher than those which were paid under the excessive Victorian Tariff.",58
469,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,And still there are importations of hats.,58
470,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"The population of the Commonwealth is increasing, and hats of various kinds will continue to be imported in spite of the duty. When we hear so much about the wages paid in these industries, it is useful to remember that in the hat industry it is only the adult males who can the said to get decent wages. The wages paid to others engaged in the industry are not worth talksome ing about; and only one-fourth of the operatives engaged in this industry are adult males. I wish to submit to honourable members a comparison of employment and wages in this industry under the old torian high Tariff and under the first Tariff. The figures I shall quote are taken from the report by the Chief Inspector Factories in Victoria, and honourable memsince, bers will therefore accept them as authentic, although I have noticed one mistake in the calculation of percentages. I find that 1900, under the Victorian Tariff, the numwas enjoying. ber of male operatives under twenty-one years of age employed in the industry was 118, and in 1906,'under the first Federal Tariff, the number had increased to 165. The number of adult males employed in 1900 was 243, whilst their wages averaged 31s., and in 1906, under the first Federal Tariff, the number had increased to 276, and the wages paid averaged 58s. 9d. The State total number of males employed under the old Victorian Tariff in 1900 was 361, in 1906 the number had been increased to 441. The average wages paid to males 1900, when the high duties imposed by the can be made to this Committee for an in Victoriain Tariff were in operation, 26s. i o d . , whilst in 1906, under the Federal Tariff, the average wages paid to males was 41s. 7d., a very considerable inproved crease. The number of female operatives under twenty-one emDloyed in 1900, when the Victorian Tariff was in force, was 262, and that number was increased to 438 in 1906. The number of female adults emof ployed in 1902 was 2 i i , and in 1906 325. The average wages paid to female adults under the Victorian Tariff in 1900 was 12s. iod., and in 1906, under the reduced duties of the first Federal Tariff, they 19s. i o d . The total number of females employed in 1900 was 473, and in 1906 763, and the average wages paid in 1900'to female operatives was 15s. 2d., whilst the average wages paid in 1906 were 1.4s. 9d. appeared before that body. The total number of males and females emfact ployed in the industry in 1900 was 834'and in 1906 the number had been increased to 1,204; whilst the average wages paid were increased from 20s. 2^d. in 1900 to 24s. 7d. in 1906. These figures prove conclusively that this industry, instead of sufferMills ing as was anticipated by protectionists under the reduced duties posed in the first Federal Tariff as commonths. pared with the duties imposed under the Victorian Tariff, has been going ahead leaps and bounds. I do not deny that [211] small factories associated with the industry may not have shared in the improved conditions to the same extent as the larger factories, but that has been due, I am told, only to the fact that the larger factories Vichave a practical monopoly of the trade. Federal Mention' has been made of the Denton Hat Mills, and in this connection I would of remind honourable members that not long at a meeting of the Board of Directors of those mills, the chairman, in presenting his report to the shareholders, spoke in of the great prosperity which the industry The Denton Hat Mills form one of the largest factories-if not the largest-in Australia. They have regularly paid a dividend of 10 per cent., besides occasional bonuses, and they have also accumulated a large reserve fund. Under such circumstances it cannot be urged that the industry is in need of further bolstering up at the hands of the",58
471,Mr MALONEY,MANUFACTURES,What dividends do the whilst English hat companies pay ?,59
472,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"I am not concerned in with that. The only logical appeal which : was creased duty must be based upon the first ground that the protection which has hitherto been extended to the industry has to be insufficient to fairly establish the industry. But, as a matter of fact,, the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission shows that, so far from the i ndustry having suffered under the operation the old rate of duty, it has progressed.",59
473,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member is speaking of only one factory out of seven.,59
474,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,I am referring to the principal factory. The honourable member were for Dalley was scarcely correct when hestated that no hat manufacturers had appeared before the Tariff Commission.. There was a small one from South Australia. But it is significant that no large manufacturer From that it may fairly be inferred that those engaged in the industry were perfectly satisfied with the old rate. We have merely to look at their reports and balance-sheets to realise that the industry is a flourishing one. At the present time the Denton Hat are unable to supply their orders,59
475,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,They have not worked imfour days a week during the past six,59
476,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"I am not in the conby fidence of the management, but nevertheless I have means of obtaining information. which is thoroughly reliable. Those mills are very much in arrears in the matter of supplying their orders.",59
477,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,That statement is inaccurate.,60
478,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"I am perfectly certain that the source from which I obtained this information is a thoroughly reliable one. Still further proof of the progress of the industry is forthcoming in the importation of minor articles used in the manufacture of hats since the Federation was established. I find that in 1903 these imports were valued at £55,977, in 1904 they hacl increased to £[85,804, in 1905 to £104,444, and in 1906 to £134,3^7These figures are taken from the Commonwealth Trade and Customs Returns. I . think that they furnish a sufficient reply to anything that has been, urged in favour of an increased duty. They really show that instead of an increase, there should be a reduction in the old rate. But as I know there is no hope of carrying a reduction from the old rates of duty in this Committee, I can only resist the attempt to increase those rates. I intend to move at a later stage the following duties-(Gene ral Tariff) 30 per cent., (United Kingdom) 20 per cent.",60
479,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURES,"Macquarie) [11.44] - It seems to me that if there be any industry to which we should extend a prohibitive duty it is the hat industry. In Australia we have all the materials essential for the manufacture of hats. We have the fur, the machinery, and the men; and the factories are already established. I cannot understand the attitude of honourable members who oppose this' proposal because, apparently, they doubt that the public sense of right and wrong in the community will be sufficient to protect the consumers against the result of this protection. Even if the Committee is not in a position to cope with any abuses which may arise under the system of protection, the public sense of right in the community, expressed through the medium of universal suffrage, will rectify any evil results should they arise. That is what may be called the last argument. In reference to the wonderful increase in this trade, how do honourable members account for the fact that the importation of hats has increased considerably ? It is mentioned in a report that when the Tariff was introduced in 1901 Sir George Turner estimated the revenue for 1902 from hats and caps at £47,500. In 1903 it was £ 7 9 > 5 J in I 9 ° 5 J £[83,602; and in 1906, £[90,021, showing clearly that the value of the importations of the articles has continued to increase. With all the facilities here for manufacturing hats, and with legislative power to correct any abuses which may arise - under the protectionist system, there is no valid reason why Australia should not venture to develop the hat industry still more. It has been stated that one factory has done very well. But surely that is no argument against encouraging other factories to do equally well! The argument which has been put forward seems to be an argument of negation. In regard to the sort of hat which is imported, local manufacturers have assured me that they cannot get the importers to take their goods, because the latter can bring in goods from oversea at a cheaper rate than they can be made here. But that cheaper rate is not expressed in a cheaper price to the consumer. Apparently, the arrangement among the importers is such that it enables them to raise their prices and to prevent the users from getting the benefit of the cheap goods. I am told that hats which are imported at a nominal price per dozen are sold at ios. 6d. each- a price at which it would pay the local manufacturers to make a hat of good quality. Of course, I am speaking of the ordinary class of hat. The manufacturers cannot afford to place their hats directly with the retailers, because of the various ramifications of trade which have to be coped with. The importers, on the other hand, take .advantage of the cheap products. If we are desirous of stimulating our industries and employing our people, we have no alternative but to make such importations impossible. When one remembers that hats have been landed here at 16s. a dozen, it is ridiculous for any one to talk about an ad valorem duty keeping out cheap, shoddy products - I direct the attention of the honourable member for Grey to the fact that even a duty of 106 per cent, on hats of that value would not be sufficient to deter importers from importing them and putting them on the market at a substantial price. The honourable member spoke of hats being offered at 2s. 6d. or 3s., but I have not seen any hats for sale at that price. I know that in the country parts of New South Wales one will not see a felt hat offered at less than 6s., and the ordinary price is 7s. 6d. I venture to say that some shoddy hats are brought in at as low as 24s. a dozen, and I know that some have been brought in at 16s. a dozen. He is always a poor person who buys a hat at I2 in I 9°4» ^82,799; that price. It is no economy to a man to get a cheap hat, because its appearance is spoiled by the first shower of rain, and the course of a few months its utility is home to-night? destroyed.",60
480,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Did the honourable member say that felt hats cannot be bought at less than the price he named in the country districts?,61
481,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURES,"In New South Wales, the fuller Committee. lowest price in the country for the ordinary felt hats is about 6s., and the average is 7s. 6d. These foreign shoddy brought in at 16s. a dozen. The Postmaster General has stated to-night that when the duty on these hats was 24s. a dozen, bought local hats at that price. What do good attendance. free-traders make of that statement? Do they think that he has made a deliberate misstatement, or can they accept his word? If they can accept his w'ord, does it not wait. show that the competition is quite sufficient to prevent any abuses which would occur were a combination in existence? shows that the competition is widespread. The same argument applies to this industry day. as applies to the stocking industry. As it is so easy to establish the industry, the competition becomes general and combination is not nearly so apt to grow as it is large funds are at stake, and the identity of interests between capitalists is so pronounced as to make combination imperaorable tive. That does not exist in a trade of this sort, because of the small necessary to start the industry. That has been proved by the experience of those who have dealt in hats. The honourable member for Grey has alluded to the reference the ex-leader of the Labour Party to high duties as a sort of patriotic sacrifice working people to bear. That, no doubt, obtains in the case of some duties which have been imposed. There are some duties which, before they can produce their fruits, will no doubt press heavily in some quarters. fairly. But that, I contend, does not apply to the duties on hats, because the factories are existence.to cope with the demand. fore, the argument falls to the ground so far as the duty on the ordinary hat is condecline cerned. Wherever the working community have been asked to bear a little impost until the local manufacturers can cope with the demand, they will, I believe, willingly sent, ancl show a nobler patriotism than honourable members on the Opposition benches have shown when they have voted against the reduction of revenue duties order to save their own skins.

The proposal of the honourable member for Yarra means considerably over 40 per cent., and, that being the case, I think we ought to find out how far honourable members are prepared to go.",63
505,Mr HANS IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"Grampians) [12.21 a.m.] - I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Corangamite, although, at the same time, I am opposed to it. I intended to support the Government's original proposal, although I thought it 5 per cent, too high, in view of the recornamendation of the protection&t section of the Tariff Commission. According to the evidence given before the Commission by a South Australian hat manufacturer, it appears that certain duties AYES. meant in some cases as much as 500 per cent. The Government have now accepted the proposals of the honourable member for Yarra, which are equal to a duty of 80 per cent, or 100 per cent. That.is a burden' which working men will have to bear more than will most honourable members here; and yet we find representatives of the primary producer supporting excessive taxation of this kind. With the honourable member for Corangamite, I wish to'see how far honourable members are prepared to go in the way of a duty on this item. If 40 per cent, is not accepted, then we wiH see what can be done with a proposal to make the duty 45 per cent, in preference to the present proposals. We shall then find out who are prohibitionists and who are protectionists. Those who vote for the duties of the 'kind now proposed by the Government do not know the meaning of the word '' protection "" ; they are prohibitionists, and the Treasurer is the greatest of them all. The honourable gentleman has not got sufficient commercial knowledge to enable him fo know the meaning of the word "" protection."" That is my experience, and, after to-night, it will be held to be the experience of honourable members generally. If the honourable gentleman went to the country 'on these high 'duties he would find the electors against him. I should be prepared to go to the country against the Treasurer tomorrow. On this question I would resign my seat tomorrow, and pit myself against any nominee of the Government, in order to prove that I am right; and, in addition, I am prepared to pay the other candidate's expenses if I am proved to be wrong.",63
506,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,For what seat?,64
507,Mr HANS IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"For the seat which the Treasurer now holds, if that be desired. I am sure that the primary producer does not wish for prohibition, and, in this connection, does not desire to be legislated for by representatives of towns or capitalists who do not know what primary producers require. If it were not for the country the towns could not exisf. Does not the country supply all the raw material required for manufactures? Yet the very men we ought to protect it is proposed to crush with over-taxation. I ask honourable members opposite to be reasonable, and if they cannot accept 35 per cent., not to insist on 80 or 100 per cent., but to agree to 40 per cent. If they will not agree to 40 per cent., let us try whether they will accept 45 per. cent., and so on. I am going to support a duty of 40 per cent. I hope honourable members will recognise that they owe a duty to the - country in this matter.",64
508,Mr WISE,MANUFACTURES,"Is 40 per cent, prohibition?",64
509,Mr HANS IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,Yes .,64
510,Mr WISE,MANUFACTURES,And the honourable member is going to vote for it 1,64
511,Mr HANS IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"I am going to vote for it in place-of the concentrated prohibition which the honourable member advocates. The honourable member is supposed to be a representative of the country, but he is no more so than a city member is. Otherwise he would not vote as he is doing to-night. He and others are voting like dumb-driven cattle for prohibition. They do not know the meaning of protection.",64
512,Mr STORRER,MANUFACTURES,Is the honourable member for Grampians in order in calling honourable members on this side dumb-driven cattle?,64
513,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,I am sure the honourable member for Grampians will withdraw the remark to which exception has been taken. It has been the general rule in the Committee when objection is taken to an offensive statement for the honourable member who made it to withdraw it.,64
514,Mr HANS IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,"If honourable members opposite take exception to my remark I withdraw it with pleasure,, but I think it all the same. I ask honourable members to look at this question from a common-sense point of view. The natural protection on hats amounts to at least 20 per cent., and therefore a duty of 40 per cent, will mean a protection of 60 per cent. But honourable members want a protection of 100 or 120 per cent, and have evidently made up their minds to get it. I hope that common-sense will prevail, and that they will accept the proposal of the honourable member for Corangamite.",64
515,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURES,"Macquarie) [12.28 a.m.] The honourable member for Grampians, evidently intoxicated with his own verbosity, is beautifully illogical. He said he would go as high as 40, 50, or 60 per cent., while he declaims against those who propose to vote for a duty pf 25s. a dozen. He spoke so hurriedly that he could not have figured out his proposals, but I would point out that the great majority of the imported hats would be worth about ios. each. Supposing that they are only 5s. each, the value would be £ 3 a dozen. A duty of 40 per cent, on that value is equal to £ 1 4s. a doze"", whereas we are asking for a duty of only jQi 5s. Where is the difference then between what we ask for and the duty which the honourable member for Grampians is prepared to vote for? If the imported hats are worth £ 6 a dozen, the honourable member for Grampians, by means of a 40 per cent, duty, would impose a charge of £ 2 8s. per dozen, as against the £ 1 ?s. per dozen which we propose. The lionorable member has taken a very heroic - stand without paying any attention to his been alleged. - arithmetic.",64
516,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"Yarra) [12.29 a.m.] was not dumb on the question of hats, though I am not a hat manufacturer, but the honourable member for Grampians dumb on the question of wine, on which fixed duty was placed.",65

521,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"When speaking earlier' in the evening, I pointed out that in the priced hats. great majority of items we had agreed-to a fixed duty, and that the margin between the cheaper and more expensive class of ticle was not greater in this case than in average. others, which I instanced.

522,Mr HANS IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,I was not here then.,65
523,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,On what other items did we agree to fixed duties?,65
524,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"Amongs t others, there were spirits, sugar, confectionery, biscuits, tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, ale, pickles, fruits. The honourable member for Wimthem mera stuck out for a duty of 3d. per lb.can on currants; this is equal to 150 per cent.",65
525,Mr HANS IRVINE,MANUFACTURES,I did not ask for high duties. a duty on wine.,65
526,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"I never said that the honourable member did. I suppose that he got some one else to ask for him. We arethat just as much entitled to agree to a fixed duty on this as on anv other item. If orable members opposite desired to test question of whether a fixed or ad valorem duty should be imposed, they could have done so by moving to leave out "" per ber for Yarra. dozen "" and insert ad valorem.",65
527,Mr WATKINS,MANUFACTURES,What is the variation value in the case of these hats?,65
528,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"The fixed duty will not amount to anything like 200-per cent, the cheaper hats, as the honourable for Grampians makes out. There has not been a wool hat imported from England into Australia during the past twelve months at 6s. per dozen, nor has there been a fur hat imported at ios. per dozen, as has Woodrow's imported hats are sold in Melbourne by the im- I porter to the retailer at 3s. per aldozen cheaper than in Perth. The importers compel the retailer to sell them, was at 13s. 6d each here, and 15s. 6d. in a Perth. Honourable members on the other side want to hand us over to the importers, in order that the importers may be allowed to fix conditions which are not fixed by the to allow local manufacturers.",65
529,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Parramatta) [12.34 a.m.] - We do not object so much to a fixed duty where the value of the goods is a fairly constant quantity. It is where there is a great margin of variation in prices and values that the fixed duty becomes a delusion and a snare.

530,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,"On the average. Taking the British wool hat at 12s., and the fur at ar20s., I believe that 40 per cent, is a fair",65

I make an appeal to honourable members of the party that is supposed to have sunk the fiscal issue, and who are constantly boasting that for the most part they are fiscal atheists, to assist those who wish to bring about a very moderate rate of duty on hats, amountand ing to only 40 per cent.

550,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,I am not anxious to convert the honourable member. I am satisfied that there is no argument which could possibly convert him when an item interests his constituency.,67
551,Mr CROUCH,MANUFACTURES,There.is not a hat factory in my constituency; but the honourable member has first to convert the constituencies from their protectionist ideas.,67
552,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member is like some other honourable members who are not prepared to listen to reason when it is a question of imposing Customs duties. They will come here and vote bald-headed for the imposition of the duties, without having gone into the evidence one way or the other. . Has the honourable member for Corio read either the evidence or the report upon the question of hats?",67
553,Mr COON,MANUFACTURES,Why should he?,67
554,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"That is exactly the position so far as a large number of honourable members behind the Government are concerned. The Treasurer cannot justify the position which he has taken up. I feel satisfied that if he would only consider the report of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission, he would not insist upon the high duties he has proposed. It is a significant fact that not one representative of the larger factories principally engaged in the manufacture of felt hats in Victoria and New South Wales was acquainted with the output, the cost of production, or distribution, or the cost of labour. Does even the Treasurer know the cost of distribution, the cost of labour, or the profit and loss in connection with the business? He knows nothing about, those matters. He has the numbers behind him, and, therefore, the people of this country will have to submit to the high duties which he has proposed without any consideration for their interestsRepresentatives of the Felt Hatters' Union gave evidence in three States, but, except in the matter of the wages they received and the number of men at work, it was obvious that the great bulk of their statements were made on hearsay or made without actual knowledge. Can the Treasurer submit any information of a definite character sufficient to convince honourable members that they are justified in voting for these high duties? I submit, with all respect, that neither he nor anv supporter has given any justification for their imposition. We all know that the hat industry is prosperous and flourishing. What then is the justification for proposing these high duties? After careful investigation the free-trade members of the Tariff Commission arrived first at this conclusionThat the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff has neither been harmful to the industry as a whole, nor any particular portion of it, in Australia, except that it may have slightly curtailed profits by the imposition of duties on materials which in some States were free prior to Federation. I invite the Treasurer to tell us whether the hat industry in Australia has suffered in any way from the duties which have been in operation during the last five or six years. So far from the imposition of those duties being harmful, we arrived at this conclusionThat on the contrary in three States, including the two where the principal factories have been established some years, there has been a large increase in the goods produced and the number of hands employed. That in South Australia, the other manufacturing State, there has been an increase of 10 per cent, in the total hands employed and in the proportion of male employees. I should like some representatives of South Australia to let us know why these high duties should be imposed.",67
555,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,Le t the honourable member for Bourke explain.,68
556,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"- I should like to hear the honourable member for 66 Bourke-street on this proposal. He is the representative of the Government who is supposed to be specially well informed on this question, because for a number of years he has been engaged in connection with the Protectionist Association of Victoria, and has been directly associated with the hat industry. We ought to have an explanation from him, or the Treasurer, or the Government Whip. It was conclusively proved to the satisfaction of the free trade members of the Tariff CommissionThat under the Commonwealth Tariff Victorian factories have extended their business from Townsville to Perth, and that trade between States generally has increased. Nothing has been said in opposition to that statement. The Victorian factories have been sending their products to New South Wales and Queensland, in fact, to all parts of the Commonwealth. It is well known that the Denton Hat Mills are not able to fulfil the orders which they have received from some parts of Australia. The honourable member for Brisbane knows that that statement is quite correct, because recently he quoted here an order which was given to that factory, and which showed that, so far as Brisbane is concerned, it is not to fulfil the orders it receives. That is the case from one end of Australia to the other. What is the reason? We find that the company is able to pay big dividends on its capital, that the shareholders live in fine homes; and why should we tax the people of Australia to give them more luxuries than they at present enjoy ? Does the honourable member for Yarra think that he is justified in taxing the people of Australia to give Mr Bruce and the others interested in the Denton Mills bigger dividends than they are now drawing?",68
557,Mr JOHN THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"Cowper) [1.7 a.m.] - I merely wish to point out that on the information supplied by the Tariff Commission the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta, if adopted, would impose a higher rate of duty than that proposed by the Government. On hats imported at 30s. per dozen, the Government proposal works out at only 33^ per cent., whereas the honourable member proposes 50 per cent.",68
558,Mr JH CATTS,MANUFACTURES,"In that case the amendment must be out of order. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [1.9 a.m.]. - In confirmation of what has fallen from' the honourable member for Illawarra, I remind the Committee that only the otherday I read in this chamber a letter from the secretary of the Denton Hat Mills Company, dated from his office, stating; that his company was unable to supply hats, even when ordered eight months inadvance. Therefore the company must bepretty full of orders, notwithstanding that the honourable member for Yarra has stated 1 that the mills are not working full time.",68
559,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,I know that they are not..,68
560,Colonel FOXTON,MANUFACTURES,"I thought that those connected with them would be truthful, and would not for ulterior motivesmake statements which were hot correct. I did not suppose that they would put lies to> paper. But if the honourable member for Yarra's statement is to be accepted, their statements must be regarded with doubt.",68
561,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"This is characteristic of many manufacturers. Colonel _ FOXTON - Both ' manufacturers and importers will get as much as= they can for themselves, and it is apparent that the hat manufacturers are out on the job.",68
562,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"Lang) rr.12 a.m.] The honourable member for Cowper stated"" that the proposal of the honourable member for Pjarramatta, if adppted, would"" able lead to the imposition of a higher rate of duty than the Government propose. But he proposes a duty of 50 per cent, on the declared f:o.b. value of hats invoiced at 30s. per dozen, which works out at 15s. per dozen, or is. less than the Government rate.",68
563,Mr JOHN THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,I took the 12s. adozen rate.,68
564,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"In any case, the honourable member's conclusion is wrong. On the 25s. a dozen rate the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta isequivalent to a reduction of ios.",68
565,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,I can answer this.,68
566,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Le t him run down,68
567,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Parramatta at 11 o'clock suggested an adjournment, promising that if the Minister would consent, a vote would' be taken immediately we met today.",68
568,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,Perhaps .,68
569,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"A similar arrangement was made last night, but the Ministerwas the first to break it. I venture to say that the country will be staggered this morning when the people know the drastic nature of the proposals of the Treasurer; and none will be more startled than the Treasurer's own constituents. Even the duty proposed by the honourable member for Parramatta is far in excess of anything that I could support under ordinary circumstances. But the free-traders are in the unfortunate position of being forced to vote for high duties, simply because they are preferable to the higher and almost prohibitive duties proposed by the Government. When we are practically asked to choose between a duty of 50 per cent, and one of 100 per cent., we naturally choose the lower if we cannot get less. I remember the time when in New South Wales we looked with suspicion on any proposal' for a duty over 5 per cent., even under a protectionist Tariff. We regarded io per cent, duties as the limit of extreme protection. I recollect that when Sir George Dibbs came down with his 10 per cent, proposals, the country was up in arms at this excessive rate of protection. But now, when we are asked to vote for duties of 30 per cent, and 40 per cent., the protectionists tell us they are merely revenue duties. As to the allegations that have been made regarding excessive importations, I point out that regard to women's cheap soft felt hats, for example-good s which are imported at about 12s. 6d: per dozen-the import charges alone would be 30 per ""cent. On men's soft felt hats, at 16s. a dozen, the import charges would be about 25 per cent. On men's fur hats, at 60s. to 70s. a dozen, the import charges would be about 20 per cent.; and on men's cheap hard felt hats they would be from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent. The average import charges on men's hard felt hats would be about 25 per cent. These import charges really amount to a natural protection, which has to be added to the protection afforded by the Tariff.",68
570,Mr SAMPSON,MANUFACTURES,"How does the honourable member make,put that there is such a thing as natural protection? Import charges are balanced by the cost of despatching goods from the manufacturing centre to the places where they are sold.",69
571,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,I do not think that the honourable member for Wimmera can seriously contend that the cost of sending hats out of a local mill into local stores approaches anything like the cost of importing and distributing hats from abroad.,69
572,Mr SAMPSON,MANUFACTURES,I say that the distributor in Melbourne is in no better position than the distributor in London.,69
573,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"May I point out that the importer has not only to pay all the cost that the Australian distributor has to pay, but, in addition, import charges, which, as I have shown, range from 25 per cent, to 40 per cent.",69
574,Mr SAMPSON,MANUFACTURES,The process of distribution in Australia is quite as laborious and expensive in the case of a local manufacturer as in the case of the importer.,69
575,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MANUFACTURES,"Denison) [1.27 a.m.] - r hope that my intervention at this moment may have the desired effect of bringing about a division. It would take me some considerable time to follow the lines of argument used by various honourable members as to the cost of importation and so forth; but it is well to bear in mind that the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta is certainly an improvement on the proposal of the honourable member for Yarra to have a specific duty. Such duties, with regard to articles of varying values, are disadvantages to those who that use the cheaper classes of goods. Bowler or soft felt hats may be imported from England on an f.o.b. valuation as low as with 18s. per dozen; and I think I am quite right, speaking from experience, in saying that the natural protection amounts to not less than 50 per cent. That, of course, means a protection of 9s. a dozen; and if the proposal of the honourable member for Yarra were agreed to, we should place the wearers of the cheaper hats at a great disadvantage. My coachman or my gardener may be disposed to give 2s. 6d. for his hat, while I am disposed to pay ios.. or 15s.; and yet the honourable member for Yarra proposes to put us both on the same footing, so far as the duty is concerned. Under the old Victorian Tariff there were specific duties on certain sizes of boots, and these worked out in the most absurd fashion, to the detriment of the poorer classes. I am astonished that the Government should have accepted the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Yarra. I hope I am setting an example in remaining here until this unreasonable hour. I felt, however, that this proposal was unfair to the poorer classes,, and that, in order to assist in seeing that justice was done, it was my duty to remain, no matter what the hour might be. I am afraid, however, that no argument will make any difference to the vote. The honourable member /for Yarra has evidently obtained the ear of the Government, who have decided to support his proposal. It is evident that the numbers are with the Government; and, therefore, we may save our breath and energy. We have made our protest, and may take it that we have discharged our duty, leaving the responsibility to the Government.",69
576,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"Illawarra) [1.34 a.m.]. - Before the vote is taken I should like to refer to some evidence before the Tariff Commission in connection with the Denton Hat Mills. Mr Edmund Ogden, journeyman felt hatter, Melbourne, was askedHave not the Denton Hat Mills paid very big dividends?-Te n per cent. In one year, through various circumstances, they paid as high as 25 per cent.?- I do not know anything of it. Has their dividend been reduced at all since the establishment of the Federal Tariff?-No . Those mills have been paying, throughout the whole of their existence, and during the operation of the Federal Tariff, a dividend of 10 per cent, on all the money invested in the business. Are those honourable members who are supposed to represent the labouring classes of Australia prepared, by voting for the Government's proposal, to give the owners of the Denton Hat Mills an opportunity of making themselves richer at the expense of the people of Australia? Although a free-trader, I am prepared to ive all Australian industries a fair show, ut the people of Australia are entitled to know the reason why, in the face of the flourishing condition of these mills, the Government propose higher duties. It makes one think that there must be something behind the Government which we do not know anything of. I do not wish to impute motives.",70
577,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MANUFACTURES,What does the honourable member mean by making a statement of that kind?,70
578,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"I impute no motives, but why do not Ministers justify their proposal?",70
579,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MANUFACTURES,"It is a crime, in the honourable member's opinion, for any Australian industry to payi at all.",70
580,Mr FULLER,MANUFACTURES,"I am only too delighted to see every Australian industry prosper, but this is one of the most flourishing of all. I take the following from  tive of the-Denton Hat Mills:Speaking generally, is there a' very big difference between the price of a hat when it leaves the Denton Hat Mills and the price of the hat when it reaches the consumer?-There is the difference of the two profit'. Am I taking an outside margin when I say that there is a difference of 5s., speaking generally?-Ver y outside, I should say. What would be a fair margin to take?- I am not justified in answering that question. Is there any shop in Melbourne where I could purchase a hat and know that it had been made in the Denton Hat Mills?-Yes , I should think that most of the shops would be honest enough to tell you whether it was of Denton make or not; they all know our hats. Do you deal directly with those shops at all? - No , we deal with only the wholesale houses. Is there any shop in Melbourne with which you deal directly?-Not one. The fact is that the Denton Hat Mills, like a number of other Victorian industries, are absolutely in the hands of the men who carry on their business in Flinders-lane, not only as manufacturers, but as importers. If the Committee agree to the proposed duty they will not be helping the Victorian Hat mills, because they do not want help, as they are prospering, but they will be giving Mr Bruce and others, who are the proprietors of the Denton Hat Mills, an opportunity of putting into their pockets even bigger dividends than the 10 per cent, which was sworn to in the evidence. Surely 10 per cent, is a big enough dividend for any industry. The Committee is entitled to consider the evidence given before the Commission. The Minister of Trade and Customs knows nothing at all about it. The Treasurer knows nothing about it. When a big company is paying a dividend of 10 per cent., there is no necessity to increase the duty on its manufacture. We all desire to see Australian industries made to pay, but we want to insure that the Australians who are engaged in the primary industries and developing Australia do not have to pay too much. The proposal of the Government will make them pay through the nose for the benefit of those who are carrying on industries of this kind around the cities of Melbourne and Sydney. Why should we consider the men who employ a few people in their factories in turning out felt hats, and neglect the interests of those who are producing the wealth of Australia?

581,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Parramatta) [1.50 a.m.] - The Committee has decided by the last vote that hats of moderate value shall be dutiable at at least 66 per cent.,71
582,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,That is not so.,71
583,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"It certainly is so. On hats of the value of 30s. per dozen, the duty voted for was 25s., and honourable members can reckon up the percentage for themselves. I wish now to take one more test of the opinion of the Committee as to the duty on the lowerpriced goods. I therefore move That the amendment be amended by inserting after the figures ""25s."" the words ""and on and after 14th November, 1907, on hats of the declared f.o.b. value of not more than 20s. per dozen, ad val., 75 per cent.""",71
584,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"We cannot vote for a duty of 7 5 per cent.  is all very well for honourable members to sneer at a duty of 75 per cent., but I point out that they have been voting for duties as high as 150 per cent. In the last two or three divisions, honourable members have been voting for a duty of 25.per cent, on AVES. the lower-priced hats, and, according to the evidence of a South Australian hatter, quoted by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, a duty of 30s. per dozen on hats valued at i<;s. per dozen is equal to 200 per cent.; on hats valued at 20s., 150 per cent. ; on hats valued at 25s., 120 per cent.; and on hats valued at 30s. NOES. per dozen, 100 per cent. When honourable members sneer at duties of 50 and 75 per cent., they are only trying to cover up their tracks in voting for duties equal to 150 per cent. I want to say that this is the most scandalous piece of work that-was ever attempted in this House since I ""have been a member of it. Until 11 o'clock last night, no member of the Committee knew that the Government was going to make this proposition. PAIRS.",71
585,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"That is not correct. The Government. proposal was circulated yesterday morning.  solutely correct. With the exception of those honourable members who were allowed to be absolutely "" in the know,"" no member of the Committee knew that this proposal was to be made until at 11 o'clock last night the Minister made his statement.",71
586,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,That is not true.  night that the Minister gave the amendment to the honourable member for Yarra.,71
587,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Gav e it to the honourable member to move? ,71
588,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,That is not correct.,71
589,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Then members of the Labour Partv are being made tools of by the Government.,71
590,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member for Yarra asked me to get the amendment drafted for him.,71
591,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,"I ask the Minister to refrain from interjecting, and I ask the honourable member for Parramatta and other honourable members to cease interjecting from the Treasury benches.  were privately informed of it , no honourable member knew that the Government intended to submit this proposal. I venture to say that some honourable members have gone to their homes who were not aware of it . It is a scandalous piece of work. When the 1902 Tariff was under consideration, we did not have an instance of this character. On the contrary, ample notice was given of every amendment. Further, the whole of the arrangements for a late sitting this evening were made privately. I cannot understand how the late leader of the Labour Party can justify the action of the Government. Only yesterday, he stated that the imposition of these duties meant that the consumer would be called upon to pay an increased price for some time to come ? I ask him whether his remarks are not applicable to hats?",71
592,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,No .,72
593,Mr CROUCH,MANUFACTURES,"I want to go home.  ber is at liberty to go. We should not suffer much loss if he retired for good. He only comes here when there is a ""job "" on like the one which is now being attempted. This is one of the dirtiest things that have been done in this House.",72
594,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Hume-Trea surer) [1.58 a.m.] - The honourable member for Grey has made statements for which there is absolutely no foundation. ,72
595,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"The day before yesterday the honourable member for Yarra brought this amendment to me, and asked me if I favoured it. I asked him to give me time to consider it. He also requested me to get it printed and circulated. I did so. I consulted the officers of the Department, and told the honourable member that I would not move it.  move it.",72
596,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I did not move it in the first instance. I moved it only - because an honourable member cannot move to increase a duty. I had the' amendprevious ment circulated, and it was in charge of the honourable member for Yarra. I did not do that which the honourable member for Grey has accused me of doing. I do not wish to become heated, because I know that the honourable member has made statements which in his calmer moments he will regret. There has been no holeand-corner business indulged in, and no arrangement was made to sit late this evening until the last moment, because it was anticipated that this matter would have been decided very much earlier. I am sure that if the honourable member for Grey had known the facts he would not have made the accusations against .. me which he has made.",72
597,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Parramatta) [2.0 a.m.] - I do not intend to take part in this little interlude, because I think that the honourable member for Grey is quite capable of looking after himself. Whatever the Treasurer may say in reference to his accidental or incidental connection with this proposal, the fact remains that he is supporting it. No more need be said upon that score. But I rise chiefly for the purpose of brushing aside a little misapprehension which appears to linger in the minds of honourable members.' I ""have proposed a duty of 75 per cent in lieu of the fixed duty proposed by the Treasurer, and I have based that duty upon a value of 20s. per dozen.",72
598,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,There are no fur hats manufactured for that price.,72
599,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"The Government proposal is that a fixed duty of 25s. per dozen shall be levied upon these hats. I have assessed the value of the hats upon which I propose a 75 per cent, rate at 20s. per dozen. These are the hats which are used by the poor people.",72
600,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURES,Poo r people?,72
601,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"The Treasurer sympathizes with the poor people on the platform, but sneers at them behind their backs in Parliament. The rate which I have proposed will work out at 15s. per dozen upon hats of that value. M.r. CROUCH (Corio) [2.3 a.m.] - I feel that I must protect myself from the serious attack which has been made upon me by the honourable member for Grey. I am satisfied that if my patriotism be compared with that of the honourable member, it will withstand any examination even of a most microscopic character. I am very pleased that, as a result of my speech, my free-trade friends have been induced to support a duty of 75per cent, upon hats. This is so encouraging that I shall probably ask foT a recommittal of the item "" woollens,"" in order to afford the honourable member for Parramatta an opportunity to vote for a 75 per cent, duty upon it. Having induced him to do that, I should vote with him on this occasion but for the fact that I have paired.",72
602,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"Lang) [2.5 a.m.] - I desire to call attention to the singularly unfair misrepresentation of the amendment by the honourable member for Corio. Although he knows quite well that the honourable member for Parramatta did not propose a duty of 75 per cent, on the article, yet he deliberately makes that statement here. Apparently his object is to mislead any person who may read Hansard into the belief that the honourable member for Parramatta, as a free-trader, proposed a duty of 75 per cent, on hats. It was made quite clear by the honourable member for Parramatta that, instead of proposing 75 per cent, as a specific duty, as the honourable member for Corio would have the public to believe, he proposed the imposition of that duty on a hat of a certain value.",72
603,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,I ask leave to withdraw my amendment.,73
604,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"Gwydir) [2.7 a.m.] Before the amendment is withdrawn, I desire to say a few words regarding the tangle into which the honourable member for Parramatta has got himself. It was quite a revelation to me to hear a free-trader propose a duty of 75 per cent, on an article of any value. It should be noted, both here and elsewhere, that, whilst protectionists are consistent in trying to obtain a Tariff in conformity with their policy, free-trader's are not consistent in their action in opposing or harassing the Government. It may truly be said that they have abandoned everything when a free-trader proposes a duty of 75 per cent.",73
605,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,As against a duty of 125 per cent.,73
606,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"To propose the imposition of a duty of 15s. on every pound's worth of imported hats is, to my mind, the most extravagantly prohibitive proposal thathas been made here. It behoves the electors to keep their eyes upon the members of the Opposition. I protest against the withdrawal of the amendment, because I think that a division should be taken, and the honourable member for Parramatta hoisted on his own petard.",73
607,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Parramatta) [2.11 a.m.] - I only rise to say, in reply to the honourable member for Gwydir, who has been chiding me about my proposal, that I proposed a duty of 15s. on every pound's worth of imported hats in preference to supporting a duty of 25s.",73
608,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,"Corangamite) [2.12 a.m.] - Apparentl y honourable members are inclined at this hour to make statements which are not conducive to the maintenance of good feeling. What the honourable member for Gwydir has been trying to do is by uttering words which misrepresent the actual position to cover up the action which he, with other members of his party and honourable members sitting behind the Government,' have taken up. The Government have proposed in all seriousness that there shall be a duty of 25s. a dozen on all hats of this description. I desire to put the question fairly and squarely before honourable members. A fixed duty of 25s. a dozen would be levied on hats .which might cost £ 1 each, as well as on hats which might cost 15s. or 24s. a dozen. In one case the user would pay a duty of 2s. i d . on his hat, while in the other case the user would be charged a duty of 100 per cent. Honourable members who are supporting the honourable member for Yarra and the Government are prepared to charge the man who can buy a 4s. 6d. hat the same duty-10 0 per centas they would charge a man who buvs a Woodrow's guinea hat. The one man is well able to pay the extra cost, but the other man should not in any circumstances be asked to pay that enormous duty. As one who believes in effective protection, I protest against the action which the Government are taking, and also against the action which the members of the Labour Party are taking, because it is not in the interests cf those whom they are here to represent. The rate proposed by the honourable member for Parramatta is much lower than that f .>r which some honourable members seemed prepared to vote, being 50 per cent, less than that proposed by the Government.",73
609,Mr CARR,MANUFACTURES,"The duty he proposes is 15s. on every £ 1 worth of hats. On hats worth £ 6 a dozen, the duty which would have to be paid if his proposal were adopted would be six times 15s., whereas the Government duty would be only 25s.",73
610,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Macquarie fails to see that there must be a differentiation in respect of values. He appears to be willing-to vote for a duty of 125 per cent, on the cheap hats used by the poorer classes, while imposing but a small charge on those who buy expensive hats, to whom a difference of a shilling or two is of no consequence.",73
611,Mr LIDDELL,MANUFACTURES,"But why should a man who is compelled to wear a silk hat be charged unduly for it? He, as much as the man who purchases low priced hats, is entitled to buy at reasonable rates. - Mr WILSON - We have no option now but to vote for the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta, unless we wish to vote for the Government proposal, and I prefer to vote for a rate of 75 per cent, rather than for one of 125 per cent.

612,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"Hindmarsh) [2.21 :i.m.] - I was surprised at the speech of -.he honourable member for Corangamite, .ind still more at the proposal of the honor.ible member for Parramatta.

614,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"If a duty of 125 per cent, is imposed, I shall escape it by purchasing locally-made hats. Honourable members are trying to mislead the country in making it appear that those who buy hats will in future have to pay a duty of 125 per cent, on them. escape the duty by buying locally-made hats. I am glad to see a good protectionist, like the honourable member for Corangamite, in agreement with a good Free-trader like the honourable member for Parramatta, and hope that they will vote for duties of 75 per cent, on other items. Apparently, if the Minister wishes to obtain high duties he should propose rates of 100 per cent., and then the Opposition may vote for 50 per cent., although, if he had proposed 35 per cent., they would not have agreed to it. But I am tired of this farce. The discussion of the Tariff - occupies too much time for it to be permissible to take up more with ridiculous proposals of this nature.",74

654,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"When one realizes that there are no fur hats invoiced at £ 1 a dozen it is a clear indication that the cerity of the honourable member for Parramatta may be gravely doubted by the Committee. I made use of an expression which, unfortunately, is unparliamentary here, and I have had to withdraw it ; but I say again that, when we find ourselves sitting here hour after hour, discussing something that is not practicable or possible, it is time somebody rose to object. The honourable member for Parramatta has moved, in the form of a fixed duty, what he could not carry in the form of an ad valorem duty; and I say there.is no justification for his action, or for the support which is accorded him by the honourable member for Grampians and the honourable member for Corangamite. When those honourable members declare that we on this side are endeavouring to impose a duty of 150 per cent., and that they wish to save the people by reducing the duty to 75 per cent., they are making a statement which cannot be accepted. There are practically no fur hats indented from the Old Country at less than 3s. apiece, or 36s. per dozen. Therefore there is no weight in the plausible argument of honourable members opposite that those supporting the Government are endeavouring to impose a duty of 125 per cent., as against the free-trade proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta of 75 per cent. To vote «for the honourable member's proposal would be ridiculous. It would make honourable members to appear to be absolutely ignorant! of the conditionswith which they were dealing. The honourable member for Illawarra chided me for not understanding the subject, and I admit that since he was a member of the Tariff I Commission he has become an eminent authority on all these questions. I hope the Committee will not fall in with the suggestion of the honourable member for South Sydney. Amendment negatived.

659,Mr SALMON,MANUFACTURES,"Laanecoorie) [2.51 a.m.].. - I wish to speak, not as a protectionist who believes that the duty chargeable upon an article is always paid by the consumer,, whether the article is made here or imported,-but as a protectionist who believes; that protection reduces the cost of an article. I hold in mv hand a hat made inMelbourne. When honourable members are buying hats, I wonder that they do not inquire the price. . I have eventuallv to pay for my hats, so that I know what I anr paying. For many years I had worn onestyle of hat- a Woodrow-for which I always paid 13s. fid. I bought this hat, of equal quality, for 9s. 6d. Does the honourable member for Grampians say tiiat I paid the duty on that hat ? I feel that I have obtained an equally good hat for 4s. less than-1 used to pay. That is the result of protection. The honourable member for Grampians laughs. He gained his seat in this House because he professed protectionist principles, and it came as a shock to me to hear him declare that in every case the consumer pays the duty, whether, the article is made here or abroad. I had some experience of the operation of ad valorem duties when administering the Victorian Customs Department. I found that they were far too frequently - used as the instruments of fraud. It is only by imposing fixed duties on these goods that we can secure for the revenue what Parliament desires. I urge the Committee to hesitate before they agree to substitute an ad valorem for a fixed duty. I am prepared to vote for a duty sufficiently high to secure to the Australian manufacturer the Australian market, in order that I may continue to get an article of. first class quality at a lower price than I previously had to pay for the imported one.",76
660,Mr COON,MANUFACTURES,"Batman) [2.57 a.m.] - I hope the Government will adhere to their proposal. The honourable member for South Sydney made a very impassioned speech, appealing to protectionists to vote against revenue duties. I now appeal to protectionists to vote for protective duties.

661,Sir PHILIP FYSH,MANUFACTURES,"Denison) [3.0 a.m.] - The discussion to-night h'as reminded me of an incident that occurred at a place which I occasionally visit. The landlord asked myself and others to enter in his visitors' book our opinion of the. accommodation he provided. I remember that I wroteI came here for change and restThe landlord took the change and the waiter took the rest. I have here a hat belonging to the honor-"" able member for Laanecoorie, for which the honourable member said that he gave 9s. 6d. I am prepared to say that a similar article can be imported from England and sold for much less than the honourable member paid for this hat.",77
662,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"But the importer does not sell such a, hat for much less.",77

666,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,Is the price less than that which the honourable member used to pay for imported hats?,77
667,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"I believe that the imported hat for which I used to pay ios. ,6d. now costs 12s. 6d.",77
668,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,Was that hat any better from the stand-point of quality than the one which the honourable member is now wearing ?,77
669,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"No. I think that the article which is turned out in Victoria is an excellent one, and that the price charged for it is reasonable. But if the Victorian manufacturers are able to produce an excellent article at a reasonable cost, why should we erect a ring fence to preserve them from the ordinary competitive conditions which the trades and businesses of the world must face in order to keep themselves alive and in a healthy condition? So far as the competition from Japan is concerned, I find from the statisI was re- tical returns that last year our imports of hats were valued at £213,000, of which £3,000 worth came from japan. It will be seen, therefore, that Japan is, indeed, flooding Australia with hats.",77
670,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,"Corangamite) [3.8 a.m.]. - The honourable member for Batman has charged honourable members sitting in the Opposition corner, and myself in particular, with being false to the pledges upon which we were returned to this House. I wish to say that I was elected to correct fiscal anomalies, and to redress just grievances. That is what I have attempted to do throughout the discussion of this Tariff. I ask honourable members whether there are any just grievances in connection with the manufacture of hats? If so, I should like to hear of them. I desire to extend fair play to this industry, which, under the rate levied under the old Tariff, was a flourishing one. The honourable member for Brisbane has quoted correspondence which proves that the* Denton Hat Mills cannot supply any further orders for six months.",77
671,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,Men - Who are employed at those mills have been out of work for weeks.,78

673,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,Le t them go to Anderson's.,78
674,Mr WILSON,MANUFACTURES,"Hi s business is also a flourishing one-so flourishing that he has recently - imported more skilled hatters. In North Queensland and Western Australia the retailers must obtain their supply of hats from some source, and if the local manufacturers cannot supply orders the hats have to be imported. In such a case we have to exercise great care, because it is generally admitted that the customer has to pay the import duty. When hats have to be imported to supply the demand, it necessarily follows that if we impose top heavy a duty we shall interfere very unjustly with the deserving settlers in the back districts of Western Australia and Queensland. The proposition of the honourable member for Parramatta to impose a duty of 17s. 6d. a dozen is a fair one. It is a very high rate of duty on the lower class of hats, and, unfortunately, it lets off lightly the more expensive articles.

The honourable member for Batman has complained that my attitude on this item has not been sufficiently protective. In my Opinion, a duty of 20s. a dozen on hats is strongly protective. It will get rid of the greatest complaint which the local manufacturers have advanced, and that is the persistent undervaluing of imported hats. I think that is. 8d. per hat is a very reasonable protection for local workmen to have in their favour.",78
676,Mr MATHEWS,MANUFACTURES,"Melbourne Ports) [3.24 a.m.] - I am rather surprised at the honourable.member for South Sydney, who has always assured us that he was a protectionist, submitting this amendment, with the full knowledge that during the last two months the hat industry has been suffering from the importation of foreign hats. Despite the statement of the honourable member for Brisbane'that, according to a letter which he read, an order has been refused by the Denton Hat Mills, we who are associated with the workmen know that they are not fully employed. The hat COOK'S mills in Australia could turn out a great deal more than they do. In spite of the fact that the workmen are not working full 13 time, thousands of dozens of hats aTe im22 - ported every year. Why do we apply protection ? We do so to foster the industries of the country, and thereby give employment to our people. When, in spite of the protective duties in force, men in the AYES. protected trades are out of work, and importations are increasing, the only conclusion to be come to is that the rates are not sufficiently high, and ought to be increased. But when we propose to increase them, we are called prohibitionists. Personally, I would prohibit the importation of any article which we can manufacture in Australia. But if we increased this duty to 52s. per dozen, hats would still be imported. Some persons, through pure cussedness, or for some other reason, will insist on having imported articles; but they ought to pay for them. As a proof that the increasing of the duty will not raise the price of hats, I again mention the fact that in Perth hats cost 3s. more than they do in Melbourne, because there is no factory there. I hope that the protectionists will not vote for the reduction which has been moved by the honourable member for South Sydney.

I never addressed an audience when I did not say that I should oppose prohibition; and I cannot support the present proposal of the Government. Those who do support that proposal are, I think, misrepresenting the farming community. The honourable member for Laanecoorie made some remark myself, and also about protection; but surely he was not returned as a prohibitionist ?
