W it h reference to the replies to questions asked ou the 20th June last, w i ll lie state whether permanent heads have power to authorize the payment of discretionary increments approved hy them by virtue of Determination No. 1 of 1024 of the Public Service Arbitrator t 2. If permanent heads approve of discretionary increments as from 28th A p r i l last, will these bc paid? 3. If not, why not? 4. Does the answer to question 2, asked by the honourable member for Barton on the 20th .Tunc last, mean that permanent heads will not be allowed to exercise a discretion in regard to increments awarded by the Arbitrator? 5. In view of the fact that the existing salaries of oflieers will be taken into consideration by the Puhlic Service' Board in fixing salaries under the classification in a ll instances, why arc automatic increments paid as they accrue, but discretionary increments refused?",15
25,Mr BRUCE,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. Yes; but such increments can only be paid if the necessary funds arc provided. 2 and 3. No. The granting of such increments would involve undue interference with classification of the Service, which will be elfective from 1st July, 1924. 4. The discretion of permanent heads is absolute under the Determination, but is dependent upon funds being made available. Pending classification, it is not proposed to make such funds available. 5. The assumption that existing salaries will be taken into consideration in classification is incorrect, but the claims of officers for discretionary increments aro being kept in view by the Public Service Board in fixing salaries under the classification of the Service. Payment of automatic increments is mandatory, and all future increments under classification will be automatic. NOTE PRINTING OFFICE.",16

What provision is made for the treatment in case of sickness of members of the Home Service Forces who enlisted after the concluby the Comsion of the late war? 2. What provision is made in the event of injury whilst on duty for compensation to in members of the Home Service Forces who enwas listed after the conclusion of the war? 3-.

Defote resumed' from 2'7tli June (vide page F729-), onmotion by Dr EABLE PAGEThat the bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr CBLAK&TON had moved, by way of amendmentThnt all the words after the word "" That"" be omitted, with a view to the insertion of the following words in, place thereof:-""in order to preserve tile Commonwealth Bank as a national' institution, and to extend its operations for the purpose of controlling credit and exchange, it is desirable that financial perts, to he fully employed in the service of the bank, should be appointed' to its management, the proposJul! of the Government tat appoint persons representing squatting and. commercial interests, who axe diametrically opposed to national banking, being designed more i'n the interests of private financial institutions than of the people's bank."" Mr MAKIN ' (Hindmarsh) [3.27] The introduction of this amending legislation synchronizes with certain advances now being made by financial magnates in other continents,, particularly Europe, concerning which I shall speak later, because they have a direct relation to t i l s bill . I recollect that you, Mr Speaker,, in the course of a learned dissertation upon financial questions in 1922, re[71] minded those who were privileged to hear you on that occasion that "" finance is government and government is finance."" Therefore^ the legislation now before the House is of the utmost gravity and i m portance,, because it may be rightly regarded as directly affecting the fundamentals of government. I view with serious concern the proposals which the Government hassubmitted. Last year members of the Opposition warned rhe people of the possibility of the present fiovernineut seeking to destroy the effectiveness of the Commonwealth Bank. ""We reasoned that such action was to be expected from the representatives of "" big business "" and financial corporations, for, PAPEES-. as other wealthy sections of the community had received handsome gifts from the Goveriumetit, it was unlikely that the financiers would be omitted from the distribution. That prophecy is verified by the bilL now trader consideration. The Commonwealth Bank was established in spiteof the uncompromising hostility of vested interests. I have familiarized myself with the debates in this Parliament in 1911, when the first Commonwealth Bank Bill was introduced by the Right Hon. Andrew Fisher, and I have read with particular interest the contributions to that debate by a number of honourable members opposite, including some who are now Ministers of the Crown. I remember the grave fears and evil forebodings that were expressed by those honourable gentlemen on that occasion. They had very little sympathy with those who proposed! to establish the bank,, and having a knowledge of their statements at that time, I am not surprised at the ex- action now taken by the Government. In the light of. the history of the bank, however, the Government's action in attempting to tamper with one of the mask substantial institutions in the Commonwealth is most audacious. There appears to be no limit to the extent to which, the Government is prepared to sacrifice the. interests of this country to those of its private and privileged friends. The proposal is that the Commonwealth Bank shall become an instrument of convenience to private financial interests, regardless of therelation of such interests to the welfare of the nation. It is appropriate that I should review what the Commonwealth Bank has done for this country. Although, it may not have accomplished all that was expected of it , it stands today as a monument to the capacity and foresight of the Labour Government that held office from 1910 to 1913. It has been of great advantage to the Commonwealth. I ts operations during the war could not have been undertaken with equal advantage to' Austraha by any other batik. During the crises of the war years we were able to appreciate its strength. It was the chief factor in the keeping open of the doors cf many of the private hunks, for it enabled thorn to nieeu urgent obligations. supported business enterprise, counteracted the effects of depression. Tn the flotation of war and peace loans il. saved the Government, approximately, £6,000,000. The average price paid to the Commonwealth Bank for the flotation of loans was 5s. 9d. per cent... while private financial institutions were charging £ 2 7s. per cent, for the same class of business. The bank also financed tht> primary producers, and assisted to solve intricate financial problems associated with the handling of primary produce. No private bank could have accomplished that work with the same degree of success. Mr Mark B . Young, who represented the Commonwealth Bank at the first Bank Pan-Pacific Congress, in Honolulu, in October, 1922, referred to the work done by the bank in assisting to market primary produce. He statedI'liiuuiciitl problems of grout magnitude and intricacy arose during the war, and had to be faced and solved. The ordinary means of transporting produce had been greatly reduced, and at times almost destroyed. The necessity therefore arose of financing a nation's produce while it was not able to reach its customary markets. In all these banking transactions (relating to the marketing of wheat, wool, rabbits, bultor, sugar, and metals), the Commonwealth Bank played the central part. course of a great war, evidence of unrest and even panic might have been expected to have been shown, but at no time was there any uneasiness. This satisfactory condition is widely attributed to the existence of the Commonwealth Bank, which had happily been created just prior to the outbreak of hostilities. So we find that during that period the Commonwealth Bank was our financial Gibraltar. While making savings, and providing banking at a minimum of cost, I find that the Commonwealth Bank has presented to the Hr, Makin. people a.profit of £4,500,000. As I have already indicated, the bank has not accomplished all that was possible, but this is in no way due to any limitation of power in the original act introduced by the Labour party under Mr Andrew Fisher. If all the advantages that might have accrued have not been realized, that has been due to the conservative policy of the management. There is something to be said in favour of ref o r m in that respect, and I think that improvement can be brought about under the amendment submitted by the Leader It of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). It aud is suggested in this amendment that provision should be made for banking experts-employee s of the Commonwealth Bank itself-to bo selected to co-operate with the management i u so directing the affairs of the institution as to make it of the greatest possible service to the people. We know that business has been refused by the bank. A person with whom I am acquainted went to the Adelaide branch and asked for accommodation to the extent of £400 upon the security of assets worth £1,200. H is money was invested at the time with a private institution, and the Commonwealth Bank was not prepared to take the business out of the hands of the private bank, for it was said to be contrary to the policy of the Commonwealth Bank to do so.",17
30,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,On e private bank does not hesitate to take business out of the hands of another.,19
31,Mr MAKIN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"That is so. The Commonwealth Bank can find the necessary money to effect new business in other directions, but it withholds its hand when it has an opportunity to protect a citizen from the rapacity of the private banks. Every person who can offer reasonable During the security should be able to secure the accommodation he requires from the people's bank. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), in introducing the bill, said that the reason for it was that the Commonwealth Bank had not served the purpose for which the original act was introduced, and the bill was required to remedy the defect. In the course of his those great speech the Treasurer statedfacilities When the question of a Commonwealth Bank was first mooted, it was generally expected that a truly national bank would be establislied- a bank of deposit, issue, discount, exchange and reserve. When the bill was introduced, however, expectations were not realized, and when the bank began to function it became perfectly clear that a national bank hud not been established, but merely a governmental institution in competition with the private 'hanks. The bill tile Government now brings forward is designed to carry out the criminal expectation. In the opinion of the Treasurer the Commonwealth Bank should not compete with private banking institutions. Although the Minister remarked that the basis upon which the Government justified the introduction of the bill was the fact that the bank had been in competition with th6 private banks, and although he said the bill was designed to give it the national character that he alleged it did not now possess, ho stated a little further on in hia speechOn the whole, it will be recognized that the Commonwealth Bank has not been a serious r-onrpetitor of the other banks. Indeed, it is understood that the policy of the management * up to the present has been not to enter into active rivalry with the trading banks, and in pursuance of this policy the interest payable nn Commonwealth Savings Bank - deposits is, and has always been, lower than the interest I'd'id hy the stato institutions. Therefore, the very premises on which the Treasurer based his justification of the introduction of N;he measure were swept away by his own declaration that the national Commonwealth Bank had not been a serious competitor with the private financial institutions. other part of his speech the Treasurer said:The Commonwealth Bank, however, gave assistance to the other banks in respect of seasonal demands by making advances out of existing credits. This was made possible through the co-ordination of the resources of the Treasury with those of the bank. Indeed, all the money offered was not accepted by the banks. According to the Treasurer himself, the Commonwealth Bank has assistance to the private banks, and has afforded them the necessary credits to enable them to meet the seasonal payments required of them. In fact, greater credits tban even they were prepared to use were available to them. not appear, therefore, that the Commonwealth Bank has been a serious competitor with the privately-owned banks. The provisions of this bill have been dictated to the Government by the controlling interests of private financial corporations. My justification for that remark is also a statement made by the Treasurer in his second-reading speech. He saidDuring discussions which I recently have had with bankers, they mads it clear that the right to get cash in case of need is of the greatest value to banking. Though some of them urged that mora legal tender notes be issued, they said over and over again that all they really"" wanted was the right to get notes in case of need. It is quite clear that the Treasurer consuited the private banking authorities in drafting the bill. But not he alone entered into that consultation, for a little later on in his speech he said that "" in conferences which Ministers have had with the general managers of the private banks,"" certain things were said. The Government has been in close touch with the very people who hope by means of this bill to strangle the Commonwealth Bank, and so make available to their own banking institutions a greater volume of business. The Commonwealth Bank, as a matter of fact, will be scientifically destroyed if Parliament passes the bill in its present form. One of the most important steps in the process of strangling the bank is to be the appointment of an unsympathetic board of directors. The gentlemen who, it is proposed, shall be given positions on the board will be mora concerned with conserving the interests of private banks than with promoting the interests of the Commonwealth Bank. Several of the interests In an- that are to be represented on the directorate have already made large and somewhat irregular demands upon the Government, which it has conceded to them in almost every case. The board of directors is to be composed of eight persons, six of whom will represent private financial, commercial, and pastoral interests, and only two of whom will care for the welfare of the general public. I think I may say justly that the only members of been of the board who will be greatly concerned about the future success of the bank from the point of view of the people of Australia will be its governor and the Secretary to the Treasury. Of the other directors two are to represent the comI t does mercial and industrial concerns, and two the agricultural and pastoral interests. The remaining two members are to be chosen for their special knowledge of currency. We may assume, therefore, that these two will have a very close, even if indirect, association with private banking institutions,' and that they will closely identify themselves with the Government's policy of sacrificing the bank. The next step in destroying the bank's usefulness is also - worth careful consideration. The Government proposes to load it with all the charges and interest payments connected with a £6,000,000 which the Treasurer is to provide. This amount, together with the profit which the bank has in its reserve f u n d , is, we are told, to give the bank a capital of £10,000,000. irony of the situation lies in the fact that the bank at present has authority to issue debentures to the £10,000,000 if it deems such a course to be necessary. U p to the present it has not iised its power in that respect. compel it to set aside a £10,000,000 reservo in the manner the Treasurer has proposed w i i l seriously handicap it . Why should it be required to pay interest on £6,000,000 which, up to the present, has not been considered necessary to its successful The bank is to be forced to pay half of its profits into the National Debt Sinking Fund, but it is not proposed that the Government shall give credit for this as a contra for interest due from the 'bank to the Treasury on the proposed loan of £6,000,000. 'On what ground can it be claimed that the - Commonwealth Bank should be compelled to forgo reasonable interest on - money which it so invests ? Ifc should bo permitted to enjoy full y the benefits of the credit balance which results from its operations. The only reason that I can give for the Government proposing the course provided for in the bill is that it wishes to ensure the success of its scientific effort to sacrifice the bank.",19
32,Mr LAZZARINI,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"It is strangling it . Mr MAKIN . - The interjection by the honourable member for Werriwa is apt. The Government undoubtedly desires to place the bank in subjection to private banking institutions and so prevent it from fulfillin g the real purposes for which it was established. It is to be prevented by unsympathetic administration from functioning in the interests of the general community. That method is frequently adopted to destroy the usefulness of government-controlled institutions. Honourable members who support the Government are pleased, from time to time, to point to various government ventures which they allege to^have been unsuccessf u l . The principal reason why there may be room for criticism is that the institutions concerned have been subjected to totally unsympathetic administration. A flourishing enterprise .can soon be made ineffective by unsympathetic administration, and a study of the history of loan of allegedly unsuccessful Government enter,- prises usually shows that they bave not been as successful as their promoters hoped they would be simply because of unsympathetic administration. Why The should the Commonwealth Bank be compelled to hold a reserve of £10,000,000? It is aeeally to meet the demands that extent of private institutions may make upon it in oansequence of its being made virtually a .clearing bank. One would expect, howTo ever, that jprivate banking institutions would be required to have credits with the national or reserve bank sufficient to meet the demands which .they might make on it , amd that ethey wiould not be able to trade upon the reserves of the na'bional c bank. The Treasurer informed the House functioning ? that ,the bill was framed with .a view to making the - GommQUwealuh Rank an in stituti-oii simi'laato the reserve bank of the South African 'Union. The practice im South A f r i ca as that - each private banking institution shail place in the reserve bank of the 'Urn-ion .an .amount of money 'equal to at least 10 per oent. of its demand liabilities., .aaid 3 rpetr .oent. of its time liabilities, but I find no provision in this bill to compel - our private banks to lodge with the CGanm.onweal.th Bank any security whatever. It really means that Liie Commonwealth Bank must provide credits for private banking institutions, whik t it is itself saddled with interest for accommodaiiioii provided for it by the Treasurer, such as the proposed loan of £6,000,000. Finance has a serious and far-reaching influence upon the economic conditions of the people. This is admitted by the Treasurer in the following statement: A very great power .is exercised by banks in the creation of credit, in their control over business, and in the effect oif tlieir policy upon wages, as well as upon other conditions. Changes in franking policy - disturb the - Wihole community. OUT people engaged in production, whether in agriculture or manufacturing industries, are affected by alterations of policy on the part of financial corporations. Those engaged in wealth production, whether in the factory or in the fluid, are being mercilessly plundered from sunrise to sunset by these institutions. The Treasurer further emphasized the way in whioh the economic conditions of the country are afftoted. He saidTho removal of the automatic cheek enabled huge credits to be built upon the war currency and the short-dated securities issued by the Government. Then was seen abnormal increase in available purchasing units, without an increase in available commodities. Prices rose and, though wages were frequently raised, the pay of the workmen usually lagged beliind the cost of living. That is the first confession of the kind we have heard from any honourable member on the other side. They have always endeavoured to make it appear that the demands of the worker have been in excess of the cost of living. ""We have at last the truth proclaimed by the Treasurer when he says that, although the wages of workmen were frequently raised, they usually lagged behind the cost of living. The worker pays in each in stance. If credits are inflated it means higher cost of living, if a deflation it means unemployment. These powers are too great for private interests to hold. The honourable gentleman f u r the r saidDuring this period of inflation trade was wonderfully active, because merchants and dealers continually acquired large stocks in the fond Ibelief that in consequence of a world shortage of goods, prices would go higher still. In the wild scramble dealers bought from each otlier, and ever prices rose. This speculative business could not go on indefinitely, however, nnd at length reaction set in. We 'find, on the declaration of the Treasurer, that the war provided an opportunity for the money powers' mighty hand to exercise a very effective control over the conditions of the people. These are the merchants of honour who, under this bill, are io share the custodianship of the nation's It is well for us to remember that the control of currency and credit, au it does, the nation's security and the welfare of its citizens, should be entirely the 'Special function of government. hase saidl that .there has been <a concentration of (money power. The Treasurer rati mated in his tapeech that, during the last 10.0 weasrB in tihe United 100 banks had .passed ;ooit of existence, amd that (the banking business of England and Wales is conducted now by the Bank of England, nine clearing hanks, and seven country banks. A similar concentration of money power has taken in Australia. The Australian and Banking Record gives the information that, in 1915, there were 22 banks operating throughout Australasia, and that twenty of these were operating in Australia. In 1922 there were fifteen banks operating throughout Australasia, and fourteen of them were in Australia. So that, from 1915 to 1922, there, was a concentration of money power, aud whereas twenty banks were operating in Australia in 1915, only fourteen were operating in 1922.",21
33,Mr WEST,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,And there are too many here nsw.,22
34,Mr MAKIN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"Q u it e so. I find, according to the Commomcealth Year Book of 1923, that the banks to which I have referred paid dividends ranging from 7 to 20 per cent. That was the return to their shareholders. Their subscribed capital is £50,122,469. The reserve profits held by these banks now amount to £32,928,568. Although they have been paying very substantial dividends, they have this amount of u n -' divided prdfits in reserve. The Commonwealth Bank, under the system proposed by the bddl, is to become a member of - the combine. The Treasurer has admitted that in his speech. He saidThe excellent banking material which we Imve already should ho strengthened and coordinated in' order that Australia should haw a symmetrical and well-balanced system of central banking. To this end the Government proposes that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia should become the pivot of Australian hanking- a hank of issue, deposit, discount, exchange, and reserve. Therefore, it is to become an absolute economic member of 'the banking combine. Let me uow show how the interests of the state doubtful can be subordinated and sacrificed under bauk. unsympathetic bamking - commissioners. In Victoria the (State savings bank is involving, administered by fi.ve commissioners. If I mention the names of two of these commissicmers that wiU be sumcient for I my alignment. iQne is Sir Will i a m MCBeath, a Flinders-lane merchant, who is cliairman of the institution. The fitter I mention is a man who has been Kingdom, known in connection with Commonwealth - activities because he was chairman of the royal commission on taxation; I - refer to Mr Will i a m Warren Kerr. He is directly associated with the business of insurance broking, and also with complace mercial activities, because he has been . Insurance president of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce. The five commissioners who have had care of the credits of depositors in the state savings bank of Victoria ihave used thoso deposits in a way which I emphatically say has not been in keeping' with what the depositors would desire. I find that £10,500,000 of the people's deposits in the state savings bank of Victoria are today invested in private banking institutions, whilst not - one penny of those deposits is invested in the Commonwealth Bank, which is the people's bank.",22
35,Dr EAKLE PAOE,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"How much is invested in government securities, Commonwealth loans, and so on?",23
36,Mr MAKIN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"That does not affect iny statement with regard to the investment of £10,500,000 of the money of the depositors in the state savings bank. This shows the correctness of the statement that tliere has been a deliberate attempt to boycott the Commonwealth - Bank.",23
37,Dr EARLE PAGE,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,Rubbish !,23
38,Mr MAKIN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"-We find that the war presented a very favourable opportunity for the financial institutions to make of Australia a Shylock's paradise. According to the statement of the Treasurer, the private banks took their gold to the Treasury voluntarily. They recognized that the accommodation provided by the note issue was more easy to handle and more convenient for them. In presenting their gold to the Treasury they were given the privilege of getting tliree notes for every sovereign they surrendered. I recognize that they were charged 4 per cent, per annum on the notes given them in excess of the gold they presented. Three notes were issued to them for every sovereign they presented. The banks had been operating on a credit basis of £4 for every £1 they held in reserve in gold. When they secured from the Treasury the additional accommodation to which I have referred, they were able to expand their credit to a ratio of twelve to one. This proves that the private banks were prepared to make use of the position for their private advantage, even though by doing so they might risk the stability and security of the nation.",23
39,Dr EAKXE PAOE,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"To what extent) did they use that right? Only to the extent of £2,000,000.",23
40,Mr MAKIN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"They exercised the right as freely as they desired. It is very desirable that we should not permit such a thing to occur in the future in circumstances likely to affect the financial stability of the Commonwealth. The ruthlessnes3 of the money-changer is well known. The grasping avarice of Shakespeare's Shylock, the rich Jew of Venice, was but a. circumstance to the rapaeiousness which characterizes the money-changers of the present century. Let me consider the type of men who are likely under this bill to become members of the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank. There are two gentlemen who are almost certain to be appointed, because of their present association witli the Notes Issue Board; I refer to Sir H . Y. Braddon and Mr J. J. G-arvan. There is also Mr William Warren Kerr, who was chairman of the royal commission on taxation. He has a direct knowledge of financial matters, and we may reasonably expect that he will be included in the directorate. It is likely that the Hon. Gr. Swinburne and the Hon. W. L. Baillieu will also be included. I should like to place on record the position now held by these gentlemen. Sir William George MCBeath is a Flinders-lane merchant. Mr J. J. Garvan. who is cn the Notes Issue Board, is managing director of the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company Limited; he is also a pastoralist, being owner of the Rochdale station in Queensland. The Hon. George Swinburne is chairman of directors of Johns and Waygood. engineers, as well as a director of the Melbourne Gas Company, the Melbourne Hydraulic Company, the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company, and also the National Mutual Life Assurance Company. The Honourable Sir H . Y. Braddon, who is also on the Notes Issue Board, is superintendent of Dalgety and Company Limited, as well as a director of the British and Foreign Insurance Company, and of the Union Trustee Company. Mr William Warren K e r r is the managing director of Richardson, Kerr Proprietary Limited, insurance brokers. During 1916-18 he was president of the Chamber of Commerce; he has also held the office of president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce. Mr Baillieu, I think, is not unknown to you, Mr, Speaker, as he was a member of a State Government of which you were the head; ho is also a director of a number of comfacilities, panies, namely, the Zino Producers' Assothose ciation, the Copper Producers' Associawhose tion, the Broken Hill Associated Smelters, the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australia, the North Broken Hill Company, the. Mount Morgan Gold Mincommerce, ing Company, the Hampden-Cloncurry zens Copper Mine, the Yarra Falls Spinning to Mills Limited, the Herald and Weekly provide Timet, the Electrolytic Refining and shure Smelting Company, and the Melbourne Trust Limited. Banking, commercial, pastoralist, and mining interests arc hero interwoven. As these persons are likely tu become the custodians of our own bank, it is useless to expect sympathy from them. They do not represent interests of the people of Australia whole. The Treasurer in his speech saidThe Government believes that it is proposing all thut can be dono by legislation towards bringing about a truo system of central ing, but recognizes that the success of the Commonwealth Bank, acting as a central bank, will called for and inaccurate. depend on the skill and foresight of the board of directors. The Commonwealth Bank is now to be the the Commonwealth Bank. subject of the knavish depredations of the money changer, the commercial specuslated lator, and of vested landlordism. Those interests would barter the soul of a nation if it would improve their own by one shekel. They have no country, and no flag. The world is their domain. legislation The Treasurer also said that legislation could not be provided to deal with the exihe change problem, which would be a matter for the board of directors to deal with as sibly, occasion demanded. In the Melbourne Herald, of Saturday last, reference was made to the Dawes-MCKenna report on ucncrnl the reparations question- a subject which must directly or indirectly alfect the counting financial stability of AustraliaIf put into operation, finance and banking control will be the dominant vernment of the most important part Europe, with authority almost the world enters, for a time, on a new phaso - th c dictatorship of finance. . . . . This 3cheme places Germany, the greatest economic domain of Europe, under control of the refrom presentatives of international finance and business. It cannot fail to involvo far-reaching consequences to society, quite apart from the payments of reparations. So much for the direct influence of governments; but the lives plain men and women, earning their toii, will bo greatly affected by it all. Germany, and elsewhere, rigid economy be insisted upon, and the period of national domestic reform, costing money, educational and health improvements, may have to wait. Poor people will have to wait for things till publie creditors are paidinfluence will certainly try to encourage business enterprise by avoiding heavy direct taxes on profits and incomes. They will not favour high wages or sliort liours. Publio opinion will be that of the great worlds of finance, and the millionaire captains of industry. The. future for the ordinary citiof Germany and other misled peoples is work hard for as little as possible, and to most of the new wealth, and a large of taxation for a period quite uncertain. That will be the ultimate fate of the people of this country. They will become practically subject to the power of these nioney lords, who are endeavouring to destroy the only means of security that wo have had provided for us, and which is the a monument to the capacity and foresight as a of the Labour movement of Australia. The statement of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) that honourable members on this side of the House aro unsympathetic towards the interests bankof the primary producer was both unMany and now real have been the benefits conferred on the primary producers of Australia by Mr Mark B. Young, a great banking authority, has that the Commonwealth Bank is already provided with, all the powers necessary to make it a purely national balance bank. Tliose are his wordsThe most important event in the banking of Australia was the passing of an net by the Federal Government, assented to on 22nd December, 1011, for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. In many respects the bank is unique, and poswith one exception, it is the only purely national bank in the world. It was empowered, amongst other activities, to carry on banking business, that is to say, the receiving of deposits on current accounts pr for fixed terms, granting of advances, disof hills, issuing of drafts and letters nf credit, and generally to transact every branch of banking business, including that of force in the goa savings bank. of I desire also to quote from the London undisguised. So Hankers' Magazine-- As its first governor, Mr Miller is responsible for the organization of the bank, and its inception until the present time, he big has laboured to make it what it is to-dayan institution of great power, soundness, and increasing strength, of incalculable advantage of to Australia, ancl a worthy addition to the bread by finance system of the Empire."" In In view of those statements as to the will all-embracing nature of the powers conferred on the Commonwealth Bank, it is evident that this legislation is not intro dnced with the idea of endeavouring to make the institution of greater service to the public of Australia, but is conceived for the purpose of assisting the private banking institutions. These greedy, grasping interests are not satisfied with what the Government has already done for them, but are crying out for more. They desire that the Commonwealth Bank shall be subordinated to the interests of private institutions in the Commonwealth and elsewhere. It would be interesting to know the experiences upon the Notes Issue Board of the Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury. I believe that it is because they endeavoured to stand against the private interests represented by the other members on the. board that this measure has been introduced. hope that this House will see the wisdom of rejecting, the gpvernment's proposals, and will support the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). In . conclusion, it is evident that the shambles of Europe Lave not saved the world for democracy, but have provided another opportunity for the financial vultures to fatten on the sacrifice, suffering, and sorrow of a cruelly deceived world. This legislation, ceived with the same design, emanating from the same dominating power, briugs the people of this country into subjection, and claims as ransom Australia's only in stitution of financial prestige and security. The time is certainly coming when an incensed world will overturn the tables of the money changers, declaring that the earth which, with all its wonderful possibilities for peace, prosperity and comfort, has been the refuge of thieves, shall in the future prove the r i g h t f u l heritage of all the eons and daughtersof abeneficent and bountiful Creator.",23
41,Mr MANN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"Perth) [ 4 . 2 9 ] - I desire to congratulate the Treasurer for having introduced this measure.. It is. one of the most important that has been brought before us, aud one which is likely in the future to have a. far-reaching effect on the finances and the economics of this country. I am not sure', however, that it will immediately effect any of the changes which are expected. Perhaps the best feature of the bill is its cautious adventure into ground in advance of the field which the bank has to occupied It is well slowly, and to advance with caution. That the b i ll proposes to do. The change proposed is not so much in the functions of the bank as in the method of exercising those functions; at the same time, the bank is to be given power to extend aa experience may warrant. That shows wise foresight, and a clear perception, of what is required of the bank. These remarks apply especially to the provisions relating todiscounting. Experience alone will disclose how far the discounting provisions will be effective in achieving the ends desired. The functions of the bank cannot be greatly changed or extended except by making it entirely a. reserve bank. I and. many others would prefer it to partake more of that character, but we have to recognize I the facts as they are, and, unfortunately, owing to the narrow lines, upon which the bank was originally established, it has become an ardinairy. trading bank to such aai extent that.its evacuation of that field would probably completely dislocate the finances of the country. Therefore, the Commonwealth Bank cannot be made purely a reserve bank, and, in the circumstances, the best possible compromise is that contained in the bill. The Leader con- of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) said that both in respect of its past operations and its future conduct as proposed in this bill, the bank is not sufficiently a national institution. Other honourable members opposite spoke as if the bank should be a people's bank. Only by an examination of the various statements they have made can one get a clear idea of what they mean. For instance,, the Leader of the Opposition read, ant a> large number of figures regarding the present position of the private banks,, aaid said that thewonderfully safe posi-bion they occupy justifies intervention by the Commonwealth Bank. He said, also, that the Commonwealth Bank was not in keen enough competition' with the private banks. It is apparent that he and his followers desire that the Commonwealth Bank shall take pessession of the whole 1 field of private banking, ultimately displacing the private banks entirely. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . Makin) today complained that the bank has had to refuse business from' certain individuals, whereas a national, or people's, bank,, could not do that. It hitheris clearly the honourable member's concepto go tion of the national bank that it should absorb the entire banking business of the country. Private financial institutions like the banks, which the Leader of the Opposition admitted to be safe and successful, should, according to the views of honourable members opposite, be incontinently destroyed. Yet the Leader of the Opposition proceeded to say that the finances of the Commonwealth should be as sound as the rock of Gibraltar. Surelv he has gravely misconceived how best to keep the finances of the country sound and safe as the rock of Gibraltar if he believes that every financial institution which is successfully doing its work should be destroyed by the competition of the Commonwealth Bank, backed by the Government. In the opinion of a great many people, including myself, the Commonwealth Bank has already competed too much in some spheres of finance: I allude particularly to its unjustified intrusion into the domain of savings banking, thereby causing considerable mischief, and financial difficulties to some of the state governments. Mi*. WEST - It was a very good thing for the people.",25
42,Mr MANN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"I entirely fail to understand the logic of the honourable member if he says that when a government financed by the people,gets into monetary difficulties, it is good for the people. Some honourable members seem to consider the Government as something apart from the people, whereas in reality the Government cannot suffer without the peojDle suffering in like measure. I am unable to understand how a purely trading government bank can - be a ^national bank to any greater extent than can any private trading bank. In fact, if .a government bank has other functions which enable it to stabilize, strengthen, and regulate ""banking finance and practice, it is much more likely to give service of a national character. bill proposes to confer such functions upon the Commonwealth Bank, and so enable it to be of greater national benefit than if it were 'continued 'as - a purely trading institution. The Leader of tihe Opposition said that 'there was no necessity to appoint so ""ma-ny - members to the board of directors. Most of the criticisms 'wharchfaaroebeen (levelled at ithe past operations of 'the hank-lan d I say this without intending ""to reflect upon any in divadtial-hav e been due chiefly to the autocratic one-man .control which has hitherto existed. Objection was also taken by the Leader of the Opposition to the proposal to appoint the Governor and Deputy Governor for a period of seven years. B e argued that it would be necessary .to try out a man before we could know iwith ^certainty whether or not he was fit for :his position. I cannot refrain from asking myself why seven years was not considered too long a term for which to appoint the late Governor of the Commonwealth Bank? That appointment was made by a Labour Government, and it seems that a term of .seven years is all right if proposed by honourable members opposite, but all wrong when proposed by their politioal opponents. W it h the bill as a whole I lam. very well satisfied, but I would suggest to the Treasurer two or three minor alterations, and I ask him to show me special courtesy in this matter, because, owing to my departure for Western Australia tomorrow, I shall be unable to make these suggestions during the committee stage. W it h regard to the constittition of the executive committee as proposed in clause T 5 E , T think it would be advisable to obviate the possibility of this body becoming a mere departmental - board <of co»trott. That could be 'done fey providing that it shall include at least one of the directors mentioned ha clause 11, subclause 2, paragraphs 6 and c. I presume that *the 'Governor and Secretary t*e the Treasury will be members <of 'the executive committee, and I should! 'prefer that the thir d member should be one of the directors representing industry .and oommerne :rather than one of the .crumrettcy experts. cBy clause '60© the - bank as - io be @iven power to issue notes to itsielf. W it h the (safeguards provided in the .trill ithat power is not likely to .be .abused, shut dt - does appear that the bank is being ,gi-ven rather special powers 'which it will .be able to exercise The for .its «wai benefit, rand, perhaps, rather unfairly. .Therefore, it would be well to provide Aha* its issue of notes to itself shall he laamddtianal oipon the approval of the Treasurer. The only . other alteration I woiiald suggest is in regard to the returns which wiU have .to be made from time to time. Time returns at present received from the banks are not as satisfactory as they might be. The quarterly returns include letaly the figures concerning the bank's feusiness within the Commonwealth, and ithe bill proposes to reenact that requirement. The entire assets of the banks are shown only once every twelve months in their balance sheets. Unfortunately, these balance sheets are made up at different times of the year, and consequently the balance sheets of the different banks do not synchronize, and do not enable a complete survey of the banking position to bo made at any one time. The result is that it is impossible to obtain accurate figures as to the banks' business otitside aud inside the Commonwealth up to a certain date. I suggest to the Treasurer that the banks, in addition to furnishing quarterly returns giving figures relating to balances within the Commonwealth, should be compelled to give accounts of their business outside, the Commonwealth, including, at Jeast, accounts of their London balances. That would prevent "" window dressing '.' between banks and banks, which is said to occur when it is to make up nnancial statements, and this information is necessary to enable the board of the Commonwealth Bank to form definite opinions regarding the regulation of exchange. In all fairness the Commonwealth Bank should be required to make exactly similar returns, which should be published in the Commonwealth Ca-i-ttc. There would then be uo differential treatment as between one bank and another, and we should have statements setting out all the information required for arriving at a correct opinion concerning exchange. no doubt, that difficulties arise today be-, cause we have no figures that disclose the actual factors in the exchange trouble, or that indicate how long the position is likely to continue. The Treasurer dealt with that trouble at considerable length, and I should like to take this opportunity of warmly congratulating him upon the preparation and presentation of his statement on a very intricate and difficult matter. That statement should be of great use to honourable members, for it is very informative, and extremely sound aud accurate.. It is based on sound principles, and is spoken of in the highest terms of approbation by all who know anything about the subject.",26
43,Mr FENTON,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,Because it suits them.,27
44,Mr MANN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"It suits every one except those who have an obsession for the destruction of everything successful. There is no doubt that consideration of the problem of exchauge is inextricably mixed up with the bill, for every one considers that the arrangements made for carrying on the business of the Commonwealth Bank must affect exchange and other financial questions. Mr GuKCionv - How does it affect exchange ?",27
45,Mr MANN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"The exchange and discount rates must work together. Several suggestions have been made to meet the trouble. The Minister for Trade and  the House with a long speech on the subject.. He suggested that the exchange difficulty was d\ie to somo fault in our banking system, and that ' certain somewhat drastic remedies should be applied by the Government. Ue went so far as to say that it was time Australia developed its own necessary economic system, independently of international finance. While the difficulty that this would cause in buying goods from abroad had no terrors for the honourable member, it was difficult to sec how, when we wanted to sell our goods in other countries, we could reconcile this desire with such a formula. To talk of having our own economic system independently of the world's finance, is to talk of learning to breathe without using the atmosphere. The exchange difficult}' is due entirely to the balance of trade. Many statements have been made about the conThere is dition of our trade, which has been attributed to the large amount of importation; but it is wrong to consider such matters from the point of view of only a twelve-months' period. It is, in fact, quite impossible to do so, because the period of importation and exportation may not come within the same financial year. The only accurate way to get a proper view of that matter is to Work out the figures over a long period. Many of our exports of years ago have only recently brought a return to the Commonwealth. If . instead of a twelve-month, we take n ten-year.period, we find the figures rather astonishing. D u r i ng the last ten year""! our total visible exports show an exeass over imports of £92,800,000. In addition there are invisible exports, which in clude such things as increase of debts and interest payments. When these arc in cluded we find that the balance swings back somewhat, but not eo far as most people imagine. There was an excess of invisible imports over exports of £85,800,000. When the one figure is subtracted from the other, the exports are still in excess of the imports by £8,500,000. These figures do not include other invisible exports and imports, such ae services and private loans. We have no means of ascertaining these. As a matter of fact it is very doubtful whether the figures for our exports are not misstated. Let me give one instance of how that may happen. Suppose an exporter is sending fruit to England, and, on the basis of what he thinks the fruit will realise, declares the value to the Customs Department at 10s. or 12a. a case. In stead of realizing 10s. or 12s. a case, the fruit may sell for 15s. or 20s. a case.",27
46,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"O r for 5s. Mr MAJSnST - That is so, and a discrepancy arises in either case. I am explaining how the figures relating to exports may be inaccurate. I am aware of no means by which the amount actually obtained for the fruit in England is brought to account to correct the figures of exports. Therefore, we are working on very unreliable figures. The same argument applies to our exports of butter and all other products. It is therefore impossible to obtain any reliable figures.",28
47,Mr WEST,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,Peopl e who go from Australia to England take money with them from this countiy.,28
48,Mr MANN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"Peopl e who go from Australia to'England do not take money with them. That is one of the extraordinary fallacies held by some people. The exchange rate today is a very great boon to the man who wants to go to England, for if he deposits £97 with a bank in Australia, it will give him the right io spend £100 when he gets to London. He does not take money with him, but by depositing money with a bank in Australia, .and spending money in London, he assists to correct the exchange trouble wliile reaping a benefit himself. No definite information is obtainable as to the credit balance existing in London. We must infer that there is a credit balance in London, but probably it is not so large as is stated. Some people say that it is £50,000,000, but any such statement is more or less a guess. The figure cannot be stated accurately until we compel the banks to supply the information in their returns. A credit, however, must be there to account for the condition of the exchanges. It has always been the practice of the banks in Australia to keep balances at sliort call in London for financing their business transactions. The important consideration for a bank is not so much to have the money on the spot, as to have it readily available in case of need. In the old days, when we were working ou a free gold basis, the banks kept balances ' in London to meet their requirements. Those balances earned interest even for short periods, and did not embarrass the banks' operations in Australia, because they were readily available if required, and could be transferred here at very short notice. Since wo have departed from, the free gold basis, that cannot be done. There is only one way of actually transferring the money or its equivalent to this country, ancl that is by importing goods. This has become increasingly difficult for two reasons. In the first place, our protective policy tends all the time to force one-way trade. It tends to force exports and stop imports, ancl that is one reason why it is difiicult to transfer money or its equivalent from London to Australia. The other reason is - and I shall speak more on this matter later-that the purchasing power of the people of this country has probably diminished. If these difficulties cannot be removed, if it is not possible to give greater facilities for the importation of goods, or if it is not possible to increase .the purchasing power of the people here so that they can buy in spite of the tariff, then the only way to rectify the trouble is by the exchanges. This remedy is now being applied, and it is being shown that the banks are anxious to replace their balances in London by balances hero. The money cannot be brought out to Australia, for the reasons I have mentioned; but by means of the exchanges we can replace a balance in London by a balance here. The banks are forced to do that. They are compelled to apply the mechanism of exchange, even though they do it by a process that encourages imports and discourages exports. The banks are not operating, as has been alleged, in a definite conspiracy against our fiscal policy. The fiscal policy has forced them to take these measures, irrespective of the effect on them of that policy. this. is particularly hard oani one section the community-the primary prodiucei'S-anid! in the end it hits, the whole - oiuinity, because only by timeexchange of the products of OUB pafimary producers the world's markets: can: new wealth be brought to this country.

This suggests a. furtherreason for the present stringency, of the money market,, and for the desireof the banks, as shown by the exchange rates, to get rid of their Eotndon balances and replace them by cash reserves in Australia. me say, in passing, that one fallacy must be avoided, for it should be remembered tft-at the mterests of the banker and' the terests of the merchant-T use the term '''merchantin the widest sense-are not aitway-s identical; in faieti, SD-metimes it im< the interests, amd' the duty, a$ banker to check the merchant. aommoin mistake to speaik of the two sets of interests as. ideniticail.

It is highly probable tifoa* that information were available, irt wou'ld be found that the proportion, of advances made by the banks to secondary tries, as compared with those made to continuesto primary industries, is large a-nd increas:ing. Of course, it is impossible to obtain definite figures on the point, since they are not disclosed by the banks; but I find Mr Mann. that in 1911 the industrial workeusenUnfortunately, gaged in the Commonwealth in primary of industries represented. 29.9 percent, of the total number of breadwinners,, and comthose employed in other industrial activities represented 28.7 per cent..' of the in total.

Much has been said of the result of borrowing:. The eifeet on the exchangesis obvious and. deplorable, but I confess that it is very difficult to find a remedy. We are told to cease borrowing. Even in connection, with our immigration policy many peoplecontend that the British Government should help us more than it does. In response to representations to the British authorities large grants in aid of immigration have lately been offered. Nobody questions the need for immigration, but grantswill affect the exchange position just as much as loans do. Even if we stopped borrowing altogether and depended on grants from the Imperial Government we should still be faced with the difficulty of bringing money into Australia. The cessation of borrowing would' mean the stoppage of developmental works and immigration. We cannot raisemuch moremaimey than we have already borrowed in Australia, for it is not available'. This isi shown by the in crease in interest rates, and money is not available,, largely because of the diversion of interiiaJly-pradhrced wealth tobolster rap exotic industries. If the economical use of this money is left to the people, there will not be. the needfor borrowing abroadtbat now. exists.. By the policy we are adopting we are forcing the Government to borrow abroad:. I . do not refer only to extuavagant schemes, which, undoubtedly, ought to be stopped, but to essential works for which it is now impossihjl'e to borrow money other than abroad'. So long as we tie up our in ternally-produced wealth in an uneconomic direction', the people will have a diminished purchasing power. convinced that something much like a purchasers' strike isi now proceeding in Australia., and, ere Ixms. fimirther evidence orf it will ber seen. One notices it when he goes among, the lanierchants. au increasing andpositive determination on the part of the peoplenot to bay, be>cause they consider that the prices charged are exorbitant.. Borrowing, can be diminished if self-denial isexercised in the matter of public requirements, but borrowing, cannot be abolished unless we call a halt for a time to schemesof development or unless the craze for secondary industries is relfnouished'. I db not propose to deal with some otf'fchesuggestions that have been m'ade for Government intervention to devise schemes for transferring credits, for it is evident from the statement of the Treasurer that such schemes de net meet with, the approval of the Government, and are not likely to be adopted hy. it . For that I am devoutly thankful. I refer to the floating of loans and the issue of notes on the strength of the credits existing in London. Even if such schemes were practicable they would not be beneficial, but would probably be harmful, to the country. I am glad, thereifore, toi know that the Treasurer these does not intend to support any such proposal.. Now, I come to the question of the note issue and the Note Issue Board. I know that I shall probably be in a minority on this subject when I say that the board,, in the past,, has done absolutely right. I have no criticism to offer on the work of the board, which has, I believe, been actuated by sound principles, and has acted in the best interest's of the Cbmmonweartb. The honourable member for Macquarie- (Mr Manning) referred last week to an instance which he said showed that the board had acted wrongly. It was the case of certain Japanese wool purchasers, who wished to deposit 20Oi,OOO sovereigns, and obtain 200',0'00 notes in return. One of the banks was willing toundertake the transaction, but. it haid not the necessary notes on hand, and it referred the Japanese to the Note Issue Board, which declined to grant, their request, ontheground .that to do so would cause inflation. The honourable member for Maequarie said, that in flation eould; not result so* long aa gold was behind, the* notes-. Let me disabuse I feel .the minds of hoaiQ-rable members, of that idea. The addition of gold will not decrease inflation.. The statement made by the honourable member for Macquarie-, and many other honorThere is able members, shows that they are under the impression that the financial position is still controlled hy the gold reserve. But our notes ar.e inconvertible;-. gold, is no longer the basis of value. It is simply an article of merchandise,, and additions to the gold reserve will not in any way diminish inflation.. The test by which we may judge whether or not there is depreciation of Gui-rency is the price of gold bullion and the starte of foreLgjn ex chawges, and the only way to correct 1 depreciation is' to reduce currency relatively to the productiono f the country. The .Npte Issue Board acted rightly in trying to decrease inflation. ""We should bend all our efforts to getting back to the basis of free gold as soon as possible. Increasing our note issue indefinitely will never attain that end.",28
49,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,We cannot get back to u gold basis until England does so.,31
50,Mr MANN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"That is so, but we arc getting near it ; and I think we should aim at restoring it as soon as England can do so. One means to that end will bo to control our note issue with the object of decreasing instead of increasing it. The difficulty referred to by the lionorable member for Macquarie is capable of being met. It is quite probable that sufficient notes are already in circulation for our currency needs. Honourable members may ask where they are. Tliey do not leave the country, so they must be here somewhere. Inquiry would probably reveal that some of the banks, and possibly the Commonwealth Bank, arc holding notes to help them to obtain, business under our competitive system, rather than allowing the notes to be used co form what may bo called a pool of yurrency to meet a crisis of the kind we are now facing. I suggest that it is the duty of the banks to try to get some measure of co-operation among themselves rather than to carry the spirit of competition too far.",31
51,Mr MANNING,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,-There is no competition at present.,31
52,Mr MANN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"That is probably so. But if a certain bank is unable to secure for itself the business it has in mind, notes should be available for use byanother bank. That is much preferable to issuing new notes to a bank, as it often wishes, in order to enable it to increase its own. business. If the already issued notes were available instead of being locked up, they could be used for trading as opportunity arose. matter of fact, very little currency is required to conduct a large volume of business. By way of illustration, let us suppose that A owes B £13, and that B owes A £10. Tho amount of currency required to meet that situation will vary according to the method of payment adopted. If A sends B £13 and B Sends A £10 simultaneously, £23 of currency is required. If B sends A £10 and A sends back to B the same £10 with another. £ 3 , £13 of currency is required. If , however, A and B get together and cancel the £10 of mutual debt and A pays B £3, only £3 of currency is required. It will be well worth inquiring whether the Commonwealth Bank is withholding notes from circulation. I do not propose to go into that question now, but some such arrangement as I have suggested should be possible under the provisions of this bill, because the Notes Issue Board will be working in co-operation with the board of directors of the bank. The disposition of the currency will then be. so well known that it will be possible to utilize it to give the maximum benefit to the interests concerned. If our currency resources are pooled for general servics as part of a definite central policy to get back to the gold basis as soon as possible, it will be altogether to the advantage of the countiy and we shall be in the right way to escape from our present troubles. In discussing financial matters recently, the honourable member for Barton (Mr F. MCDonald) went so far as to say that the Government was responsible for the unsatisfactory exchange position. This Government is no more responsible for it than any preceding Government, including the Labour Government. The honor in a speech he made lately on our financial outlook, demanded government action to remedy the situation. He said: "" The Government must do something."" But he the made his demand in a curious way. He reminded me of a patient who said to his doctor: "" I do not know what is wrong with me, .but I want you to find out and to do everything necessary to cure me. I make one stipulation, however. There must be no operation. I will not submit to one.''' The honourable member for MarAs a tin requested the Government to act, but said that it m-ust not interfere witli our policy of protection. Government interference is quite unwarranted, I think, except to provide machinery by which the best experience of the past can be broueht to bear on the situation, and to modify any public policy which is inimical to the public welfare. No Government has yet conferred much benefit upon its people by placing restrictions upon them. The most beneficial acts of government have always been thoso which removed restrictions and increased liberty. That applies to problems of trade and exchange also. sire to read to lionorable members some remarks made by Sir Henry Strakosch, chairman of the Financial Committee of the League of Nations, who, I believe, was responsible for the establishment of the South African Reserve Bank. He said:There are no countries except those in the must primitive state of civilization which can IK' c.iilled self-contained. Thin highly complex economic organization of the world has Ijcen built up by a gradual iin.l almost imperceptible process of evolution. liVorything hud in that process adjusted itself to the progros3 as it was gradually achieved, .=o that today that organization cannot exist without the essential elements that have built it up, namely, the possibility of a free and unfu'iiderud exchange of goods mid services the world over. The lack of this freedom of exchange is one of the root causes of the present disjointed condition of the world and one of the outstanding causes of the instability of the exchanges. :nd yet there are people who doubt ihe necessity of international co-operation when, as T havp tried to show, the very life of a vast proportion of the population of this globe could nut. be sustained for any length of ""time without the closest international co-operation. it: litis been said that our present position is unprecedented, and is an extraordinary outcome of the great war, and that as we have no guide from history we must evolve JI soluliou for ourselves. There is nothing new under the sun, and those that say that this situation is new only do so because they aro ignorant of the past. Circumstances exactly similar to those in which wo now find ourselves faced England at the close of the Napoleonic wars. Any one who will take the trouble to read the history of banking will find that a sanation existed then which was exactly like this one. If certain dates and names were altered that history could be made to - ipply in Australia. The famous Bullion Committee of 1819 was appointed to inquire into the subject of currency. In its report it laid down the principles which have governed sound banking practice ever since. If we think that wo are wiser than those who preceded us, or that we can afford to ignore the past and throw aside the accumulated experience of the years, we shall act very foolishly. We shall certainly suffer if we neglect to heed the lessons of history, and set out to make experiments. The principles laid down by the Bullion Committee, whioh are the basis of the exchange practices aud sound banking I de- principles of today, are also the foundation of this bill.",31
53,Mr FENTON,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,I thought it was an antiquated t h in g !,32
54,Mr MANN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"We shall be both weak aud foolish if we allow the argument that because a thing is old it is useless to cause us to neglect to profit by the lessons of the past, and i r y io guide our course by our own limited experience. That will uot discover for us a way out cf our difficulties. The Government has adopted a sound and absolutely right, course in placing before honourable members the proposals contained in this bill. It does uot suggest any foolish experiments, and I am glad that it has been strong enough to refuse to be misled into adopting suggestions which would only accentuate our troubles. By passing the bill . Parliament will act wisely, and do a great deal to stabilize comnierce, and remove many of the difficulties which face the business world. If the principles which underlie the bill are adopted, and supported by a sound and economic fiscal policy, they will help every branch of trade and commerce.",32
55,Mr LAZZARINI,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"Werriwa) [5.30] 1 want to say in reference to the bill it self, to which I - shall not devote much of my attention, that, like many other measures introduced by the Government, it is intended in the first place, as the Treasurer (Dr Earlo Page) has told us, to stabilize the money trust of Australia, and, i u the second place, .to provide some very good jobs for friends of the Government. In introducing the measure the Treasurer was strictly orthodox. He has made no attempt to substitute some better system for one that has broken down throughout the world. Eor any such purpose this bill is useless. Wc are told that the Commonwealth Bank is to be made a banker's bank in order to stabilize banking, but the one provision which might have helped to makei t effective even on those lines has been left out of this bill by the Treasurer. The Bank of England is a banker's bank nnd a private institution. It is intended for the protection of bankers, but under the law it is impossible for any financial institution in Great B r it a in to draw upon the reserves of the Bank of England. We have been told by the Treasurer that under the .scheme proposed in this bill we must depend upon the goodwill of the bankers in this matter. As one who has read something of the banking tems of the world, I say that without a compulsory provision such as I have referred to this measure will fail, even considered as a bill for the establishment of a banker's bank. I want to deal with the speech delivered by the mainly for the reason that the bill proposes the appointment of a board to manage the Commonwealth Bank, and it may be expected that the members of the board will look for light and guidance to what is termed the intention of Parliament in passing this measure. doing so, I have no doubt that the Treasurer's speech on the second reading of the bill will be the text-book of the board, and .upon, that account I regard speech as full of danger to the Commonwealth. The honourable speech was devoted anidrely to financial and commercial interests. There was not - one word iii it about rural .credits or of the intention to nse. the Commonwealth Bank .to assist £ho people by establishing rural credits for the benefit of the man on the land, about whom honourable members in the Country party's corner prate so much. I suppose that plums given to Country party supporters were necessary to allow the Treasurer to. side-step his eleotion promises. I remember which he delivered an which he said that the Commonwealth Bank should be extended to provide rural credits. not only to - develop primary but, in the honourable words, to take the secondary to the primary industries. But there is not a. word about this in the bill. fulfilment of the Treasurer's promises to his .constituents and the country, the bill is a - mookery and a hollow sham. The honourable gentleman told us that he will not subscribe to restricting public and that it is his intention to float loans abroad. I remember .the - speeches made on this subject by the hoaiotrable member  Minister for- 'Trade and .Customs. two. occasions when he sat opposite as a private member, he lectured this House very learnedly. Tie told us that borrowing abroad was to the detriment of this oountry, and he showed us dearly and definitely why that was so. Mr Lazzarini. have we ifound ? The honourable member sat in his place in this House .as a private member, and listened to the Treasurer, sys- making .the pronouncement that he was going tio float loans abroad, and two hours after the Treasurer's speech was made, the honourable member took his place side by .side with the Treasurer as a minister in the same cabinet. Ifthis Treasurer is political morality, I should like some one to tell me what is political immorality. We have been told that there is to be a hoiard <of experts to advise the management - of the bank. I suppose they - will be of the same type as the experts who advised the Government In when the war broke out., and who laughed to scorn the idea that this - country could raise more than £4,000;000 internally for war purposes. Now, as the Treasurer the wants to borrow abroad, and wouM pawn this country >to the. money-lenders outside gentleman's of Australia, I suppose the experts he has referred to will be after his own heart, and will certainly advise him to go to London or somewhere else to the Jew money-lenders, and tie up this country in the hands of 'the international money trust. The 'Treasurer is going to float loans abroad, and the Minister for Trade and Customs now says, "" All right, Mr , Treasurer, float loans abroad. I am a member of the Government today, and away go the splendid principles I - enunspeeches ciated a few days ago. I am now hand-inhand with the Government,, prepared to bind Australia, to cripple her secondary It was industries, and tie her up hand and foot industries, by floating loans abroad,"" In his disser.gentleman's tation on currencies, 'the Treasurer talked industries about money being tight, which is the most absurd statement that could be As a made. In 1914 there was £35,385,924 of legal currency in the banks of Australia. Assuming that there was half that .amount, or £ 1 7 ; 692,362, which is a Mseral estimate, in the hands of the borrowing, people, there was £53,000,000 of legal currency in Australia in T.91-4 at tfie beginning of iihe 'war period. On 'top' of that, the private banks .'expanded credit approximately to the lextent of On i^OO.OOO.'OOO.. Credit - was .'expanded to make - provision for secondary industries and to alkfw - war-tiimei indnistries to be developed, and in - many other ways. This was .all deme om a legal ourrency of £53,0.0O,-OO0.. Yet we .are mow .told that But what we .cannot float loams internally because there would be inflation. The 'Treasurer spoke of inflation repeatedly - during speech. He told us that the - Go'Vernment cannot (perform a miracle, .and we know that it cannot. The mentality of the Treasurer'is .capable of :seeing only one way out of ""the entanglement. He says, and his 'statement has been endorsed by the honourable member for Perth -(Mr Mann), that we sermst go back to something which they worship with the superstitious abandon of the most primitive savage, and that is the gold basis. I want show honourable members the - stupendous miracle which this thing called gold is be called upon to perform. T f the counsponsible try is to go back to the gold basis day day the miracle to be performed will be come increasingly difficult. The surer talked of paper currency, the green backs of America, and the assignats of France, lamd I tell him that any attempt to .go back today to .the jgold basis may precipitate a financial crisis compared to which those in America and France, ito meet which paper currency was resorted to, were insigmifiieant. Here are the figures which have to be considered if are going back to a gold 'basis. 'Commonstill. wealth notes, £t>B,'556,69S; savings bank deposits, -£162,'273., 2'S'3; in baafks at £123,«1D,1S4. 'These figures give a total of £33'9,649,«50. The total in gold coin in the Treasury and in .gold, silver, and autocraey could commit. other - metals in the banks, amounts £45,249,85'0,, or only 13 per cent, of the claims which .could lae made upon it . we .attempted to get back to the gold basis, every depositor in .a savings bank, or private - bank, w.o.uld - be as much entitled as any bank manager to demand from the Treasurer gold to the amount of his dewe posit. We have 18 per cent, in gold meet the claims set out, which might be made .against it , and if we add the amount of the fixed deposits in banks£164,,725,.978„ which would also have be paid in gold, we should have a total possible demand .of over £503,000,000, f which we should have only 8 per cent, in gold. That is to say, we have only £8 in gold for every £100. of .credit built upon Cur credit is a huge pyramid balanced on £l,.OO.0,*OiOO its apex instead - of its base. To talk of getting back to the gold basis is iia-vse the height of stupidity. The Treaamd surer must know that it be done. There is .something sinister about the proposal The his quoted by the honourable gentleman prove the correctness iof those I have quoted. All this talk of getting back .to the gold basis and deflation is only the talk of those interested in - the scheme of. deflation throughout the worid today in the interests of the financiers. The gold basis is a theory only. It is referred to as something tangible, although it has never existed in the last 100 .years.. The honourable member for 'Perth has talked to about .the bullion committee .and the banking business that was built upon to it. Talk about the ,gold basis was refor the colossal stupidity, of by Peel's Bank Act of 1844. Every time the British nation has struck a crisis that Treaact 'has had to be suspended. 'The 'Treasurer has talked of - deflation, and in tearful tones has told us about the widow and the orphan. I do not 'know whether the Treasurer realized that what ""he was doing was done by the money-masters 'hi America - and in France. It is - what - was done after the Napoleonix: wars. Those in terested talked ahout deflation, the widow, the orphan, and - the wage-earner, and we used their poverty to ma'ke them poorer Right throughout the Treasurer's speech there is the cry of deflation, and call, I say that if the money power as 'allowed , to hring about deflation today, it wil3 be the greatest crime .a .sodden financial Loans were to floated when money - was cheap, and, apparently, the old process is to be repeated If now. ""We talk of the gold basis, and are going to try to deflate, with the result in a that the bond-holders will be able to double and treble their .strangle-hdld on the nation.

Verily, B r . Johnson was right in his da)', as ho would be right today, when be said that the plea of patriotism was the last refuge of tlic scoundrel. The Treasurer told us that, in 1920, money was tight. Of course ir was tight. Who made it tight? It was the banks who did so. It was the same scheme all the time. The bankers are talking in this way, yet they say. "" Let us get a few more notes."" If notes to the value of an additional £6,000,000 are issued, they will extend credit to the extent of £1S,000,000, and will' charge 9 per cent, interest on advances. It will be the primary and secondary industries that will be squeezed. I was astounded to hear the Treasurer say that the Commonwealth note was the only paper currency in Australia. notes are only till money. pounds comprise 90 per cent, of the paper currency in Australia and in every British country. My stnteinc.nl: may be questioned, bur 1. shall quota an authority whom no honourable member will attempt fo dispute-Arthu r Kitson, a well-known financial writer. He put the position clearly when - lie -.""aid It is only »s M notumodity Uiat money is capable of btiing exploited. ] t is in litis capacity alone that inuney-bi-nUers and bunkers arc able to extort interest.

Over 30 years ago Dunning MCLeod, an authority on finance and economics, saidPaper money has had incomparably more influence, in the world than all the gold and silver. Credit and paper money now form the great circulating medium or currency of the world, and amounts to ut least 50 times the quantity of specie in this country (England), and in the United States of America nt least 98 per cent.

By a spurious currency private extend credit, and make up the deficiency of currency. In the process they reap great benefits for themselves. cheque pounds they aro issuing feit currency, just as the ordinary criminal does who forges a £5 note. Mr Lazzarini.",32
56,Mr STEWART,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"That is a strong statement to make. Mr Lazzarini . - It is illegal currency. These people have no right to usurp the functions of the Government. They provide 98 per cent, of the paper currency of this country ; and it is illegal. Some honourable members may arguo against Mr MCLeod, but I challenge them to quote any financial writer, worthy of consideration, who contends that a cheque is not currency. Let me, for the purpose of illustration, take two people-on e a goldsmith, and the other a farmer. The goldsmith turns gold into trinkets and ornaments, and, while he may not be of much use in a country, he manufactures articles which give pleasure to a number of people. Let us assume that, because: of a falling off in trade, he Those requires currency with which to pay Cheque his debts. He takes from his stock articles containing gold to the value of, say, £500, which he carries to the mint. He receives,in. return 500 sovereigns, with which he is able to pay his debts. Now let us consider the position of the farmer. He has. perhaps, a few hundred pounds to his credit, but is overtaken by a drought. His stock dies, and his machinery wants attention, and ho soon finds that his small amount of ready money is exhausted. The next year there is promise of a good season. His assets may be worth £5,000, but instead of going fco the Government and obtaining a satisfactory medium for paying his way. free of any Shylock interest, ho has to Uke his assets to a bank manager. A f t e r a lot of talk he obtains an overdraft of £2,000 on assets worth £5,000, the title to which he has to deposit with the banker in the form of the deeds of his property. He thou .obtains a cheque-book, and by tendering cheques buys what he wants and puts in his crop. as it does, Will any man outside a lunatic asylum say that those cheques are not currency? instituThe farmer has to pay to the Shylock institutions 7 per cent, or 8 per cent, for But suf- the liquifying of some of his assets. When one finds rural production stifled, and men who are supposed to be here in bankers the interests of the primary producer standing behind a Government which is responsible for the introduction of this By using measure, one is tempted to misquote the counter- well-known hymnWhen wilt Thou save the farmer, Oh God of Mercy, when? I defy any financial expert to sliow ns the lino of demarcation between safety and inflation. W it b banking institutions issuing overdrafts and cheques today, and withdrawing and cancelling them tomorrow, it is impossible to say to what extent there is inflation; but a rough idea can be obtained from their clearing-house returns. In 1914 the clearing-house returns for the Commonwealth amounted to £807,692,000. 1922-th o latest figures obtainable-the amount bad increased to £1,745,862,000. Those figures apply only to the five chief cities of the Commonwealth, as the interchanges and credit instruments for the country do not go through the clearinghouse. I repeat that increasing requirements of the people for currency can, under conditions, only bo satisfied increasing the spurious currency by means of illegal cheque pounds. The Treasurer told us of the methods which were adopted to finance the Avar loans. The banking institutions extended credit to the extent of £300,000,000 on a legal currency of £53,000,000. In doing so, the private banks did not forego the interest on their money. Let me give an instance from my own experience. At one time. I conducted a small business. I had property worth probably £1,200, but was in need bf £100 or £200 ready money. When I applied for an overdraft I was informed that I could not get it , as money was very tight. But when the war loan was floated, I could have obtained credit for the full £1,200. surer also referred to the war gratuity loan. He told us that £6,000,000 had to bo raised to meet necessitous cases among soldiers and their dependants, and that the banks had agreed to find the money on the understanding that they would bo able to get notes again at the same rate of interest as was paid on the bonds. that time we on this side of the House argued that the Government could just as easily give that £6,000,000 to the soldiers free of interest. The same thing is true concerning the wheat pools. When Sir Joseph Cook was Treasurer, I pointed out that wheat created its own credit, and that all that was necessary was for credit to be given for the time being. Sir J oseph Cook admitted that I was right, but added that he did not know where the money was coming from . We were told that the farmers could only get 2s. 6d. per bushel for their wheat at the time, and . that a certificate would be issued in six months' time for the balance of the 5s. Immediately those certificates were issued, they were cashed by the banks at considerable profit to themselves. The members of the Country party, who claim to be here in the interests of the primary In producer, are supporting a Governinent which is standing behind institutions which are bleeding the farmer. The Treasurer, in referring to the creation of security to meet the deflation of currency, used the arguments of Law and the French assignats, and the greenbacks the ever- of America. The assignats failed because an attempt was made to make them conpresent form to a gold standard. Further, the inflation did not take place in France, by but in England, where the printing presses were kept going day and night printing counterfeit notes, which were smuggled into France by the hundred million. Similarly, the American greenbacks did not depreciate u n t i l they were repudiated by the Government.",35
57,Mr SCULLTN,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,They won the Civil War.,36
58,Mr LAZZARINI,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"The same process of deflation went on. The loans for the Civil War were floated in the American dollar. They adopted the same system as is proposed here. They decided that there must be a reversion to the gold basis, and ?100 worth of bonds, owing to inflation, was reckoned to be worth §60 in gold. The Trea- A f t e r the process of deflation back to a gold basis had taken place, these bonds were worth §5100 in gold. The national debt was thus increased 40 per cent. But the American greenbacks never depreciated u n t i l they were repudiated by the Government, which refused to accept them in payment of dues and taxes, and At even after that happened they circulated at par freely throughout America for a number of years.. An y attempt i u Australia to deflate currency down to a gold basis will be attended by the same woes and distress as characterized Lawism in France and the deflation of the greenbacks in America. It can only result in enslaving the masses of the people by giving economic domination to the large bondholders. The Treasurer referred also to Russia and America, but those who urge a reform in our currency advocate something nioare sensible' than the turning aut of notes like sa>usag.esi fiiomi amachine. Listening to the Treasurer aaid the ablememuber for Perth (Mr Mann) talkprogress-,, ing about getting back, to a gold basis, one would think that that basis was. teal standard,, that it was like the raised. foot-rule orthe pound weight and never varied;. but Professor Jevona states, tha value of gold fell 46 per cent, tween 1789 and 1809, that from 1809"" 1849 it appreciated 145 per cent., whilst between 1849 ancl 1874,, it fell' again feast 20 per cent.

So it is with economic diseases;, even a fifth-class schoilaE can. state the effects of the currency manipulation, viz., too much Anything that currency, high prices: too little currency, is low prices.

Let and us then have a food basis for our cur1 Hence the rency. Food is invaluable, yet it gives a value to. everything else. A starving man will yield aJl his worldly possessions for one meal. Therefore, food should, be our basis for the fixation of a currency standard. I do not wish to be accused of advocating the issue of currency against foodstuffs. Such a proposal would be ridiculous; but we can get a definite invariable unit on the basis of some staple food. Take wheat, for instance. could ascertain scientifically what is a reasonable price for the grower to receive. Suppose, for the ""sake of argument, that that price is 5s. per bushel'. mittee of experts may adVise that with a populationo f 6,000,000 people, £5O,OW0',00O of currency is required to strictlymaintain that price. The wheat price will' be like a barometer, showing the state of the currency.

Gui'i:eney is the coE'trolling"", the impelling, force in the raatioa. It permits' the people to apply tlieir energies to primary and secondary industries. Currency is the electric current, the motive power, of the' nation. I caremot how many motor cars a man. may have if I control the supply of petrol'. I care mot wha>t expen>sive factory ©r machinery a company or an individual' may ©war if I control the motive power that) drives it . I - care not 1 how wealthy a nation' may be, how great 1 its potentialities-,, or how extensive' its natural resources., if a small body of men We have such a tight grip on it that they can control its expansion-. 1 Such a body of men control that nation just as the people who sirppfy electric current, decide A com- whether a factory shall operate or not. Those who Have this"" tight grip upon our finances today are able to say whether our wonderful' natural resources shall be developed, and' whether we shall be forced to buy goods from abroad. They decide whether we shall' become aself-reliant nation or be tied to theapron-strings of nations in Europe or elsewhere. They control absolutely the economic policy ef the country, andi they act in. accordance only with their own interests. The Treasurer told^ us that the Conimoar wealth Bank, would publish, the exchange and discount rates. That presumably is part of the deflation, scheme. The. Commonwealth Bank, im. short, is. to operate 1 like the Bank of England.. As. he talked so much about the. gpl'd basis, I presumed that he anticipated that the, discount rate would rise and f all accounting to the amount of the gold reserve. In this connection I issue a ward of warniaig. This practice of the Bank of England, was. the outcome, of the wonderful Bullion, report, upon which a bill waa passedby. Sir Bobert Peel in 1844'. Because the Bank of England raises or lowers thediscount the rate according to the. gold reserve, the Treasurer says the same system should be introduced here. I invite him to con1 The sidertheMTbwing extract from a financial journal': Sonie years ago, during a period of some weeks; a» growpof Americanfinanciers drew from the Bank of England' sums equad' in all to £11,000,000 in gold, and shipped it to New York. Prior to thisi operation the gamblers sold British securities heavily, and bought United. States bonus', amd' slraresi Thiw transfer of £11,000,000 of gold caused, a heavy fall in 325 of Britisli representative securities, equivalent to £1T5,OOO-,OO0;' while the absorption of gold ini America; caused a> corresponding rise 1 in American, seeunitiesu. It was computed that the natural' resources of England were worth £20,000,000,000 . Because of the "" wise "" provision referred to by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), the removal by a few American gamblers of £11,000,000 froma country possessing such immense resources caused a financial crisis, and 325 of British representative securities fell in value. The crisis caused unemployment and depression of trade. Why? If that £11,000,000 had been represented by goods, by the products of British factories, the result would have been buoyancy in Great B r it a in ; it would have added to employment in that coun-' try, and increased the output of its factories. But because the export was of gold, the effect was different. That is what a gold standard controlled by a few people does for the world. Many people speak of the necessity for maintaining the longestablished gold standard. When was it established ? Gold has been an international standard only since 1870. Before that it was purely a British currency. Great Britain had a gold basis of currency, and Franco a bi-metal basis. Bismarck, when Germany received her indemnity of £400,000,000 from France, turned the German basis of currency from silver to gold, and Italy and the United States of America followed shortly after. The argument that the gold basis is very old, and must for that reason be retained, does not affect me, because I know that the world managed very well without it. Between 1840 and the increase in the industrial development in Great Britain amounted to about 600 per cent. That was when there was no international gold From 1870 to 1905, when the international standard was gold, there was relatively almost no progress. The worship of gold certainly gees back to pagan days, and while we continue to worship it we shall have the undesirable economic conditions found in pagan countries. On the one side we shall have those who are economically secure, and on the other those who are economic slaves.",36

60,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"Swan) [8.0] - This bill is one of the most important, measures that could be submitted to Parliament, and I hope that the Government will not regard the criticisms I am about to offer as indicative of a desire to embarrass Ministers, for I realise that, unless honourable members can induce the Government to give my view something in the nature of favourable consideration, the interests for which I desire to speak are unlikely to receive the attention to which they are entitled. My keen desire is that the Government may reconsider their proposal, so far as the note issue is concerned, or, at any rate, try to obtain evidence as to what, the effect of the bill is likely to be on the trade and commerce of Australia. It is all very well for the Treasurer or his officials to endeavour to get information on the banking question, but it would bo far more satisfactory in the public interests if we appointed a select committee of this chamber to ascertain how Parliament could best legislate on banking so as to aid trade ancl commerce. Kather than in dulge in patchwork legislation, due more or less to party differences, the desire of every honourable member should be to help develop the industries of the country, and we should call to our assistance the keenest intellects in Australia. One matter on which I desire to reproach the Government-and many previous governments are equally blameworthy-is the fact that once legislation has been passed at the instance of what I might call a Socialistic party, no effort is made to repeal it , even when it is found to operate 1870 against the best interests of Australia. Believing that the note issue, as it is at present, is a grave menace to the future of this country, there standard. is great danger in not repealing its objectionable features. Other statutes, such as the Arbitration and Navigation Acts, are open to similar objection. Notwithstanding any threat that may be made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), Parliament should, without fear or favour, repeal legislation found to be opposed to the country's best interests. I do not blame the Leader of the Opposition for threatening what be would do if he were entrusted with the p.m. reins of government, and if honourable members on this side of the Hou""e think any particular legislation bad their first duty is to repeal it . Mr E . KIT-EY - The honourable member is not game to reoeal this measure.",39
61,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"I am, in parts. Section 60p of the principal act empowers the Governor General in Council to supersede the Notes Issue and that power is retained in the pre-cut bill. I invito honourable members to consider the position that mightarise if unemployment were rife , and the Treasurer, desiring to make finance easy, in structed the board to issue a large number of notes to the various states, or he superseded the Board. . Such a thing is quite feasible. If wo were legislating for war conditions, Parliament, could be called together, and the necessary power could be obtained ; but at. the present time there is no need for such a provision on the statute-book. The Notes Issue Board should have supreme power if we are to continue the present form of issue. Ono of the first points that occurred to is<< in looking over the bill was the designation of "" ciqntal."" The bank is to have ri capital of £4,000,000, with an additional £6,000,000 which may be obtained by loan raised by the Government. understand how money raised by way of loan can be classed aa capital. money borrowed hy the Crown for the purpose of being lent to the bank must be :> liability until the debt is discharged.",39
62,Mr MAXWKLL,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"Capital is always a liability to the shareholders. Mr ' GREGORY - There is a difference between the £4,000,000 and the loan money that would have to be repaid.",40
63,Mr MAXWELL,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,It is all capital so the bank is concerned.,40
64,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"I contend that it not capital. That, however, is a matter that can be more appropriately dealt with in the committee than in the secondmonwealth reading stage. Then comes the posal to appoint a board of directors, and this should commend it-solf fo honourable members. No matter skilful or brilliant, or hew versed i finance a man may be, there is always danger, i u one-man control, of the frailties that be3et every human being exercising an influence which may be far from beneficial to the community. The extraordinary manner in which the Commonwealth Bauk was built up reflects the utmost credit upon the late governor, Sir Denison M ill e r ; but even if he alive today, and in full possession faculties, the need for a board of direcpresent tors would still exist. Provision is required for a continuity of policy in the work (he bank. Under the bill it is to remain Board, a trading bank, although I believe it would have been better if , in the initial aiages, it had been made a reserve bank. Seeing that it has come to stay as a trading bank, our duty is to legislate to the best of our ability io make it an institution worthy of the Commonwealth. With one-man control we might have a governor or director whose convictions urged him to foster, as much as lay in his power, primary production. On his retirement, however, thero might be a director with a solid belief that the future of Australia depended on the building up of city interests, with the result that advances might be withdrawu from farming and pastoral pursuits and used in support of industrial enterprises. I am quite satisfied that it is essential to have a board of directors that will provide the continuity of policy necessary for (he best development of the industries of Australia. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), in introducing the measure, I cannot pointed out that the act under which the Commonwealth Bank waa constituted was Surely designed to create a truly national bank. We have heard the expressions "" a national bank "" and "" a people's bank "" : but we have had no clear explanation of what, honorablo members opposite, really desire. I believe that their wish is that the' Government shall, by legislation, place the control of banking under one government institution, thereby socializfar ing the whole of the banking institutions of Australia, and conducting them under is one head. If that is the desire of our friends opposite, the sooner we know it the better. Wc could well class the ComBauk as a national one if it prowere a reserve bank. I do not know how il, can be claimed that the present instituall tion is a people's bank. There may bc how some members of Parliament and some n newspapers who would class it as such, a but. I do not kuow of any substantial opinion amongst the general trading community of Australia that the Commonwealth Bank has assisted, up to the present, in developing the industries of this country to the same extent as have the leading private banks. Although I admire the splendid work of the late Sir were Denison Miller, I kuow of nothing done of his by the Commonwealth Bank up to the time which would justify one in describing it as a people's bank, and I of see nothing in the present bill calculated to make it a national - bank, f l o w does the Leader ef the Opposition (Mr .

He did not want them unless they suited him. I am one of those who assume that jseopde with a business and to in - commercial 'training know a little more - passed about t2rei.r awn businesses 'than a parliament is likely to do. My long - experience in parliament and .'in administration has led me to believe that people outside parliament can - conduct their businesses ten thousand times better than members of Parliament could conduct them for them, and that parliamentary interference in trading -.concerns leads to the depreciation and consequent r u in of those concerns. Tx""o haiik has a greater reputation than has the Bank of England. Although Great B r it a in has - passed through .most severe financial tribulations owing i o the heavy war - expenditure, no .attempt has been made to .deprive that bank of any of its - great ./powers. Lt still TStnuds .supreme as - a hanking institution, .and although Gir-ea-t - Britain's debt .is so eaieiuiMWis, and although the trade >of the nounitry - is marvelous in <coiapaiiisO!n with ours, no suggestion has *been mads - Jor pratting the bank Hinder government - Gomteol. There is - a .certain amxjHait of government control over the Bank of Er.ance, so far as the directors and censors are concerned, but it is a. privateinstitution, and is one of the great banking corporationsof the world. The Reichsbamk was a private bank until therecent war, whenmembers of Parliament like m y friendsopposite secured' control, with disastrous results such as' woulds surely fblloAv if some of my friends opposite were incontrol of the Australiannotes issue ait. a time when there was an insistent demand to provide employment for the unemployed; that is to say, tliere would he an issue of notes such as there has recently heen in Germany and Russia. There is a national reserve bank in the United States of America, but the other banks are entirely free from government control. the Treasurer a little to blame for the fact that he did not dca-l to the same extent with the banking institutions' of countries whose conditions are similar to those of Australia. As a member of the Country party, whose keen desire it is that the interests of the primary producers shall' beconserved, I think: that the legislation he should endeavour to bring before this Parliament should be on the lines' of that of Canada, or New Zealand', wliose conditions are similar to thoseof Australia.. I shall endea-wut toshow how the banks of Canada function to meet the requirements of com1 merce and trade, and how they have proved of benefit to the industries of the dominion. Like Australia, Canada has special seasonal currency requirements for the disposal of her produce, and her banking laws are framed with an elasticity that enables the banks"" to finance with their note issue the. export ofi the country's' produce . 1 have surprisingchartsshowing the extraordinary seasonal demands npon. the Canadian banks'. I do not propose to go full y intothedetails of the Canadi-am system', which hasalready been exhaustively explained by the Tuea-surer, but I want toimpress on honourable members the fact that, under the Canadianlaw, both the dominionand the banks issue notes: The banks must hold 40 per cent,! of their cash reserve indominion notes, but they m a y also issue their own notes up to the amount of their unimpaired reserves, and' also to the value of' the dominion notes and gold they hold', and upon which they pay taxation. If the suggestion I am about to make be carried orat, tliere will be no loss of revenueto the Commonwealth. Absolute protection, will 1 be afforded to the public: by strict legislation, but at the same time there will be that elasticity ofi finance which is essential to the-, couumercei of the country. MB . Joseph i \ Jlolimstoimv of the; New York University School' o£ Trades amd 1 Accounts, a recognized authority irn the United Statesof America,, has written a book on the Canadian banking, system, from which I have copied a chart which shows the seasonal requirements of the people of Cauada in connection with their banks' note issue. The period covered is fourteen years old,, but I believe that the I hold position today is exactly the same as it was then. The chart shows with marvellous exactitude each year the extraordinary seasonal demands which occur in Cauada as to an equal, if not greater,, extent in Australia. There is an almost normal' note circulation from January to July i u each year. In August, there is a large issue of notes; for the. purpose of financing, the wlieat harvest, but innearly every instance these notes are returned and cancelled, in January of. the following, year. In 1900,. the paid-up capital of tha hunks in Canada, was $68,000,000.. Iia, Jul y of the following year the note circulation was StiS^OOdDOO, 1 'ini October it was* $57',OQQ,0OO,. and in the followingJanuary $49,000,000. In 1902, the note circulation' was $52,000,000 in July; $60,000,000 in October , and' im the' following January 1 §55,O0O „O0O'. In the next year, the figures ! for the 1 respective months 1 were: $5.7,000-000; $65,000,000? and $5-6,a0%OQOl I In1908, when the capital of the banks had increased to $$6.,OOO',010O, the note circulation; was as follows: - July , $67,000 000; October, $84,000,000"";: Jan5 uary, 1909, $66,0OOsOOO'. The Canadian ! conditions are almost, ifdembical with ours, audi itr ishighly desiiiable that we should: havesimilar elasticity of cujirency to meet OUB seasonal ta-ade and commerce: requirements. TheNote Issue B'oai'd-'s; policy shows that the 1 Board has not realized what the Ausfaar Lian seasonal requirements really are. I fcrus* that honourable members' will examine the chart I have prepared, and that the Treasurer will also give some j : attention to it . In almost every year the note circulation of Canada varies f rom July to October, but becomos normal in January. A slight inflation is bound to occur, at certain periods of the year, but the banks may be trusted to sec that it is not serious, for they aro required to legal tender. pay taxation on the notes they issue. They take all possible steps to cancel the extra notes as soon as possible after they are issued.",41
69,Mr MAXWELL,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,It is practically an a utomu tic arrangement.,43
70,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"That is so. I regret that I have not been able to obtain definite particulars of the variations that have occurred in the Canadian note circulation since 1910, but the regularity Ihe variations in the years that are shown ou my chart is remarkable. I recommend honorablo members to obtain that book from the library and read it. Canada's note circulation has shown an increaso each year which corresponds with the increase in her trade and commerce. That, of course, ought naturally to occur. Which policy is most likely to be favourable to the country, placing the note issue under the control of a government bank, a semi-political institution, under trained experts ? I obtained recently from the Commonwealth Statistician a return showing the population and the imports and exports of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, and also of the notes in circulation ou 30th June, over a period of years. In considering these figures, honourable members should recollect that the figures for Canada, which aro given in pounds sterling, are for the period when the note issue wffs normal, and not when it reached its apex in October or November. In 1900, when Australia had a population of 3/740,665, and a trade of £87,845,000, the notes in circulation totalled £3,762,286, or £1 0s. Id. per head of the population. In the same year, New Zealand had a population of 763,594, a trade of £23,892,257, and a note circulation of £1,361,355, or £1 15s. 3d. per head. The Canadian figures that year were:-Population , 5,322,000; trade, £73,129,464; note circulation, £9,570,362, or £1 16s. per head. In 1910, Australia had a population of 4,367,405, a trade of £134,505,501, and a note circulation of £4,563,907, or £1 0s. l i d . per head. note circulation per head of the population of .New Zealand in that year was £1 12s. 0d., and of Canada, £2 8s. lOd. Those were the days of gold currency. I shall now quote some figures which relate to the post-war period when notes were In 1920 Australia had a population of 5,360,462, her trade was valued at £248,797,801, and her note circulation was £21,627,117, or £4 0s. 8d. per head. The figures for New Zealand for that year are:-Population , 1,192,620; trade, £1.08,037,774; note circulation, £7,890,418; or £6 12s. 4d. per head. Tho Canadian figures are:-Population , 8.631,475; trade, £523,649,628; note circulation. £50,959,768; or £5 ISs. Id. per head, as against Australia's £4 0s. 8d. per of hoad. I stress thoso figures on account of complaints that have been made of the inflation of our currency. There may have beeu some inflation but it has not been of a serious nature. As the trado and commerce of a country grows its note issue should expand. That has been the experience of practically all countries. Canada, in 1900, had trade worth £73,129,464, and a note circulation of £9,570,362; in 1910, when her trade had grown to £137,485,538, her note circulaor tion totalled £16,874,390; and in 1920 the respective figures were £523,649,628 and £50,959,768. It is customary in almost overy country to expand the uoto circulation as trade increases, but Australia has not adopted that principle. I should like to know why she has not done so. I think all honourable members agree that we should get back as speedily as possible to the basis of a gold currency. We require security against undue inflation or deflation of currency; provision for its increase to meet expanding trade; elasticity to meet seasonal requirements, aud strict legislative provision to secure ite stability. Will these result from the passing of this bill? It seems impossible for us to consider at present a return to the gold standard. Until Great Britain and a majority of the other leading countries of the world are in a position to return to it we cannot. Gold is at a premium now, and we cannot afford to allow it to go out of Australia until other countries will reciprocate. For some time to come a gold currency will be impossible, and we must consider other means to obtain a stable and an elastio The currency which will ensure safety to the public. The Treasurer would be well advised to take expert advice as to whether it would be desirable for the Governmeut to purchase all the gold produced in Australia. I shall not express an opinion on the matter, but it is well worth considering whether such a policy would assist to relieve the exchange position and tend to develop the country. There is just as much from inflation as from deflation of currency, and we ought to take what steps wo can to prevent undue variation. Are we more likely to get a stable currency by placing the note issue i u the hands of a Government-controlled or semi-politically controlled board than by giving it to people who thoroughly understand financial affairs? I consider that we shall be acting wisely if we adopt a system similar to that of Canada, provided that the Government has sufficient safeguards to meet any emergency that may arise. issue of notes is lef t to the private banks, subject to a suitable measure of official control, the progress of the country will be more satisfactory than it has been. Section 60P of the original act should, in my opinion, be repealed immediately. It gives power to the Government to issue a proclamation by which it may supersede the Note Issue Board and take full control of the note issue. I am sure that the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) will not misunderstand me or think for a moment that I am casting any reflection on hi m wheu I say that there may be Treasurers who, in n time of stress, would take advantage of that provision. If the Note Issuo Board, in such a circumstance, would not issue as many notes as a Treasurer desired, possibly to relieve unemployment, or to assist some of the states to carry out a public works policy, he might cause the Government to issue a proclamation to remove control of the notes from the board and proceed immediately to inflate the currency. The provision which makes that possible should - be repealed without delay, and if a crisis occurred in the affairs of the country Parliament could bo asked for, and, I am sure, would grant, power to meet it . We liave had inflation of currency in the past. When the war started a huge issue of notes was made to provide large sums of money for the states. If lionorable members will refer to last year's budget statements they will find that an issue of £17,000,000 was made to the states. At that time £22^00,000 worth of notes was issued, as a direct result of political influence. That may have caused au inflation of prices. There was then ample scope for the employment of every able bodied man, and there should not have been any necessity to make unemployment doles. That £22,000,000 was loaned danger to the states and to the Commonwealth. If honourable members peruse last year's budget they will find that in the funds of the Commonwealth there is an item of £3,000.000, which is classed as a credit. I admit, of course, that the present Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) was not responsible for that action. Still , it furnishes ample proof of what can be done when political influence is exerted upon those who control the issue of notes. Honourable members are aware of what has hapI f the pened in Germany and Eussia. We do not want to have the experience of those countries. I want to make it impossible for such conditions - to be brought about in Australia. Subsequent to the issue of those notes, great depression was felt in trade. In 1/920 Australia's trade amounted to £248,700,000, while the note circulation was £21,600,000-£8. 2 per cent., or £4.8 per capita. In Canada in that year the trade amounted to £523,000,000. while the notes in circulation totalled £51,000,000, a percentage of 9.34. In New Zealand the trade amounted to £108,000,000, and the note circulation to £7,900,000, a percentage of 7.3. In 1921 Australia's trade increased to £295,000,000, while the notes in circulation showed an advance to £23,924,000. The following figures will show that there has been undue deflation in the note issue, considering the increase in trade: Yoar. Note Issue. Notes In Circulation. £ £ 1020 57,000,000 24,000,000 1921 55,000,000 . 22,000,000 1922 61,000,000 . 22,000,000 1923 .. ' 52,000,000 . 23,000.000 It will thus be seen that whereas in 1920, with a trade totalling £248,000,000, the note issue amounted to £57,000,000, in 1923, with a trade amounting to £249.000,000, the note issue was £5,000,000 less. Let us deal with the matter on another basis. In 1915 the deposits in our bank totalled £169,000,000, white the notes in the hands of the banks amounted ito *29'000,'000, a ratio of 17.9. In 1922 the deposits totalled £249,000,000, but ""She notes .amounted ££4,000,000, a ratio of -'9.9. period the deposits increased £70,'750,-000, while 'the notes decreased by £4,240,000, or 8 per cent. That, to my mind, indicates undue deflation in - the last few years. I make no reflections on the Note Issue (Board. I believe that the members of 'that board consider that they are acting in the best - interests of Australia, and ithat ffhcy are keenly desirous of getting back :to a gold standard. Wc must, however, recognize first the impossibility :of .doing that at once, and, secondly, the ver%y grave thcue is :of am 'imdue deflation. who (have - large accumulations of wai* hands may make a-n uaidue profit if deflation is brought about .by the withckaiwjal iof >noJies freun (cir.aulatian.

Ma . .G.AEB. - rDoe s the honourable member wish .the position to be as it was in 1921?",43
71,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"'No ; but if we had had the same note issue as we had in 1921 the difficulties which confronted us last year probably would not have been encountered. My duty is to see that the interests of the primary prod Heel's are conserved. They have to compete in the markets iof the wonld., and it is necessary to ensure that as far as possible reasonable conditions shall apply when they are marketing - their produce. At present the primary producer has - to ""bear an export duty iof - fro-m .3 to .S per cent, on 'the produce he .sends to markets outside Australia, .because .of the .adverse exchange. This legislation will not affect the matter of exchange. The adverse conditions operating against Australia, I l>eTieve., are largely due to the borrowing that has 'been indulged in . Year after year, we 'have referred to the grave danger of both the States and the Commonwealth ""borrowing such large sums of money. 'ThiB bill - does not-deal 'with exchange; but we can, ""jievertsheless, ttry HLO afford some proto only tection to 'the imiimary .producer, so that In that oversea buyers - who <came to Australia by with good letters of credit cain - go on the market - and purchase our .products. I shall quote instances of traders who have come .here prepaaed - to purchase our products, and have been unable to do so. They have had first class letters of credit, but the rbanks could not finance them because of the shortage of jnot.es. No definite arrangement has yet beau made for a commencement with this year's .wool sales, if believe that those conoerned are waiting for .a .pronouncement - of .the Godanger vernment's intentions regarding finance.

In other A .big words, that bank was willing to give gold as seciu'ity in order ,to finance the buyers. Mr ;.E. RIMH:. -'Where was the gold ? "" Mr (GREGORY - It was offered from Sau Francisco through f h e Bank of New South Wales. Mr E. RLLTSY - Why could the bank not do business if it had the gold ?",45
72,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"*Gol d then was at a premium dn the market.; £ 1 0 0 worth of gold was worth £ 1 1 3 in notes. The issue of this «£20.0.,.000 worth of notes would not have had .an adverse .effect. When they were returned to the board they could have been cancelled. The same experience befell the Erench buyers. I could quote from the press reports stating .that certain wool buyers from Erance desired to do business, but were unable to obtain - the necessary credit. Notes which I have extracted from financial journals show that the last wool sales 1 at Brisbane dropped 10 per cent., because some buyers could not negotiate credit, even ""though 'they had excellent backing from London. TsifcTiot an extraordinary t h in g that when we are endeavouring to market our products we 'are unable to procure ndte3 to negotiate sales, although the credits furnished are - not opera, - to question? The chartered 'banks are prepared to accept credits from 'Great Britain, France, United States of America, New Zealand, and Japan, but they aro prevented from doing so.",45
73,Mr GABB,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,That does not speak well for private enterprise.,46
74,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"This was not the work of private enterprise. The honoring. able member is making a stupid blunder, and just the blunder made by the semiby political 'body at present controlling the note issue.

My the Opposition (Mr 'Charlton). time is - drawing to is tolose, or I would quote what has been said in regard these matters by . Mr Watson, a great baulking authority .of New 'Zealand. We judge cannot .ask for legislation in this country such .as has been .enacted in New Zealand, because the banks there issue their notes. We have the Commonwealth Bank here, and a Commonwealth note issue, and that is a position which we must reand cognize. But we could adopt the Canato dian system. We could issue-notes similar to the 'Canadian Government issue-tha is up to 40 per cent, of the capital of the banks-and leave the whole question of the extent of the issue of additional currency to the banking corporations, subject to the most careful restrictions that could be devised by this Parliament, to secure the elasticity necessary f o purpose of financing the industries of the country. There is not the slightest doubt lies with this {Parliament. that political pressure induced the Notes Commonwealth Baaik was Issue Board to issue £4,200,000 of notes recently, which greatly relieved the posiI tion. I do not think that .it is wise that the Treasury should be given such .a power. T suggest ""that the Government sbould reconsider the whole question. I might, agree to the appointment of a select committee of this House to go into it . The information which the Treasurer receives from his department is different from that which he would get if he asked for evidence, not from bankers alone but from the commercial men of Australia. We should get the ibest brains we can - command to advise what it is best to do for the purpose .of building up the resources of this .c©""untry. I 'am sure that honourable members opposite would be - glad to see the - industries of Australia progressThe question is whether it is better that the note issue should be controlled the Government or iby a semi-political board, or that the practice of other counshowtries should 'be adopted, and the note issue controlled by the banks. We should evidence on that question, .and conThe sider 'whether the best interests .of the countiy would not be served oy a drastic change in the present policy. I hope that legislation wilj be introduced ito rgive effect to such a change.",46
75,Mr WEST,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"East Sydney) [9.5] t is I want to ask honourable members to go back to flie bill , the intention of the 'Government in introducing it , and the by amendment submitted by the Leader of The Government has introduced a measure to to amend the Commonwealth 'Bank Act. Although so far as I have been able to thero is very 'little fault'to'be 'found with the provisions of the existing act, the Government proposes to alter the own management of the barik. This is the l most serious proposal ever submitted in connection - with banking 'in 'this country, it is fraught witih - serious consequences the f u t u r e of the Commonwealth Bank. Those who established - that - bank 'have, so t far, reason to be proud - of their work. That view is held by the people generally. The intention in the minds of those who introduced t/h-e - existing Commonwealth Bank Act was to create -& national bank. If the bank is not now all that the people would desire, and the existing act does mot r the contain all the machinery necessary to make it a Teal national bank, the f a u l t When the established the 'private bank system was dn operation. n the early days private banks may, perhaps, have been in a position - to meet the requirements of the people, but when it was proposed to - establish the Commont wealth Bank, all who took an interest in banking institutions were agreed that the time had arrived for an alteration in our banking system. The alteration was made by the establishment of the 'Commonwealth Bank. The object of the Government and their supporters seems to be to minimize the importance of the Commonwealth Bank and to injur e it i u every possible way. The provisions in this bill for the appointment of a board of management for the bank are really the crux of the measure. If they are proposed with' the object of putting the national bank - into the hands of men whose concern will be, not the interests of the people but their private interests and the interests of their friends, no better means could bo devised for the purpose. The Government proposes a board of management to consist of two persons associated with manufacturing industries or commerce, two associated with agricultural, pastoral, or other primary industries, and two having a knowledge of currency, and declared by the Governor General to be choseu because of that knowledge. What that knowledge is it would puzzle a Philadelphian lawyer to explain. I do not think any person is likely to live on this globe whoi will be able to say what it really means. So far the Treasurer has said nothing to justify confidence in the board which, under this bill, it is proposed shall in future manage the Commonwealth Bank. The exercise of the banking power may make or break a nation. It may reduce men, women, and children to a deplorable condition, and may retard' the progress of any country. This parliament is charged with the conduct of national affairs, and I believe that if we properly look after its financial affairs we may in Australia lay the foundation of a nation whose prosperity will be without parallel since the world began. That is an ambition which can be achieved, but I do not believe for a moment that it will be achieved if we put the national bank into the hands of people who will have no higher ambition than to serve their own private interests. The Leader of the Opposition has submitted an amendment in which he proposes that the management of the Commonwealth Bank shall be placed in the hands of men who understand banking, who will be removed from outside influences, and whose salaries will be paid to them to watch the interests of the bank aud its expansion as a national bank, such as it was intended to be. 1 do not know how any honourable member on the other side can find fault with the amendment. It may be that they are now so ashamed of their conception of what the management e<f the Commonwealth Bank should be that they are Jfr. West. afraid to admit the mistake they have made, and would penalize the people of Australia rather than confess their stupidity.",46
76,Mr GABB,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.""]",47
77,Mr WEST,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"The board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, as proposed by the Government, will be composed of financially interested persons. The appointment of financial experts to the board as proposed in th© amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, however disagreeable it may be to the Government, should bc agreed to by honourable members on both sides. Wiser men than those of the Ministry have acknowledged their mistakes, but unfortunately for Australia this Government, having agreed to a certain course of action, intends to pursue it to the bitter end, no matter what disaster may result to this country. If I were to submit the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition to a meeting of electors in the Sydney Town H all , I am quite satisfied that, excepting a. few outside cranks supporting the Government, the whole audience would be in favour of it . Sydney contains more people who understand the difficult question of finance than does any otlier city in the world. Not one largo institution dealing in commerce, banking, or insurance, not even the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, is managed other than by one man, who, in turn, is dependent upon experts in charge of its operations. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is managed, by Mr Knox, and the experts employed by that company to further its interests are not even allowed to mix with the experts of other commercial houses. The late Sir Thomas Dibbs was manager of the Commercial Banking Company, Sydney, for over 50 years, and if one of the directors of the bank had attempted to interfere with his administration he would have been politely shown out of the front door of the institution. Sir Charles MCKellar, M ' . L . C , oue of the members of the board of directors of the Bank of New South Wale3, would not interfere with the management of that institution. On one occasion I questioned him concerning the raising of money in Great Britain , and he told me to interview the manager, since he bad nothing whatever to do with the operations of the bank. Sir Alfred Meeks went to England to establish a branch of the Australian Mutual Provident Society in Threadneedle-street, London. As a member of the board of directors he refrained from interfering with the operations of the society. The late Sir Denison Miller, when in control of the Commonwealth Bank, was very fortunate to have the support of an excellent staff to instruct him in the management of the bank. Treasurer himself is dependent upon the staff of the Treasury, who frame his speeches and compile the tables of figures that aro from time to time placed before this House. The members of the Ministry are incompetent - to administer the affairs of this country. Their actions are hampered by outside influence, and Australia is consequently in a sorry position. However, I am confident that a change of government will soon take place. Queensland National Bank, at one time, was in straitened circumstances, but recovered, owing to the determined efforts of the manager, Mr Ralston. One gentleman, who was a director of the Bank of New South Wales, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Australian Mutua l Provident Society, Burns, Philp aud Company, the Sydney and Suburban H y draulic Power Company Limited , and other companies, while on a visit to England for twelve months, was also a senator of the Commonwealth of Australia. One can imagine the control he must have exercised in the management of those institutions. Let me explain why directors of companies are called guinea pigs. If a person wished to float a company for the manufacture of patent pills, in reality made of rubbish, he would obtain the consent of well-known men to be appointed to the board of directors, at a fee of, say, £2 2s. per sitting. In the aggregate they woulcl receive £400 or £500 per annum in return for the privilege of publishing their n nm.es as directors of the concern. That was the usual practice resorted to when floating gold mines and other ventures. Sir Charles MCKellar is a director of the Bank of New South Wide.?, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the Australian Mutual Provident Society. Persons appointed to a board of directors, although ornaments, are very useful individuals to their friends. I am not making this accusation against the persons whose mimes I have mentioned. Sir Thomas Hughes wa3 interested in a brewery, an hotel, an insurance company, a newspaper, and two banks. It is proposed that sucli persons as I liave mentioned should be appointed to the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) stated last Friday that he knew all about the banking business owing to information received by him from a director of a Tho certain bank. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) said practically the same thing, and no doubt he supports the Government in its action, because he will be able to interview members of the board in order to further the interests of his friends. We should permit nothing of this sort to occur. The men controlling the operations of the Commonwealth Bank should be in the same The position as is the Secretary to the Treasury. He is a Crown servant, with the interests of the Crown at heart. How can any man serve the interests of both the bank and a private institution ? If a man is the chairman of directors of an insurance company, drawing, say, £4,000 a year, he will serve the interests of that company rather than those of the bank. Jt is only reasonable to expect that. My object is to prevent men from being placed in a position where they will have the opportunity to serve their own interests. Men with banking experience should have charge of the bank's operations. There will be plenty of work for them to do. Wo are all interested in the success of the bank, because we are all shareholders in it . I want to see the bank so managed that every shareholder will reap some benefit from its operations. Credit is essential to commerce. Because of that, the system of payment by cheque was inaugurated. Prior to the introduction of that system, silver was taken from London to 'pay for goods purchased in the East. Large firms, such as Anthony Hordern's, or Farmer's, in Sydney, or similar big establishments in Melbourne, do not invite outsiders to their board meetings. And in the conduct of the Commonwealth Bank we should not permit merchants and others to become acquainted with the details of its operations. Every one of these persons, if possessed of any ability at all, would be able to make a fortune in three years. Do honourable members think that they would attend the board meetings, and acquire information, and yet not take of it ins their own interests ?

If there were but Mr West. one bank, there would not be necessity for the heavy expenditure now incurred, the advantage people would be able to conduct their banking business to greater advantage, while better use could be made of their money, and we would not have to borrow in London. Since 1913, no Canadian loan has been floated abroad. During the appointing war Canada raised £400,000,000 with in her own territory, and lent £230,000,000 to the British Government. The interest on that £250,000,000 will pay the interest on her war debt. Australia had the same opportunity, but failed to avail herself of it. One-third of Great Britain's war expenditure was met out of revenue, but not impor- one penny of Australia's war expenditure was met in that way. It all' came from loan.

81,Mr WEST,IMPORTATION S FOR NAV Y,"I have endeavoured to keep within the scope of the bill, and I I have not discussed the pros and cons of the economic position and its relation to Hotel ,! our banking system. The Government proposal's will not meet witli the approwere bation of the people. Amongst other communications on this question I have rethat ceived a letterfrom agentlemanprominently associated withshipping and finance. Referring to the constitution of the proposed board, he says it must be apparent that if men engaged in competitive pursuits are appointed, the knowledge they gain of their competitors' affairs must necessarily give them an unfair advantage in the conduct of their own businesses. For that reason, he submits that the Government proposal for the constitution of the board should be abandoned. I am quite sure that the people would prefer to do business with our national bank if they were assured that it was controlled by men who understood banking, and who were exclusively engaged in the service of the bank. A good deal has been said during the debate upon the note issue. I well remember how honourable members representing the interests of the parties now supporting the Government ridiculed the proposals of the Fisher Government, suggesting that the output of notes would be almost as mechanical as the production of sausages, and with what dismay they viewed the prospect of a Labour government ever having control of the note issue. By no stretch of the imagination could the proposals then made by the Fisher Government be compared with the intention of the present Government with regard to the note issue. I am not wedded to the idea of the control of the note issue by a board. The Government has not attempted to deal with the question of exchange in a satisfactory manner. In the course of an address delivered recently, the honourable member for Martin  Minister for Trade and Customs, advocated the cessation of borrowing abroad in order to improve the nnancial position of the Commonwealth. Subsequently in conversation I told him that there would be no alteration in our nnancial policy until wo had a change of government. At that time this bill had not been brought forward, and in view of its many defects, 1 say now that the Government must take full responsibility for the measure, which, I feel confident, will not do what is expected of it . The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) had a good deal to say about the banking arrangements in other countries. He quoted the systems adopted in Great Britain, Canada, Africa, and many other countries. Is he net aware that the Labour party was the first party to advocate the establishment of a national bank? We do not want to follow any other country in this matter. - [72] We ourselves created a precedent in this matter many years ago, and we should now go further in the' development of our national bank. The reserve bank in the United States of America is a valuable institution, differing in many respects from our own system, which merely relieves private banking institutions of the necessity to keep in reserve large holdings of liquid assets. A great deal more could be done in the way of developing our primary and secondary industries by the application of common sense methods to the operations of our national bank, and could be done without in any w a y creating a panic. B y intelligent handling of our national debt OUT liabilities could be reduced. Thus our friends in the corner, representing country interests, would be assisted in all the ramifications of their business as primary producers, and at the same time we could extend valuable aid to our secondary industries. In Gormany, prior to the war, trading or manufacturing concerns whose credit was temporarily lowered, were able to obtain financial help from the Government, on the basis of goods sold on bills of exchange. Under our present system of banking it is not possible to render the same assistance in Australia, but I trust that some action will be taken to improve the position. The appointment of a board of manage ment will not necessarily safeguard the interests of the people. Many years ago, the directors of a Glasgow bank were gaoled for having substituted lead washers for bullion in their strong-room. A great deal of misery was caused through the failure of - that bank. We have had the same evidence of imprudence in banking methods in Australia. I remember in 1903 travelling, with a man interested in finance, through Grafton, the district now represented in this House by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). My companion, who was charged with the duty of inquiring into the banking position there, found that his bank had advanced as much as £42,000 on certain properties which actually were not then worth £42. The amendment submitted by my leader (Mr Charlton) should remove that danger, because the directors would be required to devote the whole of their time to the business of the bank, and, therefore, to the interests of the country. The Government proposal will not bear There is nothing in history to justify the Government's proposal. I know that the Government is haunted by the thought that this bank was established by the Labour party, and it is anxious to take from us the credit that is due to us on that account; but nil the ingenuity of honourable members opposite will not blind the people to the fact that the Labour party created the bank, and that if it had been enlarged as we intended, it would be lo-day a bank of reserve, and a still greater credit to Australia. function for the general the Commonwealth, and the exchange difficulties could be tackled in a way that is not possible under present conditions. If the Commonwealth were given charge of exchange in London the people of the Old Country would' applaud us for conducting business in such . a sensible way. criticisms have no destructive aim; they are intended to be helpful and constructive., and if honorablo members opposite will place the welfare of the nation first, they will realise that this bill is fraught with a great deal of danger. would give greater pleasure Leader of the Opposition supporters than that they have the opportunity to give to the bank a truly national character so that it would bu better able to ensure better control of the finances of the Commonwealth. We are opposed to placing the management of the bauk in the hands of private persons, for history warns us against what may be expected from such a policy. The House is called upon to make a most important in regard to this bill, for upon the future operations of the Commonwealth depends the relief of the position which Australia has been placed by the mismanagement of those who held the reins of government during the war. No other country in the world has greater productive capacities and possibilities of prosperity than has Australia. it needs is that its finances be placed upon a sound basis, and if the Government will not adopt the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition, God help the country! The creation of a bank of reserve and othor extensions are minor compared with the necessity for placing Mr West. the control of the bank in the hands of investigation. independent men who w i ll realise and promote its national aim. I have appealed to honourable members to realise the seriousness of the position, and if I have failed to impress them, I have at least the satisfaction of knowing thet I have done my duty. If they neglect their responsibility the people will eventually punish them, but in the meantime serious damage may be done. Over £405,000,000 of money is earning nothing. At the same time some of the states are appealing to this Parliament lt would for financial assistance; yet no attempt is benefit of being made by the Government to enable the bank to become the national institution which the Labour party has always intended it to be. We never contemBank plated that any Governinent would atoperations tempt to emasculate the bank in the cruel fashion that this bil l proposes.
