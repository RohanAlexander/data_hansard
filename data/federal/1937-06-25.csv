""MCLACHLAN.",10
8,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"Can the Acting Prime Minister now reply to the question that I asked yesterday concerning arrangements for broadcast talks by Senator A. J. MCLachlan on the tobacco industry and the fisheries industry? I desire the right honourable gentleman to inform me as to whether these talks are in exposition of government policy, and if they are, wliether they do not at once involve political controversy, and in any event are a distinct advertisement for the Minister, who is to he a candidate for re-election to the Senate in the hear future? Would it not be better to have these talks given by experts who are connected with the industries concerned?",10
9,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I have not yet had an opportunity to ascertain exactly what the position is in regard to the addresses which the Minister in charge of Development proposes to give on these particular niatters, hut I assure the honourable gentleman that Senator A. J. McLachlan would deal essentially with matters that are of general interest and are absolutely of a non-party political nature.",10
10,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"In view of the arrangements that have been made for Senator A. J. MCLachlan to broadcast addresses over the national network, will the Acting-Prime Minister recommend to the Australian Broadcasting Commission that I be allowed to give addresses over the national network on the cotton industry and the sugar industry ?",11
11,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I have not the slightest intention of making that suggestion. The matters to be dealt with by the Postmaster-General, if he speaks, will be similar in every respect to other statements that have been made by different members of the Government during the period that wireless broadcasting has been in existence.",11
12,Mr FORDE,Unknown,That is absolute nonsense. There will have to be a straightening out of this broadcasting business. These addresses are merely political propaganda. Later:,11
13,Mr FORDE,Unknown,I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he will undertake to make representations to the Australian Broadcasting Commission to the effect that a member of the Federal Labour Opposition should be given the opportunity to broadcast over the national work every time a Minister of the Crown makes such a broadcast?,11
14,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I would no more give an undertaking of that kind than 1 would ask members of the Opposition to associate themselves with the work of the departments of State. When the people of Australia desire the Opposition to take over the government of this country they will say so. When the government with which the honourable memher was connected was in office, no objection was taken by members of the Opposition to Ministers of the Crown making such similar speeches as they desired over the national network dealing with uncontroversial matters. The real attitude of the members of the Opposition on this subject was shown yesterday when the proposed broadcasts on the subject of youth employment was being discussed. Mr Foiinis - If the commission will not do the fair thing, it mustTbe changed. PROHIBITI ON OF IMPORTS.",11
15,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"Following upon the inauguration of the trade diversion policy of the Government, under which prohibitions were enforced against certain imports, a number of new industries sprang up in Australia and expansion took place in other industries to meet the extra business that was offering locally. The raising of additional capital and the incurring of additional expenditure were involved in the establishment of new plants. In some quarters there is a feeling of anxiety.",11
16,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member is giving a lotof information and not asking a question.,11
17,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Trade and Customs allay the anxiety which exists as the result of press references to a possible modification of government policy ? Mr WHITE!-The policy of the Government has always been to give adequate protection to Australian industries. This is shown by the figures relating to factory employment. In the event of any change of policy which involved the replacing of the licensing system by a trade agreement with the United States of America, as the former Minister - directing negotiations for net- trade treaties (Sir Henry Gullett) has indicated and as has been suggested in this House by other honourable members, the industries referred to would not be left uncovered hut would receive adequate protection.

The honourable member's representations in connection with Jervis Bay will be borne .in mind. Mr E. J. HARRISON:-Has the Acting Minister for Defence seen the report that appears in the press this morning, that the opnosition to the cstaiblishment of the base at Rose Bay has heen renewed more strongly than ever by the Government of New South Wales? Has he seen the further report that if the Federal Government insists on making Rose Bay the base, the Government of that State may refuse to allow the resumption of portion of Lyne Park ancl the roadway at the waterfront? If this action, is taken by the State authorities, will the Minister consider the establishment of the base at Botany Bay which, according to one of. the world's leading authorities, Captain P. G. Taylor, possesses facilities that are equal in every way to those of Rose Bay?",12
22,Mr THORBY,YAMPI SOUND IRON ORE,"The whole of the wealth statements to which the honourable memwill ber has referred are nothing but propaganda, Which is being put foraction ? ward by those who are opposed to the establishment of the base at Rose Bay.

37,Mr WHITE,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"They are still proceeding. AERO CLUB EQUIPMENT. M i . THORBY (Calare-Actin g Minister for Defence) - by leave-Various governments have, since the inception of the aero club movement in Australia, lent numlbers of "" Moth "" aircraft, Cirrus and Gipsy engines and quantities of allied technical stores to aero clubs in all States. Much of this equipment was made available from Royal. Australian Air Force stocks after it had become surplus to Service requirements, or it was of a type not in general use by that Service. Practically all of the loans were made from seven to ten years ago, so that the equipment is now well-worn, and of little, use for training purposes. The need for modernizing the equipment of the clubs is fully recognized, it being firmly believed that the high maintenance costs of the out-of-date aircraft now used are, to a great extent responsible not only for the unsatisfactory financial position of certain of the clubs, but UNION . also for the relatively high cost of training and practice flying by pupils and pilots. (To assist the clubs in the purchase of more modern aircraft, the Government has - approved of the departmental aircraft, engines, &c, at present on loan being handed over to them as gifts, though subject to the conditions that all sales and conversions of such equipment must first have departmental approval, and that proceeds from sales must be applied exclusively to the purchase of new equipment. In extending this concession to aero clubs, the Government feels that the new equipment they purchase will lessen flying risks, attract new pupils and give trainees and qualified pilots valuable experience on modern kinds of aircraftall very desiralble objects. DAY OF SITTING.",13
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"Cowper-Actin g of Prime Minister) [10.52] - I move That the House at its rising adjourn until Monday next at 3 p.m. It is proposed to meet on Monday next because we wish to finish with the Supply Bill in time to enable it to be passed by the Senate before the 30th June, the end of the financial year. Honourable members will recall that we have, during this session, been trying to confine the sittings' Parliament? of Parliament within reasonable hours, and it is considered that, in the interests of everybody's health^ it will be better "".o meet on Monday so that late sittings may be avoided.",13
39,Mr HOLLOWAY,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"Melbourne Ports) [10.53] - I hope that the Government will reconsider this proposal. Many honourable members have already made appointments in their constituencies for Monday next. I expected that Parliament might finish its work this week, but if that is not possible I object to the House being called together on Monday next in order to do two days' work, because it will be necessary for us to travel on Sunday. If Parliament is to sit on only two days next week, why is it necessary to meet on Monday? Of course, if there is enough work to occupy us for the whole week, I should be pleased io make such arrangements as would enable me to attend on Monday, but otherwise I object to the proposal. ^ Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [10.55] The Government cannot get away with this proposal. The Acting Prime Minister (Dr Earle Page) knows quite well that the Government can carry on for a fortnight or three weeks after the 30th June without getting Supply. This proposal has been made merely so that the session can be closed as quickly as possible, enabling Ministers to run away where we cannot find them. They are making Parliament a laughing stock amongst the people.",14
40,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"Where was the honourable member last week, anyway?",14
41,Mr LAZZARINI,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"I did not come here last week because I had no wish participate in the flummery and humbug that took place during those two days. I do not object to Parliament meeting on Monday because it means another days work-so far as I am concerned can meet from Monday to Saturday there is anything to do-bu t when certain days of sitting have been stipulated, honourable members make engagements in their constituencies so as to fit in with those days.",14
42,Mr GREGORY,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,Why not stay in Canberra and attend to the business of,14
43,Mr LAZZARINI,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"I have important business to attend to in my electorate and besides, the elections are coming oh. In no circumstances do I want to break the engagements I have made, and if I have to leave for Canberra on Monday morning I cannot keep them. If Parliament meets on Monday it will close down on Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest, and probably the Government will apply the gag before the schedule to the Supply Bill is put through. The Government should take its job more seriously, and afford honourable members reasonable time to discuss the measures brought before Parliament. I object to Parliament being closed so early next week, and I object to its meeting on Monday. If it is necessary to alter the days of sitting in this way, at least two weeks notice should be given. Let me point out that Labour members have work to do in thei'r electorates. They keep in close touch with their constituents in their endeavour to relieve distress, and they are associated with voluntary organizations engaged in the same work. Of course, honourable members opposite never engage in that kind of work, and the only interest they have in their electorates is when they are invited to attend some guzzling party. During the long recess, a great many matters accumulated to which honourable members desire to refer in Parliament, and now the Government proposes to close the session after a few days. Mi-'. BRENNAN (Batman)-[10.58.] . - The sitting days of Parliament have always been a subject of controversy and some heartburning. That, I think, is inevitable from the fact that Parliament to is made up of members who have to come from immense distances, as well as those who represent constituencies less far removed. It is unfortunate that there is so little system, and so much change, in it appointing the days for sitting. The if honourable memher for Swan (Mr. Gregory) rather unkindly asked why we do not remain in Canberra all the time, and do the business of Parliament. However, the honourable member represents a Western Australian electorate, and when he comes to Canberra, it is impossible, from the nature of things, for him to preserve contact with his electorate. The people who sent him here recognize that fact, and do not expect him to visit the electorate while the House is sitting. Neither do the electors expect those who represent Queensland constituencies to visit them while Parliament is in session. This is a great continent, and we are all subject to a good deal of ill informed criticism from the press and the electorate itself regarding our attitude towards our duties. It is frequently said that we come here in a hurry ana leave in a hurry to get back to our electorates. I submit that that is the most natural thing in the world-our electorates are not here, they are elsewhere and the people who send us here expect to preserve contact with us. We have to return to our electorates at every and the earliest opportunity to give an account of our stewardship and to keep appointments we make in our electorates in fulfilment of the duties we have to perform. I suggest, therefore, that of all the days which are generally inconvenient for honourable members to sit, Monday is the least convenient. It is true, as the honourable members for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) and Werriwa (Mr - Lazzarini) have said, that we endeavour to make appointments in our electorates in anticipation that at least Monday will be free. That does not apply to those who come from great distances, but that is my position. I usually return to my electorate every week-end and make appointments in anticipation that I will not he required here on the first clay of any week. The Acting Prime Minister (Dr Earle Page) did intimate that he might have to call the House together on Monday, but he certainly did not give us notice of that as a final decision. In the meantime, it has heen suggested that we might have continued sitting and finished this week the work still to be done. I join generally with those who think and argue with some feeling that the meetings of Parliament are altogether too short and sporadic, and that there is Mr lirennan. an entire want of system in regard to its sittings. That ought to be considered by this Government or any future one that may sit upon the Treasury bench. It is most inconvenient for me personally to come here on Monday, and I sympathise with men like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and members representing Sydney electorates who have made definite engagements and will have to break them, making explanations which are sometimes accepted and sometimes not. I certainly think that a more systematic plan should be followed in regard to the sittings of Parliament. This Parliament should sit on specified days of the week over a lengthy period of the year to enable honourable members to order their business and to discharge the business they have here as members of a deliberative assembly. More and more the tendency is to make the government of the country government by the Executive; the deliberative character of the Parliament is being lost more and more. I think every honourable member, especially private members on both sides of the House, should jealously guard the rights of the rank ancl file of members who are equally responsible to the electorate with Ministers of the Crown. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to reconsider the proposal to sit next Monday or any Monday unless there are most extraordinary circumstances which do not seem to prevail on this occasion, because there is no programme of business for next week except, as far as I understand, work which will involve two, or at the most three, days of the week. Why one of those days should be Monday, I cannot understand.",14
44,Mr LANE,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,Barton) [11.4] - I am opposed to the proposal that the House should meet on Monday next.,15
45,Mr GANDER,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,Then vote against it.,15
46,Mr LANE,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"I think I shall, but there may be no necessity to do so; I am sure that the good sense of the Acting Prime Minister (Dr Earle Page) will prevail upon him to alter his mind. I have been a member of this Parliament for five'years and during the whole of that period, with one exception, this is the only occasion on which we have heen asked to sit on a Monday. Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament, Monday and Saturdays have heen reserved as two certain days on which honourable members could make arrangements to interview the electors. In my own case, I have to travel eight miles out of the city of Sydney to my electorate. I enter my protest against the proposal - to sit next Monday because I have an important engagement to appear before one of the pensions tribunals in connection with a ease which the members of the tribunal, to meet my convenience, kindly postponed from Wednesday last until next Monday. Unlike members of the Opposition we on this side have to do our work in a systematic way. Honourable members opposite tramp their electors into the Commonwealth offices, the corridors of which are frequently bailed up with undesirable people.",15
47,Mr SPEAKER,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,Order ! OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Withdraw .,16
48,Mr WARD,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,The honourable member for Barton (Mir. Lane) referred to the people from East Sydney as being undesirable.,16
49,Mr LANE,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,The honourable member is one of them.,16
50,Mr SPEAKER,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"Order ! The honourable member for Barton is now certainly out of order,",16
51,Mr WARD,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,I consider the remarks of the honourable member for Barton personally offensive to me as a representative of those people and I ask for a withdrawal and an apology.,16
52,Mr SPEAKER,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,The Chair can not demand a withdrawal and an apology for a reflection upon electors. I called the honourable member for Barton to order for his reference to any body of people in the terms which he used. Such comments are undesirable and should not be made in a debate of this kind. (,16
53,Mr WARD,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,I ask for a withdrawal and an apology of the reference made to myself as the representative of East Sydney.,16
54,Mr LANE,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,Havin g said it I withdraw it.,16
55,Mr SPEAKER,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw without reservation.,16
56,Mr LANE,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"I withdraw. I regret that the honourable member for East Sydney took exception to my remarks so quickly. What I wanted to explain waa that in the corridors at. the Commonwealth Offices in Sydney there are clients from the electorates of honourable members opposite blocking the way of honourable members entering their rooms, in consequence of which many of us"" have to make appointments with our electors, many of whom are old people, in our own electorates in order that we may be able to conduct our business with them without hindrance. I trust that the Acting Prime Minister will be persuaded not to ask honourable members to assemble here on Monday next; if necessary, the Parliament could meet during the ' following week, if there is insufficient time without meeting . next Monday to complete the business still to be dealt with.",16
57,Mr BEASLEY,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"West'Sydney) [11.9]. - My objections to the motion will be brief. I do not want to cover the ground which has already been covered or to approach this question from a personal viewpoint; 1 prefer rather to consider it on the ground of ethics. It has been the recognized practice of those who happen to lead the Government at least to warn the Opposition in sufficient time of any proposed alterations of the sitting days to enable honourable members to make their appointments in accordance with the time available. It has already heen stated that if we look over the records of the Parliament we shall discover that on very few occasions has the Commonwealth Parliament heen called together on a Monday; frequently the sittings are resumed on Wednesdays and on many occasions on Tuesdays, ancl honourable members have been accustomed to the making of their arrangements in order to attend a meeting of the Parliament on a Tuesday. It appears to me that the Acting Prime Minister (Dr Earle Page) is entirely meeting his own convenience in regard to this matter; apparently he has appointments in his electorate during the latter part of next. week, and is therefore bringing down this proposal to alter the sitting days even, so it would seem, without any consultation with his own supporters. I think it is unfair and is a definite violation of the ethics usually observed by those who have the privilege of leading the Government. That is my view in regard to it and the Acting Prime Minister ought to be-if I am permitted to use the words-decen t enough to give us an opportunity to make arrangements to carry out our work in our electorates and in the Parliament as well.",16
58,Dr EARLE PAGE,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"Cowper-Actin g Prime Minister) [11.12],-in reply-In reply to the honourable memher for ""West Sydney (Mr Beasley), before this Parliament met, I intimated to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) the possibility that it would become necessary to ask honourable members to sit on Monday next. I also discussed the matter with the Leader of the United Australia party, who assured me that he had raised the matter in his own party room and that his followers generally were favourable to this course. I ' mentioned the matter to the members of my own party at the earliest possible' opportunity and said it was anticipated that this course might be necessary. The reason why the Parliament is being assembled on Monday next is hecause the payments to the Public Service must be met on the 2nd July. In addition the financial year 1937-38 is the only financial year during the next eleven years in which there will be 27 fortnightly payments to pensioners. A payment will be made on the first day and on the last day of that year. In ordinary years there are only 26 payments. It is absolutely necessary that the Supply Bill should be passed through this chamber and through another place before the 1st July; and the only alternative to meeting on Monday next would he to sit very long hours at night. As a medical man, I am totally opposed to late sittings, and in that I feel sure that I have the general approval of honourable members.

As this is the middle of the cropping season in - certain districts, I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the Government proposes to renew the subsidy? Unless this is done an anomalous position will arise, as farmers who complete their seeding before the end of the month will receive the subsidy whilst those on adjacent properties, who do not, will not qualify.",18
66,Dr EARLE PAGE,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"In a vast country like Australia, it is very difficult to fix a member time within which all seeding operations will fall. It may even be found impossible be done. to determine a date which will not exclude some seeding operations.",18
67,Mr MCEWEN,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,I have often pointed out that the end of the calendar year would be an appropriate time to fix.,18
68,Dr EARLE PAGE,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"That would not be too good for districts on the north coast, for it would be just as difficult there as is the end of the financial year in districts further south. The Government recognizes the importance - of continuity of policy on this subject, and will give consideration to the honourable member's question.",18
69,Mr LANE,FRIENDS OF THE SOVIET,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, in view of the 'high prices prevailing for wool, wheat and butter, the Government will undertake to give the House an opportunity to discuss any proposal for the renewal of the fertilizers subsidy before action is taken in that direction? At any rate, an opportunity should be given to the party to discuss it.",18

75,Dr EARLE PAGE,AGGREGATE BOUNTY,If the honourable will furnish me with the exact details that he desires I shall see what can RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT .,18
76,Mr JAMES,AGGREGATE BOUNTY,"Since all the inquiries regarding unemployment have disclosed that the percentage of unemployment of both youths and adults is greater in the coal-fields districts of New South Wales than in any other part of Australia, will the Attorney-General give special conpage sideration, i u the allocation of the special Commonwealth grant of £200,000, claims of the unemployed in those areas?",18

79,Mr MENZIES,AGGREGATE BOUNTY,"I take it that the honourable gentleman is referring to the .special grant made in regard to youth employment. If that is so, the present position is that proposals are invited from the State governments, and those will he considered by the Commonwealth Government. STANDING ORDERS COMMITTEE .",19

81,Mr MAHONEY,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Denison) [11.34] It gives mc much pleasure to support the amendment submitted hy the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), drawing attention to the necessity for increasing the invalid and old-age pension and inaugurating a 40-hour week and a national housing scheme. The Attorney General (Mr Menzies) declared that the pensioners were better off today with 19s. a week than when they were receiving £1 PAPER. a week. No doubt the Commonwealth Statistician believes that the figures on which he bases the cost of living arc - accurate-, but I consider that the workers have been robbed of thousands of pounds owing to the method adopted in adjusting the basic wage. It is true that the 1937. members of certain organizations of (on employees have been awarded increases of their wages, but it is also true that the prices of bread, meat, mil k and wood have considerably increased. Members of the Lyons Government do not live in the same environment-as the invalid and old-age pensioners. I am sure that they for would not care to exist on 19s. a week. for Commonwealth public servants in receipt of from £1,000 to £2,000 a year were not entitled to have their salaries full y timo restored while the pensioners were compelled to live on 19s. a week. I am quite prepared to forgo my salary restoration until fair treatment has been given to the pensioners. I support the honourable member for ""Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) in the request that the pension should begin from the date of the application. The department has held requests in abeyance for months, and in that way has saved thousands of pounds at the expense of the aged and indigent. Yesterday we heard the ""swan song"" of the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) but he failed to tell us why he withdrew from the Cabinet. He should have rendered a verse from the old song which runs-""B e a little forgiving and take me back in your arms."" We should have been interested to know something about the difference of opinion among members of the Ministry regarding the negotiations for trade treaties, of which the honourable gentleman was in charge for a considerable period. The honourable member challenged the Opposition to disclose its financial policy, on which issue, he said, his party won the last election. I am reminded of the tactics adopted on that occasion by the party now in power. I well recollect seeing an election placard depicting the leaders of Lahour as burglars who were "" pinching"" the savings of the people. It is hard to imagine that auy political party would stoop to such a contemptible action. The honourable member for Henty sliould give members on this side credit for honesty and a sense boasts were an of decency in public life. If I ever accuse the honourable member of stealing the savings of the people, I shall being to retire from the political arena. No members of .the Labour party would stoop so low as to interfere with the peoples' savings. What I have I hold. I will not allow anybody to take from me that which 1. possess. My savings are just as sacred to me as those of the honourable member for Henty are to him. The honourable gentleman also asked "" Where is your Empire policy ? "". The Labour party has done its duty in showing its allegiance to the Empire and to t.he British monarchy by sending its representatives abroad to the Coronation ceremonies. Tasmania is proud to have had, as its representative in England, such a man as Mr Ogilvie, the Premier of that State. Apparently the Governincut intends to appeal to the people at the next election on the issue of patriotism, which has been well described as the last refuge of a scoundrel. The honourable member for Henty said that industry could not afford to grant a 40-hour week. The Attorney-General admitted that he knew nothing about the mechanization of industry. He, of course, is employed in a professional capacity at a high salary in discovering gaps in the legislation of the country. At a recent inquiry, Professor Reddaway, of the Melbourne University, advocated an increase of the wages of the workers, owing to the enormous profits being made in industry. He even said that child endowment should be provided for out of these enormous profits. They are largely due, of course, to the armament3 race. The warning issued by Professor Reddaway shows that the workers' standards of living have not increased in accordance with the increased profits of ' industry. Before the economic problems of Australia can be solved, we must reduce the hours of labour and abolish the working of overtime. Such reforms would absorb many workers into industry. I regret the circumstances that have compelled the Governments of the several States to increase the cost of social service to taxpayers. If the state of prosperity about which this Commonwealth Government so frequently actual fact. I fail to understand why the cost of social services to the poor have willbeen increased by every State government. The contention of honourable members opposite that the Commonwealth has not the constitutional power to legislate in respect of a shorter working week is specious and inaccurate, and the Attorney-General, as the result of his speech the other day on this matter, has definitely closed the door on the industrial workers_who believe that the Commonwealth Parliament is empowered to introduce such legislation. The Attorney General, I regret, has adopted an inferiority complex that, the Commonwealth cannot at any time introduce this necessary legislation, but the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn), on a previous occasion, expressed the contrary opinion. Both honourable members rank high in the legal profession, but on this matter their views are at variance. Eor my own part, I am prepared to .accept the opinion of the honourable member for Bourke.",19
82,Mr CLAKK,MEDICAL RESEARCH,The Attorney-General is not so very good.,21
83,Mr MAHONEY,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"That is so. The right honourable gentleman lost the dried fruits appeal case when it was taken before the Privy Council, and the advice which he tendered to the Victorian ""Government was not only rejected by the highest court in the British Commonwealth of Nations hut also was most - costly to that State. To-day, I and other honourable members of the Opposition are prepared to accept the opinions of legal men whom we can trust to give an honest and candid opinion on this matter. If the Commonwealth Government persists in the attitude that it does not possess the power to grant to industrialists a 40-hour working week, the only course left for the workers to adopt is to use vvhat is known as "" direct action."" In my opinion a Labour government will be returned to the Treasury bench of this Parliament at the next election and it will prove to the Attorney-General that it is able to legislate for the introduction of a shorter working week. It will furthermore demonstrate to the sceptics that Australia will not suffer, as the result of the reduction of the hours of labor, in competition with other nations of the world, because Australians who have had a long trudge in the industrial struggle, will show that they have risen to the highest point of industrial progress in the world. On that basis, we can plan for the future and the standard of living for the workers will be raised to a higher plane than has ever before been achieved. According to data submitted to the International Lahour Office in Geneva, thp introduction of the 40-hour working week in industry and the abolition of the working of overtime would mean the permanent reduction of unemployment throughout the world hy 33$ per cent. I have no doubt that the "" big guns"" that have fired from the Government benches during this debate realized the hopefulness of the prospects of the Labour party of winning the forthcoming Eederal elections. Although we have heen reminded of the failures that Ave have made in years gone by, the Labour party today is an improved organization and Labour governments which hold office in three of - the States stand high in the estimation of the people. The Attorney-General made extensive reference to the improvement of building activities throughout the Commonwealth, but I know full well that the revival of prosperity and conditions in the building trade in Tasmania is due to the efforts of the government led by Mr Ogilvie and the manner in which that honourable gentleman is handling the affairs of state. '",21
84,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Sto p laughing!,21
85,Mr MAHONEY,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Of course, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. White), will claim that the credit for this improvement is due to the assistance granted to' Tasmania through the generosity of the Commonwealth Government. I do not desire that such an opinion should go unchallenged and I shall therefore briefly analyse it. Special grants are given to the smaller States for the purpose of compensating them for the disabilities and losses which are due to Federation-that is, to circumstances over which they have no control, but over which the Commonwealth itself does have control. In addition, sums of money ,are paid to the States from loan sources, but.loan money is not a gift and the Minister should not run away with the idea that in accepting it the States have no obligations to fulfil. For instance, interest must be paid on the loan and a sinking fund must he established in order to liquidate the liability in the future. Up to date, Tasmania has heen able to discharge its obligations in this respect. I am gratified that the confidence displayed in Tasmania and its Labour Government is so high that private enterprise, such as insurance companies and banks, are carrying out extensive building programmes in Hobart. I accept that expression of confidence as an indication that the people of Australia are prepared at the next elections to trust the Federal Laibour party to occupy the Treasury bench. I hope that the Loan Council will grant adequate financial assistance to Tasmania in order to enable the State to proceed with a housing programme, because I understand that a portion of the money raised in connection with the recent loan will be allotted for the purpose of housing schemes throughout Australia. Housing conditions under which the workers live are shocking, and private enterprise has failed to fulfil its obligations to the people who rent homes. The slum dwellings of Hobart, which are owned hy private enterprise, are as bad as any that may be found throughout the world. I had a conversation the o.ther day with a doctor, who said to me, "" Mr Mahoney, I have just left a place where a man, wife and three children are living in two rooms"". I ask honourable members how canwe expect to rear a strong, virile race to hold this country of Australia for Australia if we allow mothers to raise their children under such conditions? Honourable members opposite will contend that the matter of housing is a State responsibility; but State governments are unable to proceed with housing schemes because the Loan Council has curtailed their works programmes, thus depriving them of the finances necessary to proceed with the proper accommodation of the working class. The responsibility therefore rests upon the shoulders of the Federal Government but the present Government has failed to carry out the promise given by the Prime Minister before the last elections that the Commonwealth would co-operate with the States in the extension of the building programme. Only one section of the people, the workers, is not in a position to occupy decent homes, because it is not possible for a man on the basic wage to obtain a home of his own. The Prime Minister, who knows so well what it means to have a large family, will appreciate the difficulties which workers experience in raising children on small incomes and in poor surroundings; hut the majority of Ministers of this composite Government and their supporters live in the luxurious surroundings of Potts Point, Toorak ancl St. Kilda, where large families are practically unknown. I have seen the women folk of this section riding in luxurious cars to and from the citie3 not with children, but with poodle dogs sitting beside them. It is the boys of the working class, whose mothers today are rearing them in conditions of penury, and not the poodle dogs who will he called upon to defend our great country in the future. For this reason the working class should have the sympathy of the Commonwealth Government*. When I read that the Minister for Health (Mr Hughes) has delivered a lecture on the subject of the suffering of the poor,. I am disgusted, because I realise that, at the same time, the Government of which he is a member is reducing taxation on wealthy interests while neglecting to carry out its obligations to the mothers of this country. I fail to see why the Commonwealth Government has not introduced child endowment and widows ' and orphans' pensions, because this section of the community is entitled to receive such assistance. On many occasions in the past the Minister for Health has lamented the declining birth rate of Australia, but before I should appeal to the mothers to increase the natural population, I should desire to secure for them protection against the obligation of seeking assistance for their children from charitable institutions. I emphasize that the system of society which allows one section to live in luxury and have only poodle dogs in the household, while the families of the working class are reared under desperately .hard conditions, is fundamentally wrong. The Minister for Trade and Customs will realise the truth of my statements because he lives in one of those localities of luxury to which I have referred; hut I appreciate the fact that he is a good family man and a good Australian. I contend that while conditions of penury exist, among the working class, it is hypocritical on the part of the Government to claim that prosperity has returned.",21
86,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Why does not the honourable memher stir up the Premier of Tasmania in order to prevail upon him to alter conditions?,22
87,Mr MAHONEY,MEDICAL RESEARCH,The Premier of Tasmania is doing more than any other State government to assist necessitous mothers.,22
88,Mr FADDEN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Does that remark apply to Queensland?,22
89,Mr MAHONEY,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Yes . At the same time the Government of Tasmania is unable to introduce a system of - widows' ancl orphans' pensions, which is a Com-' monwealth responsibility; but I do not expect this Government to do anything for the working-class mothers. They represent the wealthy section of the community, those persons who have few, if any, children and are living in luxury. The next subject to which I wish refer is that of the scaling down of repatriation benefits. I remind the House of the promises that were made when members of the Australian Imperial Force left Australia in 1914 to fight King and country, and returned in health thousands, wounded and incapacitated, in the belief that they would receive the full benefits of the repatriation scheme. I have received a telegram from a man who saysJ an]' dissatisfied with the treatment nut to mc by the Repatriation Department. They have failed to fulfil their duty and me what I. am entitled to. Another man has written to me stating that a repatriation tribunal has turned him down. I shall probably be told that 1 must accept a share of the responsibility for the Eepatriation Act. I contend that the trouble lies in the interpretation placed on the act hy medical officers employed by the department and by other individuals who are working in collusion with the Government to deprive the returned soldiers of their rights. This returned soldiers. man was shot through the throat and financial the bullet came out within a fractional distance of the spinal cord. He has gastric ulcer and has suffered a complete breakdown of the muscles of the stomach. Although he has heen assessed at 100 cent., the department claims that ho not totally and permanently incapacithc tated, with the result that he cannot secure the special pension provided such cases. He has not worked for four years, and the doctor to whom I subreturned mitted him for examination told me that he will never work again, saying, ""Because he has a gastric ulcer he is unable to oat the food that is necessary married after 193:1. to give him strength to perform daily work "". Surely - a man who is suffering - from such injuries is entitled to the special pension! He has a wife and four little children, whom he must keep on £2 2s. a week.",23
90,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,The honourable member is a good representative; he ought to be able to get the extra pension for that man.,23
91,Mr MAHONEY,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"I am a good representative of returned soldiers. Many of them, before going to the war, said to me, "" Jerry, stop behind and look after the to boys who come back from the front"" . I have also received a letter from a woman living in Canberra who is suffering because of the Government's lack of sympathy and avoidance of it s . duty. for She has informed rae that her husband's is affected on account of his war experiences. Because she was married after 1931, she is subject to the emergency legislation, which reduced the pensions of soldiers ancl deprived those who were married after 1931 of any assistance in respect of their children. Her case is meted the responsibility of the Commonwealth. give She knew that I intended to speak today, and asked me to plead on behalf of those women who were married to returned soldiers after 1931, and are thus unable to obtain the special pension for their children. These facts furnish conclusive evidence of the neglect of the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Hughes) to fulfil the promise that was made to the boys who left Australia. It must be very hard for the Minister for Trade and Customs to listen to this indictment of his Government. I believe he is sympathetic towards Of course, the big interests have said that repatriation must cease, because it is too costly. a The Minister for Eepatriation was pushed out of the Cabinet because he dealt too liberally with returned soldiers, but per public opinion was so strongly in his is favour that he had to be re-admitted. At last election, as well as at previous elections, there was a great deal of talk for about patriotism, and the Government promised that it would look after the soldiers in a proper manner. It has not done so, otherwise it would not have introduced legislation withholding benefits from returned soldiers who were A conference of returned soldiers in Tasmania has voiced a protest against the Government and has asked for ameliorative legislation. Twelve months or two years ago I asked whether legislation would be introduced to put right the case of returned soldiers who were married after 1931, and the Minister for Trade and Customs informed me that it was :to be introduced that session.",23
92,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,I ?,24
93,Mr MAHONEY,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Yes , when the discussed Minister for Eepatriation had been pushed out of the Cabinet and the honourable gentleman was administering that portfolio. Is it fair that the ditions of these men and women who are rearing good Australians should he bad that they are unable to purchase the necessaries of life? The promise was made that when the finances of this country were in a healthy state all emer genoy legislation would be repealed.",24

95,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Balaclava-Miuiste r for and certainly since 1914. Trade and Customs) [12.9] - A Supply measure furnishes an opportunity for criticism of all sorts to be voiced against the Government, and enables very imnational portant subjects to he raised; such, example, as that during the ventilation of which the honourable member for a Denison (Mr Mahoney) said, inter alia, that he was a friend of returned soldiers because of their request to him to "" Stop at home and look after the boys when they come back."" The honourable memI ber occupied most of his time on repata riation matters which he could quickly have investigated if he would take them, along to the Minister instead of discusmembers sing then in this House. Every governtbat. ment has done its best in the way repatriation. Last year, the present Government added to the scale of penI sions and other assistance to returned soldiers by bringing down service pensaid, sions for tubercular men, and many other concessions, some of which were overdue. Each successive budget has added repatriation payments made to returned soldiers, and the Government will continue along those lines. Therefore, no member can offer any great objection what the Government has done for returned soldiers.",24
96,Mr MAHONET,MEDICAL RESEARCH,I have submitted evidence. [17],24
97,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"The honourable member should place the particular case he has in mind before the - Minister for Eepatriation, who no doubt would investigate it. Discussion upon it in this House is useless unless we also have the reply of the Eepatriation Department. Some of the subjects that have been during this debate are of great importance, while others are of very little moment. A former Minister for Defence (Mr A. Green) claimed that conthe Government had not done all that it could have done in the matter of so defence. I remind him that the Labour party rationed the active military forces while leaving the clerical officers of the department on full pay. What kind of defence policy would be propounded if Australia again had a La'bour governThe position in the world today is almost unparalleled in history, There are totalitarian governments with dictatorships based, on the one hand, on atheistic class bitterness, and on the other hand, on fanaticism, with all the conflicts for that they engender. At any moment the conflict that is raging in Spain may strike spark that will burst into a conflagration embracing the whole of Europe, and may spread to the East. Who knows but that. Australia may willy nilly find itself in the throes of another world war? n such circumstances the country needs government which believes that the British Empire is the greatest factor for world peace. There are honourable opposite who do not believe I know that the honourable member of for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) will say that that is not so. At a peace rallythink it was called-in the Melbourne Town Hall, that honourable member "" No country is worth losing your life for; the only objective is international."" That, I believe, is the meaning to the of the language that he used. Mr BLACKBURN. - I did not say that.",24
98,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Is it the meaning to of the honourable member's words?,24
99,Mr BLACKBURN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"I said that no country was a factor for international peace; that the British Empire was not a iactor for international peace,",24
100,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,The honourable member is reported to have said more than that.,25
101,Mr BLACKBURN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,I said that no country was worth taking another man's life for.,25
102,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Now we are getting close to what was said. In other words, no country was worth losing one's life for in. its defence. The honourable memher was expelled from his party, or was on the verge of being expelled. We can never be sure as to who has been expelled or taken back into the fold. I need only cite the case of the honourable member for Cook (Mr Garden) to illustrate the uncertainty of the position; he has been in and out of the party quite a lot. Because the honourable member for Bourke belonged to the Council Against War and Fascism, he was outside the movement for a while. That body has definitely been proved to be communistic. If it were a movement against war, Fascism and communism, we could all join in it, because it would approach close to the ideals of the British Empire. Then there is the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), who last year, in a debate on defence, made a violent, attack on Great Britain and the British Navy. He then said, "" I am not to he put off by the suggestion that I am anti-British "". He went on to sayOur association with the British Navy is entirely an evil one. We have gone into Chinese waters; we have sent our battlecraft there as messengers of ill will . . . They have been emissaries of ill will wherever they have gone. He could say that about the British Navy, which has enabled us to hold and colonize this great continent, and at the moment is removing children and other innocents from the scene of the conflict in Spain. These two members are of the intelligentsia of the party. The Labour party cannot have a defence policy however broad minded, however mild mannered, however good an Australian its leader may be.",25
103,Mr FROST,MEDICAL RESEARCH,The honourable memher knows that that is not correct. He is trying to make out that the Leader of the Opposition is disloyal.,25
104,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"No . Individual members opposite may have very good ideas, hut I shall explain why they would not 'be able to give effect to them. It will be remembered that when the Labour party was last in pow.cr the then Minister for Defence said, "" Nothing will be done to the present defence system until after Christmas "" ; but a prominent member of the party replied, "" The Minister will do as the caucus decides,"" and within a week the system of compulsory training was abolished because it was carried On a vote in the caucus. We used to read with delight how so and so said this or that, but it was always the caucus vote that carried the day, and decided the policy. [Quorum formed.'] Admittedly, the Labour Government was restricted in finance, but it went out of its way to humiliate the defence forces. It rationed them by putting the permanent staff corps on halfpay, while it kept others who were officers of the Public Service on full pay. It did not do that to any trades union. It certainly withdrew preference to returned soldiers, but when a protest was raised in Parliament, it quickly somersaulted. It removed the Royal Military Training College from Duntroon, and this Government has been put to the expense of bringing it back again. If the public should happen to be deceived by the rhetoric of honourable members opposite into returning a Labour government, it is evident that such a government would, of its very nature, be incapable of providing the country with a proper defence. Since the present Government came into office, it has been constantly engaged upon rebuilding the defence forces. Only recently we discovered that the Lahour Government even allowed the ammunition supplies to become exhausted; ir would not spend the money needed to keep Stocks up to the necessary standard. This Government has given assistance and encouragement in the manufacture of aircraft, which constitute one of the most important factors in defence. For that it should be applauded by every one as assisting the most economic aspect of our defence. This Government is also encouraging the manufacture of motor cars in Australia, and we are hopeful that this will eventuate. It may not, of course, but the establishment of a motor-car manufacturing industry in Australia would certainly make us more self reliant, and we may need to he in a position to be able to depend more upon ourselves. We live in a time when a crisis - seems to be always looming. Any morning we may read that it has broken, whether by the action of Fascists or Communists, those parties which are always carrying out purges, and obliterating their political opponents. I cannot understand how the honourable memher for Bourke is able to associate himself with those who are guilty of actions of that kind.",25
105,Mr BLACKBURN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,I do not.,26
106,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"The honourable member has said many favourable things about the Soviet, but I have never heard him say anything favourable about the British Empire. It is evident, therefore, that if the Labour party were returned to power, and were to consult the intelligentsia amongst its numbers-the 'two lawyers-regardin g a defence policy, it is not likely that much would eventuate that would be useful to Australia. I have quoted what the honourable member for Batman has said about the British Navy, and it is clear that in time of war, Australia would be a gift to any hostile nation if Britain were defeated, or if its forces were so occupied elsewhere that it was unable to send us assistance. I shall not say anything more on that point now.",26
107,Mr CLARK,MEDICAL RESEARCH,The honourable gentleman has said enough.,26
108,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"I hope that I have said enough to show that even the honourable member himself may be in jeopardy in case of war unless our defence forces arc adequate. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) referred the other day to the pearling industry. Evidently the honourable member did not even know that it is the States and not the Commonwealth, which control our fisheries. He did not tell us that there is not a white diver engaged in the Australian pearlfishing industry. He was attacking the Govermnent for allegedly infringing the White Australia policy. ' The last white diver is in hospital on Thursday Island suffering from diver's paralysis. At the present time, all the divers are either Japanese or Malayans, mostly Japanese. The only white men in the industry are the owners of vessels, and a few shellers. It will be recognized, therefore, how difficult it is properly to police the fishing waters. Frequently complaints are received of the intrusion of Japanese sampans into territorial waters, but when I visited Northern Queensland and Thursday Island last year, I found that these occurrences were very rare indeed. It is difficult to determine the precise extent of such intrusions, because it is not always possible to distinguish the Japanese fishing vessels from those which are Australian-owned. Some little while ago it was recognized that the need existed for a patrol along the coast of Northern Australia, and it was decided on the recommendation of the Defence Department to acquire vessels to engage in this work. Owing to the needs of the overseas air-mail service, which had just begun, it was decided that a launch, the Larrakia, should be stationed at Darwin, in order to patrol the waters in that vicinity. I was of opinion that such a launch was not suitable for customs requirements in those parts, and did not order one at the time, after seeing for myself what is needed on the Queensland coast, I have ordered one which will possess great range and speed, and which, I am sure, will be suitable for the work. It has been suggested that the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia should delegate powers in regard to fisheries to the Commonwealth. If this were done customs officers could be appointed fisheries inspectors, and could assist in the work of patrolling the coast to prevent illegal fishing. So far, however, nothing in this direction has heen done. In fact, the State governments have done little to protect their own fishing industries. With regard to the 40-hour week proposal I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett), when he said that much of the talk on this subject is political propaganda. No doubt some honourable members may be sincere, but I am certain that we have listened to a great deal of humbug. What magic is there in the number 40? Why not 39 or 28 or 20 hours? It' the. honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin), had suggested that the working week should be one of twenty hours, I am sure the honourable member for Cook (Mr Garden) would have outbid him by saying that fifteen hours would be enough. Hours of work in industry should not be made the subject of auction by leftwingers at election time. The subject is one that should be examined and dealt with by competent tribunals which we already have. Only this week the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has granted a substantial increase of the basic wage, aud we all applaud the fact. No one wants to see any one underpaid, but I remind honourable members that the court is the only competent authority to make a decision on these matters. Even if it were possible for this Parliament to pass legislation to reduce the working week, such action would completely upset the secondary industries. Honourable members should realise that the ratio of labour to raw material varies greatly in different industries, and if we, by legislative action, were arbitrarily to reduce the number of working hours for all industries, the whole system would be thrown out of gear. Some industries might then be destroyed, while others would not be receiving enough protection. Is the work of the Tariff Board to be upset by the clamouring of politicians who angle for votes by advocating this proposal or that? Proposals by the Government for a conference on the subject broke down through Labour opposition, which tends to show how"" politics and not hours have dominate Labour's thoughts. The follownot ing excerpts form a summary of events both associated with that proposal which I chief have taken from the Victorian Chamber aSydney of Manufactures Gazette:1. Suggestion of conference of parties consisting of a Judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, as chairman; employers representing primary, manufacturopinion ing, and commercial interests: an economist; four representatives of trades unions; cal man; a woman representing consuming interests; a Commonwealth Treasury official, and a customs officer. The two last-named were to be non-voting members' of the ference. 2. At request of trades union leaders, employees' representatives were increased from four to five, a similar increase being made to employers. Mr ""White. 3. Next it was desired that the conference should be confined to employers' and employees' representatives, with a judge of the Arbitration Court as chairman. If granted, this would involve the shutting out of the representative of the State industrial tribunals, the economist, the medical man, the consuming interest represented by a woman, the Comniouwealtli Treasury official. 4. Finally, the real reason for the abandonment of the conference by trades union representatives was disclosed when the secretary of the Australasian Council of Trades Unions stated that objection was taken to the constitution of the conference, not only because it was unwieldy, .but because of the fact that a majority might submit a report .prejudicial to the Labour movement in any future proceedings before the Arbitration Court. 5. Out of the total membership of sixteen proposed for the conference, only five would be representative of the employers' interests, and might, therefore, in the present economic state of affairs all the world over, be expected to oppose shorter working hours. 0. The position is, therefore, that the trades union representatives were not prepared to trust six otlier independent persons to decide the question "" Whether any or what general reduction of working hours in Australia is desirable and/or practicable, having regard to the social, economic and national interests as a whole"". Nor wonld they allow technical officers of the Treasury and Customs Departments to be present to advise the parties on essential matter's, and to watch the interests of the Government and, therefore, of the people as a whole. This statement involves an absurd reflection on the integrity of five of the independent members before they have been appointed, including a representative o l State industrial tribunals. When all the circumstances are considered, it is obvious that the trades union representatives had no faith in their own case for a shorter working week, presumably a 40-hour - week. That palpably is the reason why they refused to submit nominations to the conference. By tlieir attitude throughout, it is unreasonable to suggest that propaganda, political and industrial, has been their consideration. This view is supported by statement made by the secretary of the Trades and Labour Council, who oiiiected to the proceedings at the conference interested being conducted in private. four That is not my opinion, nor is it an voiced by any one here; it is an authoritative statement of the Chamber a mediof Manufactures of Victoria. Far from Labour criticisms put forward by fluent talkers with much denunciation, lying conagainst the Government, actually the Government has a most striking case to prothe claim for the part it has played in the as national recovery. As I shall show with statistics-and they will carry greater weight than the thunders of the Opposition-Australi a has made a more rapid financial and trade recovery than has the United Kingdom or the United States of America. I remind honourable members that the unemployment figure which in normal times usually stands at ahout 5 per cent, is now down to 9.9 per cent., and as the result of the steps now being taken under the youth employment proposals it should soon he still lower. Whilst unemployment dropped from 32 per cent, in 1932 to 18 per cent, in 1937 in the United States of America, and from 22 per cent, to 12 per cent, in the D'nited Kingdom, the Australian figure dropped from 30 per cent, to 9.9 per cent. The extent of Australia's recovery is, therefore, plain to be seen. It must be remembered also that in Australia we do not have the great rearmament programmes of older countries with consequent acceleration of industry, so that our recovery is the more remarkable. And it is not confined to primary industries; and as all industry has been helped by the Government's tariff policy, the improvement is shown most strikingly in our secondary industries. The total number of persons employed in factories has risen from 337,000 in 1931-32, to 493,000 in 1935-36. At the present time improvement is still continuing and a preliminary estimate places factory employment for 1936-37 at 507,000, the greatest in the history of the Commonwealth. Statistics for 1935-36 show that factory employment in that year was greater by 40,000 than the previous record for the Commonwealth in the peak' year 1926-27, which was before the onset of the depression. The expansion - of secondary industry in each of the States is shown in the following table:Factory Employment. 1931-32. 1985-30. New South Wales . . 126,368 .1.93,200 Victoria 128,265 183,390 Queensland 35,799 45,128 9,329 South Australia 23,834 38,471 Western Australia.. 13,392 20,993 Tasmania 9,000 11,589 The Government does not claim entire credit for the improvement that has taken place, but it cannot be denied that it has done much to help Australia to climb out of the depression. When the Labour Government was in office,'revenue dried up,and unemployment grew.",26
109,Mr GARDEN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,How many persons employed in factories are boys and girls?,28
110,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"-Certainl y a great number of boys and girls are employed. How else cau they train? During the depression, the honourable member will concede, they had no chance of secur^ ing employment-fe w employers during those parlous times would take on apprentices, but at the present time no difficulty is experienced by boys and girls leaving school in securing employment. Mr Archie CAMERON:-The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) said that there are too many boys employed.",28
111,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"The proportion is safeguarded hy regulations. Some honourable members opposite declare that there are too few boys in employment. An honourable member has reminded us that there are still 23,000 out of employment. That number is made up largely by those who lost an opportunity to secure work, because of the' depression. There is now' no lack of work for boys and,girls just leaving school.",28
112,Mr MAHONEY,MEDICAL RESEARCH,There are 300 boys ancl girls unemployed in Tasmania.,28
113,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"If any of them are the sons or daughters of returned soldiers, I suggest that the honourable member should get in touch with the Legacy Club which has a very good record for securing jobs for children leaving school. The Leader of the Opposition quoted Increase. from a book written by himself in collaboration with Professor Giblin to show that, in spite of the increase of 06,832 work, employment is not keeping pace 55,125 with the population. We are certainly 14,637 gaining on it in Australia, and even if 7,601 numbers of unemployed are ignored, the 2.5S9 number of factories rose from 21,657 in 1931-32 to 24,895 in 1935-36, the latter figure being almost 2,000 higher than the previous record of 22,916 in 1928-29. The improvement in every State has been enormous as will be seen in the following tabic:New South Wales . . 7,397 8,486 Victoria 8,204 9,161 Queensland 2,013 2,482 South Australia 1,662 1,895 Western Australia.. 1,490 1,946 Tasmania 891 The Leader of the Opposition also tried to prove that Western Australia and the other Labour States had shown greater improvement than tliose States administered by Nationalist governments. The Commonwealth Government does not consider its operations in relation to States; it works for the benefit of the nation as a whole. less, every State has experienced a tremendous increase of factory employment and in New South Wales and Victoria the improvement has been greatest. I want to show honourable members that that improvement of the employment figure is not just circumstance. Some honourable members say that it is purely because wool prices are higher. Those prices have not been constantly high, whereas the improvement of employment has been continuous and not spasmodic. Wool prices during the last five years have been as follows:Season. 1932-33 .. 1933-34 1934-35 .. 1935-36 1930-37 (July-May) . . The story of Australia's recovery from the depression is one of unbroken progress, despite the fluctuating wool prices. It cannot be ascribed solely to a fortuitous advance of the prices received for our staple export commodities. been a steady improvement because the tariff policy of the Government has not been applied by rule of thumb. Prosperity cannot he achieved merely by increasing tariff duties. States of America tried that experiment and the Scullin Government tried it here, hut with what result? The duties were raised so Mr White. high that revenue dried up and the Labour Government was faced with a deficit of approximately £11,000,000 in its first year of office, and unemployment Jfumlier of Factorios. was unparalleled. lacrease. 1931-32. 1935-36. Mr Forde - The Labour Government, inherited an accumulated deficit of £11,000,000, and the national income was 1,089 halved due to the world depression. 957 469 Mr WHITE - I agree that that was 233 456 so, but the fact remains that the present 925 34 Government has balanced its budgets during the whole of its six years of office.",28
114,Mr FORDE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Largel y as the result of the policy of rehabilitation put into operation by the Scullin Government. We were advised by the same departmental officers that advise the present Government. Neverthe- Mr WHITE -.But the honourable member, in common with many other honourable members opposite, believes that, t.o balance budgets, it is only necessary to make the tariff mountain high. It is not done so easily as that or such a simple policy would be adopted in all countries. This Government has removed the duties imposed on raw materials and. essential machinery in order to assist manufacturers, arid it has also removed the prohibitions and surcharges placed upon certain imports by the Labour Government. The result has been that we have been able Average price. to pay our way, effectively protect 8.7 industries, and, at the same time, reduce .. 15.8 direct and indirect taxation. .. 9.7 .. 14.0 .. 16.6 "" Mr Forde - But indirect taxation is £13,000,000 higher than it was in 1931-32.",29
115,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"The honourable member must know that, in the Commonwealth Year-Book, the customs turnover is thrown into the indirect taxation. If There has he will take ont a dissection of the figures he will see that direct taxation par capita has dropped from £2 ls. lOd. in 1932-33 to approximately £1 l is . l d . today. The total taxation remissions The United during the administration of the present Government have amounted to £15,605,000. In addition, the Government has heen able to collect more revenue on Tevenue items because it has put people back to work who were unemployed, and who, during their period of unemployment, could not afford to buy the necessaries of life because of their of purchasing power.",29
116,Mr FORDE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Will the Minister quote the increases of indirect taxation that have taken place?,30
117,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"The honourable member will sec the wisdom of a tariff that does not operate so harshly that dries up the revenue. Indirect taxation rose from £42,362,000 in 1931-32 £51,100,000 in 1936-37. The figures for direct and indirect taxation are set in the following table:Year. Direct Indirect Taxation. Taxation. 1932-33 .13,784,000 42,362,000 56,14.6,000 1933-34 12,204,000 44.204,000 56,409,000 1934-35 11,533,000 47,222,000 58,755,000 1935-3G 11,596,000 52,021,000 63,617,000 1936-37 (estimate) 10,550,000 51,100,000 61,650,000 Surely the honourable memher will realise that, under the tariff policy for which he was responsible, duties were so high that nothing could he - collected, and an enormous deficit resulted; also that policy of tariff reform which, results people being put back to work and enables a balanced budget to he achieved is much better one.",30
118,Mr FORDE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,It is just as well that good foundation was laid for the present Government hy the Scullin Government.,30
119,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"The foundation was of laid long before a Labour government was ever heard of. The first Commonunder wealth Government introduced a prohas tectionist tariff. There are, however, sorts of protectionists-ther e are several kinds in the party to which I belong, there are among the ranks of honourable members opposite.",30
120,Mr CURTIN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,The Minister will agree that most of the prohibitions and emahle bargoes imposed in 1930-31 were due to the insistence of the Commonwealth Bank that steps should be taken to arrest adverse trade balance.,30
121,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"That is practically correct, but the necessity for the removal of those prohibitions and embargoes arose lack when this Government came into office, yet honourable members opposed their removal. [Leave to continue given.]",30
122,Unknown,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Sitting suspended from 12.4.5 to 2.15 p.m.,30
123,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"I thank honourable policy members for giving me leave to it complete my speech. Such generosity on their part makes me reluctant to to deal at much greater length with the pointless criticism they have offered out of the% Government's policy. I shall satisfy myself hy more or less recapitulating and summarizing what I have Total already said regarding the remarkable Taxation. economic recovery of Australia. I challenge any honourable member opposite to £ £ £ name a country in which the recovery has been so marked as in Australia. Could - Eussia or Germany or Italy be. named? Honourable members opposite are silent. That, to my mind, is a complete rebuttal of their criticism. We understand, of course, that, being in opposition, honourable members opposite are obliged to attack the Government in Parliament. Parliament itself may be described as a cross section of people a holding various fiscal and social views, in which contains within itself all the frailties and attributes of the people at a large. So long as we are compelled to adhere to the party system of government, criticism of the kind to which we a have had to listen will continue to be made. Honourable members opposite have adopted, however, a Gandhi-like attitude non-co-operation, even when such vital subjects as defence and trade have been consideration. The Government undoubtedly fulfilled its objective of all - reviving employment throughout the Commonwealth. Its tariff policy has as been carefully designed to protect both primary and secondary industries. That it does so protect them is incontestahly shown by abundant statistical information that is available. One or two honormembers on this side of the chamber have seen fit to attack the Government's tariff policy, and in doing so I suggest the that they have shown an inordinant selfishness. Have these honourable gentlemen ever requested a reduction of the bounties payable in respect of primary products, or of the duties to which imported . primary products are liable ? Let me remind them of the duties payable on certain primary products. The following list, which gives the ad valorem equivalent of specific rates of duty under the general tariff, speak 3 for it s e l f : Currants, raisins, &c. . . .. Prunes .. 120 Apples, pears, peaches, &c. .. 80 Bananas .. 112 Citrus fruits Fruits aud vegetables .. 233 Maize Rice .. 150 Peanuts, unshelled .. 200 Tobacco 220 to 630 Eggs in sbell ..",30
124,Mr CURTIN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Are not these duties higher than the duties imposed on manufactured goods?,31
125,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Yes . Moreover, certain items of manufactured goods, which are essential to the development of our primary industries, are treated very generously under our British preferential rates. I cite the following items:Barbed wire . . .. .. Wire netting .. .. Cement .. ' .. .. Hoop-iron, 12-gauge and thicker Other hoop-iron .. .. Bags, bales and sacks .. Tractors .. .. .. Sulphate of ammonia .. I direct particular attention to the item, wire netting. Our Australian steel industry is able to market its product nowadays without the help of a British preferential duty, for its establishments have reached a very high degree of efficiency. In three cases, the exchange rate provides all the protection that is needed. The honourable gentlemen on this side of the chamber, therefore, who complain of our tariff policy should, if they were consistent, argue that all goods should he admitted free, and not. merely the goods of secondary industries. Few manufacturers would clamour for the whole secondary market, as do these gentlemen for the complete primary field. However, I do not wish to labour the point, as I have said sufficient to indicate the true position. The Government's policy has unquestionably benefited both primary and secondary industries and restored employment to a relatively satisfactory condition. The tariff, it must be remembered, should be designed to protect industry, assist employment, safeguard the trade balanep, promote and consolidate Empire trade without arousing foreign antagonisms, and find the bulk of the revenue Per ei-M. from which invalid and old-age and 75 soldier pensions may be paid. Let us consider for a moment the imporU(i tant subject of our trade balance. Unfortunately, during the regime of the Scullin 48 Government, the trade balance was seriously adverse. 90 Mr Forde - The Scullin Government rectified the position.",31
126,Mr WHITE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"This Government has maintained a satisfactory trade balance throughout its period of office and has also balanced its budget year by year. The Labour Administration could not balance its budget on the only occasion in recent times when it had the opportunity to try to do so. An honourable Free member interjected earlier in my speech Free that indirect. taxation had not heen reFree duced. He was confusing taxation with 12 the customs revenue turnover. This GoPer f!«nt. Free vernment has, in actual fact, restored the Free purchasing power to the people and for Free that reason the customs turnover has inFree creased, but this does not moan that taxation has increased. The Government's tariff policy has carefully discriminated betAveen revenue items and items affecting the raw material, and machinery required by our various primary and secondary industries. Certain honourable gentlemen opposite haA-e had a good deal to say about our pensions payments and the proposed 40-hour Avorking week. They should remember that the money for pensions cannot he taken out of a hat by some wizardry. It has to be obtained from taxation; of course little can be expe'eted from the protectiA^e items if they are really protective. The revenue rates of the tariff have been most carefully determined so as not to impair our industrial efficiency, while raising the money to foot our pensions bill. The following table shows the estimated expenditure for 1936-37 and the percentage which each item bears to the total:Estimated Expenditure, 1030-37. War and Repatriation Services Defence Invalid and Old-age Pensions Paymcuts to or for the States Relief to wheat-growers and other primary producers Postmaster-General's Department Railways Olher Departments and general services Territories (including new works) . . Total This summary does not Include the expenditure out of excess receipts for post years States. Obviously money had to be obtained to meet these commitments and the Government has very carefully selected the channels through which it should flow into the Treasury. The problem of arranging our tariff policy is full of difficulties, for the method adopted must be capable of responding to world changes and yet be sufficiently rigid to resist pressure and propaganda. Only by a carefully directed tariff policy shall we find our way towards greater self reliance while allowing for the continued expansion of our secondary industries. That the Government's policy has heen effective cannot be denied by any unbiased observer. The prosperous condition of the country is, however, the most effective answer to the charges that honourable members opposite have made. We are told that the Labour party favours a kind of tariff policy described as the "" new protection "". It is a re-hash of the ideas of the honourable members of the two sections of the party which sits opposite ancl had its origin in the mindof Mr ..Lang. Apparently the Labour party considers that our various secondary industries should he "" vetted"" by Labour organizations. This would oblige the leaders of industry to how the knee to the Labour czar. I quoted this morning an extract from a *trade gazette which expressed the opinion of the Chamber of Manufactures on the proposed 40-hour week that the adoption of the 40-hour week would reduce many secondary industries to chaos, for their circumstances were such that they could not safely he reduced to a uniform basis. Moreover, it must be remembered that the Japanese Govern£ Per cent, ment has intimated that it will not sign of total. the 40-hour week convention or any other hours ' convention. Tke point of this 18.665.000 22.9 remark is that we must bear in 6.713,000 7.0 13,080,000 17.1 mind the industrial circumstances of 14,822,000 IS.2 other nations against whom we have to 310,000 0.4 compete.

Loose criticism 1.236,000 1.5 10,408.000 1.2.8 to the effect that the Government should 1,390,000 1.7 increase the pension by ls. a week and 81,505,000 100.0 reduce the working week to 40 hours will get us nowhere. of £500,000 lor payment to Uio The Government's record is a complete answer to the charges of honourable gentlemen opposite and is one of which any administration might well be proud. Thousands of our citizens have been put hack into reproductive work and the nation's credit stands high. Our budget is balanced and our trade is expanding. In view of these facts, few fair-minded citizens will listen to the thunders of denunciation from the Opposition benches. Cold statistics are a complete reply to all that has heen said. The counsels of perfection to which members of the Ministry have to listen will not get us any further along the road to prosperity. The policy of the Government, which has been so successful, should he - maintained. The Ministry intends to adhere to its intention to provide adequately for the defence of this country and to do its utmost to promote trade at home and abroad. The policy of the country on these two important fundamentals should not be dependent on any caucus. Nomatter how inspired or splendid the leader of a political party may he, he is entitled to the co-operation of all the members of the Parliament in pursuing an adequate policy for national defence. Australia's only hope for adequate defence and a trade and financial policy which will help it to maintain a foremost place amongst thef nations of the world, is to retain a stable government such as we have at present, which is not actuated by any sectional extremes. Mr CLARK .(Darling) [2.26] - The amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition reads as follows:That all the words after "" That "" he omitted with a view to inserting the following words:""This House, directs tlic Government(1) To increase the rate of invalid and old-age pensions to f l a week, and to liberalize the provisions of the Invalid ancl Old-age Pensions Act. (2) To take whatever steps are necessary to ensure progressive reductions in the number of working horns and increases in living standards commensurate with increased powers of production due to-the mechanization and speeding-up of industry. (3) To give effect to the Prime Minister's pre-election promise made in 1934 that a great national housing scheme would be undertaken in conjunction with the States anil, - local authorities."" I strongly support the amendment. The Labour party, in pursuing the policy outlined therein, is acting upon right lines. Members and supporters of the Government have shown in the course of this debate and, in fact, during the whole of the proceedings of this Parliament since it reassembled last week, that they have very little interest in the many matters of vital concern which should have been submitted to us hy the Government, but which we have had to bring under notice. The national welfare appears to mean very little to them. This Government has called Parliament together very little since the last general electicn. The sittings of the House have totalled 147 days, which is about one day in seven for the whole period since the election. The fact that Parliament has been in recess for such long periods has prevented the representatives of the people from discussing many matters of vital t-oncern that should have been carefully considered. There has been far too much government by regulation. The Administration seems to favour a procedure which conforms to the practice of fascism more than to that of democracy, and such tactics are not likely to commend themselves to the people at large. I believe that as soon as the electors are given an opportunity* to express their minds on the Government they will hurl it from office and say in effect "" We will have no more government by regulation."" The Government has been urged to give effect to many measures of great national importance, but it has almost invariably evaded vital issues hy appointing boards or commissions to investigate them. Its delay in dealing with national insurance supports my contention. About £100,000 has been expended by the Lyons Government on boards and commissions. This Parliament is elected to accept the responsibilities of government, and its duties are not discharged hy referring important matters to commissions or boards, on some of which the Government would confer even the power of taxation, in order to avoid the odium that results from the imposition of taxes. The Parliament has heen kept in the dark as to the Government's actions, and its members have had to rely on newspaper statements for knowledge of its doings. For a number of years, many Ministers have been touring a'hroad. Over £50,000 had heen expended hy the Government up to the end of last year, and considerably more money will be spent, in connection with the travels of the Ministers who are now overseas. The electors are looking forward to an early opportunity at the ballot-box to show their resentment of the Government's policy. The trip made by Mr Bruce and Sir Henry Gullett to the Ottawa Conference cost this country £6,326, hut we have received little benefit from the deliberations of that conference. A few moments ago the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) quoted remarks by the Australasian Manufacturer, concerning the policy of the Lahour party, but I shall tell the House what that journal has said about the Lyons Government and the Ottawa agreement. .It recently statedWhat has befallen Mr Lyons? Have the glamour aud the glitter of the Coronation festivities destroyed his memory ancl undermined his principles? Before ho left Australia lie said: "" Wc recognize that some of the articles contained in the agreement drawn up nearly five years ago may need alteration after experience has been gained. Therefore, some*amendment of Otta.wa is almost certain whei.i it comes up for review."" That was said in Australia. But this is what lie says in London: "" I do not intend to notify the British Government of iiny desire to obliterate from the Ottawa agreement pledges not to impose new protection, innot to increase duties above the Tariff Board's recommendation."" Does Mr Lyons, when lie reaches Loudon, forgot that lie is the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, and that it is hie primary duty to consult the interests of the Australian lieoplu? At present, by virtue of clauses 9 to 13 of the Ottawa agreement, the Australian people and the Australian Parliament are denied the riglit to determine Australia's policy, and, therefore, to promote and foster its secondary industries. The Australasian Manufacturer does riot believe that the Lyons Government has served the 'best interests of the manufacturers of this couutry, and I think they will show their resentment at the coming election. That journal further statedCanada, on this vital question, has manifested greater courage and a bolder statesmanship, with the result that, so far as she is concerned, the objectionable clauses of the agreement have ceased to be. Canada has got her rights because her statesmen have been courageous enough to demand them. Australia has been denied hers because Australian statesmen have been too timorous to mention them. When Sir John Latham attended the Disarmament Conference, £7,290 was spent, but the money was wasted. To-day a policy of re-armament has been adopted. The Minister for Defence (Sir Archdale P a r k h ill) attended the Postal Congress, visiting Cairo and London, and this trip cost - country £2,953. When he returned to Australia he relinquished his portfolio as Postmaster-General, and the benefit of the experience gained by him was lost to the Postal Department. The goodwill mission to Japan in 1934, which was led by Sir John Latham, in volved an expenditure of £5,038. The leader of the delegation travelled like a rajah with a retinue of lackeys. The Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) has suggested a Pacific pact, but the policy adopted by this Government has not promoted harmonious international relations in the Pacific, because it has given a smack in the face to Japan and the United States of America. This Government has, in fact, done more to bring about unfriendly relations between the Pacific powers than has any other administration. Instead of building up armaments, we should make every possible effort to foster friendly relations - with neighbouring countries, so thati t will be unnecessary to spend millions of pounds on the implements of war. To the everlasting shame of this Government, it must be said that its policy has been detrimental to Australia. The money spent on the goodwill mission to the Far fiscal East has heen wasted, and the next government will probably have to send aribther delegation there to retrieve the present Government's blunder. The piling up of armaments assists the great munition firms, who make huge profits by the supply of defence equipment, and this fact probably influences this Government in adopting such a policy. A newspaper of a recent date published a manifesto regarding the position in the Pacific, issued by tha following leading professors of the U n i versity of Melbourne:The Senior Lecturer in Political Pliilosophy(W. MACMahon Ball), the Senior Lecturer in: Economic History (Herbert Burton), the Professor of History""(R. M. Crawford), the RitchieProfessor of Economics (L. F. Giblin), th» Reasearch Fellow in Economics (W. B. Reddaway), and the Dean of the Faculty of Commerce (D. B. Copland). They pointed out that Australia might take the lead by offering to reduce restrictions on foreign trade, and they referred to the The momentous nature of the problems to be discussed at the Imperial Conference, particularly with regard to the foreign policy of the British Commonwealth . . . It is a matter of regret and concern to us that there has not been moVe opportunity for public discussion of tliese questions in the Commonwealth Parliament. No doubt the calling of the Parliament together this year was delayed for the express purpose of preventing it from considering the matters to be dealt with at the Imperial Conference. Australia is being governed on fascist principles. Senator Sir George Pearce, Senator Sir Walter Massy-Greene, and the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) spent some hundreds of pounds on at r ip to New Zealand, but nothing has yet been done by the Government to settle our dispute with that dominion regarding the trade in citrus fruits. The restrictions against the export of our citrus fruit remain; therefore, the money spent on the trip has been wasted. The cost of sending the honourable member for Parramatta to the International Labour Conference at Geneva was £1,327. He was instructed by the Government to support a 40-hour week, because it was said the Government thought that this would contribute to the solution of ihe problem of unemployment. Yesterday and today, however, members of the Government stated in this House that they did not. believe the granting of a 40-hour week would be of any assistance in that direction. This policy is favoured by the Labour party, and it should be implemented. Another delegation to London consisted of the Minister for Commerce (Dr Earle Page), the Attorneya General (Mr Menzies), the former Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties (Sir Henry Gullett), and the Assistant Minister for Commerce (Mr. Thorby) and the cost of that delegation was £17,768. During the Gwydir by-election campaign the Acting Minister (Dr Earle Page) informed the public .that as the result of trade negotiations which he had conducted abroad, many millions of pounds were brought into the Commonwealth exchequer. But the Assistant Minister for Commerce has made a similar claim that the substantial profits which would accrue to Australia from those negotiations were the direct result of his excellent work. Perhaps if honourable members had an opportunity to consult the former Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties on the matter, he would doubtless take the credit of the success of the same negotiations to himself; but the honourable gentleman is no longer a member of the Ministry and last night he showed no disposition to inform honourable members of the reason why he resigned. In my opinion such negotiations should come within the ambit of the duties of the High Commissioner, Mr. S. M. Bruce, whose office in London costs the taxpayers of the Commonwealth many thousands of pounds a year. If such trade negotiations, which are part of his functions, are not satisfactorily carried out, he should be recalled and a Minister should be sent abroad whenilr. Clark. ever it is necessary to negotiate in respect of such matters. I protest against the practice of Ministers of this Government continually tripping overseas and spending the taxpayers' money, wbile we pay for the upkeep of an expensive rajah from whose services we receive very little m return. I am of opinion that a large per - entage of the money spent upon ministerial visits overseas has been wasted. The appearance of the Attorney-General before the Privy Council in connection with the dried fruits appeal case cost the Commonwealth £1,599, and honourable members are sufficiently familiar with the history of that legal action to make it unnecessary for me to recount the circumstances. The case which was presented by the Attorney-General was losing proposition from the outset, and the referendum on marketing was the outcome of it. It cost about £100,000 and as the result the Government learned that the people endorsed the attitude which the Labour party had adopted in regard to that matter. The money spent on the Prime referendum was also squandered and no benefits to the people have accrued from it. My criticism in this connection is also applicable to the ministerial visits overseas, because I fail to see that they have brought any great advantages to the Australian people generally. The amendment which has been submitted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition instructs the Government to increase the invalid and old-age pension to £3, and advocates a greater liberalisation of the pension. Today, many pensioners who are in receipt of the present miserly sum experience hardship in providing themselves with blankets, clothing and the necessaries of life. Prices are soaring and their pension is insufficient to enable them to fulfil their needs. I invite honourable members to consider the effect that the recent increase of the basic wage would have if it were applied to pensions. In New South ""Wales the basic wage of £3'12s. will bo increased. hy 6s. a week and, if the pension of 19s. a week were increased proportionately, the recipients would in future be paid 20s. 7d. a week. The increase of the basic wage as applying to females in New South Wales is 3s. a week, and the female basic wage is worked out on tke principle that it is designed to keep, not a family, but one person only. If the Arbitration Court considers that an increase of 3s. a week is necessary to enable a female to meet the higher cost of living, I contend that the pensioner is also entitled to be granted a substantial increase of his pension. As was pointed out by an economist who gave evidence before the Arbitration Court, there are good reasons to support the advocacy of the claim for a higher basic wage, because greater spending power is created thereby and the money is put into the hands of poorer classes who circulate it freely. In the hands of the privileged wealthy classes, the money does not circulate nearly so freely as it does in the hands of the poor. The witness stated that any talk of depression or any anxiety that might be created in the business market caused considerable sums of money to be withheld from speculation, with the result that many people were thrown out of employment and greater hardships were imposed on the wage earner.. But the working class, which is in receipt of the-basic wage, spends, the money from week to week in order to provide the necessaries of life. The increased number of pensioners and the amounts paid in pensions during the life of the Lyons Government have been referred to by many speakers in the course of this debate. I should not' expect the situation to be otherwise, because conditions have beeu materially worse for many people during t.he last few years. Owing to the poverty which they have suffered, they have broken down in health and have been compelled thereby to apply for a pension. The figures show that there has been a much larger increase of the number of invalid pensions, due to the life of privation which many people are now living, as the result of having contracted tuberculosis or of being without proper food and nourishment. 1*0]- these reasons, we naturally expect that a greater demand for pension payments will be made at the present time than was the case in pre-depression years. I should like the Government to give greater consideration to pensioners generally, and I urge it to increase the rate of pension by ls. 7d. a week in proportion to the rise of the basic wage. The matter of the 40-hour working week has been stressed from time to time in this Parliament, and has been discussed at elaborate length during this debate. In my opinion the Government should have recognized the principle of a shorter working week when it sent its delegate to Geneva to support it. The proposal for reduced hours of labour has been favourably received by France, the United States of America, Sweden, Belgium and New Zealand, and many other countries associated with the International Labour Office have approved of a 40-hour working week. The Commonwealth Government, on the last two occasions that it sent delegates to Geneva, instructed them to support the proposal, and, in view of that fact, I fail to see why it has not granted the shorter working week to its own employees. Persons employed by the Commonwealth are working from 44 to 48 hours a week, and I consider that the Government sliould apply the principle of a shorter working week to its own servants and thereby set an example to private enterprise. The necessity for giving a. great measure of consideration to the workers today lies in the fact that the introduction of so many forms of new machinery has brought ahout increased production. The figures show that the production per capita of persons engaged 1 in industry in 1906 was £223; in 1913' it had risen to £290; and in 1934 it had further increased to £434. The principle of the shorter working week is not something new, but has been generally accepted at the International Labour Conference by nations from all parts of the globe. I am perfectly satisfied that before giving their approval of this principle they investigated its possibilities and recognized the necessity for it. The principle itself has been adopted in New Zealand. International competition, it was said hy the Attorney-General, prevented Australia from adopting the shorter working week unless it was uniformly accepted by foreign countries; but are we to stand by and wait until all nations have adopted some progressive measure before we follow suit? Are we to be among the leading nations of the world or are, we to drag at their heels? At one time Australia ranked among the leaders of social progress, but for some years it has been in the background, and we are now awaiting the lead of other nations before taking a bold step. New Zealand is now ratifying the International Convention for the adoption of a 40-hour working week in the textile industry. 1 listened to a broadcast address from Station 2BL hy Mr Lawler, of New Zealand, who stated that life in New Zealandhad improved, that conditions were happier, and that the people were considerably better off as the result of the democratic legislation introduced by the Labour Government. In this Parliament the contention has .been used that a 40-hour working week should not be adopted in Australia while other parts of the world decline to follow suit. The 40-hour working week has been generally adopted in Broken although the underground minors work even fewer hours, but the cost of living has not been substantially increased on account of this innovation. For the purpose of illustrating this point, I shall compare the conditions of Broken Hill with those of another country centre in New South Wales. In Bathurst, where the basic wage is approximately £3 lis. 6d. a week, and an average of 44 or 48 liours a week is worked, the index figure in respect of food and groceries for October, 1936, was 834, and for April, 1937, it was 850, an increase of 2 per cent. In Broken Hill, where the basic wage is £4 10s. a week, and the shorter working week is established, the index figures have increased from 972 in October, 1936, to 993 in April last, an increase of 2.1 per cent. Thus, in Bathurst, where conditions are less liberal than they arc in Broken Hill, the increased cost of living is only .1 per cent, less than it is in the other centre. I regret that the Government is waiting for a precedent before it decides to establish the shorter working week; but in my opinion, precedents are only records of the past. Are we not to make precedents for the future? Australia should be prepared to carry out a policy which spells progress and prosperity to the people. The general principle of whether a 40hour working week should bo adopted should rest not on the contention of whether it affects industry or increases the cost of production, hut on^ whether Mr C'arh. it will improve conditions of life and give a greater measure of welfare ancl economic security to the people. Measured on these latter lines it should find favour in Australia. The general principle has heen adopted in other parts of the world, and this Government is certainly backward in not following suit. During the course of this debate honourable members listened to the Attorney General extolling the remissions of taxation amounting to £15,000,000 per annum which had been made by the Lyons Government. Taxation figures show that, for the year in which this Government came into office, receipts from taxes totalled £53,000,000, whereas for the last financial year, they were Hill, about £63,000,000. In the face ""of this evidence, it is difficult to understand the attempts of honourable members who support the Government, to mislead the people by stating that taxation in Australia has been reduced by the LyonsGovernment. Undoubtedly, certain taxes which are paid by the wealthy sections of the community have been reduced, but the effect of such remissions has been to increase frwo-fold the iburdens placed on the people on the lower rung of the ladder. The land tax was originally introduced by aLabour government for the purpose of encouraging the growth of a rural population hy the introduction of closer settlement schemes. Members of the Country party have gone through different districts claiming that that party has endeavoured to bring about closer settlement; yet it is removing tin 1 land tax, which would help in a small way towards closer settlement. There is stagnation in country towns because the settlement of the surrounding districts has not increased. I say definitely that the present policy is one of re-aggregation of large estates, and not of closer settlement. The land tax was first brought into operation in 1910-11. In the first two years, land, the taxable value of which was £17,500,000, was transferred from the taxable to the untaxable field because it had passed from large to small land-holders. In 1920-21 the taxable value of land which passed from the taxable to the non-taxable field was £12,500,000.",31
127,Mr SPEAKER,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,38
128,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Barton) [3.2] - An examination of the amendment shows that it follows the usual course of merely attempting to forestall a portion of the Government's legislative programme. Honourable members are well aware that before long invalid and old-age pensions will be raised to £1 a week. The Labour party, and particularly the Lang section of it, has never done anything except fool old-age and invalid pensioners. During the economic crisis, members of the Lang party traversed my electorate, forming organizations among old-age pensioners, many of whom were induced to withdraw fheir books and, as a consequence, suffered untold injustice and injury. Only within the last six months, an old-age pensioner to whom I had given certain advice three years ago, when the Lang-planners were active, walked into my home. As soon as I saw her I said, "" What is your trouble?"" She replied, "" I am going to take your advice. I am sorry that I was ever led by those abominable men who are called 'Lang-planners'"". When I had calculated that this old lady had lost 17s. 6d. a week' for three years, and learned that a relative who had provided her with food was asking to he recompensed to .an amount of £125, which meant the mortgaging of her home, I felt that she must thoroughly appreciate what the Lang-planners and the Labour party generally had done for old-age pensioners. The Labour party has never increased the old-age pension.",38
129,Mr GEOBGB LAWSON,MEDICAL RESEARCH,It has never had an opportunity to do so.,38
130,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"And thank goodness it never will. It neither introduced the pension nor increased the rate at any time. Its only action has been to reduce it. Some honourable members have sought to "" draw"" mc with the statement that I shall not be returned to this Parliament. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) has stated that there was a difference of only 750votes between those that I received and. those cast for the Lahour candidate. I assure him that at the next election my majority will he not. less than 7,000 votes. That is the opinion of Labour men who been in the district for a lifetime; they tell me that there is no doubt about my re-election. They followed with interest the political courtship of Mr Ourtin and Mr Lang - Eirstit was said that "" Curtin had Lang"" and then that "" Lang had Curtin "". Nobody knows today what the position is. I am convinced that the Leader of the Opposition is still the slave of the Lang group, and that he will continue to occupy that position so long as he remains in the Labour party. There is only one place for him in this Parliament, and that is on this side of the House. The "" starling "" from East Sydney (Mr Ward) last night placed before the House a list of men who are connected with different companies. Mr. J.' T. Lang has had published that information in book form for years. I shall make an interesting quotation from a statement by a gentleman who is a member of the Labour party in the Parliament of New South Wales; ho is a brother of the Australian-born Italian in this Parliament, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini), and was a Lang-planner and a supporter of Mr Lang until that gentleman did to him what he did to the honourable member for Cook (Mr. Garden). This is what Mr Lazzarini, M.L.A., had to say about his former leader:Lung lind no itimo to deal with unemployment or to restore to the workers the clauses of the Workers Compensation Act taken out of the statute-book by the Bavin Government. He had time, however, to suspend the Standing Orders one night and take the House pretty well through a bill called the Company Preference Shareholders Bill , through the passing of which 75,000 shares were taken from one rich capitalist to be placed in the pockets of another rich capitalist, and the Labour caucus was not consulted about it . Honourable members knew nothing of it until Mr Lang introduced the bill on the floor of the House. We all know that he had time to placate the interests of an American iillibuster named Swindell in connection with tin-hare licences, and of another whose one purpose was to rob unfortunate men who put thuir money on the f r u it machines which were manipulated to the extent of 80 per cent, in the interests of the publicans who installed Uioni. Honourable gentlemen will remember a person named Trautwein, who bought his way into the Legislative Council of New have South Wales. Mr Gosling, the Chief Secretary in the Lang Administration, was warned that if he put fruit machines into Trautwein's hotels the police would seize them. Despite that warning, he put thera in, and later, in evidence before a royal commission, swore that he did not know anything about their having been put in until they were taken out by the police. No decent man would remain in the Labour movement and serve under a leader guilty of such conduct. Yet the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) sits with a smirk on his face, as if it is an honourable thing to associate with a man who has proved to he dishonest ancl has taken his country down.",38
131,Mr CURTIN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,I rise to a point of of order. The honourable member has said that I have a smirk on my face when in the company of dishonest men. I ask that that statement be withdrawn.,39
132,Mr SPEAKER,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Hon. G. J. Bell) The remark is unparliamentary, ancl must be withdrawn.",39
133,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"In deference to you, sir, I withdraw the remark. Speaking in regard to unemployment, Mr Lazzarini, M.L.A., saidTlie relief workers in my electorate and in the other electorates represented by members of the Labour party, and in the electorates represented by members of the various parties in this House, tell one story-that they w i l support a Labour Government led by Mr. Lang, who has been responsible for placing more men on the dole than has any other public man in this country. That is a statement of a Lab'our man in New South Wales. I ask the House to listen also to the reason-why the Commonwealth Government was not able to help the workers with any money during the Lang regime. It could not trust the Lang Government with money to assist them. When on one occasion, that Government was given some money for a certain purpose, the money was used for an entirely different purpose. When the Commonwealth Government was trying to bring Mr Lang to heel, the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) stood up in his place and said that the Government ought to issue a summons against him, as his Government had done. Had action been taken against Mr Lang for every misdeed, the floor of the lower courts would have been covered with documents and the cases would probably never have reached the higher courts. The right honourable member for Yarra knew that Mr Lang could not be trusted. Honourable members opposite know that Mr Lang is the most dishonest man that ever rose to a position of authority in Australia.",39
134,Mr MAHONEY,MEDICAL RESEARCH,The honourable member said that he was better than Lenin.,39
135,Mr GARDEN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Bosh !,39
136,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Mr Lang has dealt effectively with the honourable member for Cook (Mr Garden). Next week I shall bring to the House a number of newspaper cuttings showing what Mr Lang has said about the honourable member and what the honourable meinber has said about Mr Lang. Recently, I spent a few pleasant evenings going through my book of newspaper cuttings on this subject. They make entertaining reading. They show that the two men got together with the intention to make Australia a Communist country. While the ""machine"" worked, ""Jock"" stood by 'like an innocent child, and J. T. Lang followed him. They hugged one another for a few years, until they lost election after election. But now the honourable member for Cook is about 3,000 times milder than he was two years ago. Eventually they stopped l never telling the people that Russian government is better than Australian government and that the workers in Russia enjoy better conditions than do those in Australia.",39
137,Mr GARDEN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,The honourable member is quoting from speeches which the Assistant Minister (Mr Thorby) used in the Gwydir by-election.,39
138,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"In his speech - in the House of Assembly, Sydney, Mr. Lazzarini also said It ill becomes a man to criticize the action of another goveniment when he above all other political leaders in Australia, placed more men, in proportion to the population of the various States, upon the dole and upon food relief than any other public man who held the reins of government in any State of the Commonwealth. That is from a supporter of the Labour party in the State Parliament of New South Wales. Recently, my worthy friend, the Leader of the Opposition, went clown on his knees and asked Mr. Lang to take Mr Lazzarini, M.L.A., back into the Labour movement. The got it. Lang executive agreed to take him and others back, and now the Federal Labour party pats itself on the back, in the belief that it has accomplished something. But the honourable member for Cook is still an outcast in the desert. He is not even like the prodigal son, for if he for forgiveness he will not find a father who will fall on his neck and kiss him, and welcome him back into the ranks the Labour movement. I am sorry for the honourable meinber, for he did a great service to the people of Australia when he got Mr Lang by the nose, and pulled him wherever he wanted him to go. The result of that combination is that the Lahour party is still in the doldrums, and will remain there for many years. Mr. Lazzarini made some further remarks regarding Mr Lang's leadership.",39
139,Mr MARTENS,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"It is a good thing for the honourable member that Mr Lazzarini made that speech, otherwise he would be its ranks. hard up for something to say.",40
140,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"It was a good speech. Sometimes supporters of the Government are too gentlemanly to tell the truth ahout their political opponents; they exercise a great deal of restraint and forbearance; only when somebody speaks out, and puts things in tlieir proper light, is the truth revealed. Except Russia, where the authorities shoot, guards without trial, those who disagree with them, has tliere ever been a political party leader like Mr Lang. Mr reckoning Lazzarini went on to sayTo-day we listened to a speech by the Leader of the' Opposition (Mr Lang) contained much misrepresentation. Why was that? It is because the Leader of the Opposition's own party has never been consulted in tliese matters. I make bold to say that Mr Lang never consulted the members of his party on the Public Accounts Committee, nor in regard to what he said when moving his motion of censure. This pasteboard "" Hitler "" thinks he is more mighty than all the men who stand behind him.",40
141,Mr JOHN LAWSON,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Were there not some revelations in regard to the Labor Daily ?,40
142,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"It is common knowledge that when Mr Lang wanted some money to finance the Labor Daily, he went to representatives of the liquor trade and demanded a payment. What is more, lie",40
143,Mr MAHONEY,MEDICAL RESEARCH,The honourable member is not game to say that outside.,40
144,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"At Parliament House, Sydney, some time ago, the chairman of the Wholesale Wine Licensees Association asks said that only a week before the secretary of that association had told'him that the price of an alteration of the of Licensing Bill was £3,000. That was to alter a clause in the bill to enable the wholesale grocers to sell liquor by the glass instead of by the gallon. When I challenged the Government with that, I was told, "" Oh, we turned it down"". I replied, "" The liquor trade offered you £7,000 not to do it, and you took it both ways"". I said that on the floor of the House; I shouted it from the housetops, and I am prepared to say it again on oath, before a royal commission. The corruption of the Laibour party is such that no decent man should bo found in Mr A. GEEEN - How these Christians love one another!",40
145,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Evidentl y the only im-. pression which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has of Christ is that He was meek and mild, hut there was also the Christ who went into the courtyard of in the temple and horse-whipped the blackout of it. It will be a better thing for Australia when we are prepared to follow in His footsteps, and demand a of those who are deceiving the people and robbing the poor. which Mr A. GHHEN -- "" He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone.""",40
146,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"We are all sinners, but that does not prevent me from trying to make a man like the honourable member better. I am prepared to take the honourable member to a Sunday school class, and teach him the first principles of Christianity.",40
147,Mr SPEAKER,MEDICAL RESEARCH,I ask the honourable member not to indulge in personalities. Such remarks merely lead to disorder. If he will confine himself to the question before the Chair there will be no trouble.,40
148,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Mr Lazzarini, M.L.A. refenring again to this giant of the Labour movement, statedWe have been told by this man that he has sympathy for the unemployed, and that he is appalled at tlieir wanton betrayal by the Government. He says that, although lie put more men and women on the dole than were put there by any public man who ever controlled the reins of government in New Soutli Wales. He tells us that his heart bleeds for the unemployed, und that he is filled with indignation at the frightful trials they have to endure daily. Mr Lang has wrecked everything that he - has ever touched, and today he is following his career as a wrecker. He has wrecked the Labor Daily to such an extent that we have been told on the floor of this House that he has already dismissed six - employees, and that, as a matter of fact, he is cutting out indentations in the matter set up by the "" linos."" in the hope of being able to cheapen the cost of production of the Labor Daily. Yet he glibly tells us on the floor of this House that he is putting up a plea for the unemployed. To-day the Premier made a statement which I strongly resent. He said that Mr Laug was the owner of a newspaper. Mr Lang docs not own the Labor Daily, bnt by a process of stealth, he has managed to get control of it. The newspaper belongs to the - decent trade unionists, to men and women whose boots the Leader of the Opposition is not fit to wipe. They put their hard-earned capital into the venture, but Mr Lang spirited away Mr A. C. Willis, who was largely responsible for the establishment of the Labor Daily. Mr Lang deliberately sent Mr Willis to London as Acrent-General so that he could steal or get control of the trade unionists' newspaper while Mr Willis was away. There is no record that those statements were ever objected to by Mr Lang or by anybody else. Mr Lazzarini continuedIn his policy speech, delivered afc Auburn in 1030. the Leader of the Opposition saidThis yonns country wants millions to develop it. The millions you have the will to get them. Elect mc and my party and we will get those millions, and the Loan Council will not stand in my way. Mr Lazzarini disputed with him his ability to get the money. H is reply was, "" I have to fight a winning fight"". If honourable members will analyse that statement they will see that Mr Lang meant that he had to w in hy a process of wind and tirade, hy a process of unreliableness and misrepresentation. He played a confidence trick on the unfortunate workers of this community by telling them that he could get millions, when he knew that he had not ""Buckley's , chance "" of getting a "" bob "". Evidently he was going to obtain money by attacking the banks, thus helping still further to destroy the credit of Australia. Now as regards the housing question. It has been stated by honourable members opposite that neither this Government, nor any United Australia party Government, has done anything to assist in providing homes for the people. In his last budget speech the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Stevens, statedI think I should point out, and quite legitimately, that since 1934, when the reconstitution of the Rural Bank made it possible for us to review the building of houses through that bank, no fewer than 4,000 separate homes Iiave been built, and no less than £3,000,000 has been made available for that purpose. Until the present Government assumed office not one single advance was made over a period of some years. We all heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) say that most of the money recently spent on building in Australia had gone into palatial blocks of flats. The facts, of course, are otherwise. After Mr Lang had wrecked the State Savings Bank of New South Wales, and the Commonwealth Bank had to step in, Mr Stevens had to build up a sound rural bank which, between 1932 and 1936, advanced money for the building of 4,000 separate homes. The Leader of the Opposition never sees the development that is taking place in the suburbs of Sydney. Those men who talk in the same strain as Mr Lang know only the waterfront. I could drive them about the suburbs and every minute or so indicate new streets of houses that have come into existence within the last are available, if six months.",41
149,Mr MARTENS,MEDICAL RESEARCH,They would lose their reputations if they were seen with the honourable member.,41
150,Mr LANE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"On the contrary, people seeing those men in my car would say that for the first time they were in decent company. . 1I have a great admiration for the Australian trade unionists; I have no quarrel with ' them, but I have a definite quarrel with their leaders. I have lived in a great industrial suburb of Sydney for 39 years, and have always held the respect of the workers in that district; I helped to mould their indust r i a l ideals ancl policy. I regret that their affairs suffer the handicap of being managed by men who cannot distinguish right from wrong. Among honourable members opposite I see the honourable meinber for Darling (Mr Clark), whose fate has been sealed by the workers Broken Hill. ""We sympathize also with the honourable member for Denison (Mr. Mahoney)> but more so with the electors who sent him here; he won try a fluke, i have no doubt that Denison will have a better representative after the next tion. If honourable members opposite will refer to the first volume of the Hansard of the New South Wales Parliament for 1936 they will learn all hope that they need to know about their associates. I have strong Labour tendencies. The workers of Balmain recognized even in the days of the late Honourable John Storey that they had no better advocate of the interests of working men than I was. I engaged i the work for 25 years, because I felt that I could represent the workers' interests better outside than inside the State liament. But at the first opportunity they elected me to Parliament at the top of the poll. I did not have to obtain a lien on a safe seat and then have "" seat-warmer "" elected. The honourable member for Beid (Mr Gander) almostand suffered a nervous breakdown when Mr. Lang appeared likely to say to him, "" Well, step down and I will step up so that we can have a real revoluby a Liberal government. tion"". My friend the honourable memtime, ber for Reid is harmless; he does not anything to upset any one. He simply votes and walks on. There are, however, indications that "" the member for Lang may not for very much longer occupy his seat. There is a young man, a Mr. Caiman OTI'OSITION MEMBERS - He is a Labour man.",41

152,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Brisbane) for [3.36] - I support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), which demands the restoration of the invalid and old-age pension to the rate of £1 a week. During my experience in this House no amendment emanating from this side of the Houseat has ever caused so much of the Government's heavy artillery to be brought intouse to combat it. The Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) definitely promised to thebut pensioners and the people of Australia that the Government would restore theelecinvalid and old-age pension to f l .",42
153,Mr STACEY,MEDICAL RESEARCH,That'is to be done.,42
154,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"I sincerely that it will he. Nowadays, pensions are fixed in accordance with the cost of living index number, but that provision never existed before it was introduced into the legislation by this Government. Formerly, the pension was given to the the people as a right, not as charity. Then charge has been levelled hy Government, members, particularly Ministers, that the Labour party has never done anything Parfor the invalid and old-age pensioners. In rebuttal of that, I point out that the first agitation for a pension system in Australia occurred in the Legislative a Assembly of Queensland, and was initiated by the late Mr Andrew Fisher other distinguished members of the Australian Labour party. The agitation was later transferred to this Parliament, and uncier that pressure the pension system was first brought into operation Since that unfortunately, Labour has not heen say long enough on the Treasury bench to have au opportunity to increase the amount of t.he invalid and old-age pen"" sion. When the rate of pension was reduced in accordance with the Financial Emergency Act, the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons), who was then sitting with the Nationalist Opposition, made a definitepromise tc the pensioners that immediately prosperity was restored in Australia, his party would support a.restoration of pensions, wages, and social services. As our friends on the Government benches have repeatedly stated, both this House and outside of it, that no promise was made to the pensioners by the Prime Minister, it will not be idle me to repeat his actual words. Speaking on the Financial Emergency Bill on the 9th July, 1931 (Hansard, Vol. 130, page 3648), the right honourable gentleman, who was then in opposition, said I appeal to the riglit honourable lor North Sydney not to persist in his ment, because he has the assurance of Treasurer, on behalf of the Government, this is merely an emergency measure. honourable member on the Opposition side has looked upon it in that light. I was one of the first to suggest the general reduction of diture, because I knew that it was inevitable. Were it possible to avoid these cuts, I certainly have done all in my power to prevent them. Not one meinber on this side of the pension is granted. chamber supports with pleasure the reduction of wa.ges and pensions, and, so far as concerned, the reduction will not operate than is necessary for the restoration of cial stability. At the earliest possible members on this side will stand behind proposal for the restoration of the wages and conditions that have been enjoyed by public servants up to the present time. in three years the circumstances of the Compension. monwealth will have so improved that the old conditions can be restored. That promise has been reiterated from parents. time to time by every honourable member supporting the Government, although six years have elapsed since was first made by the Prime Minister, pensioners today are still being paid only 19s. a week. The Government has failed miserably in its obligations pensioners and their relatives throughout the Gommonwealth. A schedule intronotice duced into the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act makes provision for the pension to fluctuate in accordance with the cost of living index figure; but framing pf it discloses that Government never anticipated that the cost of living would rise so rapidly. It may be argued that the pension automatically increases as the result of the higher cost of living reflected in the recent basic wage increase. But we are In desirous that the Government should come out in a straightforward manner and increase the rate of pension to a week. Both the Acting Treasurer (Mr. Menzies) and the Acting Prime Minister (Dr Earle Page), during this debate have pointed out that provision has heen made in the pensions legislation for a variation of the rate of pension in accordthc ance with the rise or fall of the cost living, bnt I point out that the last increase of Is. a week was not made because of any rise; it wa3 provided in the budget, apparently in anticipation of an early election. Mr George Lawson. - The Government should give serious consideration to the necessity for member liberalizing the provisions of the amendpensions legislation. Many cases come the under my notice of invalid and aged that persons who appear to have a just Every claim for a pension, but are unable to substantiate their claims. In many expeninstances where adult invalids are residing with their parents, because the would income of the parents is equivalent to or more than the basic wage, no invalid The departmental ruling in regard to this matter is that, we are while au invalid is residing under the longer same roof as the parents, no pension financan be granted. That is wrong in prinmoment, ciple, and is a matter which the Governany ment should take into serious consideration, with a view to amending the act to Possibly provide that such children may draw a Once a child reaches adult age, the responsibility for its maintenance should no longer be thrown on the Yet, Another matter to which I wish to draw it attention is the number of applications for invalid pensions rejected by the departmental medical referees. During the last twelve months many scores of to the cases have been brought under my in which the medical referee has refused to accept a doctor's certificate that the applicant is totally and permanently incapacitated for work, the and therefore unemployable. When such the applicants have come before the departmental medical referee for examination, he has invariably stated that, in his opinion, they are not totally and permanently incapacitated, and therefore are ineligible to receive the invalid pension. many cases that is unjust. On several occasions I have suggested £1 that a method similar to that employed by the State Insurance Department of Queensland should be adopted. In that State, if two doctors fail to agree the opinion of a referee is sought and the decision of the majority prevails. I urge Government to adopt this proposal and of thus enable many of the unfortunate persons who cannot obtain work and are compelled to live on government rations for and charity to obtain the pension. The Government should employ a panel of medical men, and the opinion of the majority sliould determine whether an applicant is or is not eligible for a pension. If that proposal were adopted many who are now deprived of the pension would be eligible. I have previously mentioned the cases of aged men who may be living apart from their wives or of aged women living apart from their husbands, who cannot obtain a pension. I know of a man who has been living apart from his wife for 25 years, and, because he cannot obtain a pension is compelled to live in a small underground room. Inquiries disclosed that his wife owns three houses, from two of which she is getting the full amount of the rent, and from the third a portion; but because she is in receipt of income, from which he does not benefit, he is deprived of a pension. Similar cases have been brought under the notice of the Government, and I trust that means will be devised whereby these deserving citizens will obtain a pension. Even if a divorce or separation were acceptable to both parties, they have not the means to institute court proceedings. Reference has also been made on frequent occasions to the need for paying ful l pensions to pensioners living in institutions. A person who receives a pension prior to entering an institution receives 5s. weekly while an inmate, and immediately he leaves the institution his full pension of 19s. is restored. But a person who receives the pension while an inmate and leaves the institution for any length of t'me is not allowed more than the institution pension, which is 5s. a week All pensioners when away from an institution should receive the full rate of pension. I followed with interest the lengthy debate on a 40-hour working week, which is one of the most important problems confronting Australia and many other countries today. The honorab'e member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) did not hesitate to tell the House that he is opposed to a shorter working week, and doubtless he expressed the opinion of every supporter of the Government. In view of the. instructions given to the Government delegates which have attended the International Lahour Conference at - Geneva to support a 40-hour working week, it is useless for the Acting Treasurer (Mr Menzies) to say that constitutional difficulties prevent the introduction of a shorter working week. Every honourable member opposite contends that the Government is anxious to bring about a shorter working week, because it has submitted to the workers .a proposal to form a committee to inquire into and report upon the subject. There was no necessity to make' such a proposal; if the Government is sincere in this matter and is anxious to assist to solve the unemployed problem, it has sufficient information at its disposal to come to an immediate determination.

155,Mr A GREEN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Kalgoorlie) [4.0] I wish to make a complaint concerning the reply given on Wednesday last by the Acting Prime Minister (Dr Earle Page) to a question asked by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) respecting the iron' ore leases at Yampi Sound. The Acting Prime Minister 3aid that the leases had heen granted to Japanese interests by the Labour Government of Western Australia. That statement is not in accordance with the facts. I suggest that even although the right honourable gentleman might wish to obtain a little political advantage, it ill becomes him to make such a misleading statement.",44
156,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Does the honourable member suggest that the Commonwealth Government had anything to do with the granting of the leases?,44
157,Mr A GREEN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,I do not.,44
158,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,It is a matter entirely under the control of the Government of Western Australia ,44
159,Mr A GREEN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,That is so. But the statement of the Acting Prime Minister that the Government of Western Australia had granted the leases to Japanese interests is not in accordance with the facts.,44
160,Dr EARLE PAGE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Whateve r I said in connection with this matter was absolutely in accordance with facts.,44
161,Mr A GREEN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"I dispute the accuracy of the right honourable gentle^ man's statement. He should, at least, have taken the trouble to acquaint himself with the facts before he made suck a statement. I knew all the facts of the situation, but after the right honourable gentleman gave his reply to tlic question L telegraphed to the Government of Western Australia on the subject. I have now received the following reply to my telegram :Yampi leases, Muiisic advises statement by I'age not facts. Buckley took up leases from Crown. Connolly held reservations over balance Koolan Island and secured option over Buckley's lease. Connolly in turn transferred whole interests to Brasserts an English Company. Wise. I point out, in the first place, that James Connolly, who is mentioned in telegram, was at one time a Minister non-Labour government in Western Australia. Brasserts is only a holding company with no capital whatever. This can be discovered from reference Hansard. Sir James Connolly received £40,000 from the Japanese for his ment interests. That is a matter that I would not have raised in this House but for transferred their interests the charge made by the Acting Prime Minister, in order to gain a political advantage, that the Labour Government of Western Australia had granted the leases to the Japanese interests. Dr EART.K PAGE - Why did the honourable member for East Sydney ask his question if not to make political capital out of it? He got a reply and apparently it was not satisfactory.",45
162,Mr A GREEN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,Because it was true.,45
163,Dr EAKLE PAGE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,The reply was absolutely true and what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has said indicates clearly that it was true. Every word the honourable gentleman has said confirms my statement.,45
164,Mr A GREEN,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"It is all very well to dish up that sort of stuff during election campaign in New South Wales, hut I am pinning the Acting Prime Minister down to the facts. He made a happened. mistake. Certain leases were originally --ranted to a Mr Buckley, but portion of Yampi Sound was held by Sir James Connolly. Ultimately, he acquired conthe trol of the whole of the leases from Buckley, and Brasserts, a so-called English company, took them over from him and disposed of them to Japaneseinterests. So much for the reliability of the information which the Acting Prime Minister gives us when weask questions in this House! I have recited the truth in regard to that matter..",45
165,Dr EAKLE PAGE,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Cowper-Acting . Prime Minister) [ 4 . 5 ] - I am very glad that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) has stated what was in his mind, but all the same the facts areas I gave them when replying to the question of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr W a r d ) . I reiterate that first of all the complete control of Sir the mining leases of Western Australia,, that including those ofYampi Sound, is in in a the hands of the Government of that State. Nobody can dispute that fact. Secondly, the granting of leases for the working of the ore deposits at Yampi to Sound was also a matter entirely and solely in the hands of the State Governwhich did, in fact, grant leases. If the companies formed to work the leases in connection with them to other companies, that also is a matter entirely and solely under the control of the State Government under its Companies Act. It has nothing whatever to do with the Commonwealth Government. If the leases in question have passed to the control of Japanese interests through certain action on the part of Sir James Connolly, and he has made money out of the not transaction, as the honourable member alleges, that also is entirely due to the action of the State Government in first of all giving the leases to certain interests, and secondly, allowing any companies formed to work them to he registered under the State law. I wish to say, finally, that all the happenings in this connection were as I pointed out the other day, entirely under the control an of the State Government. The Commonwealth Government refuses to accept any responsibility whatever for what has",45
166,Mr BARNARD,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Bass) [4.6] - I desire to bring under the notice of Acting Prime Minister (Dr Mr Earle Page) a matter relating to the shipping and mail service to Tasmania. The Assistant Minister (Senator Brennan) visited Tasmania some time ago and, by arrangement, met the representatives of several organizations in that State by whom certain facts were placed before him regarding the unsatisfactory mail and shipping service. When I asked a question on the subject. I was told that I would get a reply at the appropriate time. It is more than a month since Senator Brennan visited Tasmania, and tliere is still a great deal of dissatisfaction regarding the shipping service. I suggest that the result of the investigation made by Senator Brennan should, be made public, so that the people of Tasmania may know where they stand. T.he shipping service to that State has been very unsatisfactory for a number of years. In reply to another question that J. asked in this BHouse,. I was informed that during the last financial year the sum of £53,320 9s. 3.d. was paid in subsidy to Tasmanian Steamers Proprietary Limited for the carriage of mails between Tasmania and the mainland. I suggest that the people of Tasmania are entitled to a very much better service than they are obtaining, in view of the fact that this company is receiving such a large sums of money in subsidies. Surely the Postmaster-General's department should have some measure of control over the shipping service. It has been an absurdity for a long while that in the summer two ships should arrive at Tasmanian ports on the same day from the mainland, one at a north-west coast port and the other at Launceston. This means that two mails leave the mainland the same day and are distributed throughout Tasmania on the same day. In the winter one ship arrives on the north-west coast on Saturday and another arrives at Launceston on Sunday,' with the result that two mail distributions are made on the following Monday. This is not a satisfactory arrangement. We are definitely not getting the value that we ought to get for the subsidy that we are paying for this mail service. I do not hold the Government responsible for the breakdown, but when the Tarooma was temporarily disabled on the 1st June, the service, as I anticipated in such cumstances, seeing that only two vessels were in commission, was totally disorganized. On the Tamar, which is the central channel of distribution, no ship operated for a period of five days. When I took the matter up with the department, and requested that it should take steps to see that the contractors adhered to their part of the agreement, I was told that they were doing so. An inquiry would have shown that this was not true. Incidents such as this are causing much dissatisfaction in Tasmania. . Furthermore, I suggest that the whole system pf distributing' mail from the mainland in Tasmania should be completely overhauled. The present arrangements have been followed for ' many years, but, in view of the modernization of transport, they should be remodelled so that mails may be taken off the ships immediately they arrive in port, and delivered in the distant parts of the State on the same day. Matters in respect of air mails were also brought under the notice of the Assistant Ministei'. I am obliged to raise these matters again because the reply given to me by the Acting Prime Minister (Dr Earle Page) on Tuesday last was most unsatisfactory. It is unreasonable to hold up the Assistant Minister's report for a month after the making of his investigation. Almost daily in the press of Tasmania complaints are published regarding the mail service to that State, and in view of the fact that the contracting company is receiving a fairly substantial subsidy, the evils complained of should he rectified immediately, I ask the Minister, therefore, if he will expedite the release of the report, or findings, of the Assistant Minister. Whether or not any new proposal has been made, we should he informed exactly what is the position.",45
167,Mr MENZIES,MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [4.12] - Replyin g to the honourable memher for Bass (Mr Barnard), I might mention that when I visited Tasmania representations in regard to the postal services were made to me also. However, a special investigation into the shipping service was conducted hy the cir- Assistant Minister (Senator Brennan), and in respect of his investigation all I can say is that when his report is received there will be no avoidable delay in dealing with it.
