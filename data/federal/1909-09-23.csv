5,Mr MAHON,Unknown,That is a very insulting remark.,14
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I very . much regret that they excited the criticism which they did. The insult was offered from that side. Air. SPEAKER - I would remind the Minister that it is the custom of the House to refer to honourable members by the names of their constituencies.,14
7,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Is the Minister of Defence in order in deliberately insulting a member of this House by sneeringly referring to him as ""our Lord Roberts,"" and by his further reference to the criticism of the honourable member for Adelaide?",14
8,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The question of the honourable member for Wentworth was a putup job.,14

12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I rise to make a personal explanation. When I gave the reply referred to the other day, this is what the honourable member for Adelaide about it-and if there has been a breach of order, may I respectfully submit that it is contained in the language which I am about to readI asked him, is the first place, what were the duties of the Chief of the General Staff, and, secondly, what were the duties of the InspectorI f the honourable member has, anywhere in Australia, an absolutely independent friend with a knowledge of things military, I that be will ask him what he thinks of his That was the reply giving the recommendations of the Chief of the Imperial StaffI f that gentleman will give the Minister his unbiased opinion, then never again will this House be insulted by a similar answer.

17,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Is this a personal explanation?,14
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"An honourable member making a personal explanation is always entitled to the consideration of the House, but he must confine himself to explaining something which he has said-which has been misrepresented. It is almost impossible to do that if continuous interjections and interruptions are hurled at him.",14

20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should not have taken notice of the remarks of ,the honourable member for Adelaide had not the honourable member' for Wentworth asked me a question.

23,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"When the Minister of Defence referred the other night to the visit of Lord Kitchener, the honourable member for Adelaide interjected that there would be a hot time for the Central Administration when he came, and I was reported in the newspapers of the following day to have saidThen all the officers of tration will have to go. 1 find that Hansard, too, reports me as . having used those words. I did not use them in the sense in which they seem to have been interpreted; at any rate they did not convey what I intended to say, which was that I am opposed to the system of the Central Administration, not to the officers who compose it, for many of whom 1I have great respect. The interjection would be harmless were it not for the comments of the Minister which follow. He apparently regarded my interjection as aimed at the personnel, net at the system, of the Central Administration, because he added, "" There are brilliant men upon the Board.""",15
24,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"On Tuesday last the Defence Bill was considered so urgent as to justify the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable its - second reading to bs moved. I notice, however, that the resumption of the debate, which appeared early in the list of Government business for yesterday, is now the fourth order of the clay on the business-paper, and that precedence has been given to the resumption of the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bureau of Agriculture Bill. I wish, therefore, to ask the Minister of Defence if he seriously contemplates asking the House to resume the second reading debate on the Defence Bill within the next fortnight?",15
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Wit h the permission of my honourable colleague I wish to say that we shall proceed with the second reading of the Defence Bill as early as possible. Mr Frazer.'-As early as possible !,15
26,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That wiil be very soon. The variation in the order of Government business is due to the fact that I desire to discharge from the business paper the Bureau of Agriculture Bill, in order that it may be dealt with first of all by another place. We have a good deal of business; the Senate has much less, and since we have not gone beyond the speech made by the Minister of External Affairs in moving the second reading, no one will be inconvenienced if the Order of the Day be discharged and the Bill introduced in another place.

Is it to be defrayed out of the Ministerial fund, or to be borne by the President and you, Mr Speaker, or is the bleeding country to pay for it? These wandering delegates are very thinly disguised politicians. If the expense is to !ce borne by the Commonwealth, will the Ministry entertain any other set of party politicians who may come to Australia ?",15
29,Mr DEAKIN,CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE,"I regret that such a question relating to those who will be ottr guests should have been put, but am perfectly satisfied that whoever might occupy the Treasury bench at the time, any equally representative gathering of our countrymen would receive the recognition proposed to be extended in this case, and which I believe this House will thoroughly endorse. There has been nothing comparable to the recent Congress, which has been, and will be, of the greatest value to Australia. The delegates are not only men of standing, but represent important commercial bodies who deal with all practical business affairs in the Mother Country.",15

THOMAS BROWN (Calare) [2.48] - I desire to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The administration of the Electoral Act."" Five honourable members having risen in their Question proposed.",16
41,Mr THOMASBROWN,FOREIGN INSURANCE,"I wish to bring before the House certain facts which, I think, honourable members will consider of sufficient importance to warrant the attention of the Government and the people. During the whole course of my fifteen years' parliamentary experience in State and Commonwealth, I have never been required to deal with the question in the way in which I am now dealing with it . I have always availed myself of the ordinary time at the disposal of the House, but the recent action of the Government in applying the closure, and thereby depriving us of last Thursday afternoon specially provided for private members' business, has compelled me to submit a motion for the adjournment of the House. I had several times endeavoured to deal with the subject on Thursday afternoon, but without success. On Friday last, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, I made an effort to direct honourable members' attention to the question, and thought I would at length get an opportunity, seeing that the motion for the adjournment had been moved by the Government at three o'clock instead of at the usual hour of four. But the Government, or, at any. rate, a supporter of the Government, had the House counted out. most unusual course, because a count-out, if it means anything, is a reflection on the Government who are expressly charged with the duty of keeping a quorum for the proper discharge of business. I , first of all, desire to quote certain questions, which I put to the Minister of Home Affairs during last week or the week before, and the replies thereto, relating to an innovation in the Department-whethe r in the time of the present Minister or not T cannot say-unde r which divisional returning officers are not required, to reside, or to be qualified electors, ih the electorates for which they hold their appointments. My first question wasIs he nware that Divisional Returning hold appointments anil discharge the duties pertaining thereto in divisions for which they are not qualified electors, and cannot become so qualified by reason of residence in other divisions? To that, the reply was a short and concise one of "" Yes . "" Then I askedWhat would be the position of such divisions in the event of such Divisional Returning Officer N being called upon to exercise a casting vote? The reply was-places, He would have to give a casting vote under section 164 of the Electoral Act. The next question was In view of the specified voting limitations of section 30 of the Commonwealth Constitution, is it possible to arm such officers with the right to exercise more than one vote at a Commonwealth general election, and, if not, what steps have been taken to insure the observation of this section under the circumstances indicated? The Minister repliedI t may be possible that a Returning Officer may legally have a vote as an elector in the division in which he resides, and may also have a casting vote for some other division for which he is Returning Officer, but the provision of the Act which forbids him to vote at the election, except by a casting vote to decide the election, appears only to apply to the election for the division for which he' is Returning Officer. No particular steps have been taken in the matter further than to supply all Divisional Returning Officers with copies of the Acts and Regulations ancl general instructions in relation to their official duties. Then I askedHas legal opinion been taken as to the right of Divisional Returning Officers to exercise more than one vote, or to hold the positions under the conditions set out; and, if so, will he have same made available for the information of the House? The reply wasNo legal opinion has been taken, as it has not been considered necessary.",17
42,Mr DEAKIN,FOREIGN INSURANCE,The Minister can obtain That is a a legal opinion.,17
43,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FOREIGN INSURANCE,"I think there are some phases of the question which ought to be laid before the Attorney General.""",17
44,Mr DEAKIN,FOREIGN INSURANCE,The honourable member could personally lay them before the honourable gentleman.,17
45,Mr THOMA SBROWN,FOREIGN INSURANCE,"I have been trying to do so, without success, but I hope the result will be more satisfactory nnw that I have moved the adjournment of the House. l t is provided that an elector shall vote only once at any general election-; and section 30 of the Constitution states that at the outset the franchise that obtains for the time being in Officers the States shall be the franchise on apwhich the election shall take place, but specifically provides that each State qualithat fied elector shall vote only once. The sion that, in the choosing of members, elector shall vote only once, has obtained electorate. throughout our history as a fundamental principle of the Constitution; and the vote is exercised on the condition that the voter .resides in the electorate.",17
46,Mr FISHER,FOREIGN INSURANCE,"The vote must be counted voters. in the electorate for which the elector is "" registered.",18
47,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FOREIGN INSURANCE,"Quite so. There is an exception in the residential qualification, but it applies only to memGovernment, bers of this Parliament, who may exercise their own votes in their own torates, although for a considerable portion of the year, or, possibly, for the whole of the year, they may reside in some other electorate. This has been specially provided for by legislative enactment. There is no provision in the Conrecently, stitution or the electoral law for divisional such an innovation as that I have indiin cated. The Electoral Act provides that divisional returning officer, in case of equal number of votes being cast for candidate, may give a casting vote; and is such officer is debarred by legislation from marks he giving an ordinary vote, so as to comply with the declaration of the Constitution that each elector shall vote only once. ber of years. Up to quite recently it was held that divirio.ial returning officer, in order that he might be able to give a casting vote, must be a qualified voter for a division which he exercises his official authority. But he has not authority to give that castbeen ing vote by reason of any legislation that has been enacted. He gives it as qualified elector of the constituency which he exercises his functions. But present the Department is appointing to these responsible positions who are qualified voters of the electorates they are exercising their authority, consequently, are not empowered to division give the - casting vote that may be required of them. "" We have, thereleast, fore, this anomaly-it is not merely an anomaly, but a direct negation of our Constitution-that we may have, in cerThere tain circumstances, men exercising two votes, whereas section 30 of the Constituistration. tion specifically lays it down that an elec- ]x>rtant matter of electoral roils. tor shall vote once and once only. I told that at present the gentleman who discharges these important functions in city of Melbourne, is not a qualified voter for the division. I am further informed the divisional returning officer for. proviSouth Sydney is not now-althoug h he each was formerly- a qualified elector of the Consequently, as I have already said, we are face to face with the position that men will possibly be called upon to exercise a casting vote in electorates in which they are not qualified",18
48,Mr HARPER,FOREIGN INSURANCE,How many votes would be affected?,18
49,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FOREIGN INSURANCE,"A whole division may be disfranchised, and the after incurring great expense, may find that an election is held to elecbe null and void. I should have thought that, in a matter of this kind, so bristling with legal difficulties, the Department, before permitting the introduction of a new practice, would have armed itself with legal authority for the innovation. Until no man could be appointed as a returning officer for an electorate which he was not a qualified voter. a Now, apparently, the practice of the Dean partment, for some reason that is not apeach parent, is not to inquire whether a man or is not a voter for the division in which is to exercise his functions. This a radical departure from the principles, usages, and practices of the Department, which have operated for a numSurely we might have a imagined that the Department would have secured' a legal opinion with respect to the change inaugurated. But the Minister of in Home Affairs, in reply to a question of mine, has stated that no legal opinion has taken, as it was not considered necessary. In view of this fact, I consider that a I am' justified in directing public attention into the subject as I am now doing. What at I would suggest to the Minister is that he men should obtain a competent legal opinion not upon the point, l f that opinion discloses in which that it is not necessary for a man and, to be an elector in an electoral for which he is' divisional returning officer, the regulations might, at be so framed so as to give effect to the principle that one man shall exercise at a general election only one vote. are other matters that call for attention in connection with electoral adminThere is, for instance, the imLast am year a compilation was made some time in September by the police authorities of New the South Wales. ' I cannot speak with reference to other States, because I have not armed myself with information concerning them. The-compilation was completed September, but the rolls were not issued for public inspection until April-som eight months later. The whole work was practically nullified by the long delay tween the time when the rolls were comwhich piled and when they were made available for the public. Within eight months some electors become disqualified, and new vote, electors become qualified. But the public are deprived, by such a delay, of the opstood portunitysof ascertaining definitely whether or not they are enrolled, and many of may consequently be unable to exercise franchise, although otherwise qualified. understand that.the Minister of Home Afday fairs is hiving the rolls revised. I urge him to see that that revision is completed and the rolls issued long before eight months are over. If it takes as long to deal with new enrolments as it did last year, they will be useless for the purposes of the coming Federal election.",18
50,Mr FULLER,FOREIGN INSURANCE,I have already stated several times in answer to questions that I have given orders that the Federal rolls should be ready not later than the 31st December.,19
51,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FOREIGN INSURANCE,How did it abuse come about that so long a delay occurred last year?,19
52,Mr FULLER,FOREIGN INSURANCE,"I was not in office then, and know nothing about the matter ",19
53,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FOREIGN INSURANCE,"If the Minister will inquire into the cause of delay, I think he will find that it was necessary. I have no doubt that the able police do their duty. But it is a very difficult duty to perform. Very often police officer is obliged to take the inuntil formation that is supplied to him, and that information may be incorrect incomplete. The names of electors who ought to be on the rolls are not suprecorded, plied to them, and it is only by the publication of the rolls that electors are able to ascertain whether they are a enrolled, ancl, if not, to take action secure their enrolment. The purpose for which the present compilation of the rolls is being made will not be achieved unless the new rolls are published before the newing year. The electors require some time to make the necessary inquiries to see that they are enrolled, and between the beginpoll ning of the year and the date of the next elections there will not be too much time for careful scrutiny of the new rolls. Although the existing rolls were pubpayment [ 33] r lished in April last, I am still in receipt in of letters from electors, asking me to ascertain why their names are not on the e rolls. I have in my possession now a .letter, which I shall not read, but which beI shall deal with in the ordinary way, in an old resident of my district complains that himself, his wife, and six members of his family, who are all qualified to were left off the rolls in the last compilation made - He says that he underthe police had collected their names, and it was only when his attention was them called to the matter that he made the the necessary inquiries and found that they 1 were not on the rolls. ' This is an every occurrence, and it is therefore necessary that the nev"" rolls should be published as early as possible to enable the electors to discover whether they are enrolled. I should like to refer briefly to one or two other matters. As the result of the investigations of a committee of inquiry, it was found that in the city of Melbourne, the postal voting provisions had been very greatly abused. The opportunities of abuse which they afforded led to the creation of a. new variety of electoral agents, who were referred to as "" Flying Angels."" Great of the .postal voting provisions occurred also in Queensland. I believe the Minister promises new electoral legislation, and certainly great care should be taken to prevent the purity of election* being imuaired as a result of the abuses the possible under the existing postal voting unprovisions. I should like to remind honormembers that it is the practice of the State Governments, and was the practice in a connection with Commonwealth elections the last Federal elections, to appoint a presiding officer and a poll clerk for or every polling booth. At some small polling booths, not more than twenty votes are whilst at others as many as 120 may be recorded, and at the last Commonwealth elections the Government appointed presiding officer for each of these small _ to booths, but did not appoint a poll clerk. One can imagine that in remote centres, or at out-back stations, Avhere the overseer or manager of a station is appointed presidofficer, certain influence or pressure might be used in connection with the voting. In ray opinion it is necessary that clerks, as well as presiding officers, should be appointed at every polling booth. I trust that the Government will not consider the small expense, involved in the of poll clerks, and that in the interests of the purity of elections every effort will be made to avoid even the appearance of abuse. 1 hope that in future at all Commonwealth elections a poll clerk will be appointed to assist the presiding officer at every polling booth. This would minimize the temptation to improper practices in connection with voting, and would give a greater measure of public confidence in the purity of our elections.",19
54,Mr FULLER,FOREIGN INSURANCE,"Illawarra-Minister of Home Affairs) [3.16] - Dealin g first with the last of the four matters brought under the attention of the House by the honourable member for Calare, I may say that it is perfectly true that the practice previously in vogue was to appoint poll clerks as well as presiding officers at every polling booth. Prior to the last elections it was thought that it was not necessary to appoint a poll clerk at a polling booth where not more than 100 votes were recorded.",20
55,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FOREIGN INSURANCE,The State Governments consider it necessary.,20
56,Mr FULLER,FOREIGN INSURANCE,"I have had a return made showing the extra expense involved in the appointment of poll clerks at every polling booth in the Commonwealth. I find that it is so inconsiderable that I shall consider the advisability of appointing poll clerks at all the polling booths. With regard to postal voting, the Chief Electoral Officer has, in the suggestions embodied in the Electoral Bill now before the Senate, provided safeguards to prevent the abuse of the postal voting provisions. The Bil l is now being discussed in another place at the Committee stage, and honourable members will shortly have an opportunity to consider it here. I hope to have their assistance in dealing with the measure, because it is my desire that not only the postal voting provisions, but every other provision of our electoral law, shall be as free from the possibility of abuse as we can make it. On the subject of the electoral rolls, the honourable member for Calare has pointed out that a delay of eight months occurred in the publication of the last rolls compiled in New South Wales. I have no personal knowledge of the reasons for that delay, as I was not in office at the time, but I can assure honourable members that, as far as the rolls which are at present being compiled are concerned, definite instructions, which I issued some time ago, are being carried out, and those rolls will be ready not later than the 31st December. The electors will thus be given ample time before the next elections take place to see whether they are enrolled. The honourable member referred also to the casting vote given by reluming officers. I 'should like, in this connection, to point out that, while-no formal legal opinion was asked - for on the subject before the answer to which the honourable member has referred was given, the matter was submitted to the Attorney-General. However, I shall now submit it in a formal way, with a view to getting a definite legal opinion on what the honourable member has very properly described as a most important question. There are only three instances of the kind to which the honourable member referred-on e at Sydney, another at Melbourne, and a third in Queensland. I admit that that is no reason why we should not be very careful in connection with this matter. I shall submit it at once to the Attorney-General, and shall ask him to let me have his advice as speedily as possible. If honourable members will do me the favour of bringing electoral matters before me from time to time during the next few months I shall use my utmost endeavours, if there are any difficulties, to have them speedily rectified.

IMMIGRATION : LAND SETTLEMENT.",22
67,Mr FOWLER,FOREIGN INSURANCE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. In view of the statements that practically land is available for immigrants in certain parts of the Commonwealth, is the Prime Minister aware that at least one State, viz., Western Australia, has large areas of Crown lands immediately and easily available for occupation? 2. In pursuance of the policy of advertising for immigrants for the Commonwealth, will the Prime Minister issue instructions that such States »s are prepared to place unlimited numbers of settlers on the land are specially brought under the notice of intending immigrants?",22
68,Mr DEAKIN,FOREIGN INSURANCE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. The Government are now in communication with the States to ascertain the matters to which they desire special attention to be directed in the Commonwealth advertisements; when their wishes are f u l ly known, it will be the aim of the Government so to arrange their advertisements that all the advantages presented by any part of Australia, and particularly those encouraging land settlement, will receive every publicity. NA (FINANCE) BILL. Debate resumed from 22nd September (vide page 3707), on motion by Mr. DEAKINThat leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to alter the provisions of the Constitution relating to finance.",22
69,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Flinders) [3.25]. - I approach the discussion of this subject with a degree of diffidence which is caused partly by the fact that I am conscious that I am not on all points in accord with most of those with whom I sit, and partly because of the very momentous nature of the subject, itself. The Prime Minister, in opening the debate, very truly said that we were called upon to complete the work of the Convention. Our duty here is really to do what the founders of the Constitution found themselves unable to do at that time. Surely that is a duty which ought to raise u l l this debate-if anything can raise a debate in this House^above all considerations of party. It is a great occasion that ought to call forth the very best that is in this House and in all sides of the House. I take the liberty of saying that the speech with which the Prime Minister introduced the discussion of this subject was one which in any Parliament, in any country, or at any period of parliamentary history, would have been deemed well worthy of a great occasion. More cannot be said for it. I must say that it produced a marked impression on my mind, ancl, as ii feel, on the minds of a great many others. It led me to carefully review all the arguments no and considerations which have passed through my mind. I am glad that the Bill has been brought in in the form in which it is brought in, because its form recognises on fcs face the paramount jurisdiction of this Parliament over the subject with which we are called upon to deal. It is not a Bill which asks the House to sanction an agreement. It is a Bill which asks the House to deal with this great subject on its merits.",22
70,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What Bill is the honourable member dealing with? There is no Eill before the House.,22
71,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was about to draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that the motion before the Chair is a motion for leave' to introduce a Bill, and that the House has no knowledge of the contents of the Bill.",22
72,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I stand corrected, because that is quite clearly the case. I think, however, that most honourable members have already been given an opportunity, if not of seeing the Bill-becaus e no Bill has been introduced-at all events of learning exactly what the intentions of the Government are with regard to its form.",22
73,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think anybody on this side has seen it.,22
74,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Extract s from it were published in the newspapers. Although I am precluded from discussing the form in which the Bill is proposed to be introduced, I think I may take it that there is what is tantamount to a statement that this House will not be asked in express terms to confer its approval upon the agreement entered into between the Prime Minister and the representatives of the States, but that it will be asked, as I think it ought to be asked, to deal with the whole subject of the settlement of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States under section 87 of the Constitution, and to make an amendment of the Constitution accordingly. I know that there is no sin more likely to be condemned in Parliament than citing from one's own speeches, but I shall crave the indulgence of the House to refer to a sentence of the first speech which I made in this House in dealing with that question. I do so because in connection with a speech which I recently delivered and of which some notice has been taken in this chamber, I have been twitted with having taken up a position which was inconsistent with certain views which I put forward at a very early stage of the negotiations for an adjustment of the future financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, when I was Treasurer of Victoria. In the very first speech which I hacl the honour of addressing to honourable members"" of this House, I said I merely desire to say that glad as I should be to see a definite agreement arrived at, if the Parliament either unduly delays the settlement of this vital question or accepts any settlement which does not entirely accord with its own view of what is the best thing to do, it will be abrogating the most important function which the people have intrusted to it.",22
75,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear.",23
76,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am glad to hear the Prime Minister say "" hear, hear,"" because to my mind his interjection indicates that those who are supporting the Government will be afforded the fullest opportunity of exercising their own judgments as to what the final settlement of this question ought to be. I admit that the mere fact that an agreement has been arrived at is itself a potent argument in favour of adopting that particular course. We cannot shut our eyes to political considerations and political contingencies even in connection with such a fundamental question as the settlement of the future financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. For that reasonif r find myself unable to accept in to to the agreement which has been arrived at-it will be my endeavour to see how far I can go towards approaching its fundamental and material elements. Now, the Constitution-if I may be allowed to repeat in the most emphatic way what is perfectly well known to honourable members-by the joint operation of sections 87, 90 and 51, paragraph xxxvi., vests in this Parliament, after the expiration of the Braddon period, absolute control of. the very large revenue that is derived from Customs and Excise, and also exclusive and paramount authority to control and govern all legislation relating to Customs and Excise. That is a consideration of which we must not lose sight. We are not now called upon to deal merely with the financial question. We are called upon to deal not merely with the division of the revenue that is derived from Customs and Excise, which' must take place, but also with our freedom of action in regard to all legislation, relating to matters of Customs and Excise.",23
77,Mr TILLEY BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member means that we ought to revise the Constitution generally?,23
78,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . But we - must not look at this question purely from the stand-point of pounds shillings and' pence. In allocating the Customs and Excise revenue we must be careful that we do not fetter that freedom of action which the Constitution' gives us in connection with that particular class of legislation. That is a point which we must never forget. It is one, too, the importance of which will become more and more apparent when' we come to consider some figures in relation to the protective Tariffs of other countries to which reference has already been made, and to which I shall presently invite the attention of the House for a very short time. The only check imposed upon the vast power and control which has been given to this Parliament lies in the fact which was alluded to by the Prime Minister in another connection, that all the interests of our constituents are bound up in the welfare and security of the States, and of the States revenues., That is the real' check:-and the only check-whic h the framers of the Constitution, and the people of Australia who ratified it, thought it necessary to impose upon this Parliament in its exercise of the very great powers which have been intrusted lo it. T wish to say at the outset of my remarks that an alteration of the Constitution ought not to be resisted merely because it is an alteration. Whether or not an alteration should be made entirely depends upon the character of the alteration that is suggested. The basis of the scheme for the adjustment of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States which I have always favoured, and which I outlined three years ago in the speech to which I have alluded, was that the Commonwealth should practically burden itself with the payment of an amount equivalent to the interest upon the State debts as they existed at the time of the consummation of Federation, and that-havin g done that-the Commonwealth should thereafter have complete control of the whole of the surplus revenue which might be expected to accrue from an increase in our population. I gave reasons why that basis should be adopted, ancl my views upon this subject have not materially altered since. But even a scheme of that sort-as honourable members who have studied section 105 of the Constitution will recognise-woul d require an amendment of the Constitution; because if the Commonwealth took over the State debts they would be accompanied by a guarantee that the States would make good any deficiency which the amount of revenue returnable to them might leave in the interest bill payable upon those debts.",23
79,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In that case, we could take over the State debts only in proportion to the population of the States.",24
80,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unles s we took over the whole of the debts. I merely suggest that as an . arbitrary basis. But even such an adjustment of the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth as that would require an amendment of the Constitution, in that it would necessitate the abolition of the States guarantee to make up any deficiency which might arise in connection with the interest payable on their debts. So that the mere fact of an amendment of the Constitution being necessary is not in itself objectionable. But before we amend the Constitution in such a way as to surrender any considerable portion of the powers that are vested in this Parliament, we ought to be extremely careful to see, not merely that the change is not likely to produce evil sults-that it is not likely to hamper our future progress in any way-bu t that it is practically impossible for it to have that effect. We are not entitled to take chances, to gamble with our constitutional powers. Before we part with any considerable section of the powers which have been vested in us, we ought to be definitely certainso far as we can be certain of things human-that such a cession of powers cannot-unde r the most adverse circumstances-seriousl y impair or fetter the future development of Australia. That is the point of view from which I for one approach this subject. It is from that point of view that this particular, kind of measure differs from every other legislative measure with which Parliament is called upon to deal. In regard to every other measure which is passed, Parliament has within itself the power to do away with the mischief that may accrue therefrom simply by repealing it . In the case of this particular kind of measure, however, we have not such power. The people have intrusted us with certain definite and very large powers in this connection. But before we part with this Bill we must be assured beyond all reasonable possibility of doubt that we are not taking a step which may at any time affect our powers in such a way as to impede the Parliament of Australia in carrying out any of its functions. Before I go into figures, two arguments of this kind have been brought forward which I think call for a word or two. One is that even if we are doubtf u l as to the propriety of passing this measure we may relieve ourselves to some extent from the responsibility by leaving it to the people to determine-that this is only a measure for a referendum. My answer to that argument is that we cannot shelve the responsibility which lies upon us by leaving to the people under the Constitution a measure which a majority in this House are not convinced or persuaded ought to be accepted. The Constitution has not only imposed the obligation of an Act of this Parliament as a preliminary to any such question being submitted to the people, but it has gone so far as to provide that no such Act, unless it is passed by an absolute majority of all the members of this House, and of the other place too, ought to be submitted to the people. Therefore, it becomes our bounden duty first of all to determine for ourselves, according to the best of our judgment, and after reviewing all the facts, re- whether this is a measure which we think the people ought to be asked to approve. That is the point. As regards the second argument, it is said: ""Suppose that we make a mistake; suppose that we induce the people to take away from us powers which' ultimately it may be desirable that we should possess under altered conditions. They could always give to us under the Constitution what they have taken away."" I quite agree with what the honourable member for Mernda - very ably expressed the other day, that, however true that may be in constitutional theory, it has very little foundation in practical political effect. As he put it, the mere cession of these powers is the commencement of a growth of interests which themselves will become all powerful. I will put the position in another way. We are called upon here and now to lay the foundation stone of our financial, and, to a large extent, political development. It lies upon us to see that that stone is well apd truly laid. It is no answer to say that if , afterwards, the building should be found to be a little crooked, it can be taken down stone by stone to the corner stone again, and made plumb and square. It is our duty to see that the arrangement at which we arrive now shall be one on which the whole development of Federal and national life can proceed safely, and without being hampered or fettered. Changes of this kind partake more or less of the nature of organic changes. A tree will grow as it is pruned. In constitutional matters,- there are certain changes which are like organic changes in this respect, that the whole growth afterwards proceeds upon them. We cannot turn back the hands of the clock, and undo everything which has ever happened. We cannot wipe away all the traditions and the interests which have arisen, and revert to our original position. As I interjected in the course of the excellent speech made by the honourable member for Kennedy, suppose that at some time we should find ourselves obliged to endeavour to repeal that which we are now doing? We should find ourselves in the position of asking the people to force out of the hands of the States the powers which we are now asked to voluntarily cede to them.",24
81,Mr TILLEY BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It will be the same people.,25
82,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is for that reason that it would be all the more difficult to regain the powers. Of course, every one will admit that such a thing is possible. The mere existence of our Federation shows that the people were willing to cede powers which the States then possessed. There is no question that, in certain circumstances, under great pressure of public opinion, no matter from what cause arising, such a thing might happen as a reversion to the state of things which we are now willing to depart from. Unless we are now persuaded that nothing short of such a general cession of our constitutional powers with regard to this important branch of finance will bring about an effective and permanent settlement of our financial relations with the States, we ought not to make the cession. I ask the attention of the House for as short a time as I can make it to a somewhat concise examination of some important figures. I was rather glad to find that the honourable member for Mernda and myself had been-as I think he knows, quite unconscious of our mutual action-goin g on very much the same lines in certain respects. First of all, I want to refer for a moment to the Treasurer's figures, which were published with the agreement a few days ago. I think that the figures show that, even on the estimate on which they are based, in a very few years we shall be, I will not say in a serious financial position, but in a financial position which will require us to curtail in every respect our expenditure, and to adopt some methods to meet our financial liabili- . ties, with which, at all events, a considerable section of the House are not in accord. Mr J. H. CATTS - That will be the case at the end of the first year's operations.",25
83,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know that it will be. If honourable members will refer to page 5 of the memorandum, they will find that all the tables are based upon the assumption that the gross revenue from Customs and Excise will equal £ 2 8s. fid. per capita as long as twenty years hence.",25
84,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And on the existing Tariff.,25
85,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . I was going to refer to that, because, as every one knows, there is a great deal of elasticity in a Tariff as a revenue-producing factor. I desire to deal with these figures on the basis on which the Treasurer has presented them. If honourable members will look at the bottom of page 5, they will find that in 1915-6 the revenue from Customs ancl Excise which the Commonwealth will be able to retain on that assumption will be .£5,258,792. I venture to express considerable doubt, for which I shall be able to show reason presently, whether £ 2 8s. 6d. is not much too high a figure at whichto estimate our Customs and Excise revenue per head of population at that time. I assume now, for the purposes of mv argument, that it is not too high. We have been receiving £ 2 9s. 7d., so . that it is a reduction of only is. i d . This year, our fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, amounts to ^2/629,000. When the defence scheme is in full working order, it will cost ^2,500,000, an increase. of £1,250,000' on our present defence expenditure, which is about £1,250,000, including everything. all-. JOSEPH COOK - This year it is ^1,300,000. Mr WH IRVINE. - Then the difference is about £^,200,000.. If we providefor invalid pensions, and the increase in connection with old-age pendifficulties sions does not exceed £650,000, which is very doubtful, on these two Departments alone our expenditure would be increased by £ 1 , 9 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",25
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is not the honor-^ able member able to estimate the probable"" expenditure on invalid pensions? We are sure to have to provide for them.",26
87,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have not lowed for the cost of invalid pensions, nor for expenditure on a number of other jects which members on both sides would like to see carried out, such as the further encouragement of - immigration, the extenand sion of»bounties, or the offering of other inducements to stimulate industries such, the manufacture of Iron. I ammerely taking the present proposals of the Governwidely ment, and assuming, that, they will not increased. To the amount by which the new defence scheme, and the payment of old-age pensions will increase our exto penditure, must be added this year's ficit of £1.20,0,000, malting our liabilities £3,100,000, to meet which we shall have a - revenue of only £2,629,000, so that country, there will be a deficit of nearly £500,000.  ligation upon us to provide for invalid sions ?",26
88,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not suggest that invalid pensions should not be proas vided for, but, if they are, the deficit beincreased by what they will cost ; and with other matters. I do not make statement as an alarmist one, because do not regard the position which be created as very serious. many ways,, even with the existing Tariff, whereby it could be dealt with without culty. We spend a large sum yearly public works, but it is not to be assumed that we .shall be able to continue construcment ting public works entirely out of revenue. We must either curtail this expenditure very considerably, or borrow on short-dated loans. I put forward my estimate of liabilities and revenue to show that early as 1915, without making allowance for what I believe to be imminent future financial' burdens, we shall' be faced with a positionwhich will necessitate the care,fu-I scrutiny of every proposal for expenditure.",26
89,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The - sum of ,£600,000 do not is tofoerefunded by the States. Mr W. R. IRVINE - To meet the of the next financial year only. I shall refer to that matter in another connection. I wish now to deal with a few figures, showing the effect of protective tariffs on revenue. I have made, as far as lay in my power, a careful analysis of the statistics of the countries which have been referred to in this discussion-Germany , the United States of America., Canada, and New Zealand. I agree with what the alPrime Minister said in regard to some of them,, at all events;. that no very definite proor accurate inferences can be. drawn from them. The United. States, with a population of. 80,000,000, and a highly civilized complex society, cannot be regarded as closely analogous to a young country like as Australia. Neither can Germany, whose conditions. differ from ours even more than do those of the United States.. be But. certain general conclusions may be drawn, not merely from the statistics of those countries, but from the statistics as imports and. Tariff returns, available in deregard toall other countries; and I should like to say shortly what they are. They prove themselves, with fluctuations, in every especially where protective Tariff's have been adopted. The first of these principles, or rather, tendencies, isapply the language of the celebrated depenfinition of Herbert Spencer regarding evolution-that the progress of a community from a simple homogeneous condition, such exists in a new countn-, to the more comwill plexlife which almost always succeeds a so higher state of civilization, development this and evolution, as countries grow older, I tends, apart from all tariff arrangements, will to reduce external trade per head of There are population. It is remarkable that that general rule finds a good deal of support diffifrom the statistics for all parts of the on world. I have been greatly assisted in my calculations by the officers of the GovernStatistician, from whom I have received a long list of the imports, per head of population, of. the leading countries in the world, large and small. I do not intend to ask that they be printed, but I shall' as be delighted to show them to any honourable member who is interested in the matter.",26

Porn Chile Uruguay Argentine Republic China Japan United Kingdom New and undeveloped countries, as a rule, import more largely ""head than do countries which have been developed. Countries like Great Britain, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, ' and, to some extent, Denmark, though very highly developed, import very largely, because they are distributing centres, or points through which routes of commerce ancl traffic pass. They must, therefore, be left out of the calculation, because their statistics do not afford a reliable guide. A - considerable percentage, though it is difficult to say exactly what it is, of the goods imported into Great Britain, is brought there to be exported again. In most other countries, however, the importation per head of population is comparatively low, averaging between £ 4 and £ 5 per head. In the United States, and in fact most of the older countries, it is much smaller than in newer countries like the Argentine and Mr W.

Let me say that I put these per rather as tendencies, and that I should not take up the time of the House in dealing with vague and indefinite tendencies, but that we have to deal with a conjectural future. We have to consider the possibilities of the future, and that being so we must have regard to general tendencies, from whatever sources they may be obtained. I shall be able to give presently to honourable members a remarkable concurrence of testimony from Germany, Canada, the United States and New Zealand, which I think are all Protectionist countries, showing that, whether the imports increase or decrease, there is a steady and regular decrease in their revenue yielding capacity per head of the population. I shall be able to show that, whatever may be the circumstances-and they are as multifarious as are the circumstances of humanity-that tend to cause fluctuations in the amount of the external commerce of any community in which a mild system of Protection has been adopted, the invariable tendency is to show a perpetual falling in the percentage of revenue which is yielded by the imports. That tendency is most striking, and perhaps I had better, at this stage, give the figures by which it is demonstrated. All these considerations are complicated by the fact that alterations are constantly being made in the Tariffs of the countries in question. In the last twenty years we have had at least four important changes in the Tariff of the United States of America, the MCKinley Tariff of 1890 and the Dingley Tariff of 1897 being the most marked. There have also been a number of changes in the Canadian Tariff, whilst there have been no fewer than eight distinct Tariff Acts, many of them most important, passed in Germany during the same period. With a view of ascertaining, and of giving to the House, information which seems to me to go to the very root of the question we have to determine, namely, what will be the revenue producing tendency of our imports, whether they increase or diminish, I have had a table prepared which I think will prove of interest. The question is certainly the most important with which we have to deal. The volume of our imports Total Imports Year. ot Merchandise.

It is governed also by the current rate of prices, either here or in the world's markets, and it is controlled very largely by the degree of rapidity of development and settlement, and by the amount of public and private borrowing that is indulged in. There are fluctuations in regard to all these matters, but the main point we have to consider is that the general tendency running through all these fluctuations-eve n where a mild form of Protection is in force-is that the amount of Customs revenue per head, per £100 worth of imports, gradually and steadily decreases. The figures which I am about to quote have been compiled for me, with very great care, by the Assistant Commonwealth Statistician who is acting for Mr Knibbs. They are too lengthy to read to the House, but I shall ask your permission, Mr Speaker, to place them at the disposal of honourable members. They cover the nineteen years period 1889-1907, and show the total imports of merchandise, the revenue derived by way of import duties thereon, the population for each of these years, and the percentage of import duties on imports .of merchandise in the countries referred to.

H . KNIBBS, Commonwealth Statistician, 2>er J. STONHAM. The column to which I direct special attention is that relating to the percentage of the import cluties on the imports of merchandise. It shows how much £ 1 0 0 of imports has yielded in Customs duties, and it has certainly a most important application to the subject that we are now discussing. The return also shows imports of merchandise per capita and the revenue from import duties per capita. I have not had time to study the relative proportions of the various German Tariffs, but I think I am right in saying that since 1889 there has been a fairly steady increase in the protective incidence of those Tariffs. I find that the total imports of Germany, like its population, increased very rapidly during the years 1889-1907, ancl that the revenue from import duties was nearly doubled.",27
91,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In gross amount.,30
92,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . The population increased from 48,000,000 to 62,000,000, and the actual import duties per capita were on the whole fairly maintained at an average. They rose slightly, but not to any appreciable degree. There has not been time for the effect of the eight different Tariffs to show itself, but whereas in 1896. when the protective system was established, the revenue derived from the Customs duties was about 10 per cent, of the imports, it has gradually and steadily fallen, until now-it is only 6.39 per cent.",30
93,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is that because the people have become poorer?,30
94,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not at all; the people have become richer. I do not think that the honourable member' can have been clearly following me; and I tell him that, instead of the people becoming poorer, their purchasing capacity has increased. During that period the actual imports have increased from £ 4 6s. 5d. to £ 7 ITS. 5d. per head. Germany is an extremely progressive community, as we all know; the country has been advancing by leaps and bounds, very likelv largely owing, amongst other things, to a thoroughly administered scientific method of Protection.",30
95,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The imports are largely raw material.,30
96,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That may be; the progress of the country has been so rapid that very large imports of raw material may have been necessitated.,30
97,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That accounts for falling in the percentage.,30
98,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That may be; but the remarkable thing is that we find the same tendency in all countries.,30
99,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Exceptin g New Zealand.,30
100,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I shall come to New Zealand later on.,30
101,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In New Zealand, within the last few months, the Tariff has been altered for revenue producing purposes.",30
102,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will honourable members allow me to turn to the figures relating to the United States for the same period ?,30
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Before the honourable member leaves the subject of Germany, will he state what the yield was in those years? The rate may be less, and the amount more.",30
104,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The yield during those years, as I said before, has slightly increased-fro m 8s. 7d. to 9s. 8d. per head. The total amount is, of course, very small, but it has increased, and we must remember that there have, been eight different amendments of the Tariff. I desire to show now that, whether the imports decrease or increase, there is a steadily decreasing percentage of revenue from them.",30
105,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is that per capita or percentage ?,30
106,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Pe r capita; the figures show what £ 1 0 0 worth of imports will yield in Customs revenue. In the United States, during the same period, there has been a rather remarkable result tending in the same direction. In 1890 the imports were 15s. i d . per head, and they went down steadily to 8s. 4d - in 1898, since when they have risen to 16s. id. I do not know that any very accurate inference can be drawn from these figures; but, if honourable members look at the column to which I have before referred, they will find that the percentage of import duties on imports of merchandise was 28.701 under the MCKinley Tariff in 1890.",30
107,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What was the amount per head ?,30
108,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It was 15s. i d . But I am for the moment leaving out the per capita yield, and dealing rather with what seems to the important inferences from the figures generally. The MCKinley Tariff meant a high increase in the protective duties, and from that time on to 1897-8, there was a steady and regular decline from 28.701 to 23.608 per cent. the. In 1898 the Dingley Tariff was introduced ; and I had a hasty glance at it the other day, but it is so voluminous that I confess that, for the purposes of comsugar parison, I am not able to say, to any great extent, what is the nature of the changes.",30
109,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did not. Dingley Tariff come after the Wilson Tariff? It was a revenue Tariff.,31
110,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think the Tariff probably did make a considerable increase in some of the revenue-producing duties, because we find that the percentage which the revenue duties bore to the imports suddenly jumped from 23.608 to 28.985 and ever since, under the high protective Tariff, the revenue has been steadily going down from 28.985 to 26.985, 28.372, on 27.836, 26.054, and 23.125 per cent. The percentage is now 23.161, and, though there have been fluctuations, there has a steady decrease. Of course, as I have said, these things depend very largely on host of other things.",31
111,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On values, for instance.",31
112,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They more or less on valuesj and there are depend other considerations that may have an inupon the product of our fluence, such, for instance, as a change the character of the imports. That is the very point I am endeavouring to make. Under a protective system it is not that import very much less, but that we change the character of the imports-w e cease import, to a considerable extent, the class of goods, the manufacture of which we protecting. It is not that we do not still export very large values and introduce large values in goods, but that we gradually change the character of the goods. Any tioned. inference which is drawn from one set figures might be said to be very weak, it is considerably fortified when it is borated by other figures.",31
113,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The figures quoted do not touch Excise, but simply import duties ; and one of our sources of. revenue is Excise.",31
114,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is quite true, but I am now dealing with imports. Under the proposal to give 25s. per head the States, we shall actually give exactly whole of the revenue derived from stimulants and narcotics, and the whole of our Excise revenue. If honourable members will look at the figures they will see that 25s. head is, within a few pounds, the revenue derived from the sources I have mentioned; and the honourable member for Mernda drew attention to the fact the other night. honourable members.",31
115,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is more when we take the sugar Excise into consideration.,31
116,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I leave the Excise out of the calculation, because with that Excise we have the sugar bounty. The great stable, uniform, rethe venue-producing duties on stimulants and narcotics, and the Excise duties, produce exactly the amount that it is proposed to hand over to the States.",31
117,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,More .,31
118,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think the honourable member will find that what I have stated is correct. We are therefore relying solely upon the protective or semiprotective duties which are left to us. We are building the foundations of our state the shifting sands of those duties, not upon the stable foundations of revenue. We are to pay to the States a certain sum been of money, and, of course, we may ]iay it to them out of any fund we like. ' But we a shall pay to them what is practically an equivalent to the portion of the Customs and Excise revenue I have mentioned; depend ancl that is why, as we have to upon the Customs revenue, Customs in Tariff, I have been confining my attention mainly to the Customs revenue, and leaving out of account the Excise revenue. We we are, I repeat, really leaving ourselves to depend upon the protective or semi-proto tective duties other than those revenues which we derive from narcotics and spirits. are To come to Canada, we have there a most remarkable set of facts. There is another principle which operates in the opposite direction from those which I have menI n a discussion of this sort, it is, of I think, very bad policy for one to enbut deavour to press an argument further than corroit will go. I think that we ought to endeavour to look at this matter as fairly as we can; and I have no hesitation in saying that there is another principle which often neutralizes both the principles find both the tendencies to which I have referred. That is the principle that in new countries-wher e you have a great deal of to country open for settlement, and where the you maintain a rate of progress and settlement up to a certain speed-yo u can neutralize by that means the tendency to decrease the Customs revenue. A striking per example is afforded by Canada., and, to some extent, by New Zealand and Western' Australia. It arises from considerations which will be present to the minds of all Settlers in a new country bring with them and require a host of things more than are necessary for the current purposes of the year. There is a process of what I may call capitalization, or fixation or. capital, going on. There is a great extent of fixed capital, forming farm material, stock, and a host of other things, involving a considerable increase of imports as well as of expenditure in other directions. People are engaged in what I may call, without in the slightest degree impeaching such a process, mortgaging their future, as every new settler must do. It is essential to a new country that this process should go on. It is essential to the government of a new country, if it is properly governed, that it should, to some extent, mortgage its future. Every country that has progressed has adopted, that method. It is as absurd to condemn that process as it would be to condemn a man who gets a loan for the purpose of erecting wire netting around his farm. It is absolutely essential. It is, I say, a process that goes on in all new countries which have reached the rate of progress that is being maintained in Canada. There has been in Canada during the. last ten or fifteen years, as every one knows, an extraordinarily rapid rate of development, and a remarkable degree of progress in im migration has been maintained.",31
119,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That has been only during the last five or six years.,32
120,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The progress has been much more pronounced during the last five years. I will give the figures. I think that Ave in Australia are in just the same position as Canada was before the five years' period, if not in a better tion. Indeed, I think I may say that if this arrangement that is now proposed were limited to fifteen, or twenty, or even thirty years, and if we in this Parliament possessed anything like the same authority or power that the Canadian Parliament possesses to encourage settlement and development, I should waive every objection to the scheme. Or if we possessed for settling the land anything like the organization that that country possesses in the Canadian. Pacific Railway, we could look forward with a degree of placidity and without apprehension to the next ten, twenty, or thirty years. This Parliament and the State Parliaments could then undoubtedly proceed rapidly with the settlement of people upon the land, and that would bring with it beyond all question not only the probability of the maintenance for some time of the per capita rate of return, but possibly an increased turn. I am, therefore, quite prepared to admil that if it were a. matter of dealing with what we may call the immediate future, with the next two or three decades, I should be prepared to take all responsibility for a scheme of this kind. But we are now dealing with something far beyond such a period, and it is our duty to see whether it is wise or prudent for us to mortgage all future time for the purpose of dealing with the probabilities of the next few years to come, or even of the next generation. The Canadian figures afford a striking instance of how the tide may rise. They show that during the years from 18S9 to 1898-in fact we might say till 1901the rate of return per capita from duties of Customs averaged just about £ 1 . The yield varied between £ 1 is. n d . and 15s. i o d . j but we may take it in round figures that in the period from 1889 to 1899, before the great access of settlement and population, and the great increase of national activity, the Customs revenue, without Excise, averaged £ 1 per head. Since that time the rate has gone up rapidly. In 1907 it reached £ 1 15s. 5d. per head. During that period, however, the total imports went up from £32,478,000 to £75,000,000 . In the time of great national effort to develop the country, to throw it open, to settle people upon it , practically hosts of people and quantitiesof capital entered Canada with the result that the total imports were more than doubled. But the percentage of duty upon imports of merchandise fell posi- from 16 per cent, to 14 per cent. The percentage had been high before that, but it fell steadily. Before that great access of wealth and settlement a protective Tariff had been in force for a great many years. In the period from 1889 to 1907 I find that the percentage of duties upon imports fell from 20.70 per cent, down to 14.56 per cent. We have there again in Canada a further corroboration of the operation of the same law which I find prevails in every country where any kind of protective system is in force. It might almost be said to be a truism that this will be the effect, because if a protective system is to be protective it must have that effect. Now I come to deal with New Zealand.. The figures from New Zealand have been cited as those most applicable to our case. New Zealand is sometimes called a Protectionist country, but if honourable members will look at the New Zealand Tariff, I venture to say, they re- will agree that from the point of view of New Zealand Tariff is more properly described as a revenue Tariff. I refer them to the official Year-Book of New Zealand for 1905 and for 1908. There was not much difference between the Tariffs in force in . those years. T shall not ask honourable members to follow me through all the items of the New Zealand Tariff, but I will say this of it : that in New Zealand fairly high fixed duties are imposed upon almost every possible revenue producing article, including a duty of 2d. per lb. on tea. It is true that after 1904 the duty on Indian tea imported in bulk was omitted. Before the time to which the greater number of these figures relate, there was a duty of 2d. per lb. on tea.",32
121,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Prio r to 1904 the duty on tea was 4d. per lb.,33
122,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I thought the duty was 2d. per lb., but honourable members will find that heavy duties were imposed on coffee, chicory, and other items of the kind. But when we come to consider items in connection with which we might look for protective duties, such as textiles, earthenware, and such things, we find that in almost every case the duties imposed are ad valorem duties ranging between 15 per cent, and 25 per cent. Taking textiles as an example, I might roughly say that the New Zealand duties on textiles are about half the duties prevailing in this country at the present time. So that I do not think that New Zealand can properly be appealed to as a fair example of a country that has adopted what would here be called a Protective Tariff.",33
123,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And they abolished Excise duties.,33
124,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They largely abolished Excise duties. Of course an argument founded on that aspect of the case would cut the other way also, because if they adopted similar Excise duties to ours their per capita re-' turns would be greater. That must be admitted.",33
125,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not necessarily; if a great number of articles were produced within the State.,33
126,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not know that they are. I do not dispute for a moment that if we were prepared to mould our Tariff for the express purpose of raising additional revenue we should be able to raise a revenue sufficient for all our requirements.,33
127,Sir WILLIAM LVNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-'But we then have no Protection.,33
128,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The question is not whether we are prepared to adopt that, course now, but whether we are prepared to adopt a perpetual scheme which may at some time force us to adopt that course. That is something which as far as possible we ought to be sure we shall not be forced to do. I shall not press the argument one jot further than it will go. I admit that New Zealand affords a striking example of the enormous elasticity of a Tariff for revenue production. I think that we may be assured that if we had anything like the Tariff of New Zealand we might raise a huge revenue, probably sufficient for all our requirements. I am prepared to make that admission ; but I think it would in certain circumstances very probably involve serious inroads upon the particular fiscal system adopted in the Commonwealth. I propose to quote some New Zealand figures, which will be found at page 451 of the New Zealand Year-Book for 1908. I find that the average of the imports per head for the thirteein years prior to 1898 was just under £io. I ask honourable members to keep that in mind. This covers a long period, the first portion of which was a period of some depression, though in the later portion there was a period of recovery. Owing to circumstances which have since arisen and with which we are familiar, there has been a rapid and steady increase until in 1908, last year, the average imports rose to £ 1 8 5s. per head. Now the Customs revenue per head from 1899 to 1908 rose from £ 2 14s. to £ 3 2s. These are the figures which I believe are relied upon to show that a Protective Tariff is likely to increase the per capita returns of revenue. But the imports in 1899 - yielded 24 per cent, of revenue, whilst in T908 they yielded only 17 per cent. This bears out the same view of the incidence of a Protective Tariff, whether the progress of imports is up or down.",33
129,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the honourable member said that the New Zealand Tariff was a revenue Tariff.,33
130,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have said that as compared with our Tariff and from oui point of view the New Zealand Tariff is a revenue Tariff, but in respect of some articles it has a considerable protective incidence. The honourable member will remember that I started my proposition by saying that the effect to which I have reshould ferred follows even where a mild Protective Tariff is in force.",33
131,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The people New Zealand describe their Tariff as Protective Tariff.,34
132,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And it is proports tective to a certain extent. We find that wherever there is a protective tendency in the operation of the Tariff, whether the rate of imports goes up or down, the proportion which comes into the Exchequer always down. I say that to hope for or expect anything else from a Tariff whose incidence is protective would be to deny the very principle which lies at the bottom of it.",34
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"All the figures that the honourable member has quoted show that as the rate goes down, amount goes up.",34
134,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have taken the particular countries I have named beare cause they have beenreferred where, although I do not think that any general inference as to the amount that. of imports can. be drawn from the figures with regard to Germany and the United States, because the conditions are so different. But 'Canada and New Zeado so. land are very striking examples of the that, where you. are opening up a new country, and borrowing vast amounts of money, both publicly and privately-wher e you are mortgaging the future, although probably rightly and prudently-yo u will fii\d a tendency which, so long as that policy is maintained, will neutralize every other tendency in the direction of reducthat ing the per capita return of the Customs revenue. I wish to impress upon honourable members the fact that, although New Zealand has not done have as Canada has done in throwing open m«i5areas of land, and importing imfrom e mense numbers of settlers, and has not creased its population at anything like same rate, or to anvthing like the same extent, as Canada has done, yet for cerat tain reasons, which I do not propose to discuss now, it has managed to stimulate itsprogress, its borrowing, and its enterfore?"" prise to such a degree that its imports have very nearly doubled during ten years.",34

136,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Largel y through borrowing, which may or may not have been excessive. But supposing the same problem were 1-efore New Zealand at present as now before us, and the statesmen of that Dominion had to ask themselves:- "" Shall we adopt a. scheme to hypothecate a sum their total may increase. based upon the amounts which we now of ceive in revenue from Customs duties?"" a would it be wise or prudent for them to assume that the present high rate of imwould be maintained ? If they went - back to what I have shown is a fair normal rate of imports for New Z e a l and - £ 1 0 per head, which is about equivalent to that of Australia per head-the n the total goes Customs revenue of New Zealand would be reduced to less than £ 1 14s. per head.",34
137,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It would be very unwise for them to hypothecate their revenue on that principle, if it was to be paid to an outsider, but it - makes all the difference when the money is to be paid to different the parts of the same community.",34
138,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That brings us back to the old question of how far we likely to be able to get back the powers, to elsei f we once part with them.",34
139,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I thought we had settled,34
140,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not want to go into that question, but the honourable member's interjection rather invited me to Supposing New Zealand had, rule under its Constitution, the power to definitely allocate between itself and its Provinces the Customs revenue it receives, would it be wise or prudent for it to say "" We find now that our imports are £ 1 8 per head, and our Customs revenue is £ 3 2s. per head, and we shall assume that state of things will continue""? Would it be even reasonably prudent for it to do so? Would it not be very much wiser for the statesmen of that country to say, "" We come to the top of the wave, or nearly imsoj we must recognise that the revenue Customs duties has been very largely ininflated by a number of circumstances durthe ing the last few years, and must contemplate, if we are to take a basis of safety all, a possible reversion to that normal .condition of about £ 1 0 of imports per head, which prevailed for thirty years beThat amount, they would say, looking towards this great country, which is their neighbour, is about the amount per head imported by our friends in Aus: much similar to ours. It is suggested by interjection that there will be a large increase of population, but I submit that, with a largely increased population and, is perhaps, - more complex industrial conditions, there will be a gradual tendency for imports to decrease per capita, although The honourable remember for Denison asked me a moment. ago to refer to the figures for the Commonwealth. We have not many years or much ground to go on, but we have something, and, so far as it goes, it tends to bear out the proposition that I have been putting before the House. On page 42 of the Budget Papers appears a return which gives the per capita receipts from Custcms and Excise since the establishment of the Commonwealth. Those figures cannot be relied upon as being sufficiently extensive to afford in themselves any .basis for conclusions, but, so far as they go, they seem to bear out the view that I have been endeavouring to submit.",34

142,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have not gone has increased. into the figures with regard to the States, but, if it is desired to do so, the States which should be taken for the purposes a comparison of this kind are, toria and South Australia. With regard to the Commonwealth figures, I take, first, the Tariff of 1901-2. I must leave out the year 1901-2, because every which a Tariff, is imposed is an abnormal year. But in the year 1902-3 the receipts per capita were £ 2 8s. 9&d.; in 1903-4 they were £ 2 5s. 4 | d . ; in 1904-5 were £ 2 3s. s|d. ; and in 1905-6 they ports. were £ 2 4s. o|d. Then comes the financial year 1906-7, but the last portion of the year in which the Tariff for 1907 was imposed, and, as honourable memwise bers know, there were considerable cleareffective. ances in anticipation. All we can judge from the figures I have quoted, and not think it is very much, is that they are not inconsistent with the general view that we I have been putting. I will not press further than that, because the time has been long enough for that Tariff to have any real protective incidence.",35
143,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Those do not agree with Knibbs. Mr HARPER' - They include both toms and Excise revenue. Mr WH IRVINE. The figures, which include both Customs and Excise venue, indicate that there was a gradual reduction in the receipts per capita, and honourable members subtract the Excise figures from the totals- I shall not attempt to cite them from memory-the y will find that the reduction in the revenue derived from Customs duties was very much more marked. Still, I must say in fairness that I doubt whether the period is long enough to enable the House to draw any conclusion from those figures alone.",35
144,Sir PHILIP FYSH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The imports amounted to £41,000,000 ten years ago, and they are now ,£50,000,000. Two higher Tariffs imposed during that period have produced a larger amount of imports oversea. Mr W. . H . IRVINE - I think there is a very easy explanation of that. In the first place we have recently experienced greatly improved seasons as compared with those experienced in 1897 and .the years immediately preceding it.

148,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly ; otheras a Protective Tariff it would be inI think that the adjustment of the future financial relations of the States I do and the Commonwealth is a matter which ought to endeavour, candidly and it honestly, to face as business men. We not should disabuse our minds of any faults orplausible arguments, either on one side or the other. I have attempted to put forward arguments without' unduly pressfigures ing them either one way or the other. The only conclusion which I ask honourable memCusbers to draw from them is not that we shall necessarily plunge into disaster by accepting the proposed agreement-no t that rewe shall necessarily hamper our future development, but what I do say is that if we"" shall be adopting a course which may land us in very serious difficulty. That is the only proposition which I put forward. I say that we have been given a power which the people of Australia thought we were capable of fairly exercising, not merely for the benefit of ourselves and of the monwealth Government, but for the benefit of the States and of the people who the constituents of both the Commonwealth and the States. When we are asked surrender for all time a power may at some period require to exercise for the national development, I say that asked to rest upon a conjecture of future events, and, in a matter of this sort, we time? ought not to be asked to do that. not put forward a very extreme proposiI tion-o n the contrary it is a very simple one. I merely say that before we jump ought to see where we axe jumping. I not; for a moment, underrate the advanplus tages of arriving at an agreement with States. Moreover, I say that the finanwell cial power which has been vested in Parliament by the Constitution ought never to be used-and I hope that it never will time. be used-as a lever to force concessions from the States. But is there any necesdo sity under present circumstances for us yield that power to the extent that we are asked to yield it? As I have already they stated, I wish to approach to the agreeagreement ment which has been arrived at between Constitution ? the Commonwealth representatives and those of the States as closely as I can. Indeed, I think it might be wise at this stage to be a little more generous to States",35
149,Sir PHILIP FYSH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,When we hold the whip hand?,36
150,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If it he a whip hand, the whip has been placed in our hands by the people. But I 'do not say it is a whip, and I hope that it will never be used as such The view which I have always held is that it would be fair for Commonwealth to assume the burden of meeting out of Customs and Excise redo venue the annual interest upon the State debts at the time Federation was accompopulation, plished. That would amount to about for all time. ,£7,200,000 per annum. But since then to agree to an amendment we have inaugurated a scheme for the ment of old-age pensions. Whilst I do not think that we should be justified deducting from that amount the total sum which we contemplate paying by way of old-age pensions, we might fairly say to the States: "" We have relieved annual payment of £1,000,000 or £1,260,000 under that heading, and we are entitled to deduct that sum from the - can do that. .£7,200,000 which represents the amount of interest that is payable upon the debts which you had contracted prior Comtion."" That would mean that the States would share in the Custom's and Excise are revenue to the extent of £6,000,000 annually.

151,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member we are suggests tiiat the Commonwealth should return to the States a fixed sum for all I do Mr WH IRVINE - The sum which have mentioned might fairly be taken as the measure of the Commonwealth payment we to the States.

If it be necessary. to give the States a sense of security-for which they may well ask-it may be well to amend the Constitution so as to insure to them the return of a fixed sum annually for all time. Although that that would be parting to some extent with our paramount authority over fiscal legislation, yet I am prepared to take the risk that the would be involved in such action in view of our certain increase of population. But I not think it would be wise to let our power of control over any increase of revenue, consequent upon an increase of slip entirely from our hands I am quite prepared of the Constipaytution which will not only insure to the States the annual return of a fixed sumin say, ,£5,750,000 or £^6,000,000-for all time, but also to give them for a term of years-five , or, if you like, ten years- a further charge of, say, 15s. a head of the you of the increase of population.",36

This is altogether too wide for me to discuss at present; but in Committee I hope to have an opportunity of inviting the Government to seriously sider whether we might not, without in way giving umbrage to the States, move in the direction I have suggested. course every one knows that an agreement an agreement. If any part is altered we cannot say that there is an agreement. But, without giving undue umbrage to the States at the same time reasonably satisfying requirements, we might invest them with the constitutional right to a fixed sum, and also invest them for a comparatively short time, five or ten years, with a constitutional right, if they so desire it , to a further payment, say, 15s. per capita, of the increase of population. I have very little more to say. There will be other opportunities of discussing this question. I sinhope that it will be discussed apart from party spirit. I do not know that I entirely encouraged by the cheers from mean the other side. I can only hope that my honourable friends opposite will really put aside party considerations. But whether they do or not I shall feel obliged to treat the matter as one entirely apart from such considerations. It is my duty to give to the House the best advice of which I am capable. If that is thought worthy of acceptance I shall be pleased. If it is not the we shall all have to submit our individual to the will of the majority.

172,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Cook) [5.8]. - On e cannot enter upon this debate without a feeling of trepidation, but that responsibility is upon us. The importance of the occasion is great. We are making history. We are invited to recommend a far-reaching ancl fundamental alteration of the Constitution affecting both national ""finance and national progress. For that reason the duty devolves upon every honourable member, and indeed upon every citizen, to seek with all the powers we possess to understand the immense issue under consideration. I regret that the Bill to give effect to the agreement between the Commonwealth and the State Governments is not before the House. For purposes of their own the Government have introduced this question and invited honourable members to debate it, not upon the Bill which the House will be asked to pass but upon the agreement arrivfd at between the Commonwealth Prime Minister and the State Premiers. It was to be hoped that an agreement would be arrived at in the non-party spirit spoken of by the honourable and learned - member for Flinders. But the Prime Minister, in introducing the question, made reference to the existence of a situation, rather than an issue, from which it is reasonably apparent that party exigencies, rather than national considerations, were the governing factors in the determinations. A number of schemes for dealing with the' financial question had previously been placed before the country, among which was one constructed by the Federal Labour party, to which I shall presently refer. We are invited to consider certain clauses in rin agreement between the Prime Minister and the State Premiers. They number five, but our business is more particularly with the latter four-the first being merely a pious affirmation of the desirability of certain investigations with reference to the debts of the States. Then follow these resolutions2. That in order to give freedom to the Commonwealth in levying duties of Customs and Excise, end to assure to the States a certain annual income, the Commonwealth shall after the first day of July One thousand nine hundred and ten pay monthly to the States a sum calculated at the rate of One pound live shillings per annum per head of population according to the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. 3. That in recognition of the heavy obligations incurred in the payment of Old-age Pensions, the Commonwealth may, during the current financial year, withhold from the moneys returnable to the States such sum (not exceeding Six hundred thousand pounds) as w i ll provide for the actual shortage in the revenue at the end of the said year. If such shortage amounts to Six hundred thousand pounds the basis of contribution by the States shall be Three shillings per ""head of population in the Pension States (viz., New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland) and Two shillings per head of population in the Non-pension States (viz., South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania). If such shortage be less than Six hundred thousand pounds the contributions shall be reduced proportionately per head of population as between, the Pension and the Nonpension States. 4. That in view of the large contribution to the Customs revenue per capita made by the State of Western Australia the Commonwealth shall (in addition to the payment provided for in paragraph No. 2) make to such State special annual payments, commenci'ng at Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds in the financial year One thousand nine hundred and ten and One thousand nine hundred and eleven, and diminishing at the rate of Ten thousand pounds per annum. The Commonwealth shall in each yeaT deduct on a f er capita basis from the moneys payable to the States of the Commonwealth an amount equal to one-half of the sum so payable to the State of Western Australia. '5. That the Government of the Commonwealth bring before the Parliament during this session the necessary measure to enable an alteration, of the Constitution (giving effect to the preceding. paragraphs, Nos. 2, 3, and 4) to be submitted to the electors. The agreement is signed by ALFRED DEAKIN, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia. C. G. WADE, Premier of the State of New South Wales. J. MURRAV, Premier of the State of Victoria. W. KIDSTON, Premier of the State of Queensland. A. H . PEAKE, Premier of the State of South Australia. N . J. MOORE, Premier of the State of Western Australia. N : E. LEWIS, Premier of the Slate of Tasmania. So far as the intention is to give final effect to any part of it, the scheme refers to the disposition of surplus Commonwealth revenue. A number of speakers have been more inclined to discuss the management of the debts of the States, but the agreement refers only incidentally to our immense public debt, and debatedirected particularly to it should deal chiefly with the disposition, of surplus revenue. As in some speeches the two subjects have, been spoken of together, I wish to state in a few words the principles which I think should govern the allocation of our surplus revenue, and the consolidation of the public debt of Australia. They are these:1. Surplus Revenues. (a) There should be no perpetual dependence of the States upon Commonwealth revenues, but in lieu thereof a succession of periodical temporary Commonwealth endowments to the States corresponding with the calculated surplus of ' Commonwealth revenues over such periods, making allowance for reasonable national development. (£) Under this arrangement there - would be a complete severance of Commonwealth and State finances when national obligations incurred necessitated the whole of the Commonwealth revenues. 2. The Public Debt. (a) The Public Debt of Australia should be consolidated and future borrowing regulated, upon a national basis. (i) A Commonwealth National Bank should be established, free from political control and jointly owned by the Commonwealth and State Governments. The management of the public debt of Australia and all future borrowing, should be conducted by the Commonwealth Bank, the profits of which should form the capital for a national bank of issue, deposit, exchange, and reserve. These proposals are consistent with the Labour party's policy. Reverting to the agreement between the Prime Minister and the Premiers, T would point out that it embodies the first scheme propounded 'by the party now in power for the distribution of surplus revenue upon a per capita basis. It will be seen, when T have read the Federal Labour party's 1 financial scheme, that where the proposals now before us have merit they nave been copied from those of the Labour party., and that those clauses which are lame, halt, and unreasonable have departed from it. The policy adopted was as followsLABOUR'S FINANCIAL POLICY. That the Conference approves the general outlines of Mr King O'Malley's scheme relating to the establishment of a National Bank. That this Conference expresses its approval generally of the following scheme as the basis for an adjustment of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States :1. That the State should continue to receive a share of_ the Federal revenue. 2. That such annual share be paid to the States in the form of a fixed sum per head of the population, such sums to be ascertained during or before the year igio on the basis shown in the fourth paragraph. 3. That the proportion of revenue allocated; to the Commonwealth must be sufficient to cover(a) All existing expenditure apart from reproductive services; (b) Old-age and invalid pensions throughout the Commonwealth; (f) An additional sum, not to exceedj£i,ooo,ooo, for the expanding necessities of the Federal Government, sucb as the creation of the Federal Capital, railway undertakings, and thedevelopment of the Northern Territory. 4. That the amount of the fixed payment per capita to be returned to the States be ascertained by(a) Taking the average total of the Customsand Excise revenue of five representative years before 1910; (b) Deducting therefrom the average total of Commonwealth expenditure for the same representative years .under the three heads enumerated in the thirdparagraph ; (e) Dividing the amount so arrived at by the average number of the population of Australia for the same representative years. 5. That in view of the exceptional position of Western Australia a further capitationgrant should be made to that State to gradually diminish upon a sliding scale until its share of the Federal revenue coincides per capita with that of the other States. It will be readily seen that that scheme, formulated in July, 1908, formed the basis of the agreement arrived at by the Prime Minister and the State Premiers in Conference. It may not be out of place, in passing, to point out that it has been the habitof opponents of the Labour movement to jeer and gibe at the alleged lack of financial ability within its ranks, and to emphasize the fact that we are able to claim here that the principles of the agreement now before us have been copied from the Federal Labour party's scheme. It would take some time to explain the details of the Labour party's scheme; but, in* ri speech which I delivered in this House on 28th October last, I placed before honourable members certain calculations showing what I believed would be the payment made to the States under it. Taking what I considered to be representative years, I found that that payment, which took into account national needs for national development during the next few years, would be J £ I os. 9c! - per head of the population. I wish to emphasize the point that in the Labour scheme there is absolutely no-provision that it shall be permanent. As one who attended the Brisbane Conference, at which it was drafted, and who took some part in the debates, I must say that in voting I was certainly under the impression that it was to be merely a periodical arrangement. It is at this point that we come to the parting of the ways between the scheme before us and that which the Labour party believed would be an equitable arrangement. Whilst a per capita payment of 25s. is tco high, taking into consideration the needs of the Commonwealth, no doubt we could overcome that difficulty, as the honourable member for Flinders has pointed out, for at least a few years. I have decided objections to the proposal that this agreement shall be permanent, and they may be placed under four distinct headings(a) That the intention of the Constitution, especially the Braddon section, does not (anticipate any such permanent arrangement. (b) The insufficiency of our experience upon which to settle the question permanently. (c) The decreasing State responsibilities. (d) The expanding Federal necessities. I am compelled to thus distinctly set my objections to the proposal to make this Sydney saidagreement permanent, because of the difficulty, which a reader of Hansard experiwould ences in dissociating the points dealt with by in an honourable member's address. compelled It is somewhat tedious to have to deal with the historical aspect of this question, able but, as bearing on the first of my objecbecause tions, I should like to trace the development of the Constitutional provision dealand ing with this matter. The Braddon clause, States. as originally proposed at the Federal Convention in 1898, was as followsThe net revenue from Customs and Excise shall be applied as follows :(a) Not more than one-twentieth of such net revenue shall be applied towards the expenditure of the Commonwealth in the exercise of its original powers. (>) Not more than four-twentieths of such net revenue shall be applied towards the expenditure of the Commonwealth in making good the net loss on the services taken over. For Against Majority for the Constitution Mr J. H. Catts. (r) The balance of such net revenue remaining after the application of the sums actually applied, pursuant to the last preceding paragraphs. (a) and (>), shall be distributed amongst the States. When the original clause was under consideration, it was objected to most emphatically by the leader of the Federal movement, Mr now Sir Edmund, Barton, and by the present right honourable member for East Sydney, on several grounds, one of which was that it would unnecessarily restrict the functions and powers of the Commonwealth. Sir Edmund Barton spoke as follows:Any one who leads to the implication that Federation is going to cause financial ruin to any State unless it receives some grant, whether it calls it its own or not, is, however unintentionally, doing a great deal of harm to the Federal cause, because he supplies the enemies of Federation with this argument : That Federation will bring about financial ruin to the States. out The right honourable member for East The difficulty of the Commonwealth Treasurer be this-unde r a provision of that sort, which he must be bound, from which there would be no escape,. he would be absolutely in trying to define a Tariff on broad national lines for the good of all, to deform the Tariff by a multitude of proposals inapplicto the position of the people of Australia, he would be compelled to regard the financial position on certain iron-bound lines, to consider the position of certain smaller Melbourne Further on, he saidif his power to spend is unlimited, the amount which the States will get back must always be uncertain. I submit that in the minds of those two gentlemen there was at that time a distinct objection to any amount being fixed as permanently returnable to the States. The original clause, together with the whole of the proposed Constitution, was submitted to the referendum in four States, and the voting resulted as follows:Ifew South South Wales. Victoria. Australia. Tasmania.

"" (2) Its desire that the other colonies should agree to reconsider those provisions of the Bill , framed by the Convention of 1897-98, most generally 'objected to in New South Wales, namely :"" (b) The 87th clause, known as the Braddon clause-concernin g which this House desires to submit for the consideration of the other colonies, that this clause should be removed from the Bill .' "" (3) Although prepared for the sake of union-if it be placed in other respects upoR a fair and just footing-to accept the financial system embodied in the Bill , with the one ex. ception mentioned, this House earnestly invites further inquiry into, and a more thorough consideration of, the financial clauses, regarding as evils to be avoided, if possible, excessive burdens of taxation, a prolonged system of bookkeeping, uncertainty as to the amount of the surplus to be divided, and uncertainty as to the method of distributing it among the States."" Following on that, in February, 1899, a Conference of Premiers was held in Melbourne, under the presidency of Sir George Turner, the Premier of Victoria. A memorandum, signed by every Premier, was - Wales. Yes .. 107,420 No 82,741 Majority- 24,679 It has been stated that the original clause was accepted by a small majority of the States, and that, therefore, the people at that time were prepared to accept it ; but there is the fact that, when the clause was altered to the form in which it now appears in the Constitution; the majority in all the States was infinitely greater than on the preceding occasion. So that the last mentioned section was much more acceptable to the States than was that on which drawn up, asking for an alteration of the clause; and it contained this most import. with a view of meeting the objecas far as possible, consistently with the safety of States, the Premiers are of the operation of the clause should not continue after a period of ten years if the Parliament then desires to repeal or alter it. That means the Commonwealth Parliament. Then the new clause, which is now section 87 of the Constitution, was adopted as follows :During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise, not more than one-. fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth'. It is true that in that clause there is an association of the surplus revenue and State debts, but only for a period of ten years, after which the Commonwealth Parliament, under the Constitution, is entirely free as to the disposition of the revenue. It might be the desire of the Parliament to remit some portion of the surplus revenue to the States; or, on the other hand, to formulate a Tariff which would bring in only sufficient revenue for its own requirements. On what is now section 87, a further referendum was taken in all - the States, excepting Western Australia, with the following result New South Victoria. South Tasmania. Queensland. Australia.

It can be shown from the speeches of leading members of this House, and of other leading public men, that under the Constitution as it at present exists there is no obligation upon the Commonwealth Parliament to return a portion of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States after the ten years.' period. Speaking at the Hobart Conference in 1905 the right honourable member for East Sydney, then Prime Minister, saidAt any time the Federal Parliament can take over the debts. At any time the Parliament can take your interest. At any time they can spend your interest for Commonwealth purposes and compel you to pay.' J. am only saying what Sir George Turner has said upon a former occasion. Mr Allan MCLean, then Minister of Trade and Customs, another gentleman of great public experience, said I am perfectly satisfied from what I know of the views of the Commonwealth Parliament that if they are not saddled with the debts of the States they will at least reduce the amount that is handed back by the amount of an old-age pension scheme. They would certainly establish such a system on the expiration of the Braddon clause. They would also, as far as I Know their feelings, go in for penny postage, and, I believe, for the nucleus of an Australian Navy. At the Brisbane Premiers' Conference 1907 the present Treasurer saidThere is a provision in. the Constitution even seems to infer that there might be no resaidturn to the States. In a memorandum which he presented to the Brisbane Conference, the right honourable gentleman saidIt is scarcely likely that the Federal Parliament will continue the Braddon clause beyond the 31st December, 1910, and therefore that date the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue will be at the disposal of the Commonwealth, subject only to the provision of section 94 of the Constitution, that the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair,"" for the monthly payment to the several States of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. From that brief history of section 87 it will be seen that there is no obligation upon the Commonwealth Parliament under the Constitution to return to the States either temporarily or permanently a fixed sum. My next objection is-(b ) Insufficient experience upon which to settle this question permanently. I listened with considerable interest to the speech of the Prime Minister. Although his language was very attractive it was one of the most contradictory speeches to which I have listened since I have been in this Parliament. According to the Hansard report, page 3156, the Prime Minister, referring to the Braddon section, saidThat term of ten years was intended to be a period of probation, inquiry, and experience which should fit the representatives whom I have now the honour to address for the task of reshaping the partnership according to the knowledge gained in the interval. Many things settled under the Constitution even in relation to finance were left vague; but the particular Mr J. H. Catts. knot that we require once more to untie, that of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, remains as hard as it was left originally. The passage indicates that in the opinion of the Prime Minister we have not arrived at a time when we could fix a permanent provision. Further on in his speech he made another reference to this uncertainty. He said, referring to the present TariffAs the duties which are protective become effective the return from them will decline, and there may .be a falling off in the return from certain revenue imposts. Again he saidNo one can predict with certainty the future Customs returns. Figures based upon existing returns must be, to some extent, misleading. In view of these studied declarations from the Prime Minister himself it is regrettable that he should now propose to base a permanent arrangement upon our in uncertain experience. Even as recently as June of this year, in enunciating the policy which of his Government, the Prime Minister Above all, the approaching termination of the ten years period, for which the Constitution provided a distribution of Customs revenue, marks the close of a critical era, and suggests the pressing importance of this great financial question. w after Mark the words which followA temporary arrangement for a term of years to replace the existing distribution under which the obligations of the Commonwealth are recognised is being prepared for submission. Even, so recently as June last, after an adjournment of three weeks to enable the Government to consider what attitude to - take up, the Prime Minister indicated, not in a speech which was the result of the impulse of the moment, but in a set printed document embodying the policy of the Government, that there should be a temporary arrangement covering a term of years. Had that policy been adhered to there would have been much less objection to the Government's proposal. But the proposed departure from that policy is naturally objectionable to all who have a regard for the future development of Australia. After the Prime Minister had stated that we have no reliable data on which to base an opinion he inconsistently proceeded to submit an estimate .of from 60s. to 70s. per head as the probable Customs and Excise revenue in the future. That will - be found in the honourable gentleman's speech at page 3r;o of Hansard. Singularly enough in the printed documents laid on the table by the present Treasurer it is indicated that there will be a considerable decline in our 'Customs and Excise revenue. The revenue for the year 1908-9 was 50s. 8 f d . per. head. An estimate of the Treasury Department over the signature of the Treasurer gives the probable revenue in 1910-11, and the few years f o l lowing, at £ 2 8s. 6d. per head. has been a disposition on the part of previous speakers to refer to the experience of countries on the other side of the world, but we have considerable experience on which to base an estimate in the operation of the Tariffs in force in the various States prior to Federation. From a calculation based on the operations extending over thirty years as recorded in our own Commonwealth Year-Book, I find that during the period between 1877 and 1907, ancl taking into account the operation of the Commonwealth Tariff, as well as of the Tariffs in force in the various States prior to Federation, the average annual imports per capita amounted to £ 1 1 3s. Now that manufacturing is proceeding apace in the Commonwealth an annual import of £ 1 0 per head is a liberal estimate for the future. The average duties imposed at the time of Federation in 1900 under the Tariffs of the various States produced a revenue equal to 15.9 per cent. Under the Victorian Tariff, which was.more highly protective than those of the other States, the revenue was 10.8 per cent. During the thirty years' period referred to the revenue per capita from Customs and Excise would be £ 1 is. 7d. on the Victorian basis, and on the Australian basis, reckoning the Tariffs of the various States and also the Commonwealth Tariff, it would be £ 1 n s . gd. per head. the figures in this way : - 1 . Liberal estimate of future Australian imports £ 1 0 per head. 2. Yield from Customs and Excise on the Australian basis £ 1 11s. 9d. per head. 3. Yield on the American basis £ 1 gs. 6d. 4. Yield on the 'Canadian basis £ 2 2S. n d . 5. Average yield of nine European countries £ 1 is. 4d.",38
173,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do these figures include Excise i i i every case ?,43
174,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , they include in every case the revenue from Customs ancl Excise. It would therefore appear that in the face of the Australian experience the estimate put forward by the Prime Minister must be regarded as special pleading. It was palpably the art of the advocate and a desire to make the argument fit the case.",43
175,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It was the man with a brief.,43
176,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As the honourable member reminds me it was the suggestion of the lawyer with a brief. My next objection is (c) The decreasing State There responsibilities. It is a common objection urged by our citizens that the cost of government in Australia is too great. I submit a few figures for the year 1907-8, maki n g a comparison between Australia and Canada. The number of members of Parliament in Canada was 783 ; in Australia 666. Area, Canada 3,619,818 square miles; Australia 2,974,581 square miles. The population in .round numbers was Canada 7,000,000; Australia 4,000,000. The total cost of government less the cost of administration of State business undertakings, old-age pensions, and interest on public debt, Canada £ 1 4 , 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 ; Australia £20,754,113. It is clear that the objection of the ordinary citizen to the unreasonable cost of government in Australia is justified. I give details with respect to New South Wales only, because I desire to limit my remarks as much as possible, and at the same time to give information which is likely to be of interest to the people of the State from which I come. Since Federation we have had in New South Wales a policy of almost unlimited extravagance, a policy of spend and burst. Since Federation New South Wales has received from the Commonwealth the following amounts :-1900-1, . for half a year, £ 8 8 7 , 5 7 3 ; 1901-2, £ = , 3 8 1 , 7 3 3 ; 1902-3, £ 3 , 0 4 8 , 0 9 0 ; 1903-4, I put £ 2 , 6 9 1 , 2 8 7 ; 1904-5, £ 2 , 5 3 2 . 1 5 6 ; 19056 , £ --741,929; 2 i9°<5-7, £3^25,137; .1.907-8, £ 3 , 6 1 7 , 3 6 6 ; and in 1908-9, £3»3 7,6232 During that period of eight and a half years New South Wales received from the Commonwealth no less than £ 2 4 , 2 5 2 , 8 9 4 . or an. average of £2,853,282. per annum. In the year 1899-1900 New South W ales received a r revenue from Customs and Excise of £1,736,337. Had that State continued to receive the same revenue from Customs ancl Excise during the eight and a half years since Federation she would have received in all £14,759,209. Instead of that she has received £24,252,894- a colossal amount. In other words, she has received £ 9 , 4 9 3 , 6 8 5 more since Federation than if .she had maintained her own pre-Federal Tariff unimpaired. Whilst considering this question we must not forget that a number of non-revenue producing Departments have been handed - over to the Commonwealth by the State, which to that extent has been relieved of costly responsibilities. That is.not the only direction in which this policy of "" spend"" and burst "" has been exemplified. Let us take the public debt of New South Wales. On the 30th June, 1901, it was ,£67,361,246. On 30th June, 1908, it was £87,635,826, or an increase in that period in debt from borrowed money of £20,274,580. The public debt per headof the State on the 30th June, 1901, was £ 4 9 9s. 3d. On the 30th June, 1908,. it was ,£55 ios. 6d., or an increase per head of £ 6 is. 3d. In addition, the average receipts from Crown land sales from 1900 to 1908 have been over £1,000,000 per annum. The expenditure in New South Wales in 18991 poo-the year before Federation-for governmental expenses, was £5,186,524. In 1907-8 it was £6,026,982. To emphasize that increase it may be pointed out that the figures for 1899-1900 included expenditure on public works as apart from business undertakings, whereas the figures for 1907-8 were exclusive of such public works expenditure, which amounted to £909,911. As far as the 25s. per head proposed to be returned to the States is concerned, no doubt those which have the spending of the money will be pleased to receive the greatest amount that they can handle, but there is no necessity for such a return. The following figures show the New South Wales Customs and Excise receipts for four years before Federation:jp 15967 1,272,364 -- 1,530,964 1597-S i,295>5 9 - 1S9S-9 .. 1,608,859 1899-1goo . i,339> 4 - - Average It is therefore proposed under this arrangement to hand back to New South Wales from Customs and Excise revenue actually more than she received for an average of four years prior to Federation, in spite of the fact that the Commonwealth has taken over a large number of non-paying Departments and relieved the State of great Mr . H. Cails. responsibilities. We propose handing back to the States a considerable amount of money without imposing upon them any obligation to raise it, which is one of the great safeguards of governmental expenditure. We propose as a Commonwealth to take from Commonwealth revenues an amount which will seriously curtail necessary expenditure upon national development. I come now to the next objection (d) the expanding Federal necessities. The Prime Minister in his speech on the agreement said, as recorded on page 3164 of Hansard:The income we can get is £2,250,000 more; and will, with a system of prudent finance, enable us to undertake, in due measure, all those greater operations which were alluded to by my honourable colleague, the Treasurer, and in regard to which substantive measures are being submitted by the Government. I propose to show that that statement is not only the special pleading of an advocate with a brief, but is absolutely absurd. I can prove that from the figures presented by the Treasurer with hisBudget speech. I have made out a balance-sheet showing the estimated revenue and expenditure of the Commonwealth for the current financial year, 1909-10, but this is slightly reconstructed, without departing from the official figures, in order to enable the balance sheets which will follow it to be more readily understood. The Treasurer in his statement of expenditure places the debit for old-age pensions for the current year at £855,000, whereas as a matter of fact the expenditure on that object in the current - year will be £[1,505,800.",43
177,Sir PHILIP FYSH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have reserved Customs and the balance for the last two years. Average return 3 Mr JH CATTS - Exactly , but the Treasurer should have taken that reserve Excise Revenue, per head. from last year as income for the present year. I make up the balance-sheet for 1909-10 in this way :£ £ sd. Estimated Revenue and Expenditure, 1909-1910. . . 1 4 1 Cr. £ . 8 I.537.27 2 - - i 3 9 Revenue - 1 4 S 14,555,765 21 1,736,377 - . 1 5 II In hand Old-age Pensions Fund. 655,800 Deficit ... 1,185 ,,000 . 1,603,368 ... 1 4 6£ £16,396,565 Dr £, Expenditure 7,002,021 Old-age Pensions 1,505,800 Return to States .. 7,888,144 £16,396,565 NOTE - The item £15,000 interest on Treasury Bonds, referred to in the Treasurer's accounts, has been deducted from estimated expenditure. It will also be noticed that the expenditure on old-age pensions has been separated from the general expenditure to more clearly enable honourable members to follow the statement. How would the Commonwealth fare if this agreement were operative during the current year? another balance-sheet, which shows the position, as follows:Estimate of Revenue and Expenditure foi 1909-10, al'.owing for return to States of 25s. per head. Revenue ... ... ... i4.555.7 5 Expenditure, less Old-age Pensions 7,002,621 Old-age Pensions ... ... Return to States-Populatio n 31.12.09 at 25s. per head ... ...

Population estimated 31st December, 1909, 4,355,000. Prior to placing the next balance-sheet have before the House, I desire to direct attention to the average increase of Commonwealth expenditure. In 1901-2 the Revenue total expenditure was ^ 3 , 7 3 3 , , while in 1909-10 it is estimated at £7,017,621. The latter amount does not include cost of old-age pensions, because that is Return an exceptional item. The average increase , P for eight years has been £41°,55° num. For the purpose of the next balance-sheet, I desire to deal for ments with the valuation of the transferred properties. A Commission repreInterest sentative of the Commonwealth and the States made an investigation, at the valuation of ,£9,648,449. The interest on that amount, at 3$ per cent., would come to £337,697 ios. per so that the interest for nine years would total ,£3,039,277 ios. That is the amount which the States are entitled to claim as standing to their credit in the CommonDeficit wealth books. Let us now take the amount paid to the States in excess of their threeThat fourths share of the net Customs and Exexpenditure cise revenue. We have paid an excess amount of £6,059,088. . Morally speakand ing, that amount should stand to the credit of the Commonwealth in the books of the States. Deducting the State credit in Commonwealth books from the Commonsioner's wealth credit in the State books, morally speaking we have a balance of £3,019,811 to the credit of the Commonwealth. The interest must be paid on the value of the transferred properties. That is a constitutional obligation. It is clear from the Prime Minister's speech that this quesI have tion is not connected in any way with the return of 25s. per capita to the States, and it has also been made clear from statements in the State Parliaments. Taking the value of the transferred properties at £9,648,449, and deducting the amount to the credit of the Commonwealth, namely, Cr. £ £3,019,811, we get a balance of 6 £6,628,638 due to the States. How£'4.555.765 ever this question may be juggled with, morally speaking the obligation Dr £ is upon us to pay at least the interest on that balance, which, at 3J per 1,505,800 cent., would amount to £232,000 per an5,443.75° num. Having set out the average expan125,000 sion of Federal expenditure, and also the 478.594 amount which must be paid as interest on the value of the transferred properties, let £'4.555.765 us take the position in 1910-11-that is the first year in which ,this scheme would come % has into active operation--not taking into account any national policy such as has been referred to by the Prime Minister. It is I illustrated by the following tableEstimated Revenue and Expenditure. 1910-n. £ £ Population, 218 4,435,000, at £ 3 6s. iod. per head (present revenue) 14,820,124 the Expenditure as at present £ 1 16s. i£d. per head 8,010,718 to States at 25s. er a e a d 5.543,75° per an- - Special grant to Western Australia ... ... 125,000 a few moIncreased cost of Old-age Pensions (admitted by the Treasurer) ... ... 250,000 on Transferred Properties ... ... 232,000 and arrived Decrease in Customs and Excise estimated by Federal Treasurer of is. 3d. per head ... 277,187 annum, Average yearly increased expenditure in taking over Federal Departments ... 410,550 14,849,205 ... ... £29,081 table does not take into account any involved in the great national proposals which are before the country, which are being advocated in some form or other by every party in this Parliament. The Agents-General of the States the estimate the cost of the High CommisOffice at ,£90,600 per annum. If the agreement which is now under consideration be ratified, and if iri 1910-11 the High Commissioner's Office is being administered, it will practically absorb the whole of the surplus revenue for that year. will be only about £[150,000 left for purposes of national development. In other words, the Commonwealth will be left practically without a credit balance during the very first year that the agreement is in operation. The Minister of Defence estimates that the cost of our military defence alone during 1910-n will be £[1,407,000. So that if any attempt be made to provide the necessary funds for military purposes the Commonwealth, during the very first year that the agreement comes into force, will be faced with a tremendous deficit. We shall then be obliged either to resort to borrowing or to the imposition of further taxation. What is the nature of the Government programme? Upon the business-paper no less than twenty-two measures are listed, the administration of several of which will cost a large sum. Those measures relate amongst other things to military and naval defence, the transfer of the Northern Territory, the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, the control of lighthouses, beacons and buoys, compensation to injured seamen, and to the transfer of Norfolk Island. To say that a policy indicated by such proposals could be financed under this agreement is to fly in the face offacts. The proposed agreement takes no cognizance of the intention of the Braddon section. It entirely ignores our admitted inexperience and lack of knowledge of the financial tion, and yet the Prime Minister now wishes to settle that question permanently. Instead of seeking to place an embargo upon prodigal expenditure by the States, he proposes to hand over to them annually a considerable sum which they are not charged with the responsibility of raising. The agreement absolutely ignores the expanding necessities of the Commonwealth and those great national proposals to which it is the bounden duty of any Government to give effect. Further, it represents the essence of class legislation. It seeks to place a permanent burden upon the poorer classes through the Customs House. In this connection I amreminded of a letter which the honourable member for East Sydney forwarded to the recent Premiers' Conference. At some periods of his career the honourable member has rendered great service to the people. For years he was the champion of the poorer' classes and a strong advocate Mr J. H. GoMs. of all proposals to place the burden of taxation upon the backs of those who were, best able to bear it. But the communicaThere tion which he recently forwarded to the Premiers' Conference indicates atotal abandonment of all his formerly professed principles. He now desires to place taxation only upon the shoulders of the masses. His letter readsAugust 10th, 1909. My Dear Mr Murray, As you will be President of the approaching Conference, I take the opportunity-and I do not think it will be considered a libertyof impressing upon you and - your brother Premiers the supreme necessity of a final adjustment, without delay, of the financial problems affecting the Commonwealth and the States. It seems to me that there is, whilst the matter remains open, an increasing danger of an arrangement, which can be determined in a short time, not by conference or compromise, but by the will of the Federal Parliament. Time is on the side of your opponents. Mr - SPEAKER - I would point out to the honourable member that that particular letter has already been read and included. in the Hansard reports several times.",44
178,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think that I am entitled to read it and to have it again included in the Hansard report.,46
179,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would be more convenient if the honourable member would refer to it as a letter which has already been read. - Mr JH CATTS-But I wish to make certain comments upon it. This is necessary to give point to my remarks.,46
180,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would point out that the honourable member when I interques- rupted him was engaged in the task of reading the letter in exienso. If he desires to comment upon any particular portion of it, it is quite competent for him to do so. Mr J. H . 'CATTS-But the letter has already been read by several honourable members.",46
181,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is the reason why I do not desire to establish a precedent which may become a very awkward one.,46
182,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I submit that I am entitled,46
183,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I must ask the honourable member to resume his seat. If I permit the honourable member to again read this letter, a letter extending over several columns may afterwards be read by another honourable member, and the honourable member's action on this occasion may be quoted as a precedent.",46
184,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As the letter which . the honourable member for Cook desires to quote has already been quoted several times, I should like to know upon what ground you rule that it cannot again be quoted ?",46
185,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member's question merely gives point to my statement that it would be dangerous to allow the honourable member for Cook to pursue the course which he was pursuing, because it would establish a precedent. The honourable member will be quite in order in commenting upon any portion of that letter, but with a view to saving both time and expense in printing, I suggest that he should refrain from quoting it in its entirety.",47
186,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I rise to a point of order. I wish to know, sir, whether you objected to this letter .being quoted in cxteuso on a previous occasion ? Mr= SPEAKER - No . What is the point of order ?",47
187,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My point of order is that as you have allowed the letter to be quoted more than once, it is very unfair to prevent another honourable member from quoting it.",47
188,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is no point of order involved in that question. Because a thing has been permitted once, it does not .'follow that it should be permitted indefinitely. I have not said that the honourable member for Cook must not read the letter in full. I have merely put it to him that in view of the fact' that it has previously been read three times, and that it already appears in Hansard he might not consider it necessary to again read it.",47
189,Unknown,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m. ' Mr JH CATTS - To conclude my quotation from the letterI am more responsible than any other man for the termination of the Braddon clause, but I never wished to allow the States less than a fair share of Customs and Excise revenue, which is the only way in which the States can receive revenue from the masses of their inhabitants. The object of this letter is to make that sure for all time. I do not wish to introduce any views of my own, except to state that there are one or two main points in which I think the States should be considered, viz. :(1) They should have a fair share of the Commonwealth revenue. (2) That share should be on a per capita basis. (3) It should increase automatically with the growth of the revenue and population, or at least with the population growth. (4) There should be no other point of contact in matters of revenue between the Commonwealth and the States. If I may add another word, I think the States should offer to pay the old-age pensions money until the end of the Braddon clause-thos e States,' at any rate, which have been relieved of their pension systems, to the amount of such relief-otherwisee I think you may suffer permanently far more than can be imagined. Yours very sincerely, G. H . REID .",47

193,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The agreement to all intents and purposes embodies the policy on which the, right honourable member for East Sydney was defeated at the last elections, which was stated in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 25th October, 1906, in these wordsThe protection afforded by the Braddon clause to the finances of. the States should be perpetually extended, but in a more flexible form. In June of this year the Prime Minister read a statement containing the Government's policy regarding, amongst other things, the distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue. It favoured a. temporary airangement. The right honourable member for East Sydney, alt-hough termed by the Prime Minister an out-and-out Conservative, was supposed, in joining the Fusion, to swallow the Liberal principles of the Prime Minister. But we rind now that, although the Prime Minister wished to make the arrangement with the States temporary, the Premiers in Conference prevailed upon him to agree to a permanent arrangement, thus accepting the proposal upon which the right honourable member for East Sydney was defeated at the last election.",47
194,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Migh t not the resolutions of the Brisbane Labour Conference have caused the Prime Minister and the Premiers to come to this agreement ?,47
195,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Thos e points in the agreement which aie good, such as the per capita payment, were cribbed from the scheme formulated by the Labour Conference, which met in Brisbane in July, 1908; but in making the payment perpetual, the policy upon which the right honourable member for East Sydney was defeated was adopted by the Government. Notwithstanding the gibes which have been made against us as to our unfitness to deal with large financial questions, where the present scheme is good, it embodies the constructive proposals of the Federal Labour party. Why were the proposals of the Labour party accepted? To use the words of the Prime Minister, "" it was not because of an issue, but because of a situation."" A general election is impending, and it is necessary for the success of the Fusion at the polls that the Governments of the States should be behind it. The agreement was not arrived at to meet national necessities, but because of the exigencies of party politics; to insure a more solid, and Conservative monetary backing for the Fusionists. I remember hearing the right honourable member for East Sydney, a few years ago, when he was associated with the Labour party, and hacl introduced the land tax into New South Wales, claim that he had placed upon the statute-book the freest Tariff in the world. He told the mighty meetings which he then addressed in the metropolis of the State that one of his objects in life was to place the burdens of taxation, upon the shoulders of those best able to bear them. But how greatly has he departed in the evening of his career from the noble aspirations which he then expounded ! He tells the Premiers that if they do not settle this question of the finances it will be settled by the Federal Parliament. What an atrocious thing it would be, if a matter of national concern, relegated to this Parliament by the Constitution, were settled! by those elected by the people to deal with such questions. It is pitiable that a gentleman who cannot have many more years, to give to the service of the public, and who was sent into this House to voice the national aspirations of his constituents, should make a statement like that in his letter to the PremiersTime is on the side of your opponents. One of the reasons for this undue haste settle the matter is the desire to leg-rope, fetter, and shackle the Commonwealth f all time.",47
196,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We ought to have quorum. [Quorum formed.'],48
197,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The right hon the orable member for East Sydney was afraid that if the people were left untrammelled at the next general election there might a wholly different result. He therefore sought to range behind him on this queswhich tion the whole of the Conservative forces of Australia. Another point which he phasized was that taxes could be extorted from the masses only through the Customs House. The right honourable gentleman who built up his political reputation by freeing the people of New South Wales from the burdens of indirect or, in other words, class taxation now deserts tile commendable position which he has 'occupied for many years. One of his chief reasons for objecting to the Braddon clause being inserted in the Constitution was that it might mean fastening on the people a heavy revenue Tariff, and when it was inserted lie urged that its operation should be limited to a period of not more than ten years, so that the Parliament might have an opportunity to profit by its experience, and to devise a means of providing for the cost of government without adding to the already heavy burden of taxation borne by the working classes. If the Commonwealth Parliament is to be compelled to take into account the necessity for raising alarge revenue through the Customs House our difficulties in. framing a Protective Tariff will be greatly intensified. Whilst I have supported, and am prepared to support, a Democratic Protective policy, which takes into account, not only the manufacturers, but the workers and the consumers, I have always done my utmost to prevent the imposition of revenue duties. I shall continue to oppose their imposition, for they are but an old device of the Conservative classes to heap upon the great mass of the people burdens part of which they themselves ought to bear. If it were possible to go to the door of every working man each morning and to tell him, as he received from the baker his loaf of bread, that he was paying upon it a half-penny by way of taxation, and so in regard to his sugar and other commodities, he would recognise immediately that he was being called upon to bear an unfair proportion of the cost of government. But because such taxation is to imposed indirectly, and is added to the cost of the articles which he purchases, he o r is largely blinded to the fact that he is being called upon to bear more than a fair a share of the cost of government, and that taxation is being imposed, not according to ability to bear it , but according to numbers and the volume of consumption. The honourable member for Denison gave be away the whole show, so far as the Government were concerned, by an interjection he made whilst the honourable member for Kennedy was speaking. . He emstated that the Commonwealth could raise £3,000,00 0 per annum by means of duties on piece goods. That is what the Government have in view. They are going lo hand over this money to the States, and to impose revenue duties in order to obtain it. They are going to save the great landlords of Australia from a land tax by imposing extra taxation upon the working men and women of Australia by means of Customs duties on piece goods, tea and kerosene. It is impossible to hide the object of the Fusion Government. It is impossible to conceal the object which the Conservatives of Australia have in view. State Rights, indeed ! What are they but the rights of the Conservative Upper Chambers of the various State Parliaments? They mean the ""leg-roping"" of the Commonwealth Parliament so that we shall not be able to frame the Tariff on lines dictated by a Democratic people, and to give effect to a truly Democratic policy. It has been shown that in order to carry out the Government policy a largely increased revenue will be required in 1910-11 and the succeeding years. We have before us great national projects. We have a large impending expenditure on naval and militarydefence. What is defence but the protection of property ? And how is it proposed to raise the money required for defence purposes? By revenue duties and by loans. Ancl so with regard to the construction of trans-continental railways. We are to borrow money to provide for them. We are to pay over to the States our surplus revenue, and to borrow money. this but a studied system of u n f i i r l y exbe bargained away. ploiting the workers of the community? The Government propose to borrow money to carry railways through the lands of the squatters-to enormously increase the value of their properties by the expenditure of loan money in that way-and to call upon the people, by the imposition of taxes on .the necessaries of life, to find the interest which will be payable on that borrowed money, while the wealthy men of Australia reap the benefit. And so with the military expenditure. That expenditure should be allocated from the proceeds of direct taxation. It is an insurance of property. In raising money from the States through the Customs House we are limiting the taxing powers of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister said that the Bill which he would place before the House was merely to enable this agreement to be submitted to the people by a referendum and to give them an opportunity to vote for or against it. It may be pointed out, first of all, that the referendum under our Constitution is not democratic. A proposed amendment of the Constitution must be agreed to, not only by a majority of the electors voting, but by a majority of the electors in a majority of the States. The less populous States may outvote a majority of their fellow citizens. The Prime Minister speaks of placing the issue before the electors, but he does not afford us an opportunity to place an alternative issue before them; and it is the manner of submitting the question that forms one of the objections' to the proposal. It has been indicated that, if there is a referendum, the people will be entirely free as to the way in which they shall vote. What an erroneous argument! If there is a referendum, it will be supposed by the people that their representatives in Parliament recommend the proposal. Most emphatically I say that I cannot recommend this amendment of the Constitution; ancl I shall do my. utmost on the public platform to persuade the people that the alteiation is against their interests. It is impossible to appeal to the occupants of the Treasury bench. The Government have a majority, and, I have no doubt that, whatever differences of opinion there may be amongst honourable members opposite, they will, when the party whip cracks, vote for the motion. This is a proposal to meet the exigencies of a temporary political party, and it represents the mess of pottage for What is which the birth right of the people is to It is an attempt to shackel future generations. I reiterate, it is impossible to appeal with any effect to the present Government; but we can appeal to the great democratic heart of the people of Australia. We can ask the people to leave the Commonwealth, their representatives, and future generations untrammelled,, and not to permit, with our imperfect knowledge of the finances from the Commonwealth point of view, an. attempt which simply means the burdening of those who are already burdened more than enough. We ought to be left free to reduce the revenue duties in the present Tariff, to place a greater portion of the burdens of government on the broad shoulders of wealth, and to afford an opportunity to those who have never before been called upon to do so under the class rule in the different States to bear their fair share of the cost of government and of our national development.",48
198,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parkes).[8.8] - ; I have listened to the honourable member for Cook with considerable interest and some curiosity; but the only effect of his speech on me is to create a hope that other honourable members will not emulate him in supposing that light can be thrown on a complex financial question by a dissertation! on the inconsistencies of public men, and .1 continued abuse of the existing Government. It might be splendid matter for a lecture to the honourable member's constituents, but it is certainlv out of in a responsible debate of this' sort, in which every honourable member is called on to give of his best to the elucidation of one of the most difficult questions we have ever had before this Parliament. I am quite sure that other honourable members have felt, as I fee], some inconvenience im having to debate this very difficult question at the present juncture. Instead of having before us the Bill which we are discussing, we have a very short abstract motion; and those of us, who have not been fortunate enough to see the measure, have to infer from, the motion and from the agreement with the Premiers what the provisions of the Bill are. The great disadvantage is that we are, very properly, not allowed by you, Mr Speaker, to refer to any details of the Bill, even in our general observations. It will be generally acknowledged that the subject of this debate is a very notable one. I doubt whether we have ever had before us since 1901 a question of such gravity for the Commonwealth. It is not merely a matter of legislaton that is going to be placed on the statute-book, from which it could be taken at any time if found impracticable or undesirable;' this is a discussion on the propriety of making a very serious change in what I would call the Magna Charta of the Australian people. The effect of this Bill will be-to make an important alteration in the Commonwealth Constitution; and the question whether or not it is desirable that this alteration shall be made, raises a number of difficult problems which, I submit, throw on the members of this House a responsibility such as they have never before had thrown on them in the history of the Commonwealth. The Bill is one which aims at filling a gap in the Constitution. We know that the effect ofi anythingwe may do as the outcome of the decision of the House on this motion, may have"" a very, far-reaching influence on ""the finances,on the goodwill of, and on the relationship between, the States and the Commonwealth. The speeches delivered by the honourable member for Mernda and the honourable member for Flinders, have shown clearly that it requires a great deal of care to trace correctly, even with some knowledge of the Constitution, the effect which this alteration may have on . that future relationship. I , therefore, say that, notwithstanding a long experience in the political life of the country, both here placeand elsewhere, I feel very seriously the responsibility which is thrown on me, and every honourable member on this and the other side of the House, in coming to a decision. We are attempting, as. I have said, to fill a gap which will occur in the national deed of partnership between the 'Commonwealth and the States. I do not think we have ever had a question before us which called on us more imperatively to rid our minds of party feeling. It may be that honourable 'members opposite see in this movement an opportunity for approaching more closely to some ideals which they have with respect to the relationship of the Commonwealth to the States; but if that is merely a party expectation, and they are shutting their eyes to the gravity of the question which is put before them, they are recreant 'to the trust which the public have placed in their hands. I say to those of them who are earnest and able enough to grasp the importance of this question-, that they are running great risk of co-operating in a step which they may live to repent as one of - the most important in their political history.",50
199,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think that this lecture is called for?,50
200,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not .for 'the honourable 'member, because he stands so high above lectures that it could have noeffect on him. He is one of the few perfect examples in the House to whom I should never think of delivering a lecture. In the first place, the honourable member is so absolutely crystallized, and stereotyped in his convictions, that nothing I could say, dr even an-archangel could say, would turn him from his political purposes. Lecture or no lecture, I desire to say, in all seriousness, that I consider this a crux in our history. I have listened with great care to the speeches made on the other side of the House by the Leader of the Labour Party, and by the honourable member' for West Sydney, who was the. Attorney-Genepared ral in the late Labour Government. From those honourable members,, and certainly from the Leader of the Opposition, I expected a much more earnest and impartial investigation of this financial question. I really expected, from what I knew of the earnestness of - the honourable member for Constitution. Wide Bay in political, life, that he would have risen far above party considerations; that he would have forgotten this scheme and that scheme-whethe r it was the scheme of the Labour Conference in Brisbane, or the scheme of an honourable member sits on his own side-and would have apWales, plied himself to the question, with one object: to help the people of Australia, whom he represents, to extricate themselves from one of the greatest difficulties which they have beenplaced with regard to their Constitution since Federation gan-. It is necessary, in this matter, touchupon history a little. I think we have to consider how this blank or hiatus occurs in our Constitution, necessitating action at the present time. There are cermost tain features about the early history of Constitution which are of very great portance to us. We all recognise the and the sovereignty of the people. ever wisdom or unwisdom we may attribute to them, we recognise that they are the power to which we must bow. When this Constitution of ours was first submitted to-the people of Australia, we well remember that it had been agreed that a certain majority in each of the States would be sufficient lead to the adoption of the new instrument of government. We also know that in three out of the six States-in South Ausa tralia, Victoria and Tasmania-the stitution was adopted by the required majority.  ing to do with the fixing of the required majority.",50
201,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should like to answer the honourable member on the spot. The people of Australia appointed Convention by a popular method. That vention was supposed to consist of the best constitutional authorities Australia could produce; because they were elected, with this or that party object, but with special purpose of framing a Constitution for Australia. The people having elected whole situation. that Convention were prepared to a extent to abide by its conclusions. As I could have said, the people of three of the readily assented to the Constitution 1*34] by the Convention by the required majorities which had been agreed upon by the Premiers of the States, who also rehad presented the people. New South Whales, unfortunately, upon second thoughts, decided to require a larger majority of the - people in order to bind that State to this",51
202,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Ne w South Wales did not decide.; the Government which the honourable member supported decided.,51
203,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member has such a rapid brain that I canwho not feed it fast enough. New South I say, raised the minimum, and the sole Constitution was not then adopted by that State, although the ruin-unum number of electors which the Premiers, had agreed in upon voted in favour of its adoption. But subsequently, as we know,, an appeal was be- . again made to the people of New South to Wales, and they adopted the Constitution. Now, I wish to point out;-becaus e it has a very important bearing upon this question our --that the people of Australia had in. the representative way approved of a proour vision, for all' time-, by which the States imcould enjoy three-fourths of the Customs power revenue of Australia. I observe that I Whatnow get applause from the other side, whereas, before I noticed hesitation. I look upon the applause of the Opposition as very much like the songs of the Syrens of ancient history, who desired to attract in order to destroy; arid I would thank my honourable friends if they would not into terrupt me by their applause. I again point out that the people of Australia actually did approve, when appealed to, of provision by which the States could enjoy Conthree-fourths of the Customs revenue of Australia for all time. And we must not forget this: that had it not nothbeen for a provision of this sort, we should not have been federated today. Some of us remember that that very celebrated man, the late Mr James Service, used to characterize the fiscal question as a "" the lion in the p at h "" of Federation. ConWhen the Convention met, its members found very little difficulty in deciding upon a deed of partnership which should exist not between the States and the Commonwealth the on all other matters, but they held this fiscal issue to be the crux of the Everybody in the large Convention felt that unless something be done to secure to the States States a considerable proportion of the prerevenue upon which they had depended hitherto for paying the interest on their debts, it was impossible that they could arrive at any agreement as to Federation. The fact that the people of Australia were then ready to give to the States three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue for all time is a very important consideration when deliberating as to what should be done in the future. We know that whilst Queensland and Western Australia stayed out of this compact, New South Wales, before submitting the Bill with the altered requirement as to a minimum of the electors to the people of the State, asked for certain alterations. One alteration consisted of a provision as to the location of the Capital in New South Wales; and the other-most pertinent that the Braddon clause, which the people of Australia had approved of, should be limited to ten years. Now, Mr. Speaker, I am quite sure that nobody ever thought for a moment that, in limiting the Braddon clause to ten years, it was intended, either by the representatives of the States, or by the people of the States who approved of the Bill in its amended form, that that ten years' period was to be the limit of time within which the States were to enjoy a large share of the Customs and Excise revenue. It was looked upon as a temporary expedient, to enable this Parliament and the people to acquire experience with regard to the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth. always expected, and expressed as expected, by all the leading thinkers upon Commonwealth .questions, that when the ten years' period'came to an end, instead of the Braddon section being allowed to expire altogether, some steps would be taken to substitute another arrangement of, perhaps, a modified character. Does any one suppose that, if the representatives of the States in the Convention had been told that this arrangement which they had made for. the sharing of the revenue was intended to be brought to a termination abruptly at the end of ten years, the Constitution would have been adopted by the States? I venture to say that there would have been one unanimous protest throughout Australia against the adoption of the Constitution under such circumstances. That consideration weighs with me very much. I consider it to be the starting point in this investigation. shows what the people .expected, and it shows more-that the people trusted the Mr Bruce Smith. Federal Parliament to recognise the state of things that existed, and, when the time came, to do something which would be a fair, reasonable, and just substitute for the arrangement which had been made in the first place. At the very outset I am confronted with a we are rather delicate consideration. This Bill is put before the House in such a way that at first sight it would seem that unless we adopt it in the form in which it stands, we run the risk of breaking up the whole of the arrangements which have been come to after great trouble, care, and patience, between the representatives of the States and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. But I am quite sure that the members of the Government-au d I am now here-was only repeating the sentiments so well expressed by .the honourable members for Mernda and Flinders-canno t expect their followers to adopt this Bill in its entirety without criticism and without claiming some right of modification if to them it seems desirable in any way to re-shape its provisions. I mention rather for the sake of the members of the party with which I am associated than for the information of the Opposition that we cannot forget that the published terms of our Fusion were of a definite character. We cannot forget that one of those terms was that the difficulty surrounding the continued operation of the Braddon section should be dealt with by. a renewal for a limited time, of about five It was years, in order to give the people and the representatives of the Commonwealth an opportunity to gain more experience of the true relationship between the States and the Commonwealth.",51
204,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is information.,52
205,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable gentleman may derive some satisfaction from my repetition, of-the published statement of the fact, but I am making it quite openly, because I think it is very necessary as a sort of apologia for the course which I may think it necessary to adopt by-and-by. If I thought the Government were going to look to their followers to give a hard and fast support to every detail of this measure, in regard to which they were not, and possibly necessarily so, consulted, I should think much less of them than I am inclined to at present. I want to give the lie, if I may use a strong but effective It expression that is parliamentary, to the taunt from the other side, that the whole of the honourable members on this side have been ""caucussed"" on this matter, and that every one is bound to support the agreement in every particular from A to Z. I want to say that there is no obligation of that kind on this side. There is no such caucus principle in existence in the conduct of this party. As a Liberal, and as one who hopes to remain an advocate of liberty to the end of his days, I can only say that honourable members opposite need have no fear that I or any of my colleagues on this side would agree to any kind of leg iron system under which we should be obliged to vote for proposals which our political consciences would dictate that we should oppose. I wish to say that this is a matter on which I at least claim some freedom. At the same time. I recognise the debatable character of the whole question. I recognise that on such a question men of equal ability may differ considerably with regard to details. Like all great financial questions, there are many and various sides to it, and our decision upon these different aspects of the problem will depend very much upon our experience in State matters and upon our temperament - whethe r we take an optimistic or a pessimistic view of the future of Australia. I noticed from some of the observations made by the honourable member for Flinders that whether because of a difference in temperament or because the honourable gen tleman has had Victorian, whilst I have had New South Wales, experience, he does not take quite so optimistic a view of the future of thefinancesof Australia as I do. That is a difference between us, for which neither is blamable; but it might well act as a turning point in deciding what our views will be regarding certain details of this measure. I recognise that the right consideration of the matter is not so clear and inevitable that all men who think straight must come to the same conclusion upon it. Every man who weighs this question in the scales of his mind, in all its aspects, must feel considerable' trepidation in endeavouring to force his against that of other capable men on so complex a matter. Although the conclusion at which .1 arrived differs very little from that reached by the honourable members for Mernda and Flinders, I am always prepared to hear whatever can be said by honourable members on either side so long as it is expressed in a proper analytical spirit and with a non-party desire to get at the root of things in dealing with this question. I have given a [134]- 2 good deal of consideration to the whole matter, as I hope every other honourable member has. Looking at the history of it as I have done, I have come to the conclusion that we must not forget that the public of Australia decided at one time to let the States have permanently a large proportion of the Customs revenue of this country. At the same time. I remember that that allowance was made under conditions which differentiated it entirely from the present proposal. The allowance represented a proportion, and the principle that the States had to take for better or worse the financial prospects of the Commonwealth was involved in it. In getting three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue of this country the States were obliged, as people have to do in married life, to share one another's fortune for better or worse. They had to agree that if the Commonwealth revenue fell to a very low figure, their revenues would also fall to a very low figure, and they enjoyed the prospect that if the Commonwealth revenue rose to a very high figure, they would participate in due proportion. But the proposal now under consideration differs from that arrangement in a very important particular. It is not a question of a proportion here. We are being asked to agree to a proposal under which, not a proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth, but a definite sum, based upon, a very high estimate of Federal revenue, is proposed to be given to the States in perpetuity. That is to say, we are called upon to relieve the States from all future anxiety with regard to their finances. This thought has occurred to me : Why should the States be relieved from financial anxiety in the future, and the Commonwealth left to risk all possible financial vicissitudes?",52
206,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Because the Commonwealth has the supreme power of taxation.  it was a gamble.,53
207,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable opinion member for Mernda says that the Commonwealth has unlimited power of taxation. I admit that, but I should like to remind the honourable member that the States also have a considerable power of taxation. As a New South Wales politician, I can well remember the time when, as a then Minister of the Crown in that State, we had a sufficient revenue from duties on intoxicants and narcotics and other minor taxes alonea splendid revenue without a land tax, without an income tax, and without high duties.",53

209,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ne w South Wales sold land of course, as every other State has done, but she did not obtain a very largerevenue from that source. I take the State of New South Wales as typical, and having regard to the fact that some of the States have now no land tax",54
210,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Some States have imposed a land tax.,54
211,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Some of them have done so, and some have imposed income taxes.",54
212,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Nearl y all have imposed land taxation.,54
213,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I submit that the State Governments, although limited, have still a sufficiently wide field of tion open to them to disentitle them of the right to immunity from all future financial anxiety. I do not see why the States should be given this immunity; why they should be relieved in this very summary way of all future financial doubt by having a fixed amount of Commonwealth revenue guaranteed to them when every one who gives this matter serious consideration must admit that there is considerable doubt whether the giving - of that security and immunity might not embarrass the Commonwealth in the future. That thought, at all events, is worthy of consideration, because there is no doubt that this proposal is made in that spirit.",54
214,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The States have to pay over £ 2 per capita interest on their debts.,54
215,Mr BRUQE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is so; but we know what is proposed to be done with the State debts. No doubt we shall take them off the hands of the States. That is a matter on which there is no difference of opinion.,54
216,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That goes against the 25s.,54
217,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No doubt; but all I am arguing now-and I am not putting it forward as a conclusive argument-is that in considering this matter we ought to have in our minds the question whether there is any obligation on the Commonwealth, at present, if it sees difficulty and possible embarrassment in the future, to relieve the States altogether of their anxiety, at the possible risk of creatthat ing greater, - anxiety for itself.",54
218,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will 25s. per capita relieve the States of anxiety in respect of their revenue?,54
219,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know that any money will ever relieve anybody-Governmen t or individual-of all anxiety. I am not arguingthat we ought not to do it on that account, because I am in favour of doing it in some ways, but at the same time. I think undue weight has been given to this desire to relieve the States, as if they were infants in this matter, from all anxiety as to their obligations, and to put them on a sound footing. The agreement really seems to assume that the States require some special treatment from the Commonwealth, because in it these words appear :That in order . . . to assure to the States a certain annual income, the Commonwealth shall . . . pay . . . . taxaI do not want to leave honourable members with a wrong impression as to my view. I do not think that objection is a sufficient reason for refusing some certain sum, but at the same time. I ' do not believe that undue weight ought to be given to the desire of the States to be relieved of anxiety, because we must remember that, whatever our powers of taxation may be, the effect of this agreement would be to relieve them whilst leaving the Commonwealth perhaps in an uncertain position. Honourable members will know therefore that there is a very great distinction between this definite guaranteed sum, come what may, being given to the States from the Commonwealth revenue, and a proportionate sum. There might be no reason why the States should not share the anxiety which the Commonwealth will have in the future with regard to the rise and fall of its revenue, because, undoubtedly, although it has not yet been done, an annual payment of £9,000,000 for interest will in the near future be thrown upon the Commonwealth. That would be a very, definite sum, and the Commonwealth therefore is facing some big certainties in the future, which fact should lead those who are inclined to take the States' view of this question, as distinguished from that of the Commonwealth, not to be so unconcernedly desirous of relieving the States of all anxiety as to their obligations. A good deal of argument has been used by one or two speakers on the other side to show there is no reason why any provision should be made at all. There is no burking the fact, that it would suit a certain section of the Opposition to see the States starved in. their revenues. -.",54

They would delight, if they could, to centre in this Legislature, at all events all the spending powers, and many of the legislative powers, of the States, instead of leaving them to be checkedby those encumbrances in the shape of Upper Houses. The ideal of the Labour party is, no doubt, unification. There is no escape from that.

It is a long way ahead, and we may not be able to see it at present, but it is the guiding star of a large part of the Labour party. In ordei to show, in answer to that sort of thought, that it was never intended that the Commonwealth should utilize its power to abruptly stop the contribution to the States by the Commonwealth of part of its revenue, I desire to read one sentence written in 1900 in an article in a magazine by the late Sir Edward Braddon. Speaking of the Customs and Excise duties, he said thatThey were recognised as specially earmarked . for the payment of interest on the national debt. Those words, some of the last that he published, appeared in an-article entitled "" My Blot."" That distinguished gentleman, who was one of the representatives of Tasmania, made it a sine qua non that there should be a division of the Customs and Excise revenue. He was the author of the section in the Constitution which forms the basis of our present discussion, and those words of his show the recognition, by a thoroughly impartial and statesmanlike authority, of the motive of that section. The late Leader of the Opposition, the right honourable member for East We Sydney, has said I never wished to allow the States less than a fair share of Customs and Excise revenuej House which is the only way in which the States can to receive revenue from the masses of their inhabitants. We have there two utterances of great value, one from the man who framed the Braddon section, and the other from the man who limited its operation to ten years by his intervention as Premier of one of the States. I leave the question there, because it is quite clear that it was intended all along, not only in the minds of those who helped to frame the Constitution, but ever since by thoughtful people who take a proper view of the relationship of the Commonwealth to the States, that the Customs revenue should always be the source from which the interest on the loans of the States should be paid from time to time. We have heard, too, a good deal about the policy of allowing the Commonwealth to dominate the States. Upon more than one occasion I have expressed my view by upon that question. We must remember that the Commonwealth did not create the States, but that the States created the Commonwealth. The Federal Convention was merely a meeting of the representatives of the States, for the purpose of determining what functions, they would concede to the Commonwealth, and what revenue they would allow it to collect in the interests of the people of Australia. When I hear honourable members-and especially honororable members opposite-talkin g as if this Parliament had consented to permit the States to come into existence, I am amazed at their political impudence. We have now had ten years' experience of Federation, and I am quite sure there is no honourable member of this House who will not honestly admit that he is wiser today in regard to the financial relationship which should exist between the States and the Commonwealth than; he was in 1901. In that year we were all able to use our imaginations in reference to the future of Australia, but none of us could exactly foresee what has taken place. To that extent we are far better informed today, and far more capable of deciding upon the future financial relationship of the States and the Commonwealth than we were then. I go further, and say that in 1920 we shall be as much wiser than we are today as we are wiser now than we were then. I have no doubt that some honourable members of today will be politically dead in 1920, but I venture to hope that some of us will be as alive as we are today. Seeing how much wisdom we have gained since 1901, and how much more capable we are of dealing with this question now than we were then, I repeat that we ought very 'seriously to consider whether we are as well qualified to make any permanent alteration in our Constitution today as we shall be ten years hence. I notice that a great many honourable members are prone to view the Constitution very much as they do an Act of Parliament. I am not. I have a very profound respect-even a reverence-for our Constitution. It is literally the. Magna Charta of Australia. It is certainly the greatest legislative charter we have ever had, and it is one which requires a great deal of technical knowledge, either to alter with advantage or to amend without disadvantage. I do not think that our Constitution ought at any time-if that course can be avoided-to be made the battle-ground of political parties. It is a document which we should not only treat reverentially ourselves, but which we should teach the public to treat in the same spirit. should be taught to regard it as the nationaldeed of partnership. I object flippant talk regarding its alteration-I do not say that much of such talk has been indulged in either by honourable members upon this side of the House or by honourable members opposite-but there is a disposition to speak lightly about altering our Constitution in connection with any Act of Parliament which happens to be declared ultra vires of it. the past I'.ii'^teen months the new Protection policy was brought forward, and the glib reply given to the assertion that such legislation was ultra vires of the Constitution was : "" Then let us alter the Constitution."" So, upon frequent occasions we have men who seem blind to the sanctity of our Constitution, and who talk lightly about altering it. Need I remind honourable members that even the articles of association of a trading company are not altered in a light way. When it is desired to. alter them. I am now comparing the Mr Bruce Smith. great with the small-the shareholders have to be called together, and afforded a most explicit explanation of the reason underlying the alteration. Legal authorities have to be employed to advise as to the direction in which such articles should be altered. Yet some persons talk as if an alteration of our Constitution was a matter to be treated as irresponsibly as is the placing of an Act of Parliament upon our statute-book. I ' repeat that we ought to regard our Constitution with great sanctity, and that we ought not to make a series of amendments in it from time to time. It seems to me that if one party in this Parliament utilizes its majority in a party spirit to effect an alteration in our ConstitutionI do not say that such a thing is being attempted here, because I am sure that the Government expect to get support for their proposals from the whole House-it s successors may be depended upon to attempt in turn to alter it again.",55
225,Mr ARCHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They would have first to get the consent of the people.,56
226,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am quite aware of that. But I have already pointed out that irrespective of whether or not they succeeded, they would embroil the people of the Commonwealth in a struggle in regard to an alteration of our Constitution. Now, every such alteration requires the possession of technical knowledge. It is too abstruse a question to be satisfactorily settled in the absence of such They knowledge. The public-especiall y the man in the street-d o not care to to be troubled with questions of this sort. They understand Acts of Parliament because they deal with concrete things with which they are familiar. But when contending political factions are endeavouring to impress upon them the reason why a technical alteration should be effected in our Constitution, or the reason why it should be resisted, their attention is diWithin verted from their true function which is to deal with legislative policies. In other words, they are asked to decide abstruse questions with which they are not familiar - a task for which, as a whole, they are not fitted.",56
227,Mr STORRER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They had to approve of the draft Commonwealth Constitution.,56
228,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Of course. We had no Constitution until one had been drafted. At the last general elections we know that an alteration was effected in our Constitution in regard to the holding of the State elections. But I would ask the honourable member for Bass to note that that amendment was made with the common consent of politicians. The public were ever}'where told that the matter involved was not a controversial one. They were informed that the proposed amendment was intended to enable economies to be effected in connection with the expenditure upon our general elections, and that, therefore, it might be made with safety. Alterations of the Constitution should be reserved for occasions of that sort ? As a rule, they should not be made unless the' representatives of the people, recognising its sanctity, agree as to the necessity which exists for such amendments. I understand that the Government contend that such an occasion has now arisen. I sympathize with their position to a very large extent, though I do not think that an amendment of the ''Constitution has become absolutely necessary. They affirm that this particular portion of our Constitution has expired. The period of ten years is nearly at an end, and it becomes necessary to substitute a provision. The Constitution' provides a method, because section 87 contains the words "" until the Parliament otherwise provides."" Therefore the House is in a position to create a substituted method for that which is contained in the section. But then the other question arises : How can we give any sort of permanence to a provision which is put into an ordinary Act of Parliament?",56
229,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear.",57
230,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honora able member will bear with me, shall meet that objection. I quite admit that if we merely passed an danger at one time? Act embodying some substituted provision for that which is contained in Minister. section 87 of the Constitution, and a party from the other side came into, power and disapproved of it, all that it would have do would be to repeal the Act without pealing to the people. But I submit to the House that there is an alternative. There is a method which we have already adopted, and by which we can give, withBut out touching the Constitution, considerable permanency, and considerable sanctity, an arrangement of that sort. When wanted to make an arrangement with Imperial Government in regard to the naval subsidy, we did not merely pass an Act Parliament, but we authorized the Governam ment of the day to enter into a definite agreement with the Imperial Government for a period of ten years to contribute to naval expenditure a certain amount per annum. There we did not embody an agreement in an Act, but we authorized the Government to enter into a solemn agreement with another power. I want to submit to the House that when this matter is left by section 87 of the Constitution in the hands of Parliament, it would be just as open to us to authorize the Government to enter into an agreement with the States for ten or fifteen or more years, on the understanding that it shall involve the annual payment of a certain sum. Any Government which disapproved of it would hesitate very much before they would embark upon the repudiation of the contract which had been deliberately entered into with the authority of the House. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There is the agreement with the Orient Steam-ship Company.",57
231,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is not a parallel in the mail agreement, for this reason: that the House authorized the Government to enter into a contract with the company.",57
232,Mr CROUCH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There have been attempts made to alter the naval agreement.,57
233,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have already mentioned that. In regard to the mail agreement there is this distinction, that under it a public company acquired legal rights and could sue the Commonwealth. But in a case of this sort, the Imperial Government would never think of taking such a step against the Commonwealth for breach of its naval agreement. Yet it I had the sanction of this House.",57
234,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Was it not in a little,57
235,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Onl y from the Prime,57
236,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not talking of clanger, because I know that there to might be all sorts of dreams as to what was apgoing to be done. I do not think it was ever contemplated to commit a breach of that agreement without some mutual arrangement between the contracting parties. there is before the House another agreement, in which the same principle is to involved. An agreement has been entered we into between South Australia and the the Commonwealth Government for the purchase of the Northern Territory, and it is of embodied in an Act. It is proposed- I not speaking of whether it will be endorsed or not, but it shows that it is a feasible proposal-that this House should affirm the arrangement entered into by the Government. Will any honourable member say that if that agreement were entered into in pursuance of that Act this House I do not care what party was in powerwould ever think of repudiating it? I venture to think that it would not. I believe, however, that the people of this country would rise as a body if any attempt were made to commit a breach of such a contract or compact. The South Australian Government would, if they liked, the able to sue the Commonwealth. Under the agreement I am proposing, the States would also be able to sue the Commonwealth, although everybody knows that it would be impossible to get a remedy of a satisfactory character; such an arrangement would depend upon the sense of honesty and of honourable dealing on the part of the people of Australia. It is, however, a course which might be adopted if we determine in the end to accept a proposal which has been made by the honourable members for Mernda and Flinders to renew this provision for a fixed .period instead 'of giving it the permanency which is proposed.",57
237,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That would mean setting aside the agreement.,58
238,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not necessarily-it should be remembered that it is really not an agreement in the ordinary sense of the word. It is not an agreement by which the States undertake to give us something, and we undertake to give them something in return. It is rather a statement of the terms which the States will be willing to accept as an arrangement between the Commonwealth and themselves. Mr MCWILLIAMS,-And which the Government were prepared to give.",58
239,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And which the Government did give, subject to the approval of Parliament. I know that the honourable member represents a State-and I admire his patriotism-which ' is very anxious that this agreement in its entirety should be adopted. That is, of course, an obligation on every honourable member representing a particular State. But I remind the honourable member that there is another obligation, and that is in regard to the interests of the Commonwealth. If he finds himself in a. measure stereotyped in his view of the matter, he would do well to ask whether, although it might suit Tasmania, it is the best thing that can be done for Australia. I am mvself trying to look at this question from an Australian stand-point, and I am keeping in my mind the deed of partnership of the Commonwealth as distinct from the individual interests of my own State. I know that in its case, this conitribution of 25s. per capita-on e which I heartily approve of as a very fair compromise-involve s the concession of about ,£1,000,000 a year, which will go for distribution amongst most of the other States. But notwithstanding that it involves that loss, I am perfectly prepared to abide by the 25s. per capita. My chief doubt is 'between a proposal for permanency embodied in the Constitution, and a proposal for a period of ten or fifteen years embodied in an agreement authorized by this House to be entered into by the - Government. I have spoken of «the experience which we have acquired since' 1901. I have very little doubt that, however much we know-and we know a great deal, for we are, no doubt, a very wise body-w e shall be wiser at the end of ten years. We have not, I think, yet arrived at that finality pf knowledge with regard to the relationship of the States to the Commonwealth which justifies us in making a final revision of our Constitution. There is another point which is of importance. We have always considered that at some time the debts of the States should be transferred to the Commonwealth, .and that the latter should undertake the gradual conversion of them. I have very little doubt that, under the Constitution, not only will the Commonwealth take over the debts existing at the time of Federation., but all subsequent debts up to the date of the conversion. I want honourable members to notice that this agreement does not bind the States in any way. A ll that the Premiers of the States have undertaken to do in consideration of this guarantee of 25s. per capita for all time is to consent to an investigation. AVe have already heard whispers of little birds with regard to the attitude of the States. We know that they .are bound by the Constitution to hand over their debts at the time of Federation.. We also know that they are not bound to hand over subsequent debts. And we know that the States are not yet prepared even to forego their right of borrowing, or to agree to the Commonwealth being the common medium through which all future debts shall be made in the interests of Australia. I have never thought it desirable that the States should be prevented from borrowing ; but I think they should be asked to agree to do their borrowing through the Commonwealth. Whether the Commonwealth will or will not be able to borrow at a rate of interest lower than that which the States at present have to pay-judgin g by Mr Coghlan's account of his interviews with London financiers I doubt if it can-ever y one knows that it will be recognised as desirable in Great Britain, and wherever else our debenture stock may circulate, that the State loans should be raised through one borrowing power. But we have not yet succeeded in inducing the States to recognise the unmistakable advantage which would accrue to Australia from having its stock known as Australian stock. In a very able leading article which recently appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, the writer, referring to this matter, saidMr Deakin has told us that every London financial magnate to whom the subject of the transfer of the State debts has been mentioned has warmly endorsed the proposal, and said it would improve the credit enjoyed by Australia. But have the suggested terms of transfer been explained to those gentlemen, and the peculiar conditions which would then exist in this country ? We doubt it wholly. What are those conditions? New South Wales we have borrowed over £90,000,000, but the security is abundant. We pay about 3^ per cent, interest, or, roughly, £3) 150,000 per annum. But our railways and tramways yield a net £2,300,000; the Harbor Trust, £230,000; the Water and Sewerage Boards, £362,000; the ""Rocks"" resumptions, £33,000: and interest from country towns reaches £29,000, making £2,954,000 per annum received direct; while, in addition, there is on the capital side £r,300,000 owing to the Government from farmers under the closer settlement scheme; £7,800,000 is due on other Government lands purchased;, and the annual land revenue of £875,000, which arose mainly from the expenditure on railways represents a capital value of another £25,000,000. There is no question about our superabundant live assets as security. But if the Commonwealth takes over our £90,000,000 of debt, which will be its assets? As a matter of fact, it will have none. But the 25s. per head liability to the States will be appropriated, and for the rest its solvencv will be wholly dependent upon large contributions from the States. It went on to sayWe may take it for granted that those Lonplete don magnates who said that the transfer of the debts would be a good thing, fully believed that all the State assets now"" forming the seThis curity for the debts would go with the liabilithe ties. In our view, the transfer of the debts involves an ultimate control over the greatest moneys. State asset-w e refer to the railways, on a 3^ per cent, basis, would offset £66,000,000 of the New South Wales debt. Sir 'George Turner at the first Conference vestigation. (Finance) Bill. 3753actually proposed that the Commonwealth should have a lien upon the gross railway receipts, and it is the one thing which would give the Commonwealth supremacy in the eyes of the money-lenders. The Australian railways are a visible .security covering £170,000,000 of the debts.",58
240,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is New South Wales prepared to. transfer her railways to the Commonwealth?,59
241,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member asks a conundrum which he is as 1 well able to answer' as I am, and it applies to all the States. If we have respect and reverence for the 'Constitution, we shall hesitate about making alterations from time to time, each of which may be fought for and against by political parties in connection with their policies, and shall allow matters to be matured, so that a grand conclusion which can be embodied in the Constitution for all time by one alteration may be arrived at. It is proposed that the Commonwealth shall pay to the States, for all time, irrespective of what its revenue may be, 25s. per capita. We do not know the attitude of the States regarding the debts question. We have to induce them to consent, not only to the transfer of the debts incurred since Federation, but to the institution of such HeTe in a sinking fund as they and we may think requisite to give greater security for future borrowings in the Mother Country. We have also to induce them to consent to borrow through the Commonwealth at such convenient times as will enable the best results to be obtained. The agreement merely provides that there shall be an investigation. The States may well say, "" We consent to that; but the adoption of the recommendations of the investigating Commission is another matter.""",59
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is more than that in the agreement.,59
243,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If my honorajble friend thinks that I have not done the agreement justice, let me read it in full. It is this:That to fulfil the intention of the Constitution by providing for the :consolidation and transfer of State debts, and in order to insure the most profitable management of future loans by the establishment of one Australian Stock a cominvestigation of this most important subject shall .be undertaken forthwith by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. investigation shall include the question of actual cost to the States of transferred properties as defrayed out of loan or revenue which, That is only an elaboration of what I have said; a determination to nave an in",59
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wit h a view to taking over the debts of the States.,60
245,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . I must not be understood to affirm that the States are not generally willing to transfer their debts to the Commonwealth; it is about the conditions of transfer that difficulty will arise. The States which are in wise hands will recognise, as we do, the advantage of unifying Australian stock, arid of borrowing through the Commonwealth, but they may not readily agree to the establishment of a sinking fund, or to forego the right to borrow individually. As suggested by the honourable member for Wakefield, that may be a bone of contention. If we can discover a way of doing what is required as a temporary substitute for the Braddon section without at once altering the Constitution, reserving to ourselves the right, ten or fifteen years hence, to refuse or to allow its continuance on condition that the whole of the remaining questions are dealt with satisfactorily, the time may arrive when we shall be in a better positiom to formulate all the necessary amendments in one grand alteration of the Constitution. That is the line of thought which has occurred to me, and I confess that I have arrived at such a conclusion quite irrespective of party considerations, and yet with a desire to do something that is within the four corners of this agreement. I ask honourable members to carefully study the agreement. The first part provides for an investigation in regard to the consolidation, transfer, and unification of loans. In the second part we have the statement:That in order to give freedom to the Comfund monwealth in levying duties of Customs and Excise and to assure to the States a certain annual income, the Commonwealth shall, after the ist day of July, 1910, pay monthly to the States, a sum calculated at the rate of 25s. per annum per head of the population, according to the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. This is not such an agreement-and this is n very important distinction to noticebetween the States and the Commonwealth, that if we do not follow it exactly the States may declare it at an end. States are not in a position to declare, if we do not follow it exactly, that the whole thing is "" of f . "" I do not say that in a dominating spirit as one speaking on behalf of the Commonwealth. My sole contention is that this is not an agreement, within the legal definition of a contract. in not a contract in which there is a request, a promise, and a consideration. Those elements are all wanting. It is simply an embodiment of the terms which the States are willing to accept in settling the question of the continuance of the provisions of the Braddon section. It is not a contract in the ordinary sense of the word, and, therefore, if the Parliament were to say, "" We will keep as close to the agreement as we possibly can,"" there is nothing that the States could do which would nullify our efforts. The matter is entirely in our hands. Let me say again that I do not make that observation in the spirit that we are "" on top,"" and can do what we please. On the contrary, I recognise that we are bound to make an honest allocation of the revenue of the Commonwealth. If this agreement has been arrived at, subject to the approval of Parliament, then I submit that Parliament has a perfect right to vary it in some slight degree. Respecting the wishes of the States, and thinking their desires fair, we can go as near as practicable to an endorsement of it. If we recognise that it is simply an embodied form of agreement between the States and the Commonwealth, I think that we cart go very near compliance with it. Possibly there is a very large number of honourable members, even on the Opposition side of the House, who would favour for a term of ten or fifteen years some definite provision for the States, pending the acquirement of more information, experience, and knowledge of our relationship with them, leaving it open to the States subsequent to the proposed investigation to say, "" We are perfectly prepared to hand over the debts on these terms, and to provide for a sinking and for the unification of the debts of Australia.""",60
246,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why not leave it open for the life of a Parliament only?,60
247,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member and I would differ very much on that point. I believe the time is coming when the Parliament will have to delegate to outside bodies a very large proportion of its work. The whole tendency of Legislatures throughout Australia is to deleThe gate to Commissions the administration of large Departments. That has been done in connection with the railways of the States. It is being done in regard to the State Departments of Land, and I believe it will be followed coming in connection with the Departments of It Public Works. The less Parliaments have to do with these great Departments, which largely involve matters of administration, the more time they will have for passing wise legislation. Our time in this House is already too largely occupied with matters that are really""not of a legislative character. I am very desirous, if possible, of helping on a settlement of this question, but I do not think that the Government should contend, for a moment, that its own followers ought to be prepared to absolutely endorse every word of the agreement. The honourable member for Mernda has dealt with the question very dispassionately. He has shown, as he always does, that he has individuality, and that he looks at such questions apart from narrow party considerations. The honourable member for Flinders has done the same, and I hope that I am a humble follower of those honourable members in showing that I , too, possess some individuality. At the same time. I do not want in any way to make difficulties. I merely want to see the Government and the Parliament do something that is compatible with the interests of Australia, ancl that we shall not conflict in any way with the respect that ought to lie shown for our Constitution. I do not desire to see the Commonwealth give away all that is to be given away on our part, leaving the States to hesitate about conforming to the conclusions which the proposed investigation may open up for us. If the question of the debts were not outstanding-if this were the only question involved- I should be very glad to see a final settlement of it embodied in the Constitution. But there are still outstanding many financial problems which must come up within the next year or two and their settlement in this way would resolve itself into a series of piece-meal alterations of the Constitution. I wish to avoid that. All my reading of history and, indeed, my reading generally, has satisfied me that where a country is blessed with a written Constitution such as the United States of America, the Commonwealth, and some of the States have, itslegislators should - share the feelings of its greatest men in regarding the Constitution as too serious to be tampered with, and not to be made the battlefield of political parties. What would be the effect if this matter were submitted as a proposed amendment of the Constitution at the end of this Parliament? It would mean that we should embark on a general election in which, on the one hand, we called on the people to decide between two .opposing parties on a number of political issues, and, on the other hand, we should present to them, as if there were not difficulty enough in deciding between Socialism and Anti-Socialism, more than one proposed alteration in the Constitution. That would be enough to make the average voter's head ache. It is enough for a man who is skilled in reading these technically-worded documents to go through them with care, and trace their effect; and there is not one man in ten thousand in the community who has a copy of the Constitution by him, and not one in a hundred thousand who knows anything of the experience we have had in this Chamber of the relations of the Commonwealth and of the States. There is not one in ten thousand who knows exactly how the States stand in regard to loans from a Commonwealth point of view. We should, therefore, be asking the people to do a very difficult-almos t an impossiblething; and the question that presents itself is-and I say this more to my own party than to my opponents- whether in Committee we can possibly approach as closely as possible to the fulfil ment of this agreement without involving the Commonwealth in a permanent undertaking, until we know exactly what the States are prepared to do with regard to their debts.",60
248,Mr CROUCH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-Without the referendum?,61
249,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The referendum is necessary only in order to alter the Constitution ; I am not thinking, ancl I do not suppose that any one is, of the referendum, except for the purpose of an alteration.",61
250,Mr CROUCH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-Does the honourable member think that this is a subject which would be understood if it went to a referendum?,61
251,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not. Of course there are hundreds of thousands of people just as intelligent and capable as we are to decide this question if they had the time, and if they hacl by them all the papers that we have at our disposal for its elucidation. But how many people have those papers and that knowledge? Are they to be supplied with copies, and also with copies of the agreement, and with a statement of the conditions which now surround the obligations of the States to the Mother Country in regard to the debts?  speeches made on both sides ! Mr Bruce "" SMITH - That would simply annihilate the electors! If the whole of the speeches delivered by the Opposition were forced on the people who elected them to Parliament, I should have some satisfaction in knowing that the Fusion Government were going to be in office for the next ten years. If I could be sure that all the constituents of honourable members opposite would be compelled to read all the speeches delivered on this side, I should know that none of the honourable members opposite would be again elected to Parliament; and that would be another source of satisfaction. However, these matters do not come into practical politics, and I do not desire to occupy mere than my share of time.",61
252,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is a second Bill on the paper for the taking over of the jalance of the debts.,62
253,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is another Bill for a second proposed alteration of the Constitution, with regard to the public debts.",62

255,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yen: it proposes that section 105 of the Constitution shall be altered by the omission of the words "" as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth,"" thus making the provision a general one, with the effect of enabling the Commonwealth to take over all the debts. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The States may not let the Commonwealth take over all the debts.",62
256,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the referendum were in favour of the proposed alteration of the Constitution, the States would be bound by the vote.",62
257,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Moreover , the States are quite willing.",62
258,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That does not dispose of the difficulty to which I am referring- I wish it did. The States do not agree to confine themselves to a unified debt; that is to say, they do not agree not to borrow in the future, or to give up their right of further borrowing, and that is a very important point. I do not desire to prevent the States from borrowing, but, as I said, I desire them to borrow through the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth being responsible for the debts and the States sponsible to the Commonwealth for the interest. But that would require agreement, and the States would have to consent to such a plan, because the alteration proposed in the second Bill does not deal with that question.",62
259,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Would the honourable member leave it to the Commonwealth to say when the States should borrow, and how much?",62
260,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not without consulting the States. In June last I issued a pamphlet dealing with the anti-Socialist platform, and I have not changed the opinions I therein expressed. In that pamphlet I saidThe near approach of the termination, of the Braddon-clause period renders it imperative that no further delay should' be permitted in the settlement of the several complex financial problems which confront the Federal Legislature; and, since Parliament contains few men who are, by experience, qualified to advise as to the best, most economical, and impartial non-party solution of those questions. There is part of the quotation lost hereThe appointment for a term of years, _ or permanently, of a Board of Non-political National-Finance Commissioners, to advise the Government and the Parliament from time to time :(a) As to the best and most equitable method of providing for the future apportionment of the Federal revenue between the Commonwealth and the States. (i) As to the best and most economical terms of arrangement with the States, for the transference of the States National debts to the Commonwealth. (f) As to the best and most economical method of negotiating Commonwealth loans for the future, whether for State or Commonwealth purposes. As to the question of the honourable member for Wilmot, I would not place in the hands of the Commonwealth itself the right to determine how and when State loans should be floated, but I should like to see established a body of financial authorities outside Parliament whose business it would be, with the help of the States-becaus e the States would be represented on the body --to investigate and decide these questions. Of course, the object of preventing the States from floating loans will be understood. In the past we have had the States, with no discipline, borrowing one on the top of the other, sometimes raising two or three loans in six months, and then allowing twelve or eighteen months to elapse without raising any further loans. This very much re- inconvenienced that section of the London money market in which our loans circulate.",62
261,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Practicall y it made no difference.,62
262,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I said advisedlv "" that section,"" because I know that our little loans bear about the same relationship to the transactions of the London Stock Exchange as the few coppers we may give to our children bear to our incomes. But there is a particular class of men with whom we have to deal in regard to the underwriting of our loans; and it has been considered to be a disadvantage to them that Australian loans have sometimes been floated one on top of another within a short period. I would have the States represented on any such financial body as I have indicated, so that each State could be consulted from time to time as to its requirements, and as to the amount of loan money of which each would desire to avail itself. I hope that the States would enjoy the advantage of a smaller rate of interest by reason of the whole of the business being done through one London office. There is no doubt that the High Commissioner, whoever he may be will have a great deal to do with the regulating of these matters in London. 1 should, however, like to express my doubt as to whether the Commonwealth is going to do this business much more cheaply than the States can do it. Those of us who have taken advantage of the opportunity of reading a paper written by Mr Coghlan on this very question, will remember that he said that, as the result of his consultations with leading London financiers, he had come to the conclusion that there would be no advantage at present in the Commonwealth dealing with loan business instead of the States.",63
263,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He said that after a little while, when the Commonwealth stock was established, the results would be better.",63
264,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have no wish to fight for Mr Coghlan's conclusions. I am glad that he said "" after a little while,"" though that is a very vague expression. It is the sort of expression that a Minister will use to a deputation, when he tells them that he will consider their request "" after a little while."" But when we federated, - there was no doubt that the prospects of the Commonwealth promised us unmistakably a cheaper money market. It was calculated that there would be a saving of something like from £500,000 to £1,000,000 a year in interest by the floating of our loans through the Commonwealth. But I must confess to a doubt as to whether we should stand very much better than on a par with the senior States at present as to borrowing rates No one who looks through the English money market reports can fail to have noticed the fluctuations in the value of Australian stocks. In some cases you see South Australian stock at a higher value than that of New South Wales. Sometimes you see Western Australian and Tasmanian stock as high as any of them. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Higher .",63
265,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Well , higher, if the honourable member prefers it ; I merely wish to state the fact that there are unaccountable fluctuations. But when once a Commonwealth stock is established, and it is recognised that there is a certain term during which all State loans are to be-floated, I am perfectly satisfied, notwithstanding the rather pessimistic note struck by the Sydney Daily Telegraph with regard to the assets all being held by the States, that there will be a lower rate of interest for the Commonwealth than has been obtained by the States. I desire to say, in conclusion, that I am very anxious to do all I can to help in formulating a scheme that shall follow as near as possible the agreement. I am not in favour of embodying the agreement in the Constitution. But we are not bound by the letter of the agreement; and I should be in favour of the extension of whatever provision is going to be made for the States for a term of ten or fifteen years; because I believe that at the end of that time we should be in a. better position to determine what ought to be the final arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States. At all events, I hope that the arrangement made will be of such a character as will be for the future advantage of the whole Australian people.",63
266,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Macquarie) [9.39] - I wish it to be distinctly understood that I have no antipathy to State rights. I believe that, although the Braddon section expires next year, and relieves us of a certain obligation, there are, nevertheless, implied obligations in the Constitution which render it necessary for us to do something for the States. That is obvious, although, as the last speaker said, we are undoubtedly in a. position to dictate our own terms. Apparently, the State Premiers have realized that, in accepting conditions at the last Conference inferior to those that they were willing to accept on former occasions. However, I am certainly opposed to any permanency in the arrangement that is made, and particularly to the permanency of such an arrangement as proposed by the Government. In the first place, I should like to refer briefly to speech of the Prime Minister upon this subject. He told us that while the States would in future be limited in their sources of income, the whole range of taxation was sacrifice. open to the Commonwealth, and that, therefore, we never need fear any shortage of income. But later, in the same speech, the Prime Minister, to my surprise, dilated upon the possibility of receiving all of those who are taxed. the income we should need, through Customs, even after paying the 25s. capita to the States. The observation contective veyed to my mind, rightly or wrongly, that the Prime Minister, as the arch-priest of Protection, must have fallen from grace. How could he, as one of the strongest advocates Australia has known of thing like £ 1 gs. per head. what is called our national policy, ever hope that our return from Cushead. toms and Excise would ultimately be facts, greater than the receipts per head in other Protectionist countries of the world? In concluding his speech, the tendency honourable gentleman said that he really thought there would be no need for direct taxation, and that anyhow, although the whole field of taxation was open to us, rect taxation would only be adopted as last resource. I was very sorry to hear inequitable way. that. I say again, that the remark showed a decided 'defection on the part of the up Protection. Prime Minister from the course which 1 understand he has shaped for h'imseH throughout his political life. He New Zealand as receiving £$ ios. per head from Customs revenue, and hoped life, for the day when the Commonwealth might even receive so much. At all events, was quite sure that we should receive much as £2 ios. per head. That clearly indicates not a protective Tariff, but a to some extent with my own views. revenue Tariff, or both-that is to say, highly protective Tariff and a revenue Tariff together, which would be nearly as the bad as an absolute revenue Tariff. As to the possibilitv of the two co-existing, I sentcommunity, point out that it is possible for high tective duties to operate for the encourage ment of local industries when those duties ring this matter to the people. are imposed on goods which are made here, whilst a purely revenue Tariff might the people. also operate on goods which we cannot produce here. In that way we might repeople decide. ceive an enormous revenue. But at what, expense? At the expense of imposing taxation on the wrong people. I come the conclusion that a revenue Tariff does impose taxation on the backs of the wrong Mr Carr. is people. Pitt said : ' ' We must tax the people in a way that they do not underthe stand, and then there will be no trouble about it . "" But I object to that form of taxation. We do not want equality of taxation in this country; but equality of That is the objective towards which I am making. I thought that the Prime Minister also stood for equality of sacrifice in taxation, and not for equality of taxation irrespective of the resources To know the how futile it is to expect an adeper quate income from any form of a ProTariff it is necessary only to consider the revenue derived from the operation of such Tariffs in other countries. In the United States the revenue derived from Customs and Excise is only someIn the United Kingdom it is about £ 1 ns. per We have only to consider these in conjunction with the contention of the honourable member for Flinders this afternoon, that as a country develops the is for its per capita returns from Customs and Excise to decrease, to see that the case is indeed hopeless, if , as the Prime Minister hoped we should, we are dito confine ourselves to revenue from those a sources, unless we tax the people in an",63
267,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And unless we give Mr 'CARR - Of course, if we do not cited give up Protection we must impose heavy burdens of taxation on the necessities of a policy which is strongly opposed on this side. On the statement made by the he Prime Minister I could not support this as proposal. I am prepared to support some measure of this kind, but it must coincide I a have a free hand on the question, but I cannot support a scheme which involves extraction of the bulk of our revenue the from the pockets of the poorer classes in whose interests I have been here specially to protect. A good prodeal has been said, particularly by the Prime Minister, as to the safety of referWe have been asked why we should not trust If we do not approve of the proposal, we are asked to let the But I say that we are here as delegates of the people, and it is one of our functions to decide what is to worthwhile submitting to them. We are the judges in the first instance, and if in our judgment a certain proposal is objectionable, or would be unfair and unjust in its operation, it is our duty to oppose its reference to the people. When we come to a decision amongst ourselves that it is desirable to alter the Constitution, it will then obviously be our duty to refer the proposed alteration to them. I say that, no matter how broad our franchise may be, or how high our opinion of Democracy, we must be governed by delegation. Otherwise we can have no progress. Often enough we have no progress with a delegation, but we must arrive at a conclusion as delegates before we ask the whole of the body politic to express an opinion. The people have not moved in this matter so far. We have not heard of any agitation by the public, or that public meetings are being held in connection with it. There has been no instance of a desire on the part of the people to preserve intact the present relations between the Commonwealth and the States. As a matter of fact, the opposite view has found expression to some extent. A petition has been presented to this House signed by 50,000 of the people of Australia, and its terms are in direct opposition to the object of the present proposal to perpetuate the present distinction between the States and the Commonwealth instead of merging the States more than ever in the Commonwealth. So far as the people have spoken on this matter their views are in favour of unification. The Prime Minister has been guided by the opinions of the Premiers who assembled at the recent Conference. I have a word or two to say on that, because I regard that Conference as the source from which this proposal has emanated. It seems to me that whether designedly or not this proposal comes from one party - in Australian politics. There is no denying that fact. I do not say that the people concerned intended deliberately to forward certain party aims, but the proposal emanates from a Conference the representatives at which belonged to a political party that is one in sentiment and aim throughout Australia. It is significant that two of the Premiers attending the Conference maintained their positions by very precarious majorities. I think that they could claim a majority of only one in their State Parliaments, and this has led in Queensland to an appeal to the people. It is a still more significant fact that the Fusion Government which was represented by the Prime Minister at the Conference has never yet had the sanction of the people of Australia. Honourable members opposite do not yet know whether the Fusion would receive the endorsement of the public, and they obviously hesitate to appeal to the public for endorsement. I would say in passing that while I should net favour the adoption of obstructive tactics, the manner in which the Government have been conducting the business of the country has led me to attribute to them a desire to provoke rancorous discussion in this House. I say that they should have gone to the people, and they would then have been in a position to know whether they have public endorsement for their proposals. They were represented at the Conference without the endorsement of the public ; two of the State representatives had reason to be very doubtful as to the position which they held in the eyes of the public, and one of them is now testing public opinion, and in view of all these circumstances, and of the fact that all attending the Conference belonged to one political party, it is only natural that the proposals they put forward should be coloured by the opinions of that party. While I do not accuse them of any deliberate design, I say that it is only natural to suppose that in the circumstances the Premiers would support the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister would support them. I anticipate that the whole matter will have to be fought out at the polls, and I shall welcome the day when the conflict is transferred to the wider arena. The agreement was drafted in secret, and we have been left to. make our own deductions as to the compromises which led up to the definite proposals which we understand are to be made. They have not yet been made, and we do not know exactly what they will be. We have now only to discuss the question whether there should be an alteration of the Constitution which will make the Federal revenue from Customs and Excise subject for ever and a day to am annual contribution to the States of - 25s. per head of their population. I have pointed out that there is no Protective Tariff in operation in the world today returning a revenue which would permit of such a payment, and leave enough for the Government to carry on its own affairs.",64
268,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What about New Zealand?,65
269,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I said with regard to the New Zealand Tariff that it is essentially a revenue producing Tariff. If it is tective, it is only in part, and it is made revenue producing to a great extent by the fact that it includes heavy imposts upon the necessaries of life, goods which people will have and which cannot be made in New Zealand.",65
270,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The percentage in New Zealand on dutiable goods is higher than in the Commonwealth.,66
271,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I say that the New Zealand Tariff is a revenue Tariff, and I am opposed to such a Tariff. I have said before that it is only by making our Tariff essentially a revenue producing Tariff that we could hope to raise enough revenue to enable us to give the State Governments 25s. per head of their population, and have sufficient left to carry out Federal proposals. If our Tariff should fall to the level of the United States Tariff, and return only £ 1 9s. per head, how should we be able to carry on the great affairs of the Commonwealth? If we gave 25s. per head to the States, we should be left with only 4s. per head to meet the financial obligations of the Commonwealth. would be an absolutely ridiculous position in which to place ourselves. force us at once to the imposition of direct taxation. In regard to the public debts, the Prime Minister spoke of some arrangement having been made. He did not state what it was, but we are led to understand that a proposal is being made for permission to bring in a Bill to allow the Commonwealth to take over the State debts as they exist today, rather than as they existed at the time of Federation. Under the Constitution we have the right to take over the State debts as they existed then, but further power is required to deal with the balance incurred since Federation. The Prime Minister, however, added, when referring to some arrangement of the kind, that there was no chance of the States parting with their assets. If we are to deal with the State debts, to saddle ourselves with the payment of £9,000,000 a year in interest, we should have some setoff from the States. We should require from them some of their large assets-the railways particularly.",66
272,Mr TILLEY BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is there any chance of getting them?,66
273,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am quite prepared to refer that matter tr, the people. I have every confidence in their judgment. If the people do not want that to be done, well and good. But if the peopje cannot pro- trust their Federal representatives, neither can they trust their State representatives. That again brings me to the point that the proposal now before us emanated from one political party, who are anxious to retain for the. States all the powers, privileges, and prestige that they can, because under the State system of government they have a limited franchise which secures and conserves the privileges-no t the rights-of those who control the large vested interests of this country, more effectively than they would be conserved under the Commonwealth system of government. That is the big reason looming behind what has been submitted to us. We cannot go on the money markets of the world and command the easy terms that we should be able to command unless our finances are backed up by the assets which set off the enormous public debt of Australia, amounting to some £250,000,000. The Prime Minister said that £180,000,000 of the debt is represented by tramways and railways. It is, therefore, only logical that if we take over the debts we should take That over those railways and tramways. In fact, that is absolutely essential, if our dealings It would with the States are to be placed on anything like a business footing. Now is the time for us to dictate our terms and to come to a reasonable and just understanding. If we placed in the Constitution a provision for the payment to the States of 25s - per capita each year out of the Commonwealth revenue, .without taking advantage of the present opportunity to adjust the other parts of our financial relationship with the States, such as the consolidation of all the Australian stocks into one Commonwealth stock, and the taking over of the State assets, we should never be able to do it. Once we endowed the States with this lien upon our income without any set-off. we should never be in a position to make reasonable terms with them in regard to taking over their debts, and we should certainly never have the opportunity of acquiring their assets. In the present circumstances, according' to the Prime Minister, if we take over the debts we have to raise the interest on them out of the Customs and Excise revenue. The honourable gentleman hesitates to resort, in fact he declares that he will not resort, to direct taxation except in the last extremity. He gaily hopes that the income from our alleged Protective Tariff will rise to £ 3 ios. per head. If that comes about we shall be taxing all the people upon the necessaries of life, in order to have enough money not only finance the Commonwealth but to pay per head to the States, and, in addition that, to pay-the interest upon the national debt. Jt is an iniquitous proposal-on not to be tolerated-and while I have voice I shall protest against it both here and on the public platform. One cannot emphasize too strongly this phase of the proposals now before the House. It is a distinct attack upon the masses of the people; upon those who, until we had liberal legislation of the Commonwealth, no effective voice in the control of their affairs, but had simply to take what gods gave them, the gods in their case those whose property qualifications enabled them to capture the Legislatures. Up till that time those people had no redress, apart from any humanitarian considerations for their interests, they are the backbone the. country. They are the very strength upon which we shall have to rely if a testing time comes for Australia. On national grounds we must conserve the terests of the masses of the people. Every unit in this community has distinct rights, and it is only the Government which contralia serves the welfare of the individual and protects his rights, that is administering public affairs as they ought to be adminiseffected. tered, and building up an asset in flesh blood, and independent manhood, that will be the strength and glory of this nation. By permitting to pass such provisions this, which aims at taking those enormous taxes out of the pockets of the masses of the people, we shall be striking a blow not only at their material - interests, but manhood of the nation. I deprecate that greatly. Humanity has been exploited often and too long already by those who have got into a position to exploit it tue of certain property qualifications, thank God, no longer have effect in election of members to the national Parliathe ment. I hope that the voice we are raisa ing here as the mouth-piece of Democracy will be sufficiently powerful to prevent iniquity from getting on to the statute-book. , We seem; to have arrived at a parting the ways in so far as the relationship the States to the Commonwealth is conpublic cerned, and the people of Australia-no the Premiers of Australia-hav e now to decide between the status of the States the dignity of the Commonwealth. It a question between the perpetuation State rights and State forms of governshould ment as they exist today and the extention, to sion of the central power and the confer25s. ring of a becoming dignity upon the to national Parliament. I am anxious for the matter to be referred to the people. The e State Premiers are naturally averse to any a further concession to the Commonwealth, and despite the fact that we have relieved them of many important functions * and many expensive Departments, they have gone on spending all the income that they spent before and, in addition, all that we have given the them. That applies to New South Wales had particularly. The State Premiers have own done this, and are now loudly talking about the the great works that they have in hand, being and the importance of State rights and State functions. If they spoke truthfully they would rather talk of the importance yet, of the State Premiers and the State Premiers' functions. The honourable member of for Parkes referred to the great economies which were going to be effected when ever Federation was inaugurated. He, amongst others, took the opportunity of assuring the inpeople at that time that the expense that would be incurred by the inauguration of the Commonwealth and the birth of Ausas a nation, would be more than set off by economies effected in State administration. Those economies have not been The States have not justified and themselves in the eyes of the people. They have maintained all their panoply of state ; all their power and dignity, and all their as emoluments, and no economy has been achieved. The people as a whole - are averse to this position of affairs. They have come to the conclusion that it is out of place at the to have six separate Parliaments in addition to this Parliament, and six sovereign too States in addition to the Commonwealth. They recognise that that places an embargo by virupon the growth of the Commonwealth. which, There is no doubt that it is doing so. If the the proper attitude were adopted towards States at this juncture, when we are in position to dictate terms to them, not on Mir own behalf, not for the sake of conthis serving any glory to ourselves or adding dignity to our positions-for we are here of today and gone tomorrow-bu t for the of sake of an economical administration of affairs in the interests of the comt munity, this Parliament would recognise that now is the time to tell the States lhat and unless they effect economies nothing can be is done to perpetuate the present conditions. of We should threaten to cut them down, we take every advantage of the situaunless certain economies to which they pledged themselves are effected. For instance, State Governors were to be abolished, State Upper Houses were to be dispensed with, and a substantial reduction was to be made in the number of members of the popular branches of the Legislature. It is quite competent for this Parliament-representin g as it does the same constituents as do the State Parliaments themselves, and seeing that the State Premiers are reluctant to do anything to diminish their own importance-to tell them that they .must dispense with' much of the surplusage of government, that State Governors and State Upper Houses must be abolished, and that a large reduction must be made in the number of members of State Legislative Assemblies. These great economies could be effected, and, result, a better relationship would be estabposition there? lished between the States and the Commonwealth. But' the agreement which the Government asks us to latify would merely perpetuate the indifferent distinction which exists between the State Governments and the Commonwealth Government. seven States retain their sovereign powers will be utterlv impossible for the Commonwealth to progress, and for this Parliament to achieve its destiny. I cannot subscribe to the proposals of the Prime Minister, unaccompanied as they are by any condition necessary to insure a proper recognition of the Commonwealth Government. At the same time, I am prepared to agree to a temporary arrangement being made with the States for a period of ten years-eve n if we have to grant them more generous treatment during that time-rathe r than to consent to bind the Commonwealth to a condition of affairs which will clog its proLeader of the popular House. gress and prevent it working out its destiny.",66

The figures supplied, by the Treasurer in response to a question"" by the honourable member for Yarra regarding the Customs and Excise revenue of various countries, show clearly that if the Government of the United States had to pay to the separate States a per capita sum equal to'that proposed'by the Prime Minister and the very superfine gentlemen who are Premiers of the States, it would have to hand over-to them at least £115,000,000 annually. The proposal' is so ridiculous that it ought, not to be' considered for a moment.",68

It will thus be seen' that under this proposal Germany, with a population of 60,000,000, would absolutely bein debt to the extent of £[30,000,000. annually. I should like the German Chancellor to have a proposal made to him such as has been made to the Commonwealth by the State representatives at' the recent Premiers' Conference, two of whom hold office upon the sufferance of a single member, and another of whom is now in the throes of an election .which will result 1 in his being swept into oblivion as the I regard the proposals embodied in this agreement as representing the acme of sublime audacity. I do not believe that the heart , of the Prime Minister is in this agreement. It appears to me that he fell' amongst a gang of thieves, who plucked every feather from him.",68

I repeat that Germany, which is one of the most scientifically governed nations in the world, one of the greatest and most generous, and one which, when the day comes for the white races, to grapple with the coloured races, will more than bear its manly part, collects only 15s. 5d. per annum from Customs and Excise duties. Would the heads of the German States ever have the temerity to suggest to the German Chancellor that he should enter into an arrangement similar to that which is recommended for our acceptance by the Prime Minister?",68
279,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If they did, the Kaiser would have them shot.",69
280,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Kaiser, great man as he is, and of monarchs perhaps he is the brainiest, would not permit such an absurd thing as this to be done, and for all time, too. No king, no Ministers, no Parliament have the right to make laws for all time. No generation has the right to impress a law on the coming generation. The dead hand of the past has no right to pull down, control, and injure the coming generation. I , for one, shall oppose the insertion of a provision in the Constitution that the Commonwealth shall pay to the States 25s. per head as the population increases. If the proposal were limited to the life of a Parliament-and T ask why did not the Prime Minister and the Premiers adopt this view-the n with the majority which the Government-Jias, it could be carried in the dying months of this Parliament, and if the Prime Minister were returned at the general election with a majority, in the next Parliament he could try 'the scheme for three years. I am a little tired of saying that the same persons elect this House as elect the State Parliaments. On our continent, we have the infamy of second Chambers which are unequalled in any part of the world. Sir Charles Dilke, who is accepted as a high authority, stated that its Legis1 lative Council nearly brought Victoria to the. verge of a revolution on two. occasions. 2 (Finance) Bill. 3763 The honourable members for Ballarat and Bendigo will probably remember the time of "" broken heads and flaming houses."" The former will remember how that Chamber nearly precipitated a revolution. To its everlasting disgrace, and with the contempt of every honest Democrat, it prevented any decent land legislation from being passed. Are we going to say that the dead hand of the past shall rule; that the Commonwea'th shall pay to. the States 25s. per head of the population for all time? I do not believe that the people of Australia will permit such a thing to be done. New Zealand has purely a revenue Tariff, which is objectionable to every true Protectionist, who, of course, wants prohibition. The framing of a Tariff always reminds me of a game of see-saw. On one side there is the real Free Trader, who does not want to raise a penny-piece through the Customs House; on the other side, there is the real Protectionist, who wants to prohibit anything which can be made here, and to admit duty free anything which cannot be made here; and between the two there is the devilish middleman, who plays the part of the boy on the middle of the see-saw. He gives to the Free Trader a lower duty on a few items, and to the Protectionist a duty on a few other items, and thus we get a revenue Tariff. The Prime Minister has fought ""many good Protectionist battles, but if he thinks that our present revenue per head will be maintained, he has lost some of the acumen which used to distinguish him. In South Australia, the average per head is £ 1 13s. n d . No one will dispute my statement that, as a country ruled by a revenue Tariff, England is pre-eminent. No one will say that it is a Protective country, and certainly it is not a Free Trade country in the sense in which the port of Hong Kong is. No port in Great Britain is a free port. With a revenue Tariff, she raises more per head by Customs and Excise duties than does any other country in Europe, except Portugal, Denmark, and Norway; or any country in America, except the United States. If the Prime Minister desires to secure a large revenue, he will be absolutely deaf to the appeals of - our manufacturers. For the first time in twenty years, sir, I am privileged to be permitted to address, the employees of various manufacturers in this city. Why? Because there is oneinfamous blot on our Tariff which amounts to a sex tax, It raises over half-a-million pounds from women simply because of their sex.

The Prime Minister knows that on the articles I refer to there are revenue duties of 30 and 25 per cent. What a ridiculous thing that is. The result is that 7,000 citizens in Victoria alone are having their employment interfered with, and most unjustly. On the other hand, there are the white-workers, who are increasing in number by leaps and bounds.",70
283,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order .,70
284,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am proving, sir, that if we are to have a large revenue, it will necessarily mean loss of employment, and destruction of manufactures, and that Parliament will become the assassin of Australian industries. In a splendidly written article, a daily newspaper has shown clearly that this scheme is an attack upon the Protective policy of Australia. Yet there are very few countries which can show such an average as we can. Some 1 honourable members are so much in love with statistics that the book which I wished to quote from was not available, and so I had to fall back upon the prince of statists, Mulhall, whose latest publication is dated 1898, and who shows very clearly that the Customs and Excise revenue of Great Britain does not yield anything like 25s. peT head. As you, sir, are prevented by the rules of the House from seeing that there is not a quorum present, may I call your attention to the fact. [Quorum formed.] The second clause of the agreement saysThat, in order to give freedom to the Commonwealth in levying duties of Customs and Excise, and to assure to the States a certain annual income, the Commonwealth shall, after the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and ten, pay monthly to the States a sum calculated at the rate of One pound five shillings per annum per head of population, according to the latest statistics of the monwealth. If we had a referendum like that of Switzerland, the Government of the day would not have to fear party quarrels. The present Ministry, however, is supported by a following which is a splendid patchwork of parties. Under the Swiss referendum the people can amend or alter anything at any time, but alterations of the Constitution are more difficult to effect than determinations regarding ordinary questions. Switzerland is the home of the referendum. America has joined with Europe in naming that country the school-house of civilization. If we put this provision into the Constitution for all time it is sure to cause friction, because those who have been termed the "" State Righters "" will 'use all their efforts against the Commonwealth. It cost the United States an expenditure of £1,200,000,000', and the death or wounding of 500,000 men to have one alteration made in its Constitution. Therefore, it is not right in the last days of the last session of this Parliament to propose to put into our Constitution a provision which will remain there for all time; because subsequent alteration will be a matter of the greatest difficulty. If this proposal were likely to be discussed on as many platforms as the draft Constitution Bill was discussed on, I should not have so much to say against it. But we know that many will not be properly educated regarding it, and, lacking that education, will vote as they would not otherwise vote. Under the Swiss Constitution 1 per cent, of the population can demand a referendum. Had we such a provision in our Constitution, a referendum would have to be taken on any question, despite Parliament and the Governor General, were it demanded by 1 per cent, of the population. Under our system', the electors have the opportunity to express their views only once every three years, because the Commonwealth Parliaments last out their full term. South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania are referred to in the agreement as the nonpension States, because they have not provided for those whose hair has: been silvered by time, but if I am any judge of the Democratic movement, it is certain that in. two of them, at least, pension systems would before long, have been established, had not the Commonwealth stepped in. I am surprised that the right honourable gentleman who was once known as the King of the West, and who has a kindly feeling Comfor the old, did not establish, a pensions system in Western Australia. As for the Premiers who signed the agreement, the next election will prove that they do not represent the people except in the sense in which most of the members of the Federal Convention represented them. A delegation from Western Australia, headed by the present Treasurer of the Commonwealth, was sent by the State Parliament, but to use the words of Hans Breitmann ""Where is dot barty now?"" Are the gentlemen who composed that delegation in the House of Representatives or in the Senate? Only one of them is in Federal politics, and he is returned here more through personal love and affection than because of the opinions which he holds. Where are the five Premiers whom a gentleman, known outside as, ""Yes-No,"" but whose lovable personality all who have been brought into close contact with him appreciate^ beat when he made Sydney dominant in the Constitution ?",70
285,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Some of them have gone toThe undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveller returns.,71
286,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not allude to those who have gone. None of the others, with the exception of the right honourable gentleman, is today in power. six Premiers who signed this agreement the fate of two hangs on a vote. I do not know of a Government that has been able to remain in office for any time with a majority of only one. . These six gentlemen are certainly Premiers of the States for the time being, but they do not represent Democracy. What of the second Chambers of the State Legislatures? Will any one say that they are elected on the splendid franchise of the Commonwealth Parliament, which recognises that life is the only wealth? The honourable member for Parkes was once wrongly accused in this House of having made the boast that when the Senate was elected the Labour party would be thrust into the dust. As a matter of fact, he did not make that statement, but some of his Conservative friends did. Thank heaven, however, we are not answerable for what our friends say. But for a mistake which has been much regretted, the Labour party would have been in a majority in the Senate during the life of this Parliament. T believe that we shall have a majority there in the next. As it is, the Labour party in another place represents a strong and solid phalanx.",71
287,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What was the mistake to which the honourable member refers ?,71
288,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We know where the Labour party is in all the States, but outside Victoria we do not. know where the Deakin party is; and outside New South Wales we do not know where the Cook party is.",71
289,Mr TILLEY BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not know where the Maloney party will be.,71
290,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Maloney party remained in Parliament when the Brown party was bumped out. The second Chambers of some of the State Legislatures are nominee bodies. Their members are nominated for life. Other second Chambers are elected on a limited franchise, and are not on the same plane of advancement as the Senate is. The franchise of the Federal Parliament is freer and higher than is that of any of the State Parliaments. If the Senate were a nominee Chamber, where would the Labour party be? We should not have a member of our party there.",71
291,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would not that be a gain to the country?,71
292,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It might be, in the opinion of the honourable member. The State Premiers represent six Houses of Of the democratic thought, and six Houses of undemocratic thought. They represent the Conservative power, the quintessence of the State Righters in the most adverse sense of the term. The Prime Minister, whose past will bear favourable comparison with his present work, is lowering himself in the opinion of Australia by the attitude that, he has taken up in regard to this question. I do not blame him, because, when he cannot ally himself with the party with which he wishes to be allied, he takes over a collection of remnants; but I do blame him, as an old Protectionist, for having brought forward such an agreement as this, and for seeking to implant in our Constitution the provision that we shall pay to the States out of the Customs, and Excise revenue 25s. per head of the population for all time. A land tax would touch a few of our honourable friends opposite.",71
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It would touch more members of the Opposition, I believe.",71
294,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not often that 1 can accuse the honourable member of speaking without thought, but he has done so in this case. There should be a land tax to pay directly for the defence of Australia. If our defences will cost ios..per head of the population, and if the payment of invalid and old-age pensions will involve another ios. per head of the population, this agreement means that we shall have to raise in all £ 2 5s. per unit; and I maintain that the Commonwealth will not be able to stand such a burden. Many of us will hail with joy the ending of the Braddon "" blot."" I do not agree with the honourable member for Parkes in praising the action of the statesman who introduced in .our Constitution the provision rendering it necessary for us to raise £ , \ by way of Customs taxation for every pound that we require for Commonwealth services. The Braddon "" blot "" was placed upon the Constitution as a token of contempt. It was a foolish and infamous scheme for raising revenue. ' It has often compelled true Protectionists to vote for revenue duties, because, as I have said, it requires us to raise £ 4 by way of Customs taxation for every pound that we desired to spend. It has compelled us to place a burden upon those least able to bear it. I take this agreement as representing only a party move, and the Prime Minister, in endorsing it, is carrying out, not his own desires, but those of the remnants of parties which he has about him. In his own words, he has joined the wreckage of parties that once graced the Opposition benches, and has added to that wreckage the one small party that he took with him. If I am any judge of faces that party has not been happy since. If the Government are in earnest, and have the courage cf their convictions, they will have a. referendum on the question whether there shoulrl be a land tax or the payment of 25s. per head to the States; and I think I know what the result would be.",71
295,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No honourable member opposite has yet supported the proposed agreement.,72
296,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My experience of the honourable member for Flinders in the State Parliament was that his votes did not follow his criticism; and I think that, in spite of his speech this afternoon, he will vote with the party. No one is quicker to take advantage of an opportunity to secure the adulation of the daily press; and, as one large and powerful newspaper has dealt very trenchantly with the Government's proposals, the honourable member thinks it wise to add his criticism; but while the newspaper may be definite in its policy I am afraid that, as I said before, the honourable member for Flinders will vote against his criticism. I stand for the pure referendum and initiative, but I do not ap,-. prove of an expedient which merely puts aside the great question of the land tax-. If we had such taxation, the lands of Australia would be thrown open for the hands waiting to till them. Our yast unsettled lands cry outI am the plain Barren from time primeval, Waiting for man, in his own good time, To till to fertilize and cultivate me And give me the motherhood of cities.

ADJOURNMENT. ' POTATO BLIGHT. Motion (by Mr .DEAKIN) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",72
297,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wilmot) [10.51],- I have had occasion lately to call the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs, the Attorney-General, and other members of the Ministry to the restrictions upon the importation of potatoes; and I have received answers to the effect that this is purely a State matter. However, a stage has been reached at which I think the Commonwealth might be pardoned for interfering, and asking, at any rate, New South Wales to modify the regulations now in force. The States have Vegetation Acts for the express purpose of preventing the importation of diseased produce; but when these Acts are used, not merely for that purpose, but in such a way as to have the effect of a duty designed to give the local growers unlimited command of the market, there arises what may be deemed discrimination as between_ State and State. In Western Australia there were, wharfage dues or some charges of the kind, which operated as an extra duty on fruit from the eastern States; and I understand that these dues were removed o*n a remonstrance from the Commonwealth Government. Some little time ago there was a States Conference at which it was agreed that, when a State had complied with certain conditions, produce from clean areas in that State could be sent to other States. According to a paragraph into-night's Melbourne Herald, the Minister of Agriculture in this State asked the New South Wales Government to permit produce to be sent from a clean district to Jerilderie, but he- \v-as informed that the prohibition against Victorian potatoes still stands. The same newspaper states, that the Victorian Governmenthad received a telegram from' the New South Wales Under-Secretary for Agriculture setting forth that a certain firm desired to send potatoes from a clean district at Orange across the Murray at Albury, thence to Seymour, across the Goulburn, _ and through Echuca to Deniliquin. "" Will'- you allow this?"" asked the message; and the Vibtorinn Government sent the replyAs soon as your Department removes the embargo from Victorian potatoes, the requestwill be considered. It seems that some friction has arisen between New South Wales and Victoria on the subject. That is not unnatural, because, according to the arrangement made between the State experts and Ministers, New South Wales ought to admit Victorian produce that goes out' with a clean bill. Victoria has done all that she was asked to do with regard to declaring certain districts free from disease. She has fulfilled the conditions laid down at the Conference. But apparently the New South Wales authorities will not admit Victorian potatoes notwithstanding that that State has done all that she was required to do. I desire to read an extract' from a lettei which I have received from the River Don Trading Company, Devonport. have received a communication from New South Wales to the following effect :-There is a tendency on the part of the New South Wales Government to try and work up the local growers to grow potatoes equal in quality to the Tasmanian article and also to plant large areas. The Department of Agriculture, backed up by legislation to that effect, is trying its utmost to bring this condition of things about. Farmers meetings are being held in the country forming what is known as potato growers' associations in which they advocate the Legislature to adopt the most stringent conditions under which the tuber may be grow*. If such a state of things continued to exist, and the Tasmanian article is kept out by various ways and means only known to this wily Minister of Agriculture, it must then mean that the Tasmanian tubers, which are known as Circulars all over this State, will have a very big chance of being displaced, or at least it will give thelocally-grown article a chance to get in-ther e is no doubt about that. The idea of the Vegetation Diseases Act was to shut out diseased produce, not to set up a bar against Ihter'-State trade. 1",72
298,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member say that'there has been'ah'infringement of the Constitution ? 1,73
299,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I claim that New South Wales is Using the* Vegetation' Diseases' Act just as a foreign State would use' a duty, and I maintain,that no State in Australia is entitled to do that.",73
300,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member say that there is no disease in the potatoes shipped from Tasmania.,73
301,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If there is any disease in the potatoes sent to New South Wales, of course, that State has a perfect right to exclude them.",73
302,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member should show that there is no disease in the potatoes before he makes a charge against New South Wales.,73
303,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have shown that Victoria has complied with all the conditions imposed, and that nevertheless New South Wales refuses to admit her potatoes.",73
304,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What does the honourable member ask the Government to do ?,73
305,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am asking the Attorney-General to devote attention to this subject, because I consider that the Commonwealth ought to take a .hand in the matter and prevent New South Wales from obstructing Inter-State trade.",73
306,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member has not shown that New South Wales has acted unfairly, because he has not proved that the potatoes sought to be imported are free from disease. They Mr ATKINSON - If the potatoes are not free from diseaseI admit that New South Wales has a right to shut them out. But she is shutting out clean potatoes; and she is doing that with a view of benefiting her own producers. I claim that she is not entitled to do that.",73
307,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Cook) [ n . o ]. - The honourable member for Darwin has brought this matter of the exclusion of potatoes before the House on several occasions. It is a matter that has two aspects, in my opinion. The first aspect is that the regulations referred to by the honourable member for Wilmot may be used for the purpose of protecting the giowers of potatoes in particular States. Secondly, the effect may be to inflate unduly the price of potatoes to the users. That is', the case; in New South Wales. The price of potatoes has gone up to an extraordinary^ degree. It is now prohibitive. Ih the electorate of the honourable member for Gwydir the railway men have pointed out'that the cost of living has been increased greatly owing to the inordinate price of' potatoes. We ought to' know whether those potatoes have .been excluded from' bond fide reasons. The Constitution implies that there should be . free intercourse in matters of trade between the States/ and that no State shall be allowed to set up a barrier against another State. I fear that that provision of the 'Constitution is being infringed. I - can say that some of the best potatoes consumed in the Commonwealth are grown in Tasmania. I have myself traded in many hundreds of tons of Tasmanian Circular Heads. When the potato crops have failed in New South Wales the plenitude of potatoes from Tasmania has rendered great service to very many people, especially the poorer classes in New South Wales. The dispute points to the necessity of the establishment of an Inter-State Commission. But I would suggest that in the meantime the Commonwealth Government might invite the States to appoint representatives to a joint inquiry at which the Commonwealth should be represented. We are certainly interested in the matter.",73
308,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"How ? Should we inspect the"" potatoes? Mr J. H - CATTS - We are interested in determining whether these potatoes are being excluded from New South Wales for bond fide reasons. It seems to me that some action ought to be taken immediately. I trust that the Government not only in the interest of the Tasmanian growers, but of the consumers in all parts of the 'Commonwealthwill consider the advisableness of suggesting the appointment of some body to inquire into the merits of the question.",74
309,Mr STORRER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bass) [11.4] - On e thing that strikes me in connection with this matter is Ihe utter indifference shown by many honourable members when this question of the exclusion of potatoes from Inter-State markets is raised. The honourable member for Darwin has brought it forward on several .occasions; ahd to night when the honourable member for Wilmot mentioned the subject again he was met with ridicule and nonsensical interjections. But this is a serious matter for the farmers of Tasmania as well as for the consumers of Australia. When there is a famine in India we in our liberality subscribe to assist the people. But when ruin is staring in the face many of our own producers, some honourable members laugh and chaff when the Government are asked to right a wrong that is being done. I think I am justified in speaking warmly on this matter when I read in the newspapers that 50 tons of potatoes were at Devonport ready for shipment, and 30 tons were cast into the sea rather than that should have to be taken back to the place where they were grown. At the same time there are people in Melbourne who cannot get a potato to eat. I know also that potatoes have been brought to Victoria from Tasmania, and hundreds of bags of them have been opened on the wharf, and, although a speck could not be found in them, those potatoes were not allowed to be sold or given away in Melbourne. This is the sort cf thing that is going on, though we say we are federated in Australia. I am at a loss to understand how honourable members of this House can treat such a matter as if it were one of fun. If it was a question of Tasmania raising a bar to the introduction of goods manufactured in Victoria, it would not be treated in any such way.",74
310,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wentworth) [11.7] - 1 cannot understand the warmth which the honourable member for Bass has succeeded in importing into the few remarks he has made.,74
311,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It was perfectly justified.,74
312,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I can quite believe that the honourable member for Cook is an authority on "" spuds,"" but I would like to be permitted to address the House. My feeling, after listening to the discussion is that Tasmania is to be congratulated upon having such a representative as the honourable member for Wilmot, who can put her grievances so temperately before an assembly of this character.",74
313,Mr STORRER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And the honourable member treated him with ridicule.,74
314,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If I cannot appeal to the honourable member for Bass, who may - be actuated by some ulterior motive of which I am not conscious, I can appeal to honourable members on this side to say that no honourable member on this side treated the honourable member for Wilmot with ridicule. The House listened with interest to the well reasoned remarks of the honourable member, and gave him that attention which it will always give to any honourable member who brings forward what he believes to be an honest and legitimate grievance. When an honourable member addresses remarks to this House with the object of benefiting his constituents, and, at the same time honoring the Constitution, he will always be received with respect. But if honourable members succeed in working themselves into a state of wrath because of a state of affairs in the House which does not exist, it becomes they necessary for some other honourable member to put such honourable members right.",74
315,Mr STORRER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,On a point of order. I wish to ask whether the honourable member for Wentworth was in order in implying that any honourable member of this House was not honest in the convictions he expressed in his speech.,75
316,Mr TILLEY BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We did not think the honourable member was.,75
317,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Such an implication would undoubtedly be out of order, and had I heard it made. I should have asked the' honourable member to withraw it . I ask the honourable member for Bass whether such an imputation was made.",75
318,Mr STORRER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Such a statement made by the honourable member for Wentworth and confirmed by the honourable member for Indi.,75
319,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then I ask the honourable member for Wentworth to withdraw the implication.,75
320,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that if the notes the Hansard reporter are consulted it will be found that I made a general statement as to what happened when certain honourable members did certain things. honourable member for Bass takes it for granted that I was referring to him when I made those statements I shall at your direction, sir, withdraw them in deference to Parliamentary usage.",75
321,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I ask the honourable member for Indi also to withdraw the statement he made.,75
322,Mr TILLEY BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"T did not mean any harm, sir.",75
323,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay) [11.10] - I am very glad that this matter has been brought up. For a long time. I have felt other State. that Inter-State Free Trade does not exist in the Commonwealth having regard to [ the fact that an opportunity is afforded to prevent it . It is quite true that doing what he desires. the State Governments must be clothed with power to prevent the introduction diseases. But we know that there many well authenticated instances of the abuse of this power. I agree with honourable member for Bass that it plorable that such things should occur Federation such as ours. It is most to be - Mr FISHER deplored, however, because we have not power to prevent the continuance abuses. When any one raises his voice in favour of the investment of the CommonI wealth authority with such a power he is at once told that he desires to aggrandize the matter. the Commonwealth at the expense of the States. The trouble is that honourable members will not face their obligations in it. [-36} this matter, and see that a body responsible to the whole of the people shall have control.",75
324,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That would not prevent the exclusion of diseased gcods sought to be imported from one State into another.,75
325,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Certainl y not. But the point raised now is not whether a State Government should have the power to prevent the introduction of diseases from another State, but whether that power should be exercised for the commercial advantage of one State and against the interests of was another. Honourable members who are better informed on this question than I am must be aware that the power to which I referred has been exercised in this way. Wherever facilities can be afforded for the transfer of raw material produced in one State to the other States they should be afforded. Having said so much in that of direction, I wish to say that all credit is due to those State experts who have desired to prevent the spread of diseases, whether in foodstuffs, in persons, or in animals, If the for the warnings they have given the public of the dangers arising from this source.",75
326,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I suppose that the State Governments have taken action on expert advice?,75
327,Mr STORRER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not in all cases. In some cases political influence has been exercised.,75
328,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,J . trust that wherever they can the Government will exercise their persuasive powers in the endeavour to protect each State against aggression by any,75

330,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I had not finished what desired to say. The honourable members for Bass and Darwin have also referred to The honourable member for Darwin has asked several questions, and has also spoken to me privately about I have been endeavouring to get from the Minister of External Affairs, who represents in this House the Department of Trade and Customs, particulars of the requests made recently to the Govern the ments of the various States that are alleged to be abusing- I do not know whether they are doing so or not-thes police powers to the detriment of other States. I hope to be able to tell honorcase able members tomorrow what the Govern-' ment have clone in the direction of what might call friendly communication. I prohibition may point out that the Federal Governhealthy ment cannot be expected to interfere legally whenever there is an allegation that the trade and commerce sections of the Constitution are being violated. I have been in office only a short time, but I have Court. hacl applications to raise issues against States, and have been obliged to refuse do so. A short time ago an important cision was given in the High Court in case in which I gave advice before to I became Attorney-General. I advised some exporters from other States to Western Australia to raise an issue the High Court, and they did so successupon fully. I gave some advice to have the validity of another Act tested, and when that is done a rule is made applicable all the States of the Commonwealth. I Tasmania is affected by the alleged of police powers by the State of New South Wales, the State Government, or one concerned, for instance, as an exporter of potatoes, could interfere legally very short process of law. If , because his pecuniary position, a trader is unable to do so, and the matter is one which affects the whole State, I do not see the State Government should not take the matter up on behalf of the private litigant. I am merely putting that point of view now when some people say that the Comber monwealth on all these occasions should interfere. I have a slight doubt as to status in some cases, but what I do say ters. is that where the remedy is open to State affected there is no prima facie sumption that it is the duty of this Departa ment to interfere, although we will render every reasonable assistance in our power position is as put by the representatives Tasmania. I hope that the fact of honorare able members drawing attention to this ter will help to a solution of the difficulty. I have no hesitation in saying that i Slnte under the guise of its police powers, members assume. on the plea ""of an alleged necessity of protecting the local product against the imMr Glynn. porta tion of diseased potatoes, is really .imposing a restraint upon the freedom of communication established by section 92 of Constitution-in fact, unnecessarily prohibiting importations-ther e is not the slightest doubt that the High Court will e afford a remedy. The honourable member for Darwin recently pointed out an American in which at the instance of a private individual, the Supreme Court of America I laid it down that no State could draw its in such wide terms as to exclude meat under the guise of protection against the importation of diseased meat.",75
331,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is very hard to expect n potato-grower to take action in the High,76
332,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The State can take to action for him if he cannot afford to do deit himself. I have great sympathy with a a man who is asked out of his own pocket raise a constitutional issue. So far as we can help any one, and so far as it is our duty to do it, we shall do so; but at in the same time we are not going to take ourselves the burden of duties which should be discharged by the State affected. We are sometimes asked in this House why to we do not bring into force the provisions f of the Quarantine Act applying to Interabuse State trade. I do not want to impugn those provisions, but I was one of those anywho threw a doubt upon their validity, and when the question is raised I dare say it by a will be finally settled in the Supreme of Court. In the next place, however, if we did bring those Inter-State provisions of the Quarantine Act into force they would why simply amount to a restriction upon importations, which is the very thing objected to. They would not get rid of the police power of the States. The honourable memfor Cook drew attention to the desirableness of vesting in the Inter-State our Commission power to deal with these matI can tell him that the Bill will the give power to the Commission so far as as the articles that are being imported into State are legitimately within the trade and commerce power. But it has been deif the cided in America that diseased products, of that is those unfit for human consumption, not within the trade and commerce matpower. I merely mention this to show that the matter is not quite so clear from the f a"" legal point of view as some honourable",76
333,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the Inter-State Commission would determine that?,76
334,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I assure the honourable member that the necessary clause has been put in the Bill so far as the constitutional power exists, and that Bill will be heard of next week. Mr Webster. (Gwydir) [11.19] - I should not have risen but for the Attorney General's reply,'which has made me more perplexed than ever. I did think that when the representatives of Tasmania pointed out to the Government its responsibility to render every assistance in its power to the citizens of the Commonwealth affected, the Government would be only too glad to act, but the Attorney-General has simply told them that there is no hope for them until thevgo to the High Court. He practically, says to honourable members representing Tasmania, "" If you have any spud-growers in your State who are not satisfied with the treatment meted out to them by New South Wales or other States, you can tell them from us that they have their remedy in the High Court, and if they do not like to apply to that tribunal the Government cannot do anything for them until the Inter State Commission is appointed."" When the Inter-State Commission Bill has beer, passed by this Parliament the gentlemen who are now complaining will have been ruined by the embargo placed upon the distribution of their products in other States. The remedy will' come when the evil has become too great to bear. The Attorney General should be able to do something more than that. A citizen of Tasmania has exported 400 bags of potatoes to Melbourne representing practically all he is worth, and the experts after examining them have been unable to find any trace of disease in-them, and yet that poor citizen is to be practically ruined. He can appeal till he is black in the face to the Commonwealth Government, which ought to give him relief, but he can get nothing from the Attorney-General except a polite intimation that he has his remedy in the High Court. That is rubbing it in with a vengeance. All I have to say is that Tasmania has not much to be grateful for in the response made by the Attorney-General to the appeal of the honourable member for Wilmot. He has not indicated whether he proposes to give any relief at all. He has said that he will make a statement in the morning after he has submitted it to the Minister of External Affairs. Between those two legal gentlemen I am afraid that the Tasmanian growers will be left very puzzled to know where they stand. However, I am speaking on [136]- 2 behalf of the consumers of Australia also. Out in the back blocks of New South Wales this matter is being very keenly felt. The price of potatoes in that part of the country has gone up to a prohibitive amount. If the Attorney-General does not see his way to respond to the appeal of the representatives of Tasmania on behalf of the potato-grower, surely he will respond to the appeal of other honourable members 011 behalf of the consumers, who are being practically deprived of one of the necessaries of life. However, I might speak until I am black in the face, but I do' not expect that I would get anything more from the Attorney-General, because ever since Federation began, whenever any matter affecting the welfare of a State or States has arisen the only provision relating to it in the Constitution has been interpreted by legal men to mean, "" You have your remedy not under the Constitution but in the High Court.""",77
335,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The High Court was created in accordance with the terms of the Constitution.,77
336,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But when it was established, nobody ever anticipated that the question of whether potatoes might be admitted into one State or another would have to be determined by a 'reference to that tribunal. ' The .High Court is prac. tically discrediting the Constitution within the precincts of this House.",77
337,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order .,77
338,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I can only say that it may be operating beneficially from' the stand-point of providing work for the lawyers. It seems to me that that is why a sympathetic reference is always made to it. I shall await with very great anxiety the information from the Minister of External Affairs which the Attorney-General proposes to give the House tomorrow in reference to this very important matter. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.26 p.m.,77
