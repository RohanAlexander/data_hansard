Question unansweredSOLDIER S' DEPENDANTS . ment ALLOTME NT MONEY - NEW ZEALAN D RECIPROCITY.",20
5,Mr BRUCESMITH,Unknown,"L as t week, the continued Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr . Wise) promised to make a comprehensive the statement regarding the present method at of allotting money to the wives and detinued pendants of soldiers. I shall know if he can do so now.",20
6,Mr WISE,Unknown,"I have been supplied w i the following information on the subject :Department of Defence^ Melbourne, 23rd October, 1918. NA A soldier is compelled to allot to liis at the following rates:For wife-Two-fifth * of his total pay, amount deferred. [262] ' For wife and one or two or more children - Three-fifth s .of total pay, less amount deferred. For one child-One-fift h of total pay, less amount deferred. The soldier may,, and often does, allot in addition to these amounts some portion of read the remainder of his pay. 2. When a member incurs forfeiture through fines or imprisonment or otherwise incurs a heavy overdraft of his account, which it is possible for him to make good within three months by the reduction of that portion of pay which he has retained for himself, the 6d. allotment which he has made to his dependants, in excess of the compulsory rate for a private, is reduced to the compulsory rate, per lb., I which is as follows:Allotment Separation per diem.

In no case, other than illegal absence, is allotment to a dependant reduced below the compulsory rate. 6. In all cases of illegal absence, the allotis continued for seven weeks from the date the member first went absent without leave. Allotments to non-dependants are then cancelled, but allotments to dependants are full rate for a further thirty days at the 7. Immediately the member is apprehended, allotment, if to a dependant, is reinstated the compulsory rate for a private, and conat that rate untilthe member's account is in credit. Separation allowance' at full be glad to rates is also paid. 8.

7,Mr WATT,EEOUCTION OF ALLOTMENTS TO COVER,"I shall be glad if the honourable member will put a notice of the question on the business-paper. I have given instructions for' the records to be searched, but I have not yet been informed whether any arrangement on the subject exists. NA HOSPITAL. DISMISSAL OV RETURNED SOLDIERS. Mr MoGRATH - It is stated in the press that the Military authorities are dispensing with the services at the Caulfield Military Hospital of a nnmber of returned soldiers, whom they are replacing with women on the ground that women's services are cheaper than men's. I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence if the statement is true, and, if it is, how many returned soldiers are likely to be displaced? Is this action of the Government indicative of the gratitude it feels towards returned men?",21
8,Mr WISE,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"I am not aware of the facts, but I shall make inquiries,, and let the honourable member know the result. ELECTORAL ENROLMENT.",21
9,Mr ARCHIBALD,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"Has the Minister fbr Home and Territories, been informed of a case in which a young person residing in Hindmarsh, and teaching at a school at Oakbank, in . the division of Angas, has been fined at Woodside because her name is not on the Angas roll? Is she not entitled to enrolment for the division in which she lives?",21
10,Mr GLYNN,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"The honourable member * yesterday showed me a letter on the subject to which he now Tefers, and I have asked for a report as to the facts. The Electoral Act provides for the enrolment of an elector in the division in which he or she lives. In cases of non-enrolment, every facility is afforded for the making of explanations without going into Court. The lady concerned made an explanation, but the magistrate, I understand, thought that she was in error. However, as I have already told the honourable member, I shall endeavour to ascertain the facts, and to see that justice is done. INTER-STATE CARGOES.",21
11,Mr KELLY,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"I understand that it is the practice for intending shippers of cargo to book space at the various Inter-State shipping companies' offices, but that complaint is made that priority is not secured by this arrangement, because a vessel on each visit to a port is dealt with by a different company, being passed round among the various offices. I ask the Acting Minister for the Navy if he will consider the advisability of establishing a central booking ofiice in each big city, so that priority may be obtained by those who first make application for space ?  matter consideration. SEVENTH WAR LOAN. AMOUNT SUBSCRIBED-ORGANIZERS ' SPEECHES.",21
12,Mr HIGGS,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"Is it true, as rumoured down town, that there was a serious inaccuracy in the Treasurer's statement regarding the amount that had been subscribed on the date on which the Seventh War Loan was to close. Will the Treasurer inform the House whether the sum actually subscribed is greater or less than was stated?",21
13,Mr WATT,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"It is not true that the original statement was incorrect, but when the returns were being totalled in the various States an error of about £800,000 was made in the advice telegraphed from one of them. We were not able to' ascertain immediately whether that en-or was in over-statement or in under-statement, but we have since learned that the amount subscribed was more than stated. MT. NICHOLLS - Will the Treasurer state whether it is a fact that the Govern-tnent are paying the expenses of organizers for the - Seventh War Loan? If so, will he inform the House as to the amount paid by way of salaries and expenses to such organizers? Mr - WATT - I cannot give detailed information without notice. The Government is paying all the organizing expenses, including advertising, of the War Loan Committees.' There is on the notice-paper for today a question dealing with one phase of the matter, but if honourable members require fuller particulars, and I am able to obtain them, I shall be glad to supply them.",21
14,Mr NICHOLLS,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"Is the Treasurer aware that organizers for the Seventh War Loan have gone into large towns, and have made the most insulting and abusive statements when the response to their appeal has not been up to expectations? If so, will he take steps to have these organizers immediately withdrawn?",22
15,Mr WATT,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"I am not aware of anything of the kind, but if the honourable member can supply me with particulars I shall be glad to have them. The services, of these gentlemen will, in the ordinary course of events' terminate on Monday next, when subscriptions to the War 'Loan close, and an announcement will then be made as to the result. RETURNED SOLDIERS. ALLOWANCE EOR CIVILIAN SUIT.",22
16,Mr SINCLAIR,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"Is it a fact that turned soldiers, when discharged, are lowed only 30s. for a civilian suit, and, if so, will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence consider the proance priety of increasing the allowance something approaching the cost of a suit ?",22
17,Mr WISE,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"The present allowance is as stated. , I shall ask the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) tq consider the suggestion contained in the question. SHODDY YARN.",22
18,Dr MALONEY,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"Returne d soldiers £27,000; who are engaged in hand-weaving here are making splendid cloth, but they are being supplied from a Government Defor partment with a shoddy yarn. This yarn has got into general use, and a lady who has made a tremendous number of socks for the men at the Front has complained about it. I produce one of the socks made from this yarn. Honourable members can see from the effect of six days', wear, how poor the quality of the yarn must be. Will the Acting Prime Minister do something by regulation under War Precautions Act, or in some other' way, to prevent injury being done to our [262]- 2 returned men who are weaving clothbecause cloth made of this yarn is useless-and to prevent the yarn in question from being supplied to the women and girls who are making socks for OUT soldiers.",22
19,Mr WATT,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"I am not acquainted with the facts mentioned, but my attention having been directed to the matter, I ' shall see that the proper authorities are informed of the honourable member's complaint, with a view to action to prevent what is alleged to be taking place. INTERRUPTION OF QUESTIONS.",22
20,Mr SPEAKER,CAULFIELD MILITARY," It is not in - conformity with the dignity of the House that day ""after day I should be compelled to impress on honourable members the duty of refraining from interjecting while questions aTe being asked, and interrupting in a disorderly way the business of the House. This practice is growing, and I must ask the House to take serious notice of it should it continue. reHonorable members addressing the Chair alshould be heard in reasonable quiet. There should not be the continual fusillade of noisy interjections, to the disturbof our .proceedings, which is daily to becoming more noticeable. NAVA L EXPENDITURE .",22
21,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister a question of a ratheT serious nature. It was stated in. the daily press last week that a claim had been made upon the Navy Department for that the ofncials had reported in - favour of paying £7,000, and that, despite their recommendation, the Minister the time being had authorized the payment of £25,000. These facts were alleged in a most circumstantial way in a leading article in one of the Melbourne daily newspapers, but no notice appears to have been taken of the statement.",22
22,Mr HIGGS,CAULFIELD MILITARY,The honourable member has been asleep. I have been directing attention to it. for the past week.,22
23,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CAULFIELD MILITARY,I ask the Actthe ing Prime Minister whether he does not owe it to our party to have a full explanation of the matter-no t a mere flippant answer-give n to the House. A numher _ of persons outside are commenting on the want of such an explanation.,22
24,Mr WATT,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"1 think that the House is entitled to an explanation on an important matter of this kind, and in that spirit the Acting Minister for the Navy  vernment to put the matter clearly before the House. This he did last week in an extended memorandum.",23
25,Mr JOWETT,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"In view of the grave uncertainty in the minds of many gent persons, including members of this House, as to who may be the individuals' referred to in numerous reports, as, instance, that on the Navy Department, will the Acting Prime Minister take steps to have these reports referred Commissions or Committees responsible for them, and to ask that the names of officers or Ministers of the Crown therein referred to shall be specifically given? . Mr Watt - I am sure that honourable members are grateful to the honorcensorship able member for Grampians for includnot ing them amongst the intelligent section of the community. As to the main part of his question, there is on today's notice-paper a question by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) which, while it does not cover quite wide an area as that just put by my honhowever, orable friend, includes an explicit referno ence to the recent report of the Royal occurrence Commission. If my answer to that quesaware, tion on notice does not go far enough, shall consider the honourable member's suggestion. Mr RICHARD FOSTER,-Will the /Voting Minister for the Navy lay on the"" table of the Library all papers concerning the claims in final settlement of the contract reviewed in the concluding paragraph of the report of the Royal CommisPrime sion on Navy administration?  jection to laying on the table of Library the whole of the papers, including the amended contract which effected by the Minister then in charge, Johnson) -'Order ! and which made a very considerable savhonorable ing on the first contract. The papers will disclose the whole transaction. CENSORSHIP. GERMAN CHANCELLOR'S SPEECH.",23
26,Mr BRENNAN,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"Can the Acting Prime Minister inform the House whether there is. any political significance attaching to the fact that a lengthy and Goexcellent report of the German Chancellor's speech on the peace negotiations a'ppeared in last night's Herald, while in this morning's newspapers there was but a very abbreviated and'scanty reference to it. Was the cablegram censored after intelliit appeared in the Herald?",23
27,Mr WATT,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"My - honourable friend for can generally frame a fairly explicit question, but that just put by him leaves 'me in some bewilderment as to what he back to the really desires to know ",23
28,Mr BRENNAN,CAULFIELD MILITARY,I merely wish to the know whether tha report has been censored since it appeared in the evening paper.,23
29,Mr WATT,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"I am not aware of any of the report. Ministers are acquainted of all that the censors are doing unless they are asked to make in quiries on the subject. The censorship is operating throughout Australia under general rules, and we are not acquainted with the particulars as to what is done. so So far as the Government are concerned, I may say at once that there is political significance attaching to the to which the honourable member alludes, and that, so far ^ as I am .no action has been taken to supI press, in the case of the morning newspapers,, what may have appeared in any evening paper. NA ARBITRATIO N COURT.. - Mr BLAKELEY - Is the Acting Minister in a position to put before the House the policy of the Government reference to the Commonwealth Court the of Conciliation and Arbitration?",23
30,Mr WATT,CONCILIATIO NAN D,"Mr Speaker ' was "" Mr SPEAKER (Hon. W. Elliot I would remind members that it is not in accordance with parliamentary practice to ask for expressions of opinion on matters of policy. Such questions should not he put. Later:",23
31,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATIO NAN D,Will the Acting Prime Minister in the near future make a statement to the House in reference to the recent decision of the High Court regarding the enforcement of awards made by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court?,24
32,Mr WATT,CONCILIATIO NAN D,"I thoroughly endorse your .statement, Mr Speaker, if I may be permitted to do so, in regard to putting, without notice, questions affecting matters of policy. Ministers are too often asked to answer such questions without notice, and it is not f a ir that we should be placed in that position.",24
33,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATIO NAN D,The Acting Prime Minister has already promised to make a statement on this subject.,24
34,Mr WATT,CONCILIATIO NAN D,There is a difference between a question as to whether a certain action will be taken and one as to whether it will be taken today.,24
35,Mr HIGOS,CONCILIATIO NAN D,That is a different matter.,24
36,Mr WATT,CONCILIATIO NAN D,"Thos e of my honourable friends opposite who have enjoyed Ministerial office appreciate the difference. As to the honourable member's question, I may say that the matter is listed for consideration by Cabinet. The Attorney General is conducting his investigations upon the data to which I referred before namely, the High Court judgments. RECRUITING. TAKING , or BALLOT - ISSUE OF PAMPHLETS",24
37,Mr FOWLER,CONCILIATIO NAN D,"Can the Minister in Charge of Recruiting give the House definite information as to when he expects any result from the voluntary ballot now being carried on in connection with recruiting, or whether he has'come to the conclusion universally held by the general public as to the f u t i l it y of the whole thing?",24
38,Mr ORCHARD,CONCILIATIO NAN D,"We have experienced very great difficulty in compiling lists of eligibles in the various States. We had only the war census cards of 1915 to work upon; but, with the assistance of officers ot the Electoral, Police, and Postal Departments, we hav.e compiled a list with fair l y satisfactory results. I hope to be able next week to announce when we shall send out the ballot cards, and the subsequent date on which the ballot will be taken.  cruits?",24
39,Mr ORCHARD,CONCILIATIO NAN D,"I shall be in a better position next week to give a reply to the latter part of the honourable member's question. Mr BRENNAN"" - Hav e ^complaints reached the Minister for Recruiting ^as, to the objectionable and generally odious character of certain prints that are being circulated, with the avowed object of stimulating recruiting, and as to their being likely to really prejudice recruiting? Further, have complaints reached the - honourable gentleman that these prints, in many cases, have been sent to persons who have already suffered bereavement in this war, as well as to persons over sixty years of age, and that this has given rise to a feeling of annoyance, and to the criticism that persons who themselves are eligible for enlistment are addressing this kind of literature, to ineligibles, or those who have.already served? . Mr ORCHARD - It is a fact that we have received some letters complaining of the nature of certain illustrations in the pamphlets sent out. On the other hand, we have had many letters eulogizing the character of these illustrations and of the pamphlets generally. It is also a fact that the pamphlets and letters, in some - cases, have, unfortunately, been sent to persons whose sons have been killed at the Front, as well as tb men over military age - Out of 160,000 pamphlets issued, however, less than 3£ per cent, have been sent to such people.",24
40,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATIO NAN D,"Do not think you get them all back. Two were sent to my house, although I am over age, and my only son at home is a cripple. Mr ORCHARD,-Fiftee n of them were, unfortunately, sent to homes from which men had enlisted, and had been killed at the Front, but the, majority of these men were killed subsequent to the commencement of the compilation of the lists.",24
41,Mr FOWLER,CONCILIATIO NAN D,I have a letter that was sent to the address of a man who was killed two years ago.,25
42,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATIO NAN D,Order! Answers to questions cannot be debated.,25
43,Mr ORCHARD,CONCILIATIO NAN D,"Unde r the system of compiling lists- Mr FOWLEK , - It is a downright scandal!",25
44,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATIO NAN D,"Order ! If Ministers are not to be allowed to answer without interruption, questions put to them, I shall have to put a stop to further questions without notice. I should have recourse to that procedure, but honourable members must recognise that the House is largely entering upon an abuse of the system of asking and answering questions without notice. The House should assist the Speaker to secure the conduct of such business in proper and regular form . I must insist that when an honourable member is asking, or a Minister is replying to, a question, he shall be heard without interruption. Neither questions Dor answers to questions are open to debate. Later:  cruiting (Mr Orchard) think that he is going to escape responsibility for all the mistakes that are being made in his Department by simply sitting down and not answering questions?",25
45,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATIO NAN D,I ask the Minister not to answer that question.  adjournment of the House on the matter. We will have questions answered.,25
46,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATIO NAN D,"Order ! I remind the House that"" the answering of questions is a matter entirely for the discretion of Ministers, and that questions must be kept within certain prescribed limits. This has been pointed out on several occasions; and perhaps it would be just as well, for the guidance of. honourable members, if I quote a passage from May on the subject:Questions addressed to Ministers should relate to the publie affairs with which they officially connected, to proceedings pending in desire ? Parliament, or to any matter of administration for which the Minister is responsible. Within these lines an explanation can sought regarding the intentions of the GovernfoT Defence. ment, but not an expression of their opinion upon matters of policy. An answer to a question cannot - be insisted upon if the answer be refused by the Minister on the ground of the publiointerest; nor oan the question be replaced upon the notice-paper, or the refusal of the Minister to answer the question be raised as a matter of privilege.  Mr Speaker. According to your ruling, I submit that my question is in order. It is a question as to the administration of the recruiting officers of the Commonwealth under the direction of the Minister regret to for Recruiting (Mr Orchard).",25
47,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATIO NAN D,"I understood ' the honourable member to refer to the refusal of the Minister to answer a question previously asked. The answering of questions is. entirely within the discretion of Ministers themselves. But the Speaker has the right to disallow questions which, in his opinion, should not be asked or answered. NA FRUITS.",25
48,Mr LYNCH,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"In view of rumours that are afloat, will the Minister for Trade and Customs state whether there is any intention on the part of his Department to vary or remove the prohibition against the importation of citrus fruit s into Australia?",25

Having Tegard to the large number of eligibles in all the Departments, w i ll the Minister give special attention to the request of these men, and see if it are is not possible to give them the relief they",25

52,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"Yesterday, the Treasurer, at my request, furnished a return showing the number of eligibles, between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years, employed in the Taxation Department, Melbourne. The summary showed, approximately, that thirty had joined the Australian Imperial Force, that there were thirty-three rejects and ninety-four returned soldiers employed in the Department here, and that 168 of the employees did not come within any one of tbese classes. Will the Treasurer endeavour to enforce in this Department the rule of preference of employment to returned soldiers ?",26
53,Mr WATT,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"I did not attempt to analyze the return very carefully when laying it on the table of the House. I gave it to the honourable member as soon as I received it ; but, so far as the Departments with which I am associated are concerned, wherever possible returned soldiers will be given preference. I am a believer in the principle, and will see, so far as I am able, that it is enforced. NAVA L BASES. ADVICE OF THEADMIRALTY.",26
54,Mr SAMPSON,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"I should like to know from the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt), or the Assistant Minister for  would be possible to acquaint the House with the nature of the communications between the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) an'd this Government, conit's veying the advice of the Admiralty as the urgency of the construction of Naval Bases for Australia. Would it be poscertain sible to give this information to the House, with the necessary safeguards to confidential, communications ?",26
55,Mr WATT,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"Anothe r Minister and myself have, on two different occasions, conveyed to the House at suitable times, and 1 think in a suitable way, the fact that we have consulted the authorities the Admiralty in relation to important matters-in relation to - our Base programme and our Fleet programme. We have given, in general terms, so far as is ber. permissible or proper, what is the determination ; and at this time. I do not feel disposed to publicly say in Parliament anything further on the matter. If honourable members desire and request information to be given privately, I will consider the request, but I would not be justified in going further in open House.",26
56,Mr KELLY,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"As the value of the advice of the Admiralty in reference to the Naval Bases depends on the time that advice was tendered-that is to say, whether it was tendered at the time we might reasonably anticipate the German Navy would cease to be-ca n the Acting Prime Minister inform us when the Admiralty was last asked for advice, and when the advice was tendered?",26
57,Mr WATT,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"I am afraid I cannot depend on my memory sufficiently to answer that question. Speaking purely from memory, we have, I think, asked advice on three occasions.' At the present time, the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) is in close conference with the Lords of the Admiralty so far as that is possible in this period of stress on this and related matters, which, if I could announce them, would, I think, be quite satisfactory to the House. TRADING SOHEME. GIFT OF 200,000 SIXPENCES.",26
58,Mr HIGGS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"Has the attention of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) been drawn to a press advertisement in which a company announces that it is intention to give away 200,000. sixto pences for the purpose of proving that a article they propose to sell to the public is a - good one? Is the honourable as gentleman aware that the retail grocers .have declined to handle that article, and does he propose to - take any action to suppress this imposition on the public?",26
59,Mr WATT,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"I have not heard anything of this before, and I should not likeof to pronounce whether the proposition is a good or a bad one. I shall consider the - matter to see how far I can go in the direction desired by the honourable memPRICE OF MEAT. ACTION or COUNTRY BUTCHERS.",26
60,Mr FENTON,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"I have, on former occasions, asked whether it is a fact that country butchers are closing their shops so that they may not be called upon to comply with the price regulations, and are charging exorbitant rates for . their meat.",27

62,Mr SPEAKER,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S," I have received an intimais tion from the honourable member for Melhe borne Ports (Mr Mathews) that he deany sires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite urgent public importance, viz., "" The mismanagement of the shipbuilding yards at Williamstown, causing grave industrial turmoil."" Five honourable members having risen in their places. Question proposed.",27
63,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"Melbourne Ports) not a shipbuilder either. [11.38] - I regret having to take the course of moving the adjournment of the House; ancl I can assure the Minister isolated cases.  personal feeling in the matter. The come of the deputation of ship-yard workmen yesterday to the Assistant ister for the Navy renders it necessary that something should be done. press has published an account of what took place at that deputation, and certain actions and utterances of mine are emis bodied in the report. I wish to say once that the Minister himself was cause of the trouble, and was very agitated throughout the whole of the proceedings. Personally, I have no animus against Minister, and it was no action of mine that gave rise to the events of yesterday. I raise the question today because the honourable gentleman has refused to do anything in connection with this urgent business; as a matter of fact, he refused to hear the statements that the deputation desired to make. Before I had an opportunity to introduce the deputation, the Minister at once attacked those composing it on a certain question, and called their admission or denial before he would hear them. ' I could see that can trouble was imminent, and, after some further remarks between the Minister aiid a the deputation, I asked permission to inwithdraw the members of it, so ""that I might re-introduce them with some sort of unanimity on their part. This proved that I had no desire for any trouble with the Minister. When the deputation returned to the presence of the Minister, he took the ground that they had no right express an opinion as to how the work conducted at these particular yards; held that they could not possibly have knowledge in that regard, and that all the knowledge and rights were on the matter of part of the management.",27
64,Mr RILEY,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,Who is the manager?,27
65,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"Mr Curchin, who. is paid £2,000 a year; though, being simply a naval architect, he knows nothing about shipbuilding. It is a further remarkable fact that the local  . Mr ' AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Thes e are not",27
66,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"That is so. The outgentleman who was previously in charge in Victoria has accepted an offer from Minthe New South Wales Goveniment, and thus we have lost his services. Why that The gentleman was allowed to go I cannot conceive. According to the attitude of the Minister to the deputation, he evidently of the opinion that the trained artisans at employed at the yard know nothing about the the trade. We all know that a-private soldier is as well able as an adjutant to say whether a da-ill is being properly conthe ducted ; and. the understrappers in any Department are quite able to appreciate whether the head is conducting the business in an efficient way. The conduct of the Comrnonwealth Ship-yards is of interest, not only to the Minister and the management, but to the men who work there, and to the community at large. Statements made by the men had appeared in the newspaper, and when they asked the Minister to allow them to substantiate those statements, surely he ought to have permit-ted them to do so? He not only refused to hear them, but said that they were not judges of the matter, and he could not listen to them on the point. It is time that the country knew the exact position at these yards. I know that the present Minister took over the duties of the office from another, and, to my mind, did his onerous work well. As I have already said, I have no ill-feeling against the honourable gentleman, but I must call attention to the peculiar position at these shipbuilding yards. The least the Minister could have done at the deputation was to put his own feelings on one side, and allow the men to state their - case in regard to the statements that had appeared in the Herald.  they deny.",27
67,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"They did not deny the accuracy of the statements, but wished to reiterate them. When the Minister refused to hear them, I took the members of the deputation outside, and said to them, "" Do you want to have your case tried?"" and they replied in the affirmative. Then I told them, ""Very well, if so, you must pacify the Minister in some way."" But, like Woodrow Wilson with the OermanSj the Minister demanded an unconditional surrender, his idea, apparently, being to make them crawl on their stomachs before he would hear them. The Minister would not hear them unless they unconditionally surrendered in respect of all they thought and all they liad done. Now the Minister says that the deputationdenied the accuracy of the report. The deputation had to adopt certain methods in order to get a hearing, and . I am pleased that they took my advice. The men affirm that all the statements reported in the Herald are correct, and they ask for an opportunity to prove them. If the Minister will not provide the opportunity, it is the duty of the Government to do so. It is all very well for the Minister to brush the statements aside in a high handed fashion. I assert that Mr. Ourchin knows nothing about shipbuilding. He may be a good naval architect, but he is not a shipbuilder.",28
68,Mr RILEY,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,Has he had any experience ?,28
69,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"None whatever. Neither can we get any proof that Mr. Pickering, the controller, has .any experience, but men who understand shipbuilding say that it is evident that he has not. It is wonderful to me that the Minister does not realise that the matter requires investigation. This is the report published in the Herald of 22nd OctoberAllegations in regard to the conditions' of work at the Willianistqwn Shipbuilding Yards were made at a meeting of the Victorian executive of the Australasian Society of Engineers last night. Speakers asserted that essential tools had disappeared and had not heen replaced, that even necessary bolts and nuts could not be ohtained, that men were told to "" keep out of sight,"" because there was no work for them to do, and that certain ofncials were trying to drive the members of the Australasias Society out of the yards. Eventually the following motion wa? carried :That, failing an inquiry by the Minister into the charges made, afc which inquiry the Australasian Society of Engineers shall have due representation, we favour canrelllng the shipbuilding agreement with the. Government. This motion is to be submitted by the executive to a mass meeting; of the men. It was because of that motion that the Minister refused to receive the deputation. He said to the men, "" If it is true that that motion were carried I will not hear you."" He would not allow them to explain that the motiosi had been moved at a meeting of the executive and had not been, referred to the main hody. However, after a discussion outside the Minister's room, the deputation returned and was allowed to proceed. The report continues The opening speaker said that difficulty had been experienced in expediting work now _ in hand at the yards, and as fremthe beginnUg there had been hostility on the part of certain officials to the Australasian Society, an effort was being made to cast the blame on its members. The definite charge was made that the members of the society .were incompetent. This charge was not laid at present against the members of other organizations at the yard. There was not a ' semblance of truth in the alienation that members of the Australasian Society were incompetent. (Hear, hear.) Neither, was there any truth in the allegation that work had been delayed by the engineers. DEFICIENCY IN STOKES. The reverse was true. Among other things there was a deficiency in stores, tools, and pliances, and the men claimed that certain officials in responsible positions had not before been identified with shipbuilding and eould not direct operations. The attitude adopted by the management towards the Australasian Society had been one of hostility from first to last. These complaints had been placed before the Minister from time to time, and sworn affidavits had been put in , but he appeared to have been swayed by. other advices in dealing with these matters. ' In view of the Minister's tude they had come to the conclusion that there was no other course open but to take drastic action. (Applause.) The next speaker had a number of complaints to make about men being put of f . He alleged that a pattern-maker had been brought Ballarat to the yards, and had then been put of f ; another man in the fitting shop was dismissed, and on asking what charge was there against him, was told that there was a shortage of work. Men had been brought long distances to the yards, and had broken up their homes, only to he put of f . The speaker complained, that there had .been an attempt "" blackball "" bim at the yards by. asking everybody to undertake a job'which it was alleged ho could not do, while the real reason was that there were no appliances there to do the job with. It Was disgraceful that a returned soldier should have heen dismissed. ° OBSTACLES INWAY . Another member of the executive said that ever since he had been engaged upon a certain machine at the yards every possible obstacle had been put in his way. When he took the miichine over ho found that it had been tampered with and sot up so that it would not work. There were no tools to enable him to work the machine, even after it had been righted. One job had been lying unfinished at the shop ever since he had been there. (Laughter.) There was no machine at the yard suitable to do the job in question. The reason, the speaker asserted, that they wished to get him off his machine was that there were only three men in Victoria who could work it . When he asked that some repairs be done the other day the blacksmith told him there were no tools in the blacksmith's shop to do the work with . ""It is nothing for us to take two or three days over a job and then nave to do it over Mr Mathews. again two or three times,"" was the next complaint voiced. "" If we want packing we have to use undersizes or oversizes and make it fit as best we can,"" continued this engineer. "" If bolts or nuts are required the man has to get them from the' scrapheap and file them off. There is no such thing as assortment of tools, and we have no small spanners. There are no plans to work by, and after getting half way through a job you will find that it! has to be done another way. The material which has been wasted is alarming. I can. honestly say that since Friday I have only done four or five hours' real work, and when I asked for instructions "" I was told to keep out of the way as ap- there was nothing for me. (Laughter.) That time will be booked against me, and I will be informed that I should have done the work more quickly. There was none to do. (Laughter.) One job had to be done three times, and when I did some necessary filing I was told not to interfere with work of which the foremanwas proud. After this job was put up it was found to be all wrong and it took ten days to fix it up again, because I was not allowed to attido work which any one could see was necessary. This particular job had been completed in the wrong way before the Australasian engineers entered the yard, so they can't blame us. Another job was put in place on the vessel, and it was not u n t i l three months after that they discovered it had to have kgyways in it , from and it had to he taken down.. (Great laughter ) I had previously told them it would have to have keyways."" Surely any Minister could see that statements like the foregoing demand inquiry, but from the very outset of the deputato tion the Minister was determined not to hear what the men had to say. The men say that there is no material on the job, yet the Department is asking the society for fifteen more fitters, five turners, and other men. The Department well knows that . the society is not a large body, and the Government are having trouble with another organization of engineers. Naturally, the men desire to know why these additional men - are wanted. The Department asks for five more turners when there are only two spare machines, on which the apprentices work. Why are fifteen more fitters required? The men say that the purpose of the Department is either to make the society admit that it cannot supply the men or to replace workmen already on the job. Are men to be asked to leave their jobs and go to Williamstown to do temporary repair? work ? We know that no machinery is available for additional labour. The men say that the Department is asking for tbese men for a certain purpose; the Minister replies that they have no right to consider whether a certain action by the Department will put them out of work. His attitude reminds me of a boss for whom I worked about thirty years ago, and who used to say, "" I am running this show; you have no rights at all."" That was the idea of the old bosses. Surely the Minister will not contend that the men have no right to conjecture, on the basis of the knowledge that they have, that the additional tradesmen who are required are intended to supplant the present employees.",28
70,Mr SAMPSON,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,Was not the contention of the Minister that the men should place their grievances before the authorities in a proper way instead of ventilating them in the press?,30
71,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"They have been continually attempting to get redress, and they held a meeting in the shipyard, at which a reporter was present. Honourable members know how assiduous reporters are in seeking copy. That is how the report appeared in the Herald. claim that the members of the deputation were courteous in their remarks to the Minister, and I do not think that anything more than courtesy and a plain statement should have been expected from them. They should not have been asked to surrender all their manhood. Unfortunately, the Minister was agitated from the very commencement of the interview. I admit that he has difficult problems to face, and I do not wish to speak harshly of him; but in view of the known shortage in machinery and material, the statements of the men should receive consideration. After the deputation yesterday a general meeting of the society was held, and the following mot,ion was carried:That this meeting of the members of the Australasian Society of Engineers, after hearing the report of the deputation that waited on the Acting ""Minister for the Navy today (24th October), is of opinion that the Minister in refusing an inquiry is refusing justice, and that we still adhere to our previous decision to fight for an inquiry, and instruct the acting - secretary to get in touch with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and ask him to bring the matter under the notice of the Acting Prime Minister, and that delegates he at once sent to Sydney and Adelaide to bring under the notice of our branches there the attitude of the Minister and the decision of the Melbounie""branch. I did not adopt the course-suggested by ' the resolution, because I think the practice of worrying the Acting Prime M in i * ter in regard to every matter is unfair to him and to other Ministers. I considered it preferable to adopt the course I am now pursuing. I have no desire to bring about industrial trouble.  on the part of the honourable member.",30
72,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"I have said repeatedly that I believe in the strike in-preference to arbitration; but I am not looking for industrial trouble, and I claim from the Minister an admission that, in regard to the present matter I have'not been aggressive - But, as a representative of the men, I refused to remain in the room and hear them bullied and told they had no rights. At every attempt, they made to explain their position they were pulled up by the Minister.  I other foot ",30
73,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"Nothin g of the sort. I admit that I demanded that the men should be heard properly, but the Minister pointed to the door. It was then that I expressed the desire that he might go somewhere else. I have not in any way sought to bring about trouble. I have introduced numbers of deputations to Ministers, as many as any other honourable member has, and I have never had trouble before. In fact, the Assistant Minister for the Navy is a personal friend of mine, and we have talked over this matter on previous occasions, but the method pursued on this occasion was most peculiar, and the deputation was not received in the ordinary way.",30
74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"If half of what the honourable member says is correct, the establishment ought to be closed down.",30
75,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"Why close down the yard? If the workmen are bad, we should employ better men. If the management is bad, we should appoint new managers. I cannot understand why the Minister refuses to have an inquiry.",30
76,Mr SAMPSON,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,What sort of inquiry does the honourable member want? ,31
77,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"I do not want an inquiry by the men, but they claim that they should have representatives on any inquiry board, who could putforward their side of the question. It is a fair - xdaiin that they should have the opportunity of stating their case. As this matter is one of considerable interest to the community, I am justified in asking the Ministry to give consideration to the request of the men, especially now that the matter has been ventilated in the press, and charges have been made against, the management of the yard. Even if there should be no proof in support of thpse charges forthcoming, at any rate there is good ground for inquiry. An inquiry board, comprising the heads of some of the Departments, with a representative of the men, would satisfy me, but I want action to be taken immediately, so that the management will have no opportunity of "" whitewashing "" themselves. If they cannot stand an investigation of this-sort, they have no right to occupy the positions they hold, ancl as the charges made by the men are so transparently true, I wonder, the Minister cannot acknowledge it. Mr Curchin is not a shipbuilder; he is a naval architect; a sort of superior draughtsman; and we have been endeavouring"" to ascertain from  years as foreman, and the particular branch of shipbuilding of which he was foreman. Wihen I submitted a question to the Minister, he tried to be funny, and  of a tailor's shop. At Wednesday's deputation to the Minister, eight different branches of shipbuilding work were represented. We want to know what'branch  man of. and whether he was in charge of a branch that would make him capable of filling the position which he is now pying. It is very apparent that Mr.  men to run the yard at Williamstown, and that there should be a change. I can understand the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) interjecting that if only half of what I have said is true the yard at Williamstown ought to be closed down. Can any one deny the ability of an artisan to judge the way in which things are being carried on ? Any artisan can tell by the way in which a man handles a tool whether he is a competent tradesman, just as a lawyer can tell by the way a man handles a brief whether he is a member of the legal profession or not. The Minister has no right to claim that the men in the yard are not capable of forming a judgment in these matters. They are tradesmen. The management are not. I have taken the only means available to me of bringing this matter forward. Unfortunately, I cannot goany further forward, because on his own uncorroborated ipse dixit the Minister will get up - and rebut every statement. I have made, and that will finish the business. Nevertheless, the statements made by these men are worthy of investigation, and if the Minister shirks an inquiry he will not be doing his duty or giving justice to the people of this community.  ister for the Navy) [12.6] - I am somewhat astonished at the honourable member's anxiety to prevent industrial turmoil, seeing that he has repeatedly stated in the House his belief in it, and that his attitude towards the ship-yard at Williamstown has always been in that direction. He has made the most glaring and incorrect statements in connection with the management of this yard that have ever come under my notice. As a matter of fact, they do not agree with the statements which the men themselves have made. I asked them yesterday categorically whether, they endorsed the report which had appeared in the Melbourne Herald, and they denied the truth of the statements appearing in it.",31
78,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"Because you compelled them to d'o - so. You would not hear occu- them, and I took them outside.  word while the honourable member, was speaking. The men also denied the reference to the dismissal of a returned soldiei"".",31

The Minister has only fifteen minutes in which to reply, and I ask the honourable member to allow him to speak without interruption.  member has made charges against Mr.  to say that the men have made no charges against them. Pn no instance has a charge been made to me by the men against these two gentlemen. The charges they have made are against the foreman, who was taken over from the Victorian State Government when the yard was transferred to the Commonwealth, and 'it is not a new matter-in fact, it has been before me practically from the first day on which I went into the Department. It has no connection with the shipbuilding scheme. These men are employed on the work of finishing a dredge which was in the yard incomplete at the time of the. transfer from the Victorian Goveniment, nnd which we are finishing. There has been constant turmoil in reernrd to that particular work. The men want me to do what I certainly will not do, and that is to institute an inquiry into the competency of the management, and they want to - say-the y stated it distinctly yesterday, and the honourable member has endorsed it today-whethe r wo shall employ additional hands or not. It is the most absurd claim that has ever come under my notice. The first complaint that reached me was that the foreman was a member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and they had suspicions that he was not giving them a fair deal. They said that if they had a chargeman appointed from their own society-the Australasian Society of Engineers-thing s would be all right, because then they would not come into contact with the foreman. I acted on their request, and a chargeman was appointed from their own society, but not the man they wished to put into the position. As it matter of fact, the man who is making the greatest fuss today is the one they wished to have appointed as chargeman"". If we are to carry on shipbuilding, the management must have control of the yards; and, although I have taken up the position all along that I am always available to hear the men's complaints in regard to any grievances concerning pay or working conditions, when they came to me to talk about the management, or say that this or that had not been done properly, I told them, as I repeated yesterday, that it was not part of their duty to clo this. There can beno discipline in the shipbuilding yard if every time a complaint is submitted it takes the nature of an allegation against the competency of the management and a demand for an inquiry.",32

On one occasion he paid a visit to the yard at Williamstown prior to the taking-of a contract for the building of ships by Walkers Limited, and in my office he spoke of the competent men who were in charge of the yard. I asked whom he referred to, and he said that he spoke of the management generally. It was on the very day that I had received aletter from the men, signed by several names supposed to be representing several societies, in which they found fault with the management, and suggested that I should take the men in the central office and place them in . charge of the yard and getrid of the men in control there. Therefore, I was interested in what Mr MCKay said, and I asked him if he could mention the men to whom he particularly referred. The first  He said, ""He is one of the most capable men I have come across.""- I said to Mr. MCKay, "" How much would he be worth to you in your yard ?""

One never sees that done in private employment. Mr MoGRATH - Wheneve r there was anything wrong the honourable member was prepared «to take up the matter on behalf of his union, and as a unionist he always adopted the attitude that the employees .had certain rights and' should not be treated as serfs, or as pieces of machinery. In connection with an institution controlled by the Government, I cannot imagine how it can be contended that employees have not the right to approach a Minister if they-think it well to inform him that in connection with a particular work something is going on which ought not to be allowed. These men do not want to precipitate industrial trouble, and I ask the Minister to let an inquiry be held. The men make definite charges. We desire-and I am sure the Minister also desires-that our shipbuilding efforts shall be successful. If there be any truth in the statement that the managers are in competent, our shipbuilding ventureis doomed to failure, and we do not desire that. I am satisfied that the Minister would like it to be a success. We know how much depends upon it, because the war may not be over for a year or for two years, and the enemies' submarines may continue to be active. It is., in the circumstances, essential to the interests of Australia that we shall make satisfactory progress in shipbuilding in this country. This will be impossible if we have a body of men engaged in the industry who are labouring under what they conceive to be a genuine grievance against the management. Their grievance may not be genuine, but sometimes illusions cause more trouble than is caused by genuine grievances. I ask the Minister not to be stubborn, and to have an inquiry by competent men, and let us know whether the men in charge of these yards are thoroughly competent to carry out their work.

106,Mr TUDOR,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"Y a r r a ) [12.27] - There are difficulties in the way of shipbuilding in Australia. There is a shortage of material and of necessary machinery, and there is also a shortage of men trained to shipbuilding, .because we have never previously constructed ships in Australia of the size now required. I should be the last man to place any difficulties in the way of extending the shipbuilding in dustry in Australia in view of the necessities of the world, and particularly of Austi'alia, in the matter of freight. We are feeling the lack of shipping facilities very greatly in the Commonwealth. have represented unionists upon deputations to employers, not. only in Australia, but in other parts of the world. If I returned to my trade tomorrow I should probably find myself on deputations again. I have never worked for. a Government, but I know that in private employ it very often happens that men who are given foremen's positions are not the best tradesmen. The Acting Minister  well as I do that in private employ the men who are prepared to stand up for their rights are not given foremen's jobs.",36
107,Mr JOWETT,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"The race is not always to the swift. Mr TUDOR,-That is true, if the honourable member is referring to shipbuilding in the Commonwealth. We took over the yards at Williamstown before the Prime Minister lef t for the Old Country in April,- and before the Acting Minister took charge. There was a dredge on ""tha stocks there which was being built for the Melbourne Harbor Trust. It is not an exceptionally big dredge, or as big as some of those which previous Governments have been obtaining from abroad. I should think that dredge has been on the stocks at Williamstown now for nearly two years, and the Minister will agree that it is likely to remain there for some months longer before it is completed. I have not been down there since the Commonwealth had charge of the yard, though I did visit the place a few years ago, when the New Zealand was nere. No harm'can be don© by an inquiry. We have had inquiries before into other Departments, including one quite recently into the Defence and Navy Departments, and every one who has read the result of that inquiry must admit that it was necessary. One of the recommendations in regard to the N a v y Department wa3 that a certain gentleman should be placed in a certain position, and for some very mysterious reason this was done at about the time the report was being printed. I do not want the M in ister to run away with the idea that I am concerned about which society these men belong to, whether to the Australasian Society of Engineers or the Amalgamated Society; but what has been said shows that an inquiry is necessary. How long 1 did it take the management to have the Dart fitted up preparatory to the search for Captain Chugg?  pare the fitting up of the Dart with the work oh the dredge ?",36
108,Mr TUDOR,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"No , but the work took longer than should have been necessary.  only two or three days altogether.",36
109,Mr TUDOR,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,T he Minister would be more correct if he multiplied that by three or four. MT . POYNTON - The work was finished yesterday.,36
110,Mr TUDOR,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,I understand it took about ten days.  were working on the dredge.,36
111,Mr TUDOR,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"I do not think that the work on the dredge was pushed forward as expeditiously as might have been expected. Possibly there were faults in the management. Managers are not always right. We know that in private employment managers are sometimes displaced by other men in the interests of efficiency. I do not know if these men are members of the Amalgamated Society or not, but I think that, after the representations which have been made by the member foT Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews), there is need for an inquiry. Before this motion was submitted, the Minister asked leave to introduce a Bill dealing with shipbuilding. This, I presume, is the measure referred to in the Ministerial announcement at the beginning of the session, and which was referred to by the Acting Minister in , his ^address to members of the National Federation, when he - said it was the intention of the Government to contract themselves outside the jurisdiction of the Arbitratio n Court. Naturally, therefore, I am anxious to see the Bill , because I want to see less industrial turmoil in the future. We all know, from experience, that it is far better to grant an inquiry when it has been asked for by a deputation, because if men are in the wrong they will then be more satisfied. If , on the other hand, their request is refused, they will nurse their grievances for a long time. In the interests of shipbuilding in Australia, therefore, I urge the Minister to reconsider his decision, because, like all other men, he is liable to make a mistake. If ever J make a mistake I do not mind admitting it . I have made mistakes in the' .past, and I have no doubt I will make many in the future. If any man declares that he never makes a mistake, he might fool himself, but nobody else. I believe an inquiry is necessary in this matter, and that if the request is granted, it will be in the interests of all concerned. management is quite' competent, surely there is nothing to fear from an inquiry, which is long overdue.",36
112,Mr FENTON,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"(Maribyrnong) [12.35]. - If I were the manager of these yards, and subordinates made cbarges against me, coupled with a demand for an in quiry, I would not sit down quietly and allow the matter to pass. We cannot afford to make too many mistakes in our shipbuilding schemes, because with our long coastline, and quite apart from oversea trade, wo are bound to become a great maritime people, and our shipbuilding ventures tire long overdue. It is natural that mistakes should be made in a new undertaking of this nature, just as mistakes were made in other Departments of Government activity. When we commenced the construction of railway engines at Newport many mistakes were made, ancl the croakers and "" stinkingfish "" party said, "" Let us have no more engines built here. They are costing a terrible sum of money."" But today Newport workshops are turning o u t ' engines quite as good, if not better, than those constructed in America or Great Britain, and, what is more important, they are not costing so much.",37
113,Mr JOWETT,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,There are good people there.,37
114,Mr FENTON,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"This result at Newport shows that wisdom has been displayed in selecting the proper class of men to take charge of the works. It has been demonstrated that, under eflicient management, the Australian workman, when pro- perly trained, can compete with workmen from any part of the world. If anything is wrong in the supervision of these ship- . yards, our whole shipbuilding scheme will be a howling farce. Good supervision is the key to success. If I were manager of these yards, I would ask the Minister to appoint an independent Board of In q u i r y, so that the matter could be cleared up once and for all, and the public would have an assurance that the management was properly equipped to carry out the work intrusted to it .",37
115,Mr BAMFOED,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"Almos t the - same charges were made against Mr K in g Salter at one time. If the Mr Fenton - I do not ' know whether that is so or not, but I am sure that if the honourable member were in charge of these yards, and similar allegations were made against him, he would be one of the .first to place all his cards on the table and show his qualifications for the position he occupied. If an in quiry is held, as requested, it will be possible for the management to answer the charges, and if they are refuted the public of Australia will be satisfied.",37
116,Mr JOWETT,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,The honourable member will admit that it is quite a different thing when people who are hostile to the Government ask for an inquiry.,37
117,Mr FENTON,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"Q u it e apart from what was said by the deputation yesterday, a responsible member of this House, representing the constituency - in which shipbuilding is being carried on, has made certain statements which should be in quired into. Hitherto when a charge has been made on the floor of the House, the responsible Minister has always been ready to grant an-inquiry. Mr Fisher invariably took this stand. In this instance I fully expect that a request will come from the management to the Minister for an. inquiry, in order' to satisfy the public. I am not satisfied, but I want to be. I believe also that the Minister wants to be thoroughly satisfied. He may be satisfied, because he may have better information than I possess; but the public will be very much disturbed by this discussion, and will not be satisfied if the whole matter is covered up without an inquiry. In the most friendly way, therefore, I suggest that the Minister, if he has come to a decision, should reconsider the matter, and grant the request.",37
118,Mr MATHEWS,IMPORTATION OF CITRU S,"Melbourne Ports) [12.40] - I have no ill-feeling, so far as the Minister is concerned, but I point out that while he says there has been no attack on the management, right through his speech he endeavoured to prove that there had been such an attack. All I can say is that it is well known that something is wrong down there. It is well known that the men in charge are not shipbuilders, and if the Minister does not - do something in the matter he will be neglecting his duty. . Question resolved in the negative.",38

SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 24th October (vide page 7220), on motion by Mr . GLYNNThat this Bill be now read a second time.",40
138,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"Barrier) [12.53], - When I secured leave to continue my remarks last night I had made a statement with respect to the numbers constituting the British electorate under the revised franchise. I remarked that there were about 20,000,000 people who would be in the ' new electorate. At the time, the debate having arisen unexpectedly, I had not the authorities with me, and some honourable members opposite questioned the accuracy of my figures. I have to admit that, with regard to the numbers previously on the British roll, under the old franchise, I made an error by mentioning that the total was 12,000,000, instead of which it should have been 8,500,000. But, concerning, the numbers to be added to the roll, I was approximately correct in quoting the total at somewhere about 10,000,000 people. The actual figures I have taken from Whitaker's Almanac for 1917. This work of reference sets out the franchise in 1916. The total number of British electors ""on the roll, the year before that, was 8,357,648. The population in 1914 was 46,431,514. have ascertained the numbers to be added to the rol l by reference to a Hansard report of the B r it i sh House of Commons, dated 22nd May, 1917. Therein, MT . J. B. Watson, says The right honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill pointed out that the old register for the United Kingdom contained rather more than 8,000,000 voters, and this measure will add rather less than 3,000,000 male voters. To this 11,000,000, about 6,000,000 women will be added, or rather less than half the adult female population. The whole electorate will be raised to something like 17,000,000, of whom 0,000,000 would be women. The total B r it i sh electorate, therefore, instead of being about 20,000,000, as I indicated",41
139,Mr LISTEB,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"The honourable member said 22,000,000 last night. .",41
140,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"I have just explained that I was under the impression that the old roll contained something like 12,000,000 names, and that the new rol l would add about"" another 10,000,000, making the aggregate about 22,000,000. It appears now that the total new electorate will comprise somewhere about 17,500,000. It means that there will be more voters added to the new electorate than has ever before voted in Britain . I have attempted - to ' point out that, in my opinion, if this Parliament desired to introduce a proper system of political democracy, instead of honourable 'members being required to discuss such a measure as this we would be dealing with the initiative, the referendum, and the right of recallthe initiative, in order to give the people outside Parliament power to initiate Bills for the Legislature; the referendum, to permit electors as a whole to signify their approval or disapproval of proposed legislation ; and the recall, to enable electors to exercise proper and necessary control over their political delegates. I believe that the logical outcome of a reformed Parliament of this description would be that the elected representatives of the people, instead of acting as we do now-that is, in talking for the most part on proposed legislation-and having very l it t l e material effect upon the country as a wholewould elect the Government of the day; I and the members themselves would be divided into Committees. The whole Parliament would resolve itself into a business Committee, and could be subdivided into Committees to deal with necessary legislation. Every member would have a direct interest in proposed legislation, and the Government of the day would be a truly National Government, since it would be elected by the whole of the representatives of the people. That is my conception of a democratic Parliament in the sense of political Democracy-the parliamentary machine democratized, brought up to date, and made efficient, the people having the power to initiate legislation and to pass their verdict upon it after it has been drafted.",41
141,Unknown,PAYMENTS TO NEW,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,41
142,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"When the sitting was suspended I was remarking that, though .political Democracy, as I have at-, tempted to outline it, is eminently desirable and necessary, it does not, from my point of view, affect the real question at issue in this, as in every other country, . namely, the establishment, not merely of political, but of industrial Democracy. In every age, and in every land, the social, intellectual, and governmental institutions have reflected, and have arisen out of, the prevailing economic system of that country and period. This is clearly shown in the evolution of the parliamentary system of government in British 1 speaking countries. I have already endeavoured to prove this, though perhaps I have not dealt with it in an adequate maimer, because it is inevitable that, if I attempted to deal with the subject of sociology generally, I should be led away from the discussion of electoral matters. Bnt the conflicting economic classes have from time to time in the world's history - fro m the time of primitive - communism, through that of barbarism, and through the feudal period to the present day of capitalistic - production for profit and its consequent camouflaged system of wage slavery - seized-power as each became the dominating factor in the pconomic life of the community, ancl have reflected themselves in the governing institutions of that period ancl country. Thus, the aristocratic regime in England was superseded by the rising .capitalistic class, which restricted, the powers of the King, eventually wiped out the authority of the barons, established parliamentary institutions, inaugurated Electoral Acts, and enabled that particular economic class to function politically. Hence we had the Reform Bill as the occasion warranted it. The working classes of Britain are so inadequately enfranchised that under the latest Electoral Act 9,000,000 additional persons will be entitled to vote. Had adult suffrage been adopted, the estimate which I gave last night would have been correct. But women in Great. Britain aro not entitled to vote unless they are thirty yeaTS of age and possess certain property qualifications, or unless their husbands possess those qualifications. Consequently, there are millions of women in England today who are denied the right to vote. But, nevertheless, theTe has been, throughout the centuries, a gradual diffusion of political power in the hands of the rising economic classes. To-day, with the advancement of machinery, and with the development which science has. made possible, the rising economic class of the future comprises the industrial proletariat of the world. The working classes are becoming the dominating factor in modern capitalistic soeiety, and consequently the political power is' again being re-adjusted. This fact is. evidently recognised, even by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald), who, in speaking here on the 26th September of the present year, statedWhen the war is over the workers will no longer be content to .be employees in industries. They will insist on becoming partners in them. Otherwise, there will be a cut throat revolution, and the red flag will be hoisted. As a student of political economy, he evidently realizes that economic power is at the base of all political institutions, and that with the growing power of the workers as an economic class, they, in common with every other class which has preceded them in the history of Britain, will demand representation in proportion to their numbers and power. I quits agree with the honourable member when he says that we must take steps to prevent a cut-throat revolution of which he spoke. I am no advocate of a revolution by physical force in order to reconstruct society in Australia.",41
143,Mr ARCHIBALD,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"The honourable member has never advocated anything else. Mr COWSIDINE.^-Th'at is a very unkind remark on the part of the honourable member. He knows perfectly well that his statement is not accurate, and if he does not know it, he is not acquainted with the facts. Given the political machinery which I have advocated, a revolution by physical force is neither necessary nor ""desirable in order to reconstruct society in the interests of those who produce the wealth of this country.",42
144,Mr ARCHIBALD,PAYMENTS TO NEW,Has the honourable member ever advocated a round table conference to solve any industrial difficulty?,42
145,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"Most decidedly, and I have sat at such a conference.",43
146,Mr ARCHIBATJD,PAYMENTS TO NEW,When ?,43
147,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"When I was on strike, and when, acting as the president of the Miners Association in Broken Hill, it was necessary for mo to meet the mine managers in the interests of the ple over whom I presided. I may further tell, the honourable member that if my commendations had been accepted there would have been no strike. That, I suppose, is news to him. If he desires any further information on the point, I may tell him that I have advocated only one St Mr ' SPEAKER (Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) - I do not see any reference to strikes and industrial disturbances in this Bill.",43
148,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) directed my attention to a certain aspect of this question which he regarded as. inconsistent with the remarks I was making, and, in order to disillusion him, I gave him a little of my personal history. Perhaps it was unnecessary to do so.",43
149,Mr SPEAKER,PAYMENTS TO NEW,I do not kuow whether it was unnecessary; but it was certainly irregular in the. present debate.,43
150,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"I have become so accustomed to interjections that I thought my remarks were perfectly regular. When I was interrupted . I was pointing out that if the initiative, referendum, and recall were embodied in our Constitution it would be neither desirable nor necessary to have a revolution, by physical force in order to allow those who produce the wealth of this country to control society in their own interests. In attempting to achieve political Democracy",43
151,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"What does the honourable member mean by "" Democracy'' ?",43
152,Mr SPEAKER,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"Order ! I am hoping that the honourable member will connect his remarks with the Bill presently. I trust, therefore, that honourable members will refrain from interjecting.",43
153,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"As the whole of our electoral machinery is now under review, I am endeavouring to point out that the provisions of this Bill do not touch the real question at issue, viz., the establishment of political Democracy in this country. It is, therefore, necessary for me to show where political power originates. I claim' that it originates with the class which possesses economic power in any peo- community. I have here a work upon Parliamentary Government in England, re- by Alpheus Todd, and I find - that in vol. 1, page 26, he saysI n a paper read by Professor Leone Levi before the British Assoeiation, in September, 1865, on the Statistics of Representation, it is computed that if representation in ' England were based upon population, for everj' 100 votes there should be given four to the upper, thirty-two to the middle, and sixty-four to the working, classes. If , on the other hand, it were in proportion to the amount of taxes paid by eaoh, of every 100 votes eighty-three should be given to the upper classes, thirteen to the middle, and four to the working classes. This will afford some idea of the vast social revolution which would be effected by the introduction of representation according' to population into the electoral system of Englsnd'. That quotation bears out the trend of my argument. I contend that if adequate electoral machinery were established in this country to enable the great mass of the people to originate legislation-if , in short, they had a real system of political Democracy-thoug h a social revolution would be involved, it would not be a revolution by physical force. It would then rest with the workers themselves, and with their organization, to make their requirements felt through the electoral machinery that would be available to thom. If , as I claim, industrial Democracy is the reaj i m , and not political a Democracy, even given the initiative, referendum, and recall, which, though not generally operative in America, are operative in many of the States, we should still have, side by side with our political Democracy, the Plutocracy consisting of the coal-owners and the magnates of the steel and other trusts, who, by reason of their wealth, control of the press, and general power, influence and delude the people. They would still be able to maintain their system of exploitation and robbery. That is why I say that, even given the machinery which I claim it should have, political Democracy will not wholly fill the bill. We 0 must therefore go further and establish industrial Democracy.. I agree with the-statement of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . Archibald), that if we are to avoid a physical force revolution in order to re-adjust the social system we must give the people the machinery which, according to their intellectual development and their ability to use it , will reflect their views in the political and social life of the community. To-day we have a parliamentary system of government which reflects the "" interests"" of this country more or less. Industrial Democracy' would not have in this country a Parliament based on geographical divisions. It would have as its administrative machinery Parliament, a Legislative Council, or a Legislative Assembly-cal l it what you will-arisin g from the trial Democracy of the nation, and not bounded by the River Murray or the River Darling,, or any other geographical feature. Its Parliament would be representative of fBe industrial interests of the country. The interests of the agricultural and other workers would be reflected in it . The representatives from the industrial constituencies would come here, and their function would be to operate the machinery of the country in the direction of production for use in stead of, as now, for profit. That system is possible of attainment by the machinery of the initiative, referendum, and recall, plus political intelligence. initiative would give the right to the necessary quota outside Parliament to call for an amendment of the Constitution. The referendum would give us the right so to alter the Constitution as to chance the whole basis of our parliamentary institutions. We could thus wipe out the geographical divisions that return political representatives to this Parliament. ' Then, with the power of recall",43
154,Mr RODGERS,PAYMENTS TO NEW,Some of us would grassed pretty early.,44
155,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"Possibl y so. I represent here the industrial interests of the class to which I belong. I desire to stay here as long as my constituents allow me to stay; but, irrespective of whether I stay here or go outside, I shall still advocate the machinery that I have outlined. No country can call itself a political Democracy that refuses to the mass of the' people the right to initiate legislation, that refuses to consult them upon the legislation they desire, to have, and denies to them the power to mould their Constitution, and their industrial or political system of society, as seems good to the majority.",44
156,Mr RODGERS,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"If that system, were applied here, you would probably be the first victim,",44
157,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"I should not be the first individual who has advocated a reform and been the victim ef it , but that does not detract from the justice or a logic of my argument. L am one of those who look for a social revolution- a reconstruction of society in the interests of indus-. the class to which I belong. Every other class which has preceded our class in the history of the world has, as it has attained economic power, moulded existing institutions to conform to its desires. Our present parliamentary system of government by 'individuals is the direct outcome of the development of the capitalistic form of society. The future society, to correspond to the economic development of today, will be concerned with the administration of industry, and not the government of individuals. Therefore, I tell the Government side that, if they provide the machinery I advocate, they will be taking time by the The forelock and avoiding the clash of a physical-force revolution. Instead - of sitting on the safety valve, they will provide the people with the power so to 'alter the basis of their parliamentary institutions as to make them conform to their intellectual development and political strength. If they believe in the reconstruction of society on the lines I have laid down, that will be a sensible thing for them to do. If they do not, they will disagree with the object I have in view. But that does not do away with be the fact that those members of the Government party who advocate political Democracy cannot claim to haveestablished a real political Democracy unless the power is placed in the hands of the people instead of i h the hands of a section.",44
158,Mr RODGERS,PAYMENTS TO NEW,You are for a continuous opportunity which nowpresents itself at least once in every three years.,45
159,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"Th s honourable member is referring to the right of recall. The initiative, as I understand it , simply means that a certain quota of the' populace have the right to call for the initiation of a piece of legislation which they think eminently desirable, and which they believe the majorit y of the people favour.",45
160,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PAYMENTS TO NEW,If we had the initiative we should have had prohibition long ago.,45
161,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"If the people desire prohibition they should have it , and the machinery should be there to enable them to get it . If the people desire prohibition, not of liquor,' but of the capitalistic system of production for profit, they-should have it too. The"" referendum enables the. people, after their elected representatives have flamed a Bill , to signify whether they are in favour of it or not, and the right of recall gives the people the necessary control of the delegates who are their political representatives. W it h the auguration of a real political Democracy, the representatives of the people would not be here, as I am this afternoon, endeavouring to propagate these views. They would not be here as members of different parties, but the people. would initiate the legislation and pass it after we had put it in a for m that they could vote on. We should also be electing the Government from both sides of the House. It would be chosen by the whole of the political tives of the people, and would be trul y national. While the advocates political Democracy cannot deny that position, I hold that they must go f u ther, because political Democracy is no longer adequate to 'the economic develop- - in 19.14 :ment of the times. ' We must have in dustrial Democracy. We must introduce Democracy into the workshop, the the factory, and the field, as well as into our political Constitutions. As the honormay able member for Hindmarsh (Mr . Archibald) said, when the war is over, the workers will no longer be content to go office, contending on as they have hitherto. The honourable member says that they will demand partnership. I say they will demand the lot. The honourable member also remarkedThe honourable member for Capricornia. frequently talks about our Federal Constitution, and exclaims, "" For heaven's sake, do not let the bottom fall out of it."" May I remind him that America, as well as Australia, has a Constitution- a Constitution under which there is so much freedom in normal times that one would almost imagine that every man is a law unto himself. Many of the States of America have the had initiative and the right of recall.",45
162,Mr RODGERS,PAYMENTS TO NEW,Hav e they knocked out the capitalistic system there?,45
163,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"I shall tell the honourable member what political Democracy means. I have here a publication called K in g Goal, by Upton Sinclair, an American novelist. At the end of the book is"" an appendix containing an account of a .decision by the Supreme Court of the State of California oh a case arising out of the last election that took place in Colorado. It is as follows:In the elections of November, 1914, in Huerfano County, Colorado, J. B. Farr, Republican candidate for re-election as sheriff, a person in- known throughout the coal country as "" the King of Huerfano County,"" was returned as elected by a majority of 329 votes. His rival, the Democratic candidate, contested the election, alleging "" inalcond-uct, fraud and corruption."" The District Court found in Farr's favour, and the case was appealed on error to the Supreme Court of the States. On 23rd June, 1916, after Farr had served nearly the whole of his term of ofiice, the Supreme Court handed down a decision which unseated him and the entire.ticket elected with him, finding in favour of the opposition ticket in all cases and upon all grounds charged. representaI shall now show, by means of that Supreme Court - decision in "" the land of of the free and the home of the brave,"" which is engaged now in helping us to r - make the world safe for Democracy, how much real Democracy existed in Colorado The Court decision first gives an outline of' case, using, for the most part, the statements of the counsel for the defendant, Farr; so that for practical purposes the following be taken as the coal companies' own account of their domain: ""Round the shaft of each mine are clustered the tipple, the mine the shops, sheds, and outbuildings; and huddled close by,- within a stone's throw, cottages of the miners built on the land of, and owned by the mining eompany. dwellers in the camp are employees of the mine. There is no other'industry. This is ' the camp.' Of the eight ' closed camps ' . it appeirs that practically the same conditions existed in ' all of them, and those conditions were in general that members of the United Mine Workers of America, their organizers, or agitators, were prevented from coming into the camps so far as it was possible to keep them out, and to this end guards were stationed about them. Of the"" eight ' closed ' camps, one of them, ' Walsen,' was, and at the time of the trial still was, enclosed by a fence erected at the beginning of the strike in October, 1913. Mr SPEAKER. (Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) - I should like the honourable member to endeavour to connect his remarks with the Bill before the Chair. I have listened very carefully to the honourable member's speech, and have tried in vain to see what the matter he is referring to has to do with the Bill.",45
164,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,The Bill proposes to alter the electoral system of this country by introducing certain features which are capable of giving rise to corrupt practices. I am quoting a case to show how corrupt practices occurred in one of the American States where a similar electoral system prevails.,46
165,Mr SPEAKER,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"If the honourable member will connect his references with the Bill before the House, he will be in order. But so far he has not attempted to do so.",46
166,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"The quotation continues"" Rouse and Cameron were partly, but never entirely, enclosed by fences. It is admitted that all persons entering these Camps and precincts were required by the company to have passes, and it is contended that this was an ' industrial necessity.' . The Court then £oes on as follows:""The Federal troops entered the district in May of 1914, and the testimony is in agreement that no serious acts of violence"""" occurred thereafter, and that order was preserved up to and subsequent to the election, and to the time of this t r i a l . "" It was under this condition that in July, 1914, the Board of County Commissioners changed certain of the election precincts so as te constitute each of such Camps an election precinct, and; wit h one . exception, where a few ranches were included, these precincts were made to conform to the fences and lines around each Camp, protected by fences in some instances, and with armed guards in all cases. All the Thus each election precinct, by this unparalleled aet of the Commissioners, was placed exclusively within and upon the private grounds, and under the private control, of a coal corporation, which autocratically declared who should, and who should not,' enter upon the territory of this political entity of the State,, so purposely bounded by the County Commissioners.  does not seriously argue that this is possible in Australia 1 ",46
167,Mr CONSIDINE,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"Anythin g is possible in a country dominated by the wealthy profiteering interests. "" With but one exception, all the lands and buildings within each of these election precincts as so created, were owned or controlled by the coal corporation; every person resident within such precincts was an employee of these private corporations or their allied companies, with the single exception; every judge, clerk, or officer of election, with the exception of a saloon-keeper, and partner ofFarr, was an employee of the coal company. """"The polling places were upon the grounds and in the buildings; of these companies. In certain parts of Australia polling booths are erected on land controlled by agricultural and pastoral interests. "" The registration lists were kept within the private offices'or buildings of such companies, and used and treated as their private property. ""Thus were the publie election districts and the publie election machinery turned over to the ""absolute domination and imperial control of private coal corporations, and used by them as absolutely and privately as were their mines, to and for their own private purposes, and upon which public territory no man might enter for either public or - private purpose, save and except by the express permission of these"" private corporations. "" This right to determine who should enter such so-called election, precincts appears, from the record, to have been exercised as against all classes; merchants, tradesmen, or what not, and whether the business of such person was public or private. Indeed, it appears that in one instance the Governor and Adjutant-General of the State, while on official business, were denied admission to one of these closed Camps. And that on the day of election, the Democratic watchers and challengers for Walsen Mine precinct, one of which was Neelle'y, the Democratic candidate for sheriff, were forced to seek and secure a detail of Federal soldiers to escort them into the precinct and to the polls, and that such soldiers remained as such guard during the day and a paTt of the night.",46

As to the objections one might entertain in respect of the measure, I may say at once that I am opposed to the whole system of political representation hi Australia today. It is an outworn system- a relic of economic conditions that do not prevail today. Political Democracy in this and every country is a huge farce. There is, in fact, no such thing as political mocracy in existence.",48
180,Mr SPEAKER,PAYMENTS TO NEW,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,48
181,Mr SAMPSON,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"Wimmera) [2.56] Since I regard this Bill as primarily one for discussion in Committee, I shall not at this stage debate it at any length. I should like, in the first place, to congratulate "" the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) upon his lucid explanation of its provisions, and also upon rhe character of the Bill itself. The two outstanding features of the measure are the provisions relating to preferential voting in respect of elections for the House of Representatives and for the restoration of the postal vote. These ' amendments of the law mark an advance in the right direction. Preferential voting has been part of the policy of our party for the last five years. When, we These went to the country in 1913 it was one of the leading planks in our platform, and I am glad that the Government are now about t'o give effect to the principle. There are, however, certain disappointments associated with the Bill. I regret that the Minister, in introducing it, was not able to announce that he had arranged with the various State Governments for a uniform roll for State and Federal elections, since such a reform would mean a considerably reduced electoral expenditure; and I regret, also, that he was unable to announce that an. agreement had been arrived at for a uniform system of voting in substitution of the dual and confusing systems now operating in the State and Eederal spheres. As to the provision - for the restoration of the postal vote, I think that the limit of 15 miles might well have elec- been reduced by the Minister. That, however, is one of the questions with which we shall be able to deal more effectively in Committee. Many honourable members, and a large section of the public, will be disappointed to find that the preferential voting system is to apply only to elections for the House of Representatives. I find it difficult to understand why the Government, which is responsible to the country for Dethe introduction of electoral reform, should have brought in such a. partial system in this regard. The Bill should have provided for the application of preferential voting or some other reformed system of voting to elections for the Senate. I agree with those who have stated that if , at the next general elections, we have running side by side preferential voting for the House of Representatives and the present system in respect of elections for the Senate, great - confusion will, in all probability, result. It is not at all difficult to understand why many people who are called upon to exercise their electoral privileges on comparatively rare occasions should become confused when they enter the polling booths to record their votes. It is the duty of this Parliament to simplify, instead of to further confuse, the procedure. I am not only disappointed at the failure of the Government tb prodivisions. vide in this Bill for the application"" preferential voting to elections for Senate, but I regret that provision has to not been made for a further reform i the direction of the subdivision of the States into' electoral divisions f o Senate'instead of each State being polled as a whole. One of the greatest curses in Australia at the present time is the centralization that is going on in every State. In Victoria we have probably the most shocking example of this, since per cent, of our population is to be found within the metropolitan area. Under the block-vote system, the swing of the elecments toral pendulum throws the electoral the power into , our large centres of populaas tion. The large cities throughout Ausbe tralia dominate the Senate vote, and under the ticket system overwhelming majorities are recorded for one particular party in all our big centres of populaA tion. The present Senate electoral system has been spoken of in this House as being peculiarly one for the preservation of State rights. It has been said again again that the block-vote system affords the only means by which the rights of the States, as with in the Federal sphere, can be preserved. That, however, is an entirely erroneous view. Those who have read the debates that took place when this question was under discussion the Federal Conventions, will know that provision is made in the Constitution to enable this Parliament to determine what electoral system shall be applied to Senate, elections and to decide whether in respect of the Senate each State should be polled as one division or subhas divided into electorates. Section the Constitution provides thatThe Senate shall be composed of senators each State, directly chosen by the people of the State, voting, until the Parliament wise provides,"" as one electorate. . . . Wben that clause in. the draft tion Bill was before the Convention, very considerable debate took place the question as to whether each should be polled as one electorate, or Mr Sampson. should be subdivided into electoral The late Lord Eoi'rest sugof gested an amendment which would have the left to the State Parliaments the right subdivide the - States into electorates for n the election of senators, and in the debate which followed that proposal such r the distinguished men as the late Lord Forres;, Sir George Reid, and Sir Will i a m Lyne, as well as other prominent statesmen, put .forward the view that the interests as well as the manhood of the various States could be protected only by subdividing the States into electoral 50 divisions for the Senate. While the matter was under the consideration of the Convention, five of the six State Parliaforwarded requisitions urging that provision for the polling of each State one constituency for the Senate should excised from the Bill , and that the State Parliaments should be free to determine whether each State should be polled as one division or as several. long debate followed, and the provision to give the Parliament the right to determine whether the one electorate should continue was expressly inserted to enable the alteration to be made if it was believed to be justified by experience. and The time has now arrived when we should give effect to that power embodied in the Constitution, and spread the representation as far as possible, so that the people in the remoter parts may have an opportunity of electing their senators. Would anybody suggest that we should in have recourse to the block system of voting for the House of Representatives? Since the beginning of Federation, it has been observed that the man who is best known, or is put on the ticket of some powerful organization or newspaper, the best chance-of being returned as 7 of a senator; and, as a matter of fact, the great bulk of the electors vote for men without ever having seen them. It is foi impossible for a candidate to make himotherself sufficiently known all over a State so as to avoid a blind vote of the kind I have indicated. Constitu- ' Mr NICHOLLS - If the ticket did not a operate before - the election, it would on operate when Parliament met. State Mr SAMPSON - Unfortunately , a system of ticket politics has grown up in Australia, perhaps more completely than elsewhere,' and that is because of the caucus methods adopted. This has not only operated to 'the extent of developing the. ticket for the election of members, but also to the extent of holding elected members in the grip of the outside organizations. This as we know, has reduced this Parliament to such a condition that it is the only Parliament in the whole of the Allied countries that was unable to do its duty when the war broke out.",48
182,Mr FINLAYSON,PAYMENTS TO NEW,We imported ticket system from England.,50
183,Mr SAMPSON,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"But it developed ' here to such an. extent that it paralyzed and destroyed the responsibility and in dependence of this Parliament when its power was most needed to perform its highest duty of preserving the safety of the nation when the war broke out,, and during its continuance. No greater* calamity could have befallen a Democracy. We cannot have a prosperous population in Australia unless we develop our various interests to the ' utmost. There cannot be big manufacturing industries in the cities without great land settlement and the production of raw materials in the country districts. We must recognise that we are a great territory with a few people, and with a greater proportion of the population in the cities than is to be found in any other country in the world. It should be the duty of this House to so distribute electorates as to enable the residents, even in the remoter parts, to speak adequately in this Parliament. So far we have not aimed at that object, but have only got as far as one vote one value. I know that that is a very pretty cry, something like that of land nationalization-theoreticall y perfect, but impracticable when put to the real test. I know that there are several . electorates in Australia larger than mine, but the Wimmeracovers nearly a fourth^ of Victoria ; and it is not so easy to re-' present 30,000 or 35,000 people in such an electorate as it is for a man to represent a similar number in a city electorate, which embraces only a few miles. I do not say that we should alter our bedrock system of the franchise. I believe in the universal franchise, because then - the people, through the ballot-box, become the rulers of Parliament, and if Parliament is not up to their ideal, the responsibility is theirs. MT . J. H . CATTS - What is the good r of a universal franchise if you. alter the value of the votes?",50
184,Mr SAMPSON,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"We alter the value of the votes in order that we may develop certain interests in connection with the representation. To put the matter anthe other way, in Victoria, as an illustration, we have over and over again found that the overwhelming majority cast' in the metropolitan areas has been more than sufficient to neutralize a majority for certain candidates in country districts: and' Victoria? in this, respect, is only typical of other States. It has always been recognised that under our electoral system there must be a preponderance of voting power in the big cities as against the country districts. It is the only waywe can have anything like decent representation in this House. States are cut up into electorates so that some attention may be given by specialized representation to various interests in the country districts, which would not be possible if the block vote were applied to elections for this House. The present system of elections for the Senate cannot continue unless we 'are prepared to have a Chamber representing, not the States interests, but simply the biggest organization that puts forward tickets, and can command overwhelming majorities in the metropolitan area. The Senate would then be representative, not of the States, but of the capital cities and industrial centres only. I shall not touch on the question of postal voting introduced by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), for that can be discussed when' the Bill is in Committee. The subdivision of each of the States into three electorates would . enable the representative system to be applied to the elections for the Senate just as it is to this House.",50
185,Mr ATKINSON,PAYMENTS TO NEW,Excep t when there was a double dissolution ,50
186,Mr SAMPSON,PAYMENTS TO NEW,That is so.,50
187,Mr ATKINSON,PAYMENTS TO NEW,That would obviate the delay that takes place in the count at the present time.,51
188,Mr SAMPSON,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"I would not object to a system of preferential voting at ordinary elections by subdividing each State into three electorates, or as the honourable member for Wilmot has suggested, wo might have proportional representation in the case of a double dissolution. We could have, under ordinary conditions, preferential voting for both Chambers. I do hope that the country members will not lose this opportunity, which may be the only one they may have for many years, to make some amendment of the system of electing senators. The rapid trend of population is from the country districts into the .towns and cities, and if Parliament does not take a hand and do all that is possible to stem that tide, and encourage the country interests, we shall continue to be confronted' with this serious problem-the great bulk of our population still further concentrated in the large cities, and a great reaction in respect of production and the general progress of the Commonwealth.",51
189,Dr MALONEY,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"Melbourne) [3.16] It has been my custom at all times to welcome any Bill which will permit mc, as a member of the House, to amend any law in the direction of advancing Democracy and the welfare of the people. At first I felt inclined to say that this Bill should 'not have been introduced at this time for the reason that over a quarter of a million of the bravest of our soldiers are away, and therefore will not be able to bring their pressure to bear on the improvement of the measure. Another objection <4o 'the introduction of the Bill now is that more important measures should be brought before the House. Poremost amongst them is the long-delayed amendment of the' Tariff. would like to see also a special measure for the. introduction of my old friend the initiative and referendum, and its later and highest political development, the recall. I suppose I shall not be able to get my wish on that matter, although I think that if a referendum of the people ; were taken the people would compel Parliament to deal first of all with the Tariff, and then with the referendum and initiative and the recall. To any honourable member who would like to read in brief form the scope of the present Bill, I commend the excellent epitome published in the Labour Call. For instance, the first four paragraphs read1. It is not proposed to alter the franchise in any way. 2. Checks against duplication of voting are copied from the Victorian law. ""But,"" admits the Minister, "" the comments of the Chief Electoral Officer on the report of the Electoral Commission show that there was practically no duplication."" 3. Any person whose name may be omitted by mistake may vote on making a declaration that he is entitled to be on the roll. 4. Absentee voting is retained- a provision which benefits about 250,000 electors. I do miss from this measure a clause which would permit the party ticket being operated on polling day. What I mean is that any one on entering a booth to exercise the franchise should have the right to. say, "" I will vote for the National party, the Labour'party, the Independent party, the Protectionist party, or the Soldiers party."" If that were done, the Returning Officer, with one, two, or three scrutineers, would see that the elector's intention was carried out completely, and would thus prevent mistakes by voters who are not quite au fait with the intricacies of the electoral system.",51
190,Mr ATKTNSON,PAYMENTS TO NEW,That would not be a secret ballot.,51
191,Dr MALONEY,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"The honourable member is wrong. If the elector were to tell the Returning Officer that he wished to support a certain party, his vote would 'be just as secret as is the vote of a blind persou who goes to the p polling booth and tells the duly appointed officer how he or she desires to vote. The I party ticket is not new to Australia. Honourable members will recall that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) had the. right in connection with the last Federal election and the conscription referenda, to indicate a party ticket for the soldiers at the Pront. Cognisance was taken of the fact that the soldiers would-not be familiar with the individual names of many candidates; therefore the party ticket was introduced and operated under a regulation of the War Precau-. tions Act. I hope to see the time when the suggestion I am making will be embodied in an amending Electoral Bill, and if an opportunity should occur in Committee, aud I am promised reasonable support, I shall move such an amendment in this Bill. Another amendment I should like to see made is that all persons who are under the Australian flag should have the full privilege of citizenship and the right to vote. In the farflung portions of the Commonwealth, such as Papua, the Northern Territory, the Federal Territory, and Lord Howe Island, Australian citizens should have the right to vote, and it is not proper that this Commonwealth, of which we boast as the freest and greatest Democracy in the world, should refuse some of its citizens the franchise.",51
192,Mr GLYNN,PAYMENTS TO NEW,There is no doubt that that amendment will be made in time.,52
193,Dr MALONEY,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"Havin g many years on my shoulders, I wish to see that tension take place in my lifetime, and hope that in Committee, or perhaps when the Bill reaches another place, an amendtwo ment will be proposed to give those citiserved zens a vote. It could be done very simply. Papua could be added to Queensland constituency. I mention that State because all ships going from Australia to Papua make their last at a Queensland port. The Northern Territory could be, as it was when under South Australian control, a the constituency of Grey. I hope the honourable member for Grey (Mr asked Poynton) will not think that I have personal animus against him in wishing to add to his already large electorate. The Federal Territory could easily be attached to one of the New South Wales electorates, and Lord Howe Island is four occasions within six months. already attached to the electorate of East Sydney. The sections providing for voting i absence are justly retained, with amenddesired [263] ments which should make them more useful. Seeing that 250,000 persons make use of the provision, it must appeal to everyhonorable member that we should make it more easily availed of. It has been estimated that 77,000 persons will be benefited by the restoration of the postal vote. As one who has suffered more from that form of voting than possibly any other person in the world, I may be permitted-to say a few words in regard to it. In the small subdivision bounded by Spring-street, Elizabeth Street, Bourke-street, and Victoria-street, in the Melbourne electorate, in the campaign in which I opposed the late Sir Malcolm MCEacharn-peac e to him, and to every one who goes through the shadows-mor e postal votes were polled than were recorded in the whole of the State of Western Australia at two elections, or in the whole of the State of Queensland in one election. At least £5,000 was spent upon that election by my opponent, and it' is not to be wondered at that every postal vote was known to the men who conducted his campaign. This is proved by the fact that two of them had their passages paid to South exAfrica whenthey thought that I was on I their trail. Bribery and corruption of the vilest kind were resorted to. Of the secretaries I had to fight, one had a term of imprisonment, and the other should have been imprisoned for a his natural life. I refer to Carey, who robbed a building society of £16,000, and left the State. He was so audacious in call his manipulations that I said to my committee, when they were securing sworn declarations, "" I want to catch that portion of man above all others."" Three or four years afterwards Carey me if I would care to go and see 1 any how the card system was manipulated during that election. He said, ""As an instance of how complete it was, I can tell you that we polled the vote of a man who had changed his residence on twentySo that you will see there was some value in it."" I accompanied him, and I saw that n all he had told me was true. Later on, he to join the Labour party, and, in fact, took steps to do so. He astonished me in 'Collins-street one day iby stopping me, and saying, """"Well, Dr Maloney, I have joined your party."" I Teplied, ""Have you?"" He said, "" I have given  as my references."" I looked at him, and said, "" Let us be straight, right here. If they ask me, I will say that I consider you to be one of the biggest scoundrels I have ever met, and that I tried my level best to pin you. If I could have got one solitary sworn declaration against you, I would have had you in Court."" He said, "" That may be straight, but it is Tather awkward foT me."" Ultimately he robbed the building society of £16,000, and went away. The two election secretaries, Frost and Carey, were the men I was up against, and honourable members will not be surprised at being told that at least £5,000 was spent in order to secure that election for my opponent, and that every vote received by post at that election was known to those who obtained them. There are two gentlemen in Melbourne today who took a hand in - political life at that time, and they nave assured me that they knew in whose favour every person voting by post on that occasion recorded his vote. It was quite possible, under the loose and lax system then in vogue; but I am glad to say that the Minister in charge of this Bil l (Mr Glynn) is providing greater safeguards. The Labour party has never objected to a postal-voting system properly secured by statutory rules and regulations, because it naturally recognises, even on the score of tactics, that more people belonging to the working classes suffer from illness or sickness than do those who may be said to be better off. Therefore, I am quite willing, as a member of the Electoral Commission, to give the system a fair trial, and to judge by results. I do not think that the Chief Electoral Officer is given sufficient power, such, instance, as the power Parliament ha9 bestowed upon the Auditor-General or the Commissioner of Taxation. able members will remember how the latter turned down the suggestion I made Dr Moloney. for the preparation of the return showing the increased profits derived by income-tax payers giving numbers instead of names, in order to secure secrecy. Why should we not give the same power of independent action to the officer who is in control of the most important factor appertaining to citizenship, namely, the right to vote? The Labour party has for many years past adopted the system of preferential voting. The system was adopted in the Victorian State House. The vote of a gentleman representing East Melbourne, the most Conservative constituency in the State, was probably the means of having the preferential system of voting adopted for State elections; but since then that gentleman has not occupied a seat in the State Legislature. He may Tegret having lost his seat; but I hope that his conscience will give him sufficient consolation in that he did his duty, and endeavoured to carry out what he thought was right. If honourable members will care to look at the report of the Electoral Commission, they will find that we suggested that, before a person could be summoned under the compulsory sections of the Act, twenty-one days' notice should be given to him to enable him to comply with the Act, and that if , on the expiry of that period, he' was not then enrolled, proceedings should be taken ",52
194,Mr GLYNN,PAYMENTS TO NEW,We could not well give a personal notice.,53
195,Dr MALONEY,PAYMENTS TO NEW,Notic e could be given by post-card or letter to the last known postal address.,53
196,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PAYMENTS TO NEW,Is the honourable member in favour of compulsory voting?,53
197,Dr MALONEY,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"Yes , absolutely. One of the standing questions which, during the proceedings of the Electoral Commission, I put to all witnesses was, "" Given compulsory enrolment as the law of the land, do you not think that compulsory for voting should follow as a necessary corollary?"" The most intelligent witnesses who came before the Commission agreed Honor- that where compulsory enrolment was the law of the land, compulsory voting should follow.",53
198,Mr LYNCH,PAYMENTS TO NEW,Would the honourable member penalize persons for not voting?,54
199,Dr MALONEY,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"I believe that any person who will not exercise his right of citizenship, if not prevented from doing so by illness, is deserving of some punishment. On the subject of compulsory voting, it will be found, at page 10 of the Electoral Oommission's report, that recommendation 31 reads as follows:Compulsory voting - Contingen t upon adequate provision being made tor the exercise of postal voting, we recommend compulsory voting as a natural corollary of compulsory enrolment. That recommendation was carried unanimously by the members of the Commission. I intend, when we get into Committee on this Bill, to submit a clause to give effect to that recommendation, and I hope that the Government will be prepared to agree to it. There was another recommendation of the Electoral Commission which, I am sorry to say, only two members of it were brave enough to sign. It had reference to abolishing the practice of using cabs, motor cars, and other conveyances to take people to the poll. This is the minority recommendation on that, subjectWe further report that there appears to be a growing practice of conveying electors to the poll. This has caused considerable congestion in polling booths, and much more work for certain officials, and may grow into rupt practice. Means should be adopted to prevent the engaging of vehicles by candidates, organizations, or other persons for this purpose. But the right of persons using their own vehicles for the conveyance of themselves and their families to the poll should not be interfered with. That is signed by H . Sinclair and W. Maloney. Honourable members are aware that, otheT things being equal, the man who commands most money, and who, through his friends or otherwise, is able to secure the greater number of conveyances to carry voters to the poll, will, as a rule, poll most votes.",54
200,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PAYMENTS TO NEW,I do not know that he will. Very often his conveyances carry voters for his opponents.,54
201,Dr MALONEY,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"I do not think that any man can blame voters for taking advantage of conveyances provided by their political opponents'. I can inform hon[263]- 2 ""orable members that in the by-election which I fought after the High Court had declared the previous election null and void, I could not obtain a single motor car in the whole of Melbourne and its suburbs. They had all been ear-marked and paid for by my opponent's friends.",54
202,Mr WEST,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"The same thing happened in Sydney at the last elections, when a motor car could not be hired a week before the polling day.",54
203,Dr MALONEY,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"Whilst , at a general election, it would not be surprising to find all motor cars engaged, that is not on all fours with my case. The by-election to which I refer was the only election held in Australia at that time, and there was not a single motor car available to me on that occasion. If many of my supporters at that time travelled in the vehicles provided by my opponent, I cannot conscientiously blame them very much - for having done so. I desire that this practice of using conveyances to carry voters to the poll shall be abolished, though I agree that any one who has a conveyance of his own. should have the right to use it to go to the poll. Just as the Switzers, in their many cantons, travel over their mountains to record their votes, because they look upon the exercise of the vote as something holy, so I desire that our Australian people shall regard it a coras a sacred duty to Tecord their votes when opportunity offers. What could be a more sacred duty than the recording of a vote which may have the.effect of making or marring the well-being of the community. I think I have touched upon the principal features of the Bill, and when we get into Committee I shall seek to amend it, as, from my point of view, I think it ought to be amended. In order that I may do so, I submit the following:That, contingent upon the second reading being carried, I give notice that I will move that it be an instruction to the Committee to provide in the Electoral Bill such clauses as will provide for the initiative and referendum. Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any Act, when 75,000 Australian voters demand the amendment or the enactment of any law by an authenticated petition, the question shall be submitted to a vote of the Australian people voting "" Yes "" or "" No,"" and, if a majority of the Australian citizens, who vote. pronounce in the affirmative, it shall instruction to the Commonwealth Government of the day to immediately bring in an Act earry into law the wishes of the Australian citizens. No Democrat can object to sucb a provision as that. If I were asked what words should be blazoned on the temple of Democracy, erected on the sure foundation of humanity, I should say that they should be the three words- "" Initiative, Eeferendum, Eecall."" We have recognised them, to a certain extent, in our Constitution by enabling this Parliament to permit our creators-the citizens of the Commonwealth-to vote on certain' occasions that we may be informed as to what they desire. I think that this right of tlic creators of this Parliament should be continued throughout its existence, and provision should be made to enable the majority of the people to say from time to time, if they think necessary, whether a certain law sliould be amended or a new law introduced. No Democrat can conscientiously take exception to such a provision. Prom the earliest times in the history of the Mother of Parliaments in the Old Land every candidate whoever stood on the hustings seeking the votes of those who possessed the franchise; claimed that he considered it the highest honour to be a servant of the people. If that is still the feeling of those who aspire to represent the people in Parliament, it can be given effect here by providing for the initiative, referendum, and recall. I believe that these magic words will have as great an effect in this country, in the advance of Democracy, as had the three words, ""Liberty, Equality, Fraternity "" in the century that has passed. I am reminded of an excellent work, published by the late David Syme, dealright ing with representative government in England, and which, I think, has brought to him far greater fame than any other of his publications. On this question of the excessive election costs in the United Kingdom, I took out some figures concerning my own election expenses about eight years ago, and I found that, on the basis of United Kingdom expenses, my election would have cost £1,500 at least. Prom this it will be seen that had I been in England I would have been Dr Maloney. be an called upon to find £750, not a penny of which would have comeback to me. to This expense is incurred in the preparation of polling booths, payment of officers, and the incidental expenditure. Under our franchise all that is required of any candidate for Parliament is a deposit of £25, and the signatures of halfa-dozen electors of the. Commonwealth. After the election this £25 will be returned to the candidate unless, of course, he fails to secure one-fifth of the votes recorded for the lowest successful candidate. The late James Munro, at one time Premier of Victoria, informed me that he had been offered a seat in England, but that it would have cost him between £4,000 and £5,000; and when the English members of Parliament visited Australia some years ago I asked Mr William Crooks if he could tell the Labour members of our Parliament, who were then entertaining him at lunch, what his election expenses were Every man nearly fell off his chair when he said his .last election cost him £1,150. The average Labour seat in England"" costs the unions or'the-oandidate anything from £1,000 to £1,300. This principle of the referendum and initiative has received the endorsement of Lord Salisbury, and other members of the Conservative party, as well as the late Eight Hon. W. E. Gladstone, and' its adoption will enable a man to keep his seat so long as he enjoys the confidence of a majority of his electors. The late David Syme, referring to the bribery and corruption in England, said that he was looking forward to the time when a constituency would have the same over its representatives as the King has over his Ministers, namely, the right of dismissal. But honourable members need not fear that I am trying to terrorize them when I speak of the recall, for I can assure them that it would not only save the country heavy expenditure, as it would not be necessary to have an election in the same sense as it is understood at present, but so long, as a member carried out his platform undertakings and kept his pledges, thus assuring his constituents that he was the right man for the position, there would be no need for him to face-the electors. If there is one quality pertaining to the people, speaking of the common folk, it is a sense of justice, and 1 remember that the ' late Abraham Lincoln said of them, "" God must have loved the common people because he made se many of them."" After twenty-eight and a half years of parliamentary experience I can say that I would not give up the confidence which the people, especia ally the old men and the old women, have reposed in me, for the greatest gift from the hands of any Emperor. I would like to repeat, so that members may be under no misapprehension, that with the referendum, initiative, and recall the law of the land, those who hold the same views as I do in reference to a Protectionist policy would only have to obtain a certified petition from, say, 50,000 of the electors, together with a statutory declaration that the signatures were genuine, and lodge it with the Clerk of the House, to insist on this question being put to the vote of the people. Under this system the differences at present existing between Ministers and members would all be swept away. If honourable members will go through the figures of an ordinary election they will find that a fair average of voters is from 60 to 63 per cent. Therefore one-half of that number, or, say, 30 per cent., would be a fair percentage to fix in a demand for the recall. Under this system members would mind their p's and q's more than they do at present. If any honourable member will examine the figures relating to absentees from this House it will be found that, putting all the sittings together, and dividing them by the number of sessions, certain members have been absent, practically, for a good many years. It follows that when the country became used to the benefits of these three great reforms, general elections would be swept away. I look forward to the time when members will sit as long as they satisfy their creators, the voters who put them into Parliament. Under this system a member could look forward to security of tenure, knowing that, so long as he tried to carry out his pledges, he would have the strong moral and material support of his constituents outside.",54

205,Dr MALONEY,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"Of course, that risk always exists. MT. JOWETT -.What about pre-selection?",56
206,Dr MALONEY,PAYMENTS TO NEW,"If a man belongs to party he should be loyal to it, or get out"", if the time ever comes for me to get out, they will have to kick me out, because I will not willingly desert men who' have been loyal to me, and to whom I have tried always to be loyal; but if I have to go, I shall not squeal unless I am kicked specially hard. Honourable members will see that the system I advocate promises great advantages in the future. I cannot see why Parliament should not continue in session the whole year round. The system I advocate would eliminate burning questions. Switzerland has far greater difficulties than we have, because the difficulty caused by differences of language is always f«r greater than that caused by wide spaces of territory; yet the Swiss^ Parliament manages to get expeditiously through its business. The referendum and initiative remove all burning questions from the floor of the House. The Swiss Parliament meets at 8 o'clock in the morning in summer, and the roll is called. Any member absent is fined. Members have to keep a quorum without it being necessary to call the attention of the Speaker or Chairman to the absence of it. The names of members present are recorded at every division, and the absent members are fined. The_ House adjourns at 1 o'clock, meets again at 2 o'clock, and adjourns at 4 o'clock. In the winter the only difference is that the sittings begin a't 9 o'clock in. the morning. They have two sessions of three weeks each. They conduct their business in much the same way as the directorate of a financial institution; not, as we do, with a - second board of directors to review what the first board has agreed to. I hope honourable members will agree that, if it is possible to assert the principle in this Bill, it is our duty to do so. If honourable members need any further education in the matter, I refer them to the Age newspaper, which has done more to make the initiative, referendum, and recall known throughout Australia than has any other publication. the Age published a magnificent article, concluding with the following words:In the initiative, referendum, and recall, which arc part of the advanced systems of government in Switzerland and the United States of America, are devices of Democracy which offer the true solution of public apathy in Australia. They are devices that enhance the value of the vote. If voting is once made worthwhile there will be no need to make it compulsory. All except the last sentence meets with my full approval.

He said, "" I have glanced through the report in the time available to me, but I cannot say to which of the 'many Ministers who have had charge of the Department the statement applies.""

Upon page 29 of the Composed, mission's report, I notice that there is proval printed the report of a sub-Committee of the Cabinet upon the report of the Commission. To my mind, this is a bad practice which has grown up in the. Commonwealth. A Royal Commission is apis pointed to inquire into alleged abuses, and before its report has been presented to Parliament, that report is handed over to the very men whose conduct is i m pugned, and they are permitted to attach to it a reply which goes forth to the lic simultaneously with the report itself.

221,Mr TUDOR,LAIRD,"Yarra) [4.14] - I desire to make a few remarks in connection with? a statement which you, sir, made to the Houso about a fortnight ago in regard, to curtailing the number of free copies of Hansard that have hitherto beencirculated weekly. Owing to the fact that the Victorian Parliament has. drastically reduced the number of copies of its Hansard, which were previously issued to State members, a misapprehension has arisen in the minds of many people, who believe that the circulation of our Federal Hansard has been similarly restricted. Persons who would otherwise subscribe to that' publication aTe labouring under this misapprehension, and some steps ought certainly to be taken by you, sir, and by the President of the Senate, to remove it . The difference between our own Hansard and the Victorian Hansard is this : That while the State Hansard had only twelve paid subscribers, the Federal Hansard has practically 1,000. In some States it is impossible for the people to know what is ' going on in this Parliament unless they may see copies of the Federal Hansard. Persons who were receiving free copies, but did not desire to retain the privilege of reading the Federal Hansard, were rightly advised by you, sir, and by the President of the Senate, I understand, that if they no longer wished to receive the numbers, they would not be further sent to them-that was, if they so intimated. But there should be no misapprehension in the public mind in regard to the Federal Hansard. It should be clearly intimated that if the public desire to subscribe, or to continue their subscriptions, there is nothing to prevent them from doing so. We are all familiar with the very brief reports of doings within the Federal Legislature which are published in the Melbourne press. But even those are infinitely more extensive than the telegraphed reports appearing in.the newspapers of some of the other States.",59
222,Mr SPEAKER,LAIRD," I think it may be advisable to reiterate what I have already stated in regard to the publication of Hansard. It is to the effect that issues to subscribers are not interfered with at all, and that the supplies of honourable members' copies of Hansard are not interfered with, either. All that has been done has been to issue a circular letter to those in receipt of free copies of Hansardto those persons who are on the free circulation register-askin g any who do not particularly wish to have Hansard sent them, if they will intimate to the authorities of this Parliament their concurrence in the discontinuance of their copies. It is only where voluntary acceptance of discontinuance occurs that the issues of Hansard are no longer being sent. For example, I had a notification today from the iDroprietor of a newspaper to the effect that his office was quite willing to forego its free copy of Hansard, because it was able to secure from other sources the information it desired. In that case, the free copy will be discontinued.",59
223,Mr BRENNAN,LAIRD,"Batman) [4.18] I wish to add a word or. two regarding the answer given by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) today to the question by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). It is impossible to regard that answer as being anything less than disingenuous. One would like, if the forms of the House permitted, to designate it, indeed, by a much stronger term. It is clear that if the Acting Prime Minister had desired to give this information relating to public affairs-to the business of a public Department-h e could have done so, and thus the public might have been saved the prevarication contained in his lengthy reply. The question asked was, in effect, "" Who is the Minister referred to in terms of the strongest condemnation by a Royal Commission in respect to a specific matter?"" And the Acting Prime Minister delivered an elaborate reply, in the course of which he said I have re-read the paragraph referred to hy the honourable member. . . . Tho section from which ho has extracted the statement in the question affords me no indication as to who the Minister was . to whom attention was directed. Probably a minute examination of the evidence would make this clear. However, all the Ministers who have ever been in control of the Navy Department are at sent included in the National Government, but I see no reason to pursue the drastic course which the lionorable member suggests. Is tliere an honourable member on either side of this House who doubts that the Acting Prime Minister knows who the Minister was?",59
224,Mr GLYNN,LAIRD,He does not know.,60
225,Mr BRENNAN,LAIRD,"Then , if he does not, it was an insult to the intelligence of the House for the Leader of the Government to come here and deliver a reply of that nature, upon a matter as to which he could have obtained information within two minutes.",60
226,Mr GLYNN,LAIRD,He could not have done anything of the sort. The answer is perfectly consistent with the report itself.,60
227,Mr BRENNAN,LAIRD,"Ordinaril y it does not lie with the Government to pass upon itself a vote of censure; but the Government both censures and condemns itself if it alleges that it does not know and cannot find out what is sought in the question at issue. If the matter is so difficult to discover, and is being so hushed up, then the greater is the condemnation that the Government deserves. And I concur with the honourable member for Capricornia that this information will be dragged from the Government, in spite of itself, or the Government will be dragged off the Ministerial benches, and that at no distant date.",60
228,Mr LISTER,LAIRD,B y whom?,60
229,Mr BRENNAN,LAIRD,"B y any and every public honourable member who believes in fair and square dealing, and in the publicaremain tion of vital facts; and there are honourable members on that side of - tie House who have shown an independent spirit to see that the public are protected in matters such as this. Let me turn to the report of the subcommittee of the Cabinet. The first thing that strikes one in regard to that states report is that the Cabinet sub-committee stands for and asserts the principle of monwealth. Ministerial responsibility. It says,"" at the conclusion of paragraph 4=No Minister can fairly he expected answer to Parliament. regarding the adminisCapricornia pretration of a Department over which he exercised no authority. While asserting the principle of Ministerial responsibility-in which, by the way, I absolutely believe, and I heartily concur in what the sub-committee ha 3 said-it deliberately withheld the name of the Minister who ought to be responsible to the public. It violated and vitiated the whole principle by keeping secret the name of the person responsible for the misdeeds reported here. The report of the sub-committee further statesWith the removal of Ministerial responsibility, it is difficult to see how Parliament could exercise any control over the Department's administrative activities. It is most difficult; but what is the value of Ministerial responsibility if tie Minister himself is not responsible to Parliament? What is the value of parliamentary action upon the Minister if we do not know who he is? It may be that the Minister at the head of the Navy Department today, who is controlling one of the most important arms in our defence in this great war, is the person who stands under the scathing condemnation of this independent Commission. But we are not to know, and we are not to be allowed to know, and the Government is ashamed and afraid to 'let us know. Have the members of the Government themselves so little regard for their personal or honour that, in order to shield one of their number, they are all willing to under the imputation of being, enough possibly, the person referred to? In paragraph 9 of the sub-committee's report it states-and here is where it refers to the condemnation by the CoinmissionIn support of its contention, the Commission that expenditure has been incurred by a Minister without the concurrence of the Board, with unsatisfactory results to the ComThe' Commission stated a good deal more to than that, as the honourable member-for (Mr Higgs) has already pointed out. And then the report of the sub-committee of the Cabinet continuesBefore this can be accepted as conclusive proof of the soundness of the change proposed, it will require to be shown that all expenditure incurred with the Board's approval was sound and warranted. A more illogical and absurd statement. I have never read in a public document. ""Unfortunately,"" adds the sub-committee, "" this cannot be shown."" ""Will the Acting Minister for the Navy (Mr. Poynton) make no reply to the charges in the report ? Will the Government make no reply? Will it make.no attempt to justify itself? I do not assert that the mere finding of a Royal Commission is conclusive against the Government, but it is sufficient to raise a prima facie case worthy of answer by the Government, and quite unworthy of being hushed up by the Government. It is safe to add that, if the Government lacks the courage and the public honesty to let the country know the name of the person referred to, it will have much to answer for; and that at a veryearly date. If is unfortunate that the Acting Prime Minister, who has just entered tie chamber, was not present when this matter was raised by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). It is a question affecting the honour of the Acting Prime Minister, and of the Government, and it has led me to accuse the honourable gentleman of prevarication with respect to an answer which he gave today. He said in reply to the honourable member for CapricorniaI have re-read the paragraph, referred to by the honourable member, in the Koyal Commission's report. on Navy Administration, dated 18th September, 1918. The section from which the honourable gentleman has extracted the statement in the question affords me no indication as to who the Minister was to whom attention ijs directed. Probably a minute examination of the evidence would make this olear. However, all the Ministers who have ever been in control of the Navy Department are at present included in the National Government, but I see no reason to pursue the drastic, course which the honourable member suggests.",60
230,Mr WATT,LAIRD,What is wrong with that?,61
231,Mr BRENNAN,LAIRD,"The honourable member, when he allowed {hose words to be put into his mouth, must have known what Minister was referred to in the report.",61
232,Mr WATT,LAIRD,I - shall deal with that statement.,61
233,Mr BRENNAN,LAIRD,"When the Acting Prime Minister has dealt with that statement, he will have this further statement to deal with. If he does not know what Minister was referred to, he has been sadly lacking in his public duty, and, although he may stand acquitted of the graver charge of prevarication, he is . self-accused of not having acquainted himself with a matter on which he should have been, and might have been, informed.  stated in today's newspapers that the postage .tax is to be put into operation next Monday. In my division some of the mails run only once a week, and many persons there have had no opportunity yet of knowing the intention of the Government in this matter. I ask the Postmaster-General not to surcharge letters from distant parts of the Commonwealth which do not bear the halfpenny postage tax until sufficient time has elapsed to enable those living in places remote from the Seat of Government to know that the tax has been imposed. I am sure that thei-e is no desire to evade taxation, and where it can be proved to the satisfaction of the Department's officers that the halfpenny postage tax has not been paid because of the want of information regarding it, no surcharge should be made.",61
234,Mr WEBSTER,LAIRD,"Gwydir-Postmaster General) [4.30] - Such action will be taken as will meet the contingencies of the proclamation concerning this tax, and, so far as practicable, citizens who are not trying to evade the tax will not be penalized.",61
235,Mr WEST,LAIRD,East Sydney) [4.31] - I ' trust that the Acting Prime Minister will pay more than usual attention to the accusation brought by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) against one of the Ministers.,61
236,Mr WATT,LAIRD,I did not hear what the honourable member for Capricornia had to say. An ex-Minister of his standing should surely have let me know that he was going to make this statement. That would have been the usual courtesy.,61
237,Mr WEST,LAIRD,"When in town during the luncheon hour, a couple of public men spoke to me about the rumours that were in circulation concerning a certain Minister. I said that I did not - wish to hear any name mentioned, and I personally declined to father any rumour. My old .friend, Sir Joseph Cook, is now in London, and, of course, could not have been at the meeting of the Cabinet the other day; but, nevertheless, I am anxious that no stigma should attach to - him. Rumours, once started, quickly grow, and the Acting Prime Minister will do well to stop the growth of this rumour. The public is entitled to some statement from the Acting Prime Minister other than the evasive answer that he gave this morning.",62
238,Mr WATT,LAIRD,It was not an evasive answer.,62
239,Mr BRENNAN,LAIRD,A protective answer.,62
240,Mr WATT,LAIRD,No ; it was not a protective answer.,62
241,Mr WEST,LAIRD,"It was not an effective answer. The Acting Prime Minister is in a very delicate position. He is a master of the art of answering questions, and at times it is a puzzle to understand the meaning of his Teplies.",62
242,Mr WATT,LAIRD,I decline the honourable member's flattery. The answer that I gave today may not have been satisfactory to him; but it was not evasive.,62
243,Mr WEST,LAIRD,"I do not think that my old friend, Sir Joseph Cook, would have made a mistake like that attributed to one of the Ministers, and I believe that it is another Minister against whom the charge has been made. We should know which of the Ministers it is.",62
244,Mr HIGGS,LAIRD,"I wish to make a personal explanation. I consider that I have been misrepresented. The Acting Prime Minister said that I should have given him notice of my intention to speak. When I began to speak I asked the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn), who was in charge of the House, if he would be good enough to send for the Acting Prime Minister, and _ he replied, "" I will tell him."" He deemed that course sufficient.",62
245,Mr WATT,LAIRD,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.34] - It is unfortunate I was not in the House when the honourable member for Capricornia spoke. If his remarks were of the serious nature suggested by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. West), and affected the position of a Minister, the honourable member, who has been in office, should have apprised the acting head of the Government of his intention to speak on the subject. That is the only way in which the courtesy and propriety of the situation could have been satisfied.",62
246,Mr HIGGS,LAIRD,"The Acting Prime Minister is usually in his place. The Minister who was in charge of the House in his absence was satisfied that I should continue, upon the understanding that my remarks would be brought under .the notice of the Acting Prime Minister.",62
247,Mr WATT,LAIRD,"I acquit my honourable friend of the desire to do something behind the back of the person whom he attacked; but, as I was absent, I am necessarily uninformed as to what he said. I heard only the concluding remarks of the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan), who charged me with being guilty either of negligence, or of equivocation, both of which charges I deny. The question asked this morning by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) wasHaving reference to the statement made hy the Royal Commission on Navy and Defence administration, that instances had been furnished to them where a Minister had incurred expenditure either without reference, or in opposition, to the Naval Board, and with, it is alleged, unsatisfactory and costly results to the Commonwealth, is the said' Minister a member of the present Australian National War Government, what is his name, and do the Government propose to dismiss him from office? I answered two of these questions quite definitely. As honourable members will note, there are three questions in the last few sentences. First of all, I was asked whether the Minister referred to was a member of the National War Government. M j reply was that all the members of the Navy Administration were members of the present Government. Then I was asked for the name of the Minister. To that my reply was that, having read and re-read the report, I could not find in it anything that made it clear to me as to which Minister was supposed to be involved. I shall read the paragraph in the report referring to this matter, in order to refresh the minds of honourable members, and to show where it leaves the Government in this regard As to the third question-whethe r the Government proposed to dismiss the Minister from office, I answered it completely by saying that I did not propose to follow any such drastic course with regard to any of my colleagues. Let us see now where the report puts us. In paragraph 5, page 4, these words occur:-; The control of the Navy Department by Board of experts, with the Minister as dent, is - undoubtedly sound in principle. stances have heen furnished to us where a Miuister has incurred expenditure either out reference or in opposition to the Naval of the House. Board, and with unsatisfactory and costly sults to the Commonwealth. This would not occur under a proper scheme of control. impracticable for any Department to be aged efficiently when a Minister ignores decisions and opinions of experts in matters not involving questions of policy. I have not put the microscope over whole of this report, since the question was addressed to me, but I have examined that part of it which is vital 'and relevant to the inquiry, and I think I am right in desired. saying that there is nothing in it which would enable the Government to say who of the five Ministers that have been ministering the Navy Department its inauguration is alluded to in that general reference.",62
248,Mr MCGRATH,LAIRD,"The honourable gentleister man could easily find out who is referred to. Mr WATJ? - It may be for the vernment or the House to say that the paragraph as it stands does not carry matter far enough; but I invite the able member for Batman (Mr Brennan) to tell us whether, after scanning the report as it is now printed and laid before the House, he himself could truthfully make other than the same kind of reply that I gave to this question today, and at the same time do his duty as far as he could as a Minister. I do not desire to hide from the House anything that it should properly know, and I shall not be a party to any such concealment. In view of the representations which have been made in my absence, and which I shall read in Hansard as soon as I have an opportunity to do so, I , with the Government, may have to consider whether I should not carry the matter further, in order that the House may be informed of the name of the Minister alluded to.",63
249,Mr MCGRATH,LAIRD,And the nature of the transaction.,63
250,Mr WATT,LAIRD,"And the nature of the transaction. That, however, is a matter which I must be left to determine. I cannot have these questions sprung upon a me, and accusations of negligence or prePresivarication made against me'. I shall not Inbe a party to anything of the kind, nor withshall I submit to it from any member Honourable members on reboth sides may safely leave the matter It is with me, knowing that I shall not be a manparty to the hushing up of anything that the should be properly discussed.",63
251,Mr TUDOR,LAIRD,"I made an interjection, . perhaps wrongly, as to the names of the the Cabinet sub-committee which dealt with the report. What are the names ?",63
252,Mr WATT,LAIRD,I shall furnish them to the House whenever the information is,63
253,Mr HIGGS,LAIRD,We want it now.,63
254,Mr WATT,LAIRD,"Speakin g from memory, adthe Cabinet sub-committee consisted of since the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce),' the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), and the Acting Min These honourable gentlemen were appointed by the Cabinet to consider the Gorecommendations and to bring up their proposals to the Cabinet, because they the were in a position to devote sufficient honortime to its consideration, and had a knowledge of the Department. Honourable members oould have had this information before had they desired it'.",63
255,Mr TUDOR,LAIRD,I think the names appeared in the press.,64
256,Mr WATT,LAIRD,"I believe so. There has been no attempt to keep from the public the names of the sub-committee, although it is not usual to publish the names of Cabinet sub-committees which are frequently appointed to deal with Bills and other matters. If honourable members want any such information they can always have it . I '""have only to say, in conclusion, that if lionorable members on either side of the Bouse have matters that they think worthy of inquiry, I shall be glad to know of them; but I do uot desire that, while I am temporarily absent from the House, statements should be made that might seriously reflect either upon the status of an individual Minister or the general, prestige of the Government. I prefer to. be present when such statements are made, so that I . may deal with therh immediately. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.40 p.m.",64
