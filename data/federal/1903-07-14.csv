Mr MCDONALD , for .asked the Minister for Trade and Customs,! - upon notice I. Have any inspectors been appointed to insure that the different sugar-cane areas registered for rebate under the white labour provisions are being cultivated in accordance with the Act and regulations relating thereto ? 2. If any persons have been appointed, how many such appointments have been made, and in what districts ? 3.

23,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLICATION OP,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows :No persons have been specifically appointed field inspectors. The police in each district by arrangement exercise supervision as to compliance with the regulations and report to the local Customs any case in which breaches of the regulations are suspected, and upon their report such .action is taken as the case requires. They do not receive payment for this duty. All officers, especially those employed in connection with rebates, are also required to exercise vigilance and report suspicious cases. NA In Committee (Consideration of Senate's amendments). Sir EDMUND BARTON Minisber for E x t e r n a l A f fair s ) That the Committee disagrees with amendment INo. 3 made by the Senate in the Bill intituled "" AB ill for an Act to provide for a Bonus to Growers of Sugar-cane and Beet"" for the following reason :Because the B i ll is a proposed law appropriating revenue or moneys, and amendment No. 3 is an infraction of the provisions of section 53 of The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act,' which prohibits the Senate from originating a proposed law appropriating revenue or moneys or from amending any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or bui-den on the people, and the Committee does not deem it necessary to offer any further reason, hoping the above may be sufficient. That the Committee agrees with all the other amendments of the Senate in bhis Bill. Honourable members are aware that bhis Bill came down from the Senabe wibh cerbain amendments, one of which, at least, has been pointed out by bile Speaker as in volving an infringemenb of the rights of bhis House. I purposely avoid using the word "" privileges "" in order bhat there may be no confusion in discussing this matter, which seems to me one of righbs, and one which should nob be encumbered by any term which may confuse its exacb nature. My motion is nob so drastic as proposals which are sometimes made wibh regard bo Mr BAMFORD, Bill s in which a Second Chamber, or any Chamber, has made amendments which are deemed to be unconstitutional. Frequent as is the practice under such circumstances to lay a Bill aside, and introduce another for the general purposes of legislation, ib is yeb permissible bo deal wibh the mabber by the milder course of disagreemenb which I now propose, because in the firsb place ib will , in some degree, hold oub the olive branch, and, secondly, ib will be more compatible bhan the course firsb mentioned, wibh the possibiliby that the amendmenb exceeding consbibutional power may have been made under some misapprehension. The propositions l a i d down in the motion are sufficienbly definibe bo enable honourable members bo follow bhem and bake bheir own course of action. In the firsb place, we propose to disagree with one amendment on constitutional grounds, and in the next place to adopb all the obher amendmenbs. Mosb of these other amendments are verbal. They consist in the substitution of the word - bounby"" for bonus, 1 BILL. bo which we bake no e x c e p t i o n; more especially as the word "" bounby "" is used in the Consbibution bo denobe the k in d of appropriation wibh which bhis Bill deals. (Hunter- Anobher amendmenb ab the end of clause 2 - I move- provides bhabNo bounby shall be paid in respect of the production of sugar on land which has been culbivabed by other bhan white labour after a bounty has been paid in respect of the production of sugar thereon. That is an amendment solely for the purpose of prevenbing any backsliding-if I may so term ib. Ib is inbended bo prevent a planter who, after receiving the bonus under the terms of the Bill, may afterwards cultivate his land by means of black labour and then revert to white labour, from making a second claim for the bonus. It is proposed not to interfere with that amendment, because, looking at the terms of the 53rd section of the Constitution, we do not conceive that it is unconstitutional; and moreover, in view of the general intentions of the Bill, it may be considered an improvement. But the amendment to which we have called attention as an infringement of the rights of this House follows on these word? in clause 2There shall be paid out of the consolidated revenue fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly Honourable members will note that this is a distinct appropriation:to every grower of sugar-cane or beet within the Commonwealth in the production of which sugar-cane or beet white labour only has been employed, after the twenty-eighth day of February, one thousand nine hundred and three. Then come the following words, which constitute the objectionable amendment:Or for a period of twelve months immediately preceding the delivery thereof for manufacture. That is the amendment to which, on constitutional grounds, exception is taken, and I think that I shall have little difficulty in convincing honourable members on both sides of the House - that, whatever opinion we may hold, whether regarding the Bill as a party measure or as ameliorating legislation, this is an amendment which, to have been accepted at all, must have been made in this House. The controversy turns upon the second and third paragraphs of section 53 of the Constitution. able members well remember, the Senate is, by the Constitution, prohibited from amending either proposed laws imposing taxation, or, to put it shortly, the annual Appropriation Bill, which is described in these terms : "" Or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government."" These are the proposed laws which the Senate may not amend. But the Constitution does not provide that the Senate may notamend any Bill which contains an appropriation. As appears by the next paragraph, the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. If , then, this is a law imposing a charge or burden on the people by means of an appropriation, Sir Edmund Barton. it is a proposed law which may be amended by the Senate, inasmuch as it is not an annual Appropriation Bill ; but it is also a law which they may not amend "" so as to increase .any proposed charge or burden on the people."" If honourable members have followed the words I have read, they will see the exact point. To put it shortly, any contention on which this amendment can be upheld on the part of the other Chamber must rest on the ground that it is an amendment which will not increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. I am aware that it has been argued that there is a difference between'charges on the revenue and charges on the people, and, therefore, that while charges on the people may not be amended upwards, so as to speak, or by way of increase, yet amendments by wayof increase of mere charges on the revenue-which , be it noted, Â»is the people's revenue-ma y nevertheless be. admitted under our Constitution. In the first place there can be no doubt that the Bill makes an appropriation, because it provides thatThere shall be paid out of 'the consolidated revenue fund, which is hereby appropriated accordinglyThen if an amendment, which would have the effectof increasingthat appropriation, is to be in anyway constitutional, it would have to be true that there are Appropriation Bills which are not burdens on the people. The Government, insistent as it is with the Speaker in guarding the rights of this House, cannot come to any other conclusion than that a proposal for an appropriation out of the consolidated revenue fund imposes a charge or burden on the people. As honor- If that view"" be correct, then this amendment must be taken to be improperly brought to this House. I understand that various arguments have been used to show that there are appropriations of revenue which are not burdens on the people. If those who, when arguing in this matter, and pointing to the data of the old struggles between the Lords and the Commons, would turn their attention to the historical aspect of those struggles and the terms which were evolved during their continuance, they would at once see that the money matters dealt with during those troubles-whic h I do not wish to revive, and I wish to be definite on that point-were , putting it broadly, on the - one side taxes, and on the other side - expenditure, and that the prohibition to amend measures which involved expenditure, dressed as it may have in the phrase ""charge or burden on the revenue"" or ""charge or burden on the people,"" is one thing in - meaning and effect, simply because a charge on the revenue is a charge on the people's revenue, and therefore a charge on the people. The first branch of the motion dealing with the amendment which I question uses the word ""originate."" ""We put this subject forward in two phases. We say that the amendment is an infraction of the 53rd section of the Constitution, because the Senate is prohibited from originating a proposed law appropriating revenue or money. We say, in the second place, that it is an infraction, because the Senate is prohibited from amending any - proposed law so as to increase any charge or burden on the people. In order to clear the ground, I will deal with the implied assertion in the motion that this is an origination of appropriation of revenue or moneys. Our position in regard to this part of the subject may to some extent depend on the question whether the words "" proposed laws,"" used in the Constitution, refer to the whole of a Bill, or whether they deal with any Bill in such a way that the enactments' contained in it may be considered separable one from another. It will be clear to honourable members, assuming that this is an Appropriation Bill-abou t which I think there can be no doubt-that any provision in a clauseof a Bill of this kind which prescribes a larger expenditure than that proposed by this House is to the extentof the excess which it involves an origination of further appropriation. If, for instance, we had specifically purported to appropriate Â£60,000 out' of the consolidated revenue fund, and the amendment, instead of being in its present form, proposed to increase the amount to Â£65,000 or Â£70,000, then we suggest that to the extent to' which that amendment would overtop the original proposal of this House-the authority ultimately responsible, at any rate, for the care of the purse strings-it would originate a further appropriation. An appropriation of, in the case of the illustration, Â£5,000 or Â£10,000, which does not come from this House, and is placed by the Senate in a Bill orginated in this House is, to the extent of that increase, an origination of public expenditure. Nobody can doubt that it is so. It seems to me that it is stating a truism to put that proposition, because if the increased appropriation does not originate in the amendment, where does it originate 1 It cannofcoriginateanywhereelse. The second branch of the motion is that this is a proposed law appropriating revenue, and is, therefore, a charge or burden upon the people; and that being so, the Senate cannot so amend it as to increase, that charge or burden. I should have thought that it would not need any lengthy argument to establish a proposition of this sort. I say that, leaving aside-excep t for the .purpose of explaining the meaning of the terms-the records of old struggles, and confining myself to this section, to the terms which it uses and to the meaning of those terms even as .shown by any historical usage. If Imay citeBourinotin this connection - a n authority of admitted eminence-w e shall see by reference to his book upon Jfarliamenlary Procedure, the way in which similar matters are treated in Canada. I cite this authority mainly for the purpose of demonstrating what is the meaning of the term-"" A charge or burden on the people,"" and of making clear whether or not there is any difference in its meaning irrespective of whether it be called "" a - charge on the people "" or "" a charge on the revenue."" In the second edition of this book, published in 1892, I find, on page 596, the following passage:It is the invariable rule that all measures involving a charge upon the people, or any class thereof, should be first considered in a Committee of the whole.. That consideration in Committee of the whole interests us only incidentally in our .discussion of this matter. Rule 88 orders ""If any motion be made in the House for any public aid or charge upon the people, the consideration and debate thereof may not be presently entered upon, but shall be adjourned until such future day as the House may think fit to appoint; and then it shall be referred to a Committee of the whole House, before any resolution or vote of the House do pass thereon."" Mr Bourinot goes on to sayUnder this rule all Bills providing for the payment of salaries or for any expenditure whatever out of the public funds of the Dominionand this Bill is "" for the payment out of the consolidated revenue fund which is hereby appropriated accordingly ""-mus t be first considered as resolutions in'Committee of the whole. And all such resolutions necessary to the introduction of a Bill must first obtain the recommendation of the Governor General. I need not point to the fact that this Bill originated upon a messag^efrom bheGovernorGeneral, which was dealt with by a subsequent Committee. That is to say, we adopted the ordinary course which is followed in dealing with financial measures.",14
24,Mr JOSHPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"Does the quotation which the Prime Minister has read say "" all Bills""?",17
25,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"Yes . I cite Bourinot to show that in the opinion of that authority the wordsPublic aid or charge upon the people, are applicable to any expenditure whatever out of the public funds of the Dominion.",17
26,Mr GB EDWARDS,SUGAR BONUS,The fact of any Bill being recommended by message from the Governor General governs the whole procedure.,17
27,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"I will not go so far as to insist upon that, because I wish to get upon still closer ground, though the honourable member is perfectly right in saying that the origination of any measure by message amounts pretty well to an admission on the part of the Government who introduce it, that they could not obtain what - they desire to secure, unless such a message were brought down. But that is not the conclusive guide. The conclusive guide is in the essence of the transaction.",17
28,Mr REID,SUGAR BONUS,The firsb paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution shows that there are a number of Bills appropriating revenue which do nob require to be initiated upon a message.,17
29,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"I wish honourable members to understand that I am not contending that certain Bills appropriating public moneys, and involving expenditure, cannob be amended by the Senabe, bub rabher that under the Consbibubion bhose Money Bills which ib can amend ib cannob so amend as bo increase the burdens on the people. That is the whole point I am able to burn bo passages in May which throw a light upon the subjecb in bhis connection ; first, in regard to the way in which public expendibure is broughb aboub and made good, and nexb, in regard bo the meaning of the berms used in the Constitution. I do not intend to apply these practices any further for the purpose of insisting that, in all matters under bhis Consbibubion, we are bound bo make provision in accordance wibh the limibabions which have arisen oub of the consbibubional sbruggles bebween the bwo Houses in the old counbry, simply because-irrespectiv e of whether we have legislated here, or whether the very Parliament which was the scene of those sbruggles has legislabed wibh reference bo them-bher e can be no misbakiug the meaning of the words used in the bwo paragraphs of the Consbibubion bo which I have referred. Ib does nob matter, therefore,, whether we are dealing with bhis mabter in the lighb of privileges asserted on the one side and denied on the obher, until oub of the confusion and chaos bhus caused bhere arose a sebbled practice; bub ib does mabter whether certain words which are used here have acquired, as the resulb of the sbruggles bebween the two Houses, a technical parliamentary meaning, and whether that meaning applies to the measure with which we are now dealing. As to the procedure adopted in the British Parliament and its. meaning, I refer honourable members bo page 515 of the tenbh edition of A/ay T where the following passage occurs :The Sovereign being the executive power is charged wibh the management of all the revenueof the State, and with all payments for the public service. The Crown, therefore, acting wibh the advice of its responsible Ministers, makes known to the Commons the pecuniary necessities; of the Government;- the Commons, in return, grant such aids or supplies as are required tosatisfy bhese demands; and they provide by taxes, and by the appropriation of obher sourcesof the public income, the Ways and Means to meet, the supplies which they have granted I ask honourable members to carefully note the order of these stepsThus, the Crown demands money, the Commonsgrant ib, and the Lords assent bo the grant; bub the Commons do not vote 11101103' unless ib be required by the CrownThab practice lies at the root of the in terjection just now by the honourable member for South Sydneynor do bhe3 impose or augment boxes, unless: r such taxation be necessary for the public service, as declared by the Crown through its constitutional advisers. Now, an argumenb has been raised, nob in this House, to the effect that the only realcharge or burden on the people is a bax r and that, as bhis Bill does nob .impose a bax, ib does nob provide for a charge or burden on the people, and, therefore, may be amended in the way that is claimed. A very little examination will dispose of that argument. In paragraph 2 of section 53 of the Consbibubion, the Seriate is prohibibed from amending proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating aevenue or money for the ordinary annual .services of the Government. Of course, the latter portion of that provision relates to the ordinary Appropriation Bills. The next .paragraph providesThe Senate may not amend any proposed law .so ii.s to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. Now, to make it clear that the term "" a charge or burden on the people "" is not used in the Constitution in the sense of a tax, it is only necessary for me to refer to the paragraph immediately preceding the provision which I have quoted, and under which the Senate is prohibited from amending proposed laws imposing taxation. That is a direct and specific prohibition. But if "" a charge or burden on the people"" meant merely a tax, there would be absolutely no necessity for the succeeding provision, the words of which would be meaningless, because, if a tax is "" a proposed charge or burden on the people,"" the Senate under the prior paragraph has been prohibited from amending such a measure. - Consequently it could never have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution to use other words which imply a power to .amend, and a prohibition against amendment - rising beyond a certain point.",17
30,Mr A MCLEAN,SUGAR BONUS,Y e t a tax is a burden on the people.,18
31,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"There is no - doubt that is so, but it is not the only one. These words are inclusive. They are designed without doubt to include not only the area of taxation; but also the area of expenditure in all its bearings.",18
32,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"The force is to be found in the word "" any.""",18
33,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"Yes. <do not know whether I have failed ito make myself clear to honourable members, because this is rather a difficult matter to deal with, but I am endeavouring to show that the first of the two paragraphs - in question altogether takes away from the Senate the power to. amend taxation Bills in any way. Having done that it would be idle and futile in the very next two lines to say thatThe Senate may not amend any proposed law - so as to increase any proposed charge or burden .on the people, if the construction is right that a tax is the - only charge or burden which can be imposed - on the people. If there are charges or burdens on the people, in addition to those of taxation, it seems to me to follow, with irresistible inference, that those other charges or burdens on the people are appropriations. It is, I suppose, unnecessary to refer to what was said by delegates in furtherance of their arguments during the sittings of the Convention. I understand that a passage from a speech of mine has been cited in this connection. But I would point out that those remarks were made at a certain stage in the proceedings of the second, and not the final session of the Convention. They were merely an expression of opinion as to certain matters which arose at that time, and the question of the power of the Senate to increase the burdens on the people by means of amendment was not, in any sense, before me. How have we come, in the course of history, to the present settled practice of dealing with matters of taxation and appropriation ? Matters of taxation we may lay aside for the moment, because they will be dealt with in the third stage of the arguments which I intend to put forward. How did we come to deal with appropriations in. this way? May has told us that the Crown, through its Ministers, makes known its necessities. That is to say, its necessities for the purposes of Government. Then the Commons in return grant such aids or supplieswhich are convertible terms, as aie required to satisfy those demands, and, thirdly, that they make provision by taxation and' by. the appropriation of other sources of public revenue-if there are other sources which can be used - for the supply granted. By that process they provide the means to meet the supplies thus granted. I That is the origin of the nomenclature of our Committees. In the first place, we receive a message from the Crown recommending certain expenditure. After referring that message to a Committee, which ordinarily is a Committee of Supply when we are not dealing with a Bill but with a grant, what is the next step taken ? Committee of Supply having been set up, the matter is referred to that Committee in order that the necessities indicated by the Government may be supplied. That is the origin of the term ""Supply."" What follows next ? Immediately afterwards the House goes into Committee of Ways and Meansand I ask honourable members to note in this connection that in the process Supply comes before Ways and Means. In appropriating money, therefore, the question of whether there is sufficient in the Treasury chest to meet the appropriation, though it may be the subject of argument, is not a matter ' of technical procedure. The next step is that the Commons say to themselves-""We have, in Committee of Supply, granted certain Supply, but the amount so granted must be made good."" Then they go into Committee of Ways and Means ; and, here again, the name supplies the reason of the Committee-the Committee consider the "" ways and means "" by which the money already voted can be made good, either out of fresh taxation or out of the proceeds of existing taxation.",18
34,Mr GB EDWARDS,SUGAR BONUS,"But ""appropriathe tion "" must precede "" ways and means.""",19
35,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,""" Approinserted priation "" must precede "" ways and means."" In a very elaborate argument used elsecases, where, there has been an attempt, on the very passage I have quoted, to make out that "" ways and means "" precede "" approregard priation""; but I cannot conceive any stretch of ingenuity by which that contention In' could be made good. We have first the following :Message, next Supply, and then Ways and Means ; or, in other words, we have first the recommendation, secondly, the grant, their and, thirdly, the making good of the by grant.",19
36,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"""-Sectio n 56 is decisive.",19
37,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"I think it is ; but I do not want unne'cessarily to go bewere yond the provisions of this paragraph, because they conclude the case. I now pass from this part of the question as to the order, and and the way in which the . order indicates seG-governmentthe origin of all these matters. It recollected that in the Senate there is no analogue-n o parallel to the Committees of Supply and Ways and Means.",19
38,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR BONUS,The Governor General may send a-Message to the other House.,19
39,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"Possibl y the Governor General may send a Message to the other House, but that is a course which, although it has been followed even in late times in the English Parliament, has not generally been pursued in Colonial Parliaments. I think that the honourable and learned member will agree' with me as to what has been the practice in the House of Commons, and it may be that section 56 of the Constitution has some relation to what I am about to say. When the Crown-that is to say, when the Government-is moving Parliament for an expenditure by way of Bill, a. Message comes down from the Crown to theCommons, asking them to make an appropriation to cover the expenditure, aiid the only Message which goes to the Lords is one asking for their concurrence in the appropriation. The origination, even under this system, is with the Commons, who hold thestrings of the purse; and, therefore, until the Commons have agreed to an appropriation, message or no message, it is impossible for the House of Lords to touch the matter. That, I say, applies not only to an appropriation, but to an increase of an appropriation-that is to say, the logical reason forthing applies to that extent.",19
40,Mr REID,SUGAR BONUS,"The House of Lords have amendments in "" red ink."" Sir. EDMUNDBARTON - In some but that is a very different matter. During the Federal Convention there was,.

Unless the recommendation of the Sovereign enjoined by these standing orders be signified in the manner hereinafter mentioned (see page 528), the Speaker cannot put the question on a motion which comes within the scope of these standingorders. Accordingly, if any motion or Bill or proceeding is offered to be moved, whether in the House or in a Committee, which requires but fails to receive the recommendation of the Crown, it is the duty of the - Chair to announce that no question can be proposed upon the motion, or to direct a withdrawal of the Bill. A nd even in cases where there have been two messages, there is a message which must precede. In like manner, after the question has been proposed on an amendment, and it has appeared that the amendment would vary the incidence of taxation, the Speaker has declined to put the - question. Then follows another paragraph dealing with procedure on legislation which creates - a public charge. I should like here to interpose the remark that, in quoting these passages, I am still on the question of whether a ""charge upon the public revenue"" and a "" charge upon the people "" are really both included in the term ""appropriation."" If there is a charge or burden on the people, it does not matter, according to the authorities, whether it has alternatively, to prevent tautology, been called a charge on the revenue, because, as I have explained, the revenue is the people's, and by so much as it is charged the people are charged. The paragraph which I have already indicated is as follows :In pursuance of the standing orders which regulate the financial procedure of the Houses, - Committees of the whole House are appointed to .sanction by their resolutions grants of public money or the imposition of. a charge upon the people. The Committee is appointed either before the commencement or after the close of public business by a motion, that ""This House will,"" on afutureday, "" resolve itself into a Committee,"" to consider the matter specified in the motion. If satisfied that the motion will receive the Royal recommendation, the Speaker proposes the motion as a question from the Chair, and thereupon a Minister of the Crown, or a Privy Councillor, actingnnderinstructionsfromtheTrea-sury, signifies to the Speaker and to the House that the motion is recommended by the Crown. Whatever refinements may be indulged in, in any endeavour to distinguish in its constitutional effecb bebween a charge on the revenue and a charge on the people, the - endeavour must be futile, because each is a public charge. Let us examine the words which follow the - paragraph I have jusb readWhen the main objecb of a Bill is the creabion - of a public charge, resorb musb be had to bhis procedure before the Bill is introduced, and upon the report of the resolution of the Commitbee of the whole House bhereon the Bill is ordered bo be broughb in. There is acbually no machinery by which the Senate can go through bhis procedure, and, bherefore, the originating House has the control of the amount of the public charge, and, notwithstanding concessions made in the Constitution to the Senate, ib is quibe clear, from these passages, that the charge is sbill unalberable by way of in r crease. Ab page 529 of May, the following words occur:In deference bo the usage expressed in Standing Order No. 62, that consideration of a charge upon the people ""shall not be presently entered upon but shall be adjourned"" to a future day, the resolutions of the Committee of Supply and Ways and Means, and of all resolutions which are sanctioned by the recommendation of the Crown As in the present insbance, bhere are cases in which the Crown has made a recommendabion which was agreed to only in Commitbee of the whole, and nob in Commibbee of Supply and Ways and'Means. - ar e not considered on'the day on which bhe3 are T reported from the Commibtee, bub on a fubure day appointed by the House. What is the object of the recommendation t Simply that Parliament may part with the public money for the purposes .of the Crown's Government.",19
41,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR BONUS,"How far would the right honourable genbleman carry the bhird paragraph of section 53 ? Would he say that the Senabe could nob, for insbance, increase the number of J udges proposed in a Bill ?",20
42,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"I should nob like to discuss that question on the present occasion. I do not think I oughb to be asked for a hypothetical case, for the reason thab in the courbesy which oughb to prevail between two bodies such as the House of Representatives and the Senate, it is the duty of bhis House bo waib until ibs righbs are infringed.",20
43,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR BONUS,I suggested the Judges only as an illustration.,20
44,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"If I may hope, however, that my remarks will not reach the other House, I can accept the i l lustration and say bhat were an amendmenb made by the Senabe in the way of inereas-' ing the number of Judges so bhat the tobal appropriation was increased, that would necessarily be unconstitutional - an infringement of the Constitution.",20
45,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR BONUS,Then there is a very great point ab issue.,20
46,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"I shall quote further exbracbs from May, because I wish honourable members to see to what expublic tent and to what class of Bills this right controlling expenditure-this right which is preserved with some modifications in Constitution-ha s been extended in the cover all the ground. To tell us that, not House of Commons. In May, page 530, the following :. Examples may be given of matters which recommendation from the Crown ; namely, vances on the security of public works, when funds in addition to the funds already available to such purposes must be provided to meet advunces ; advances to landlords and tenants yond the scope and objects of the Public Loans Acts; Bills relating to Savings Banks which create a charge ufjon the consolidated fund or other public liability. There follow several examples with which I need not weary honourable members. I shall now read the standing orders passed by the Commons in 1671 and 1678 in order to show in what sense these matters are understood. According to May, page 541The Commons having during nearly three centuries claimed the right to include the members of the House of Lords in the taxation upon the subjects of the Crown, advanced claim still further by resolving, 1071, ""That all aids given to the King by the Commons, rate or tax ought not to be altered by the Lords and by a second resolution, 3rd July, 1678, "" That all aids and supplies and aids to His Majesty Parliament are the sole gift of the Commons; and all Bills for the granting of any such aids supplies ought to begin with the Commons ; that it is the undoubted and sole right of the Commons to direct, limit, and appoint in such Bill the ends, purposes, considerations, conditions, limitations, unci qualifications of such which ought not to be changed or altered by the House of Lords."" That resolution is, to a very large extent, the foundation of the claims which the Commons have successfully Without attempting to make the present parallel case, I ask whether any honourable member supposes that, in the deliberate asserand tion of their rights and privileges in that lution, the Commons would have allowed the authority on parliamentary practice as May possibility of any quibble-that allow any expenditure of public moneys be amended in the House of Lords, or anychangeably where else, on the ground that it was charge on the revenue, and not a charge the people 1 Such a position is inconceivmore able, unthinkable ; and the phrase, "" aids on page 565and supplies,""in that resolution, must be held to cover equally charges on the revenue and charges on the people. Because, if we For what? look back to the cause-to the evil was to be remedied in those da}'S-it was a been explained. fear lest another authority than the repreWhat sentatives of the people should expend Sir Edmund Barton. money, or originate any expenditure. of It was essentia], therefore, that the Commons in their resolution should express, the their intention in words so wide as toT is withstanding the use of the words "" aidsand supplies, and aids to His Majesty in Parneed liament,"" any expenditure was, under this adstanding order, allowed to be within the privileges of the Lords because it could be such described as a charge on the revenue, or bewas not allowed within the privileges of the Works Lords because it could be described as a charge on the people, is simply to palterabout the matter. W it h all respect I say that any confusion of that kind is merely paltering with the question. If what was originally aimed at was expenditure-if , in considering the mere technical words used in an instrument like our Constitution-we arrive, by history and by analogy, at the fact that the instances are all instances of expenditure, and are all under the same ban, what levied conclusion can we come to except that when this the Federal Convention, the people of Ausin tralia, and the Parliament of the United! the Kingdom, when the latter gave the Constituj "" tion the form of law, used the words ""charge in or burden on the people,"" they intended to include all expenditure of public money' and I carry the thing to that length-that no> and right is given to the Senate by the Constitution in respect of any Bill which it can amend to so amend the Bill as to increase grants, the expenditure of public money.",20
47,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,Suppose that it appropriated the whole of the revenue 1,21
48,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"If it can maintained. , originate an appropriation of i 5, it can a originate an appropriation of Â£5,000,000. I have quoted a number of these passages,, I might have quoted more for this purresopose primarily-to show that by such an T they would the terms "" charge on the revenue"" and to "" charge on the people"" are used interfor the expression of the same a thing-that a charge on the revenue is a on charge on the people. If it could be made clear, I find that it is made more clearThe practice requiring the recommendation of"" the Crown and the Committee stagethat for proposals involving public expenditure ha* confusion is to be found there between a charge on the revenue and a charge! on the people 1 ""What does it say 1 It includes in the matters to be dealt - with by the ordinary constitutional process ""proposals involving public expenditure."" If a man raises so many tons of sugar by white labour only, and it is proposed in this Bill that he is to have a bount}' of Â£ 2 a ton on that quantity, can we escape from the conclusion that it is public expenditure? If we are to run away from the consideration of matters of this kind by saying- "" Although it is an expenditure, it is not a charge on the people, but only a charge on the revenue,"" then this refinement of interpretation can be carried to such length that absolutely the originating power of this House would be abandoned, and it should be'regarded as a warning to the House, if I may use the expression, because, if we allow a thing of this kind to take place, then there will be no end to it, and almost anything may be defined as a charge on the revenue, because it means practically the same thing as a charge on the people.",21
49,Mr MCCAY,SUGAR BONUS,"H as the Senate explained to Kyabram that an expenditure is only a charge upon the revenue, and not a burden upon the people.",22
50,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"It s next suggestion may be that the word "" K y a bram "" occurring in any Bill must be considered a burden on the people. Now, let us look at a standing order of later date, by means of which the House of Commons has again expressed the public understanding of the words I am talking of. I am asking honourable members to arrive at their conclusion as to the meaning of the words used by relation to the only source, not merely of authority, but of practice, that we know of. On the 20th March, 1866, the Commons passed this orderThat if any motion be made in the House for any aid, grant, or charge upon the public revenue, . whether payable out of the consolidated or out of moneys to be provided by Parliament, for any charge upon the people the consideration and debate thereof shall not be presently upon, but shall be adjourned till such further day as the House shall think fit to appoint, and shall be referred to a Committee of the whole before any resolution or vote of the House therein The value of that seems to me to be words "" for any charge on the people."" is argued that a distinction is drawn in that very resolution between a charge the revenue and a charge on the people. But honourable members who read it closely will come to this conclusion-that when the House of Commons used the words ""aid, grant, or charge upon the public revenue,"" and followed that phrase up with the words "" or for any charge on the people,"" it meant to give full effect to the use of that word "" any"" to prescribe the practice as to aids, grants, or charges on the public revenue, or any charge on the people, because not only the charge on the public revenue, but the aid or grant, which stands in the same category with it, is equally a charge on the people and comprehensible in the same terms. As to that phase of the matter, I think it would be unfair to the House to multiply argument or instance. But it may be said - it is not urged, I understand, in argument elsewhere-that this amendment does not increase the appropriation. Let us look at it. The Bill prescribes that a bounty shall be paid out of the consolidated revenue, which is appropriated for the purpose, to growers of sugar-cane or beet, who have used only white labour after the 28th February, 1903. These are the words which have been added by the SenateOr for a period of twelve months immediately preceding the delivery thereof for manufacture. So that, even if ' the white labour hs;s been resorted to, not under the terms of the Bill as it left this House, there is an alternative aid, giving in addition a period of twelve months immediately preceding the delivery of the cane for manufacture. That of course, if the words mean anything, means that the quantity of cane which has to come under the provisions of the Bill is increased ; it may be rightly or wrongly increased, but that is not for us to consider now.",22
51,Mr LE GROOM,SUGAR BONUS,That was theintention.,22
52,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"The intention of the amendment was to widen the area, to increase the number of tons of cane fund to which the bounty should apply, and to or that extent therefore to increase the appropriation. Our ultimate date in the Bill was entered the 28th February, 1903. If - the Senate then it did not stop at that date, but went on to House prescribe a time after that in which the do pass bounty might be earned, then it is clear that to the extent to which in the it gave that widening application to It the Bill it was originating an appropriation, or, at any rate, increasing the approon priation made. If honourable members believe with me that the appropriation includes both a charge on the revenue and a burden on the people, then the Senate was increasing the burden on the people by fixing a date not limited by the 28th February, 1903, and allowing a further time during which, simply by going through the formality of giving a notice, the bounty might be earned, bringing the expenditure provided by the Bill to an amount larger than that intended by this House. have disposed of the question whether or not there is an increased appropriation if I show that, when the Treasurer came to disburse the bounty provided by the Bill he would, under the amendment, have to distribute it on a larger number of tons of cane, and that this is so is proved simply by a mere reading of the amendment. have we put this? We have said that certain sugar-growers should have a cash bounty if it is earned in a certain way. The Senate says that ceitain other sugar-growers who are not eligible under our proposal shall also get the bounby. That increases the expendibure. Pirsb, ib increases the number of persons who are bo benefib by the' Bill; secondly, ib increases the amounb of cash paid bo bhem; and, bhirdly, by doing that ib increases the drain on the resources or pockebs of the people, and whether or nob any one chooses to refine to the extenb of calling ib a charge on the revenue or a burden on the people, the effect is the same. Ib is the precise kind of expendibure inbended bo come under bhat provision of the Consbibubion which prevenbs the Second Chamber from increasing the proposals of . bhis House in that regard. I do nob intend to .ask the House to follow me at any greaber lengbh, bub I wish bo reverb bo the fact that I am baking, and asking the concurrence of the House in my taking, as between two courses by which this infraction of our righbs mighb be opposed, the more conciliabory and milder one. I might have proposed to throw the Bill under the bable, and have proceeded afresh in such a way as seemed righb bo us in our position as guardians of the public purse. But bhere was precedenb and warranb for our proceeding by the means we have elecbed, which insures to the Bill its vitality; which does not throw ib away or end ibs life, bub leaves blie mabter altogether as one for further amicable consideration bebween the Houses. Bub, accepting as we do certain amendmenbs, bhere is one principle upon which I must ask the House to Sir Edmund Barton. ' stand firm, and that is to carry the motion disagreeing with this particular amendment of the Senate-^to sband firm in this resolution, because if a concession were once made to a process of which bhis may be the beginning, I cannob see in whab way the House would be furbher able bo defend ibs rights. Honourable members will recollect that I have taken a very large part in the I shall dealing wibh this Constitution, and particularly in the dealing with the money provisions. My voice was often raised during the Convention and elsewhere in favour of the proposition that, so far as could be done compatibly wibh preserving the ulbimabe sole righb and responsibility of this House in matters of money, How concessions might be made to another Chamber, seeing that it was bo be elective, and consbibubed on the same suffrage as that of the other House. Over and over again I have laid down that principle, and I may recall to the memory of honourable members that in our first Supply Bill I endeavoured-and successfully endeavoured, very much to the disappointment, I know, of some of my friends-to lay down the principle again, and bopoinb oub that, though we might have to look to old-world struggles for the meaning of terms, ulbimabely our rights in relation bo each obher were defined in the Constitution, and particularly in the money sections. I say that again, and I do hope that it will nob be supposed bliab in baking bhis stand I am endeavouring to make for a moment any encroachment on the rights of the Senabe. Ib is our rights which are abbacked ; ib is we who are on the defensive ; and unless we defend our righbs by the adoption of bhis motion they may be open bo prolonged, indeterminabe, and possibly successful abback.",22
53,Mr REID,SUGAR BONUS," I suppose bhat we shall follow the course pursued by the Prime Minisber in not at present discussing the merits of the suggestion conbained in the proposed amendmenb. The leader of the House has felt it to be necessary-perhap s in view of the novelty of this matber-b o enber upon a very exhaustive statement of the views which he entertains. But, so far as I am concernedj I bhink thab we shall have in the future to a large extent bo casb aside our Mays and our Bourinots in relation bo these matters, and to simply examine the. provisions of the Consbibubion. They seem bo me capable of a very simple consideration. The firsb question for us at present is-ca n the proposal of the Senate be said to be one which would involve the Treasury in an increase of liability ? The language of the section of the Constitution does not refer to an increase in charges or burdens on the people ; it refers to an increase in a ""proposed"" charge or burden. And that is a very sensible way of putting it ; because there might be many discussions on the question whether, in fact, an amendment would involve an additional charge within the meaning of the words of the section. The section does not concern itself with whether, in point of fact, there would be an increased charge on the people, but with whether there is an increase in a "" proposed "" charge; that is to say, whether the proposals of the Bill are widened in the nature of further charges by the words proposed to be added. On that question of fact, it is perfectly clear that the intention of the proposed amendment is to widen the area of benefit to the sugar-growers, and therefore to increase the area of the burdens on the people. I agree with the Prime Minister, that it simply seems a wasteof words to combat arguments to the effect that an increased charge upon the public Treasury is not an increased burden on the people. Upon whom is it an increased burden? On the Treasurer? On the Crown ? On the members of the Government ? On none of these ; because it is immaterial to them personally whether the appropriation amounts to Â£1,000,000 or Â£2,000,000.",23
54,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"It was that the more we pay Â£ 2 a ton in bounties, the more we lessen the payment of Â£ 6 a ton Custom duties; and that, therefore, this proposal is a reduction of the burden . on. the people.",24
55,Mr REID,SUGAR BONUS,"This Constitution does not leave many openings for mental exercises of that description. We are fortunately able to decide this matter on very simple grounds. It is a question.as to a proposed charge, not as to the view of each individual member concerning something which may happen after the Bill is passed. Will any one deny that this proposed bounty is a ""proposed charge"" on the people? If they cannot deny that, they cannot deny the corollary, that the amendment increases the proposed charge. It seems to me to be almost a waste of words to engage the attention of the, Committee any further. The Prime Minister has gone over the ground at unnecessary length. The matter seems to me to be so clear that I do not propose' to say any more about it ; except that I quite agree with the Pi-ime Minister that we should take the most courteous means we possibly can in dealing with these difficulties. There may be a time - whic h I hope will never arrive-whe n an amendment is made under circumstances that may call upon us to take a different course. But looking upon this as a matter which has given rise to debate in another place, and considering that probably there was no real intention to invade the pro-: visions of the Constitution, I quite concur in the inoffensive method which has been adopted by the Government in the present case.",24
56,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS," I am very glad indeed to find the leader of the Government and the leader of the Opposition in full accord, because it would, I think, be disastrous if there were a party difference on a subject that is so'foreign to any party considerations. 1 agree with the right honourable the leader of the Opposition that the matter is so clear that very little argument - is necessary ; but I am glad that the Prime Minister has placed it at such length before the Committee and before the country, because the other Chamber debated it by so many of its honourable members, so well and so ably, that a full and explicit answer was due to it. It is only consonant with that respect which this House owes to its sister Chamber, that the fullest reasons and explanations argued should be given as to why we are taking this stand. I fully agree with what has fallen from the Prime Minister, that we have to look at the records of past discussions and struggles, both in this country and in the mother-land, in order to ascertain for the guidance of Parliament in its procedure the meaning of terms that are used in the Constitution, so far as those terms can be ascertained in that way. We can derive great enlightenment from such books as May, Bourinot, and other works of an authoritative character. In my opinion, the matter is concluded by the words of the Constitution. If honourable members will look at the 81sb section relating to "" Pinance and Trade "" they will see that it saysAll revenues or moueys raised or received by the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution. Now, that revenue and those moneys go into the consolidated revenue f u n d ; and the first question we have to ask ourselves is, to whom does that consolidated revenue fund belong ? It belongs to the people.",24
57,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR BONUS,Does it not belong to the Crown ?,25
58,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"Technically , in one sense it does belong to the Crown.",25
59,Mr REID,SUGAR BONUS,The Crown cannot take a penny of it without a vote of this House.,25
60,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"Exactly ; to all intents and purposes it is the property of the people of this country. An y money taken out of that fund, or appropriated to be taken out of that fund, is as much a charge and a burden on the people of this Commonwealth collectively as .a tax is a burden or charge upon any individual amongst the people. So that I give a wide meaning to the paragraph in section 53, which provides thatThe Senate may not amend anj' proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people I think it is too narrow an interpretation to give to the word ""people"" there used to exclude from its connotation the people as a whole. Suppose the whole of the consolidated revenue were appropriated; could any one imagine for a moment that that was not a charge on the people ? Suppose the whole, of the money were appropriated for any purpose or purposes, leaving no means to the people with which to pay for the ordinary annual services except by further taxation-whic h would inevitably be the case-woul d not that be a "" charge or burden on the people""? Y e t according to the arguments presented on behalf of the' Senate it would not be a ""charge or burden on the people."" I think, therefore, that altogether too narrow a view is taken by those who contend that the Senate has the power to do what it has .done, when they restrict the meaning of the words "" charge or burden on the people"" to ordinary taxes. Section 56 of the Constitution has been relied upon by honourable members of the Senate. Now, section 56 prohibits any- vote, resolution, or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneysfrom being passedunless the purpose of the appropriationThat must refer to specific appropriationshas in the same session been recommended by Message of the Governor General to the House in which the proposal originated Not in which the proposed law originated, but "" the proposal""-that is, the specific proposal for appropriating that particular money. Where has there been a compliance with that section? Where has there been a Message sent to the Senate by the Governor General under section 56 or any obher section recommending the appropriation which the Senabe has added-and which is an original appropriation bo that exbenb-b o the appropriation passed by the House of Represenbabives?",25
61,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,Does the honourable member bhink a message could go to the Senate under section 53 ?,25
62,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"I do not think ib could. I agree with my honourable and learned friend thab if section 56 stood alone some misundersbanding mighb arise; and in the Convention, I endeavoured bo have that section correcbed. Ib was nob corrected; bub I agree wibh my honourable and learned friend that nobwibhsbanding that the words ""the House in which the proposal originated"" sband bhere, they can have reference onlyas far as such a mabber as bhis is concerned - b o the House of Representatives. Recause there is in section 53 a disbiucb prohibition bhabProposed laws appropriating revenueor moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. So that even if we could imagine a Message for appropriating money going to the Senate, that House would be absolutely prohibited by section 53 from initiating any legislation appropriating moneys or revenue. I should like to draw the attention of honourable members to the fact bhat, in the Senate, the Chairman of Commitbees, Senator Best, placed this mabber on precisely the same footing as that upon which the Prime Minister has placed ib today. Senator Best explained his views very clearly. Honourable members will find them in Mansard, but I am prohibited by the sbanding orders from quoting them.",25
63,Mr GB EDWARDS,SUGAR BONUS,"I rise to order. Is it competent for the honourable and learned member to refer in debail bo speeches delivered uj the Senabe ? I was pulled up on a mabber'of bhis kind, and I wish bo have the course of procedure defined.",25
64,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"On the point of order, I desire to say thab I have not referred in debail to what book place in the Senate. I have nob referred bo anybhing excepb, in the mosb general way, the facb that a certain position was taken up by the Chairman of - Committees in the Senate.",25
65,The CHAIRMAN,SUGAR BONUS,S t and in g Order 270 makes provision thatNo member shall allude to any debate in the - current session in the Senate or to any measure pending therein. I ask the honourable and learned member to - observe that rule.,26
66,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"If it is not in order to - do so, of course I shall refrain from alluding - to what took place elsewhere; but perhaps I have said enough to indicate that the views entertained by .the Prime Minister, - and, I think, by nearly every member of this House-if not by every member-ar e also entertained by a responsible officer of the Senate. I think it is unnecessary. One thing which strikes my mind very strongly upon this point is this : Suppose that this Bill, appropriating moneys for a limited purpose, had passed its second reading in this House, and that it had passed into Committee. I understand that that - Committee of this House would not, under - our standing orders, have had power to make the very amendment which the Senate has sent down to us.",26
67,Mr GB EDWARDS,SUGAR BONUS,We tried to do it.,26
68,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,Then it is clear that a - Committee of the House of Representatives would not have had that power ,26
69,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"I think it would have - been contrary to our standing orders for the Committee of this House to have made the amendment in the way > in which Â«mobher place has sought to make it, and, that being so, it would be strange indeed if we permitted such an alteration to be made by the Senate.",26
70,Mr SYDNBY SMITH,SUGAR BONUS,"I agree with honourable and learned member, but this House took a different view when dealing with the Tariff.",26
71,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,I do not desire to enter upon a discussion of what was done in regard to the Tariff; I think that we should be led away from the point we are now - discussing if we were to institute comparisons dependent upon the views taken by honourable members in dealing with any particular Bill. Mr G B . EDWARDS - Does the able and learned member know what were the precise terms of the Governor General's message in regard to this Bill?,26
72,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"I do not; but I think the message was in general terms, and did not specify any particular amounb.",26
73,Mr GB EDWARDS,SUGAR BONUS,"Then it would , have allowed us to deal wibh the matter?",26
74,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"Yes , as a House. When we lead section 53 in the way we have to regard it, ib seems to me that the meaning of the wordsProposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys> or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. is bhatappropriations shall nob originabe in the Senate, and I consider thab we should be wrong in permibting any infraction of that well-undersbood principle, which lies ab the back of the mere words of bhis Consbibubion, which is involved in these words, and which musb be regarded as parb of ibs inberprebabion. I hold, bherefore, that the objection that whab the Senabe has done is an infraction of the prohibition againsb origination, and an infraction of the prohibition that a proposed law shall nob be amended by the Senabeso as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people, is well founded. In these circumstances, I hope thab we shall have a unanimous expression of opinion on the part of honourable members in regard bo the mabber.",26
75,Mr GB EDWARDS,SUGAR BONUS,"Soubh Sydney). - I do not bhink I can add anybhing bo the very able discussion that has baken place on the difficulby that has arisen ; bub as I was the firsb bo propose in this Chamber the amendmenb which anobher place subsequenbly introduced into the Bill, I desire bo intimate my entire approval of the course proposed by the Governmenb, and supporbed by the leader of the Opposibion. Ib seems to me that it is clear thab, whatever view we may the hold as bo the righbs or wrongs of the policy involved in the proposed amendmenb, the words of section 53 of the Constitution, thatThe Senate may nob amend any proposed law so as bo increase any proposed charge or burden on the people, wibhoub regard to any obher section relating bo the question, make ib incumbenb upon bhis House to decline to receive the amendment in the form in which it has been senb down bo us. Before the Bill was senb bo honoranobher place I urged very sbrongly that as a mabber of policy the amendmenb was one that we mighb very well adopb wibh justice bo the inberesbs of the sugar planbers concerned; but, on the other hand, I think it is incumbent upon this House, more particularly in the early stages of its career, to sternly stand up for the rights reserved to it by the Constitution. I have my own opinions, which may be somewhat peculiar, as to what will be the relative importance of thetwo Houses in subsequent developments under the Constitution. I believe it is inevitable that the Senate will play a very large and important part in that development, and that in the great and important crises that will take place, we shall find that the Senate will ultimately prove to be the more popular and stronger House.",26

77,Mr GB EDWARDS,SUGAR BONUS,"-That fact ought to influence us to strictly preserve the rights which have been given to this House, and given to it, I believe, for very good purposes. It seems to me that the Prime Minister very lucidly and clearly made out his case that the provisions of the Constitution, so far as they safeguard the rights that it was intended should be conferred upon this Chamber, have been violated by the form in which this amendment has been made by another place. Although I was the first in this House to suggest that an amendment of this kind should be made by us, I strongly support the Government in the action they have taken ; but I hope that, if the message comes buck to us in a proper constitutional form, we shall find ourselves in a position to adopt the suggestion.",27
78,Mr FISHER,SUGAR BONUS, I concur in the remarks which have just been made by the honourable member for South Sydney.,27
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,What ! Senate is going to be the popular House ?,27
80,Mr FISHER,SUGAR BONUS,"I do not know about that; but I certainly realise that the Senate is a deliberative assembly elected under the Constitution, and I dare say its members are endeavouring, to the best of their ability, to legislate for the welfare of the Commonwealth.",27
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,I agree with the honourable member that that is so.,27
82,Mr FISHER,SUGAR BONUS,"That is the position occupied by the Senate as well as by this in House. I rose to support the proposition is the difference. made by the Prime Minister ; but it seems to me that it .is only fail to express view that, if the Senate sees fit to deal with the proposed amendment in anneed other way, its desire should receive every in this case. consideration in this House. We are now only discussing the constitutional difficulty, and apparently the Senate has gone to work in the wrong way. I sincerely hope that another place will submit the proposal to us in a way that will recommend it to us, and that we shall have an opportunity of discussiug in a proper form the question of policv involved.",27
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS," I fail to understand why those in another place should have adopted their present attitude in regard to this matter, and why they have gone out of their way to make it clear that in their Opinion there is a very great distinction between the power to amend and the power to' request. In my opinion that is the most peculiar feature of the present situation. I always understood that the right of request was equal to the right of amendment. In these circumstances I fail to see why the Senate should have gone out of its way at the present juncture to demonstrate to this House and to the Commonwealth generally that in its opinion there is a radical difference between the two powers; but as they have seen fit to emphasize the difference we perhaps should not complain on that ground. I could not help feeling somewhat amused when I heard Mr Speaker call attention to the message in the way that he did. It recalled to my mind a little incident that occurred in this House only a week ago in connection with the motion authorizing the Government to renew the contract for the Vancouver mail service. When that motion was before the House, I called attention to the fact that the proposition was one by which we were That the asked to authorize the Government to make an entirely new charge upon the people of the country. Mr Speaker, as well as the Government, then took the point that as there was an appropriation to follow there was nothing in the contention that the matter should have originated, as Money Bills do, in Committee of the whole. I understand that that is precisely the argument which another place has adopted in regard to this amendment.",27
84,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,The appropriation this case is made in the Bill itself; that,27
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,I apprehend that the it will also be made on the Estimates. ,27
86,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,I do not think it be. There is a special appropriation,27
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"The right honourable gentlemen will not say that we cannot refuse to vote the amount in question, if we choose to do so, when we are dealing with the Estimates.",28
88,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,No .,28
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"This is no more an appropriation than was the proposal in (connection with the Vancouver mail service. In that case this House deliberately stated that the contract should be continued, and that an additional sum should be voted for that purpose. The Government then employed precisely the same argument that another place is using in regard to this Bill. I understand that the Senate contends that this is not a monetary proposal, and that therefore the amendment may be made. Their - argument is that, as there is to be an appropriation on the Estimates to cover the amount involved by the amendment, they have a right to amend the Bill in the direction sought. However much we may take exception to such an attitude, it is difficult to understand how the Government can do so with consistency, having regard to the stand which they took up upou the motion relating to the Vancouver mail service. Personally, ""I believe that the amendment which another place now desires to make, as well as the arrangement which the Government made by resolution a few days ago in regard to the Vancouver mail service, involves a charge on the people of the country, and that therefore both of those matters should have gone, first of all, through a Committee of the whole of this House, and should have been recommended by a message from the Governor General. Mr G . B . EDWARDS - The member is right.",28
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"The honourable member did not take that view the other evening. He then left me in the lurch, but I am glad to learn that he believes now that I was right in the action which I took on that'occasion. Whether I was or not, I certainly am of opinion that in this matter the Senate is going out of its way in the most exbraordinary manner to emphasize a distinction which many of the people who argued the question so vigorously during the Federal referendum contended did not exist. It was urged then that there was no distinction between the power to request and the power to amend. As the Senate has still the power to make a request, and to make it more than once",28
91,Mr MCCAY,SUGAR BONUS,It is not at all clear that they have the power to make a request in regard to this particular amendment.,28
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,They have exercised this power.,28
93,Mr MCCAY,SUGAR BONUS,Not in similar cases.,28
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"As they have exercised the power, and the right to do so has gone by default, the honourable and learned member will have to put forward a very strong argument in order to maintain the position which he now seeks to set up. In any event, they have the power to request. '",28
95,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"On l y where they cannot amend. They have power to amend this Bill, but not to make an amendment of this kind.",28
96,Mr HUGHES,SUGAR BONUS,They have the power of request which is inherent in all legislative bodies.,28
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"They have the power to make a* request in connection with this Bill, or any proposed amendment which they may send to this House.",28
98,Mr FISHER,SUGAR BONUS,I think the Prime Minister should make a clear statement on that point.,28
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"I care very little whether he does so or not, although I .do not deny that he is one of the best authorities of the House on this point. I listened with pleasure to his very able speech/and I cannot understand why another place should have raised trouble over what after all, from their point of view, is a very small matter. honourable Mr HUGHES (West Sydney) - I quite agree with the honourable member for Parramatta, that the question as to the difference between a request and an amendment, which threatens now to become rather serious, was described during the referendum campaign as being one of very great moment. We were told then that it was essential that there should be a difference, but apparently we are told now by some people that the difference is rather important, and by others that there is really no distinction. One who has posed in this House as a leading light on constitutional practice has said that the difference between a request and an amendment was the difference between tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee. As that honourable and learned member has not given us the advantage of his constitutional knowledge today, we must reluctantly put his opinion on one side. It appears to me that the real question before, the Committee is simply this: Is the power to impose a tax the same as appropriating the revenue derived therefrom ? The honourable and learned member for Indi has just now referred to the fact that section 53 provides that a proposed law appropriating revenue or money, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. It is quite clear that that is a prohibition, so far as the imposition of taxation is concerned, but it is not quite so clear to me that it is a prohibition of the Senate from making any amendment upon a proposed law that, having originated here, has been sent on to the Senate.",28
100,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"We admit that they can amend, but we say that the third paragraph of the section prohibits them from amending upwards by way of increase.",29
101,Mr HUGHES,SUGAR BONUS,"The r e for e they may make any amendment except one which will increase taxation. That is so with regard to the imposition of taxation, but is that section a prohibition against the appropriation of revenue? If it is, what does the next paragraph of the section mean? The Senate may not do three things apparently: It may not originate a tax, it may not amend a proposed law appropriating revenue for the annual services of the Government, and it may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.",29
102,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,An annual Appropriation Bill may not be amended by way either of increase or decrease by.the Senate.,29
103,Mr HUGHES,SUGAR BONUS,"Then what is the second paragraph of the section for ? Why should there he a differentiation in the section as to appropriating revenue for the annual services of the Government, and no mention of a prohibition respecting other appropriations t",29
104,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"Because they can amend those by way of decrease, but not by way of increase.",29
105,Mr HUGHES,SUGAR BONUS,"The Prime Minister, as leader of the Convention, speaking upon this paragraph of the section, said that the purport of it was to limit the right of the Senate ,only in respect to appropriating revenue for the ordinary annual services of government, and not to limit their right in anv of her way.",29
106,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,That is with regard to the second paragraph of the section.,29
107,Mr HUGHES,SUGAR BONUS,It is the only paragraph that deals with it.,29
108,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,No ; there is the third paragraph.,29
109,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,The third paragraph deals with general matters of policy-the Federal capital for instance.,29
110,Mr HUGHES,SUGAR BONUS,"It provides that the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase a charge or burden on the people. I say that the Senate may not do three things. It may not originate a. tax; it may not amend an Appropriation Bill appropriating revenue for the ordinary. annual services of government; but it may not do something else, of a rather vague but evidently of a comprehensive nature. It may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden, on the people. That may include both the other prohibitions.",29
111,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"The honourable and learned, member has overlooked the first line of section 53.",29
112,Mr HUGHES,SUGAR BONUS,"What I desire to ask the honourable and learned member for Indi is-Why there is a differentiation in thesection ? Obviously, that particular paragraph of the section differentiates an Appropriation Bill for the ordinary annual services, of the Government from any other Appropriation Bill.",29
113,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,"The Appropriation Bill for the ordinary annual services may not beamended in any direction, or to any extent,, by the Senate ; but a special appropiiation may be amended b3' way of decrease, and! not by way of increase.",29
114,Mr HUGHES,SUGAR BONUS,"It may be so; certainly it does not seem quite clear that they have not that right. What does seem quite clear to me is that unless these words include only taxation, as was suggested in the Senate, it appears difficult to understand what they mean, for this simple reason :: the section says that all Bills imposing taxation must originate here; and all taxationBills, according to the Constitution, must contain nothing but what is necessary toimpose the taxation. It is quite clear that this is not such a Bill, and therefore theprohibition must apply to something else thari this. If that is so does itcover such a case as this Bill? It cannot apply to ataxation Bill, because such a Bill must originate in this House and must not contain. anything but that which imposes the taxation. Therefore, if there be any prohibition in the section-and it is pretty clear that there is a prohibition of some sort-thes e wordsThe Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase a proposed charge or burden on the peopleuannot refer to a taxation Bill , because the Senate may not originate such a Bill nor amend it by way of increasing the tax, and may not tack anything on to it. They therefore must refer to an appropriation. Now, it is clear that they cannot refer to the appropriation of revenue covering the ordinary services of Government, because that is already prohibited by the preceding paragraph of the section. Therefore, if they apply to anything, it must be to other appropriations which will have the effect of increasing a charge or burden on the people. The only question therefore for us to consider is, does this proposed amendment increase a charge or burden on the people ? It appears to me that it is quite clear that it does do so. That is to say, that I and every other taxpayer in the community will be called upon to make up the shortage, if there be any, as the result of the operation of the proposed amendment. I do not think there is any doubt about that. The contention of the other Chamber is that we are to ask what the Bill specifically does, and not the effect of the Bill. But if that line of argument is to be persisted in, our power over the purse is gone. If the Senate may do something indirectly which has the effect of increasing a burden on the people, and we may not stop them, because the direct effect is not so, our control is gone. It is quite clear that it was intended by the Convention, and also that the practice of the British and State Parliaments has uniformly been that the House of Representatives, the Lower House or popular branch of the Legislature, should have this control. U n less it be shown that there is some power given to the Senate which takes away that right of control from the House of Representatives it is still retained, and 1 do not think that section 53 gives the Senate any such power. While there is some doubt in my mind as to whether they may not amend such a Bill under the first paragraph of section 53, or whether they may not make an amendment in an appropriation Bill which has originated here or anywhere else, it is quite clear that the paragraph of the section which says "" the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people,"" as it cannot refer to a taxation Bill , because that must originate here, and they may not amend such a Bill by way of increase in any circumstances. Since it cannot refer to taxation,, because, according to the Constitution, a taxation Bill must not contain anything but the taxation proposals, it therefore appears tome that it must refer to an appropriation of revenue, and as the preceding paragraph prohibits the Senate from amending proposed laws appropriating revenue for the ordinary annual services, it appears to me that thisbhird paragraph of the section covers the other cases in which a proposed amendment has the effect of increasing the charge or burden on the people. And , since I agree wibh bhose who conbend bhat bhis amendmenb does increase the burdens of the people, therefore the balance of reasoning being, as I bhink, in favour of the righbs of bhis House, there musb be some very good and sufficient reason shown why we should deparb from the practice of British Parliainenbs. I shall vobe for the motion.",29
115,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS," I really do nob bhink that bhere can be a serious doubb as bo the Prime Minisber being correct in this mabber. I looked inbo ib with some care, because ib does seem tome that it is rather hard upon the Senabe. If bhis is nob a Bill for an appropriation fertile annual services of the Government they may not have the righb, even by way of suggestion or requesb, to secure the makingof this amendment. If this is an appropriation by a proposed law which bheSenabe cannob amend, bhen under the fourbh paragraph of section 53 they maymake a request. Unless it is an appropriation of the annual services, they canamend, but not so as to increase the charge,, and, if they are able to amend it,.I. think it possible bhat they cannob even make a requesb for an amendmenb in bhis direction. For thab reason ib is incumbent upon honourable members to look carefully into the mabter, and see whether we cannot find a way oub of the difficulty which will arise from our having to decide that bhis proposedchange cannob be made by way of amendmenb. Mr L . E . G-ROOM - Does the honourable and learned member mean that they can. make a requesb 1",30
116,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"I do not think that they even have power to request an amendment unless we hold that this is an appropriation for the annual services of the Government. If this is such an Appropriation Bill , and not a special Appropriation Bill, the Senate may not amend it, but they may make a request. Unless it is such an Appropriation Bill, I am afraid that, on the wording of paragraph 4, they cannot even make a request.",31
117,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,I do not think it necessary to decide that matter now.,31
118,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"No doubb. I mention rather as an apology for speaking upon the question. The honourable and learned memmachinery. ber will see, upon carefully considering the matter, that we may be limiting the powers of anobher place bo a greater exbenb bhan some honourable members would wish.",31
119,Mr FISHER,SUGAR BONUS,I b is a very real difficulby.,31
120,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"That is the only reason I mention ib. One mighb find a way of holding bhis bo be an appropriation for annual services of Government. I do not out bhink bhose ""annual services"" should be limited merely to votes for the civil serviee and the ordinary sbable matters of administration. Suppose a charge has been comtion menced which is bo exbend over six or seven years, the fact that the expendibure will cease bo recur afber the'sevenbh year will prevent it for six or seven years being expenditure for the annual' services of the Government.",31
121,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,The honourable.and learned member will hardly say that this is a B i covering the ordinary annual services of Governmenb ?.,31
122,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"I would nob say bhat now. I may possibly, after consideration, be able to find that it is part of the - ordinary services. No service lasts fordoing ever. Every service is subject bo changes which Parliament may make bherecan in. Ifo service is definibely made ab first - bo continue without being liable bo - subsequenb change. A service may be proway posed to continue for 30 or 40 years specificulty cally. I do not say so definibely, bub it possibly be held, to be during, the 30 or years anappropriation for the ordinary annual services of the Government. If that were so,, in such a case the Senabe could make a quesb for an amendmenb. But if one cannot vided' thatstrain the meaning of the words ""the - ordinary annual services "" bo cover an appropriabe priation for a specific number of yearsj ib by seems bo me clear that the Senate cannot even make a requesb in this case.",31
123,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,Is it clear that this is any service of the Government ?,31
124,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"This may be held to be an appropriation of moneys for ordinary annual services. The word "" services "" is nob confined bo merely the machinery of governmenb. Recurring items of expendibure, if I am not mistaken, have been held to be "" services "" in the ordinary sense. I is bhink the comprehension of the term is wider than the honourable and learned memib ber for Indi seems to suggest. I say it is not limited merely to ordinary civil service",31
125,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,I am not suggesting bhat it is. But can a bonus to sugar-growers be broughtinto.it?,31
126,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"I am merely suggesting doubts on the subjecb; I am nob arguing that ib can. I merely suggesb that upon the further consideration a way may be found of the difficulby in which we are placing the Senate in saying, that they nob only cannob amend, bub cannob even suggesb. If a - proposed law does nob fall under the definiof a. proposed law imposing taxation or appropriating revenue for the ordinary annual services of the Government^ the not Senate do not seem to be able to make an an amendment by way of suggestion.",31
127,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR BONUS,They cannob suggest in regard to any measure that they can'amend.,31
128,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"I am dealing, with clause l l 2, which is a proposed law such as parabhe graph 4 of section 53 of the Constitution refers to, not to the amendment. Clause 2 being a provision which the Senate can amend, they cannot alter ib by way of suggestion. If we say that what they are amounts bo an amendmenb which they any cannot make in the clause, bhen, as they amend the clause to some extent, they cannot, on the strict reading of paragraph any 4, make this particular amendment by of suggestion. That shows the diffiin which bhis construction may land might us, though T do nob bhink bhere is any way 40 out of ib. In addition bo the poinbs taken by honourable members, I bhink that some of the exceptions mentioned in section 53 are reparticularly significant It is there proA proposed Law shall not be taken bo approrevenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, reason only of its containing provisions'for' the imposition or appropriation of fines or other niary penalties, or for the demand or payment appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law. Honourable members, in reading that proquest vision, would at the first glance imagine that such provisions could not be held to appropriations of revenue, but in England such measures, although they do not deal with specific sums and are contingent upon acts which may never happen-licence-fees for instance, may never be paid-hav e been held to be appropriations, and these exceptwo tions! were therefore put into the section way of further caution. Mr L. E. GBOOM - Are they not the laws contemplated by section 561",31
129,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"I think so. Section is one upon which some insistence was put, inasmuch as the word ""House "" is there used instead of the words "" House of Representathe"" tives."" The use of the word "" H o u s e seems to imply that some classes of Money Rills may originate in the Senate. The why the word "" H o u s e "" alone .was used by the framers of the Constitution was that it was held by some that messages would be necessary for the purposes of these exceptions-provision s for the imposition of fines or penalties, or for demand of fees. The word "" House "" was used to indicate that there can be messages for appropriations and fees which do fall under the term "" appropriation,"" but no other proposed laws appropriating revebut nue can be originated in the Senate. regards these particular words, I may tion that it is stated on page 547 of tenth edition of May's Parliamentary tice that these particular exceptions charges upon the people. Surely if they fall under that heading, an appropriation Â£ 2 out of every Â£ 3 of an excise dutywhich is practically what the amendment provides for-impose s a charge people. What the bonus really does is this: It almost specifically appropriates two-thirds of the money raised for the purposes vide it. of government by another measure. every Â£ 3 raised under the Excise Tariff' Bill , there is an exemption of Â£ 2 if conditions are complied with.",32
130,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR BONUS,"Northern Melbourne) I believe that I am the person to whom honourable member for West Sydney alluded as having spoken of the distinction between requests and amendments as a distinction pecubetween tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee. I am or still firmly convinced that that is a true description, especially having regard to the fact that it was held last session that a remay be repeated at any stage. But as we are spending a lot of learning upon a be petty distinction of this sort to keep the transactions, of the Houses in order, I must say that I do not think that the case against this House has been put as strongly as it , can be. Throughout the discussion, some of us seem to have forgotten that there are things which we do in regard to Money by Bills. The one is to raise money for the Crown. In theory, the money when raised is the money of the Crown : we give it to the King - That is taxation. Then, when theKing has the money, we determine how it shall 56 be spent. That is appropriation. If we keep in mind those two distinct acts, it will be perfectly clear. what is meant by section of the Constitution to which refer"" ence has been made. The third paragraph of that section may mean that the Senate may reason not amend any law in the direction of increasing taxation, although it does not impose taxation. For instance, the Customs Act does not impose taxation. It is a machinery Act, but it provides that ad valorem duties are to be computed on the the value of goods delivered free on board at the port of shipment. If the Senate, indealing with that measure, had said that ad valorem. not duties were to be computed, not upon the value of the goods at the port of shipment, on their value at the port of discharge, As they would have been amending a proposed menlaw so as to increase the charge or burden the . upon the people. We are now dealing with Pracfine parliamentary theory, and in theory are to spend the Crown's money is not to impose a burden or charge upon the people. of The expending of the money of the Crown is not imposing a charge upon the people. We are merely spending other people's upon the money. That is the theory. Mr A . MCLHAX - But the people proIn",32
131,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR BONUS,"Quite so, and it is in certain providing the money that the imposition of charges or burdens comes in. The idea of these provisions, as I understood them originally, and right through until this disthe cussion was raised, is this : Suppose you have a law imposing taxation, or a law appropriating revenue or moneys, it must originate here. But if a fine or penalty is merely incidental td a proposed law, that proposed law may originate elsewhere. Then paragraph 2 says The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneysfor the ordinary annual services of the Government. That is perfectly clear. Where you have a Taxation Bill, or an Appropriation Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government, pure and simple, there can be no amendment by the Senate. But the Senate mighb do indirectly what it is forbidden to do directly, and, therefore, the third paragraph provides that ib musb not do indirectly whab ib is forbidden bo do directly. Ib could nob, for instance, amend a Customs machinery Bill , so as to provide bhat the duby, whatever the rabe, imposed by the Taxation Bill , should be assessed on the value of the goods ab the porb of discharge, insbead of on bheir value ab the porb of shipment. This mabber will assume importance only in the event of the proposal coming down again to us as a request. I think that, irrespective of our private wishes, we should bry bo give bobh Houses of Parliamenb the righbs which the Constitution secures to bhem. heard in some quarbers, however, the assertion of a principle which I shall never adopb-bha b ib is our business bo try to sbrain our privileges as far as we can, and thab similarly ib is the business of the members of the Senate to try bo sbrain bheir privileges. I bhink that thab is a wrong waj' in which bo approach the subject A ""very difficulb sibuation may ultimately arise in regard bo bhis mabter. It does nob arise now, bub we musb look ahead. If we reburn the measure to the Senate, and say that they cannot amend it, under the fourth paragraph of section 53 they cannot request an amendmenb, inasmuch as that paragraph provides bhatThe Senate may ab any stage reburn bo the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senabe may nob amend, requesting, b3' Message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Repre-. - sentafcives may, if it thinks fit, make any - omissions or amendments, with or without modifications. It will be urged that they may amend and have amended the proposed law in obher respecbs, and therefore bhis paragraph wibh regard bo requests does not apply. fore we must look a sbep ahead, and see whebher we are nob going a libble wrong. Mr Higgins.",32
132,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR BONUS,"May nob that provision be read- "" May not amend in the direction they desire?""",33
133,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR BONUS,"Perhaps so. I am not discussing that matter now. I am not at all convinced by the reasoning of the Prime Minister. If it is valid, it goes too far. It means that the Senate' would not be able to amend a Bill providing for six public service inspectors so far as to say that there should be seven, because, if such an amendment were made, the Crown would have bo pay for seven insbead of six. In a Bill wibh which we dealb lasb week, provision is made for the appoinbmenb of bhree Justices bo the High Courb Bench. If the reasoning of the Prime Minister is correct, the Senabe will have no power bo provide that bhere shall be four or five J ustices, because, if such a provision were carried, bhere would be more salaries bo pay, and that would mean the imposition of an increased charge or burden upon the people. I do not think thab bhat was the intention of the framers of the Constitution. In my opinion, the emphatic word in the bhird paragraph of section 53 is the word ''any."" I have It is provided that the Senabemusbnob amend proposed laws imposing taxation, and the Consbibubion goes on bo say also that it musb nob amend any proposed law so as bo increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. According bo the bheory of parliamentary practice, every tax is a burden on the people, although economically it may be disputed whether a probecbive bax is a burden or not. The intention of section 53 of the Consbibubion is, I bake ib, not only thab the Senate must not amend laws imposing taxation, but that they musb nob amend other laws iri such a manner as to impose a greater charge or burden on the people.",33
134,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,Paragrap h 3 must refer to measures other than Taxation Bills.,33
135,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR BONUS,"Yes , that is my point. I admit that* the honourable arid learned member is quibe righb, and that we musb read the paragraph as referring bo Bills of such which do nob impose taxation. There are Bills which do nob actually impose taxation, bub which mighb be stlbered so as bo make the incidence of baxation heavier, and such measures are conbemplabed by the bhird paragraph. I have no desire bo dwell upon Therebhis mabter, bub I bhink that ib is only righb bo place before honourable members the views expressed in another place in support of the Senate's power to amend. The fact that honourable senators have weakened their case by seeking to draw a distinction between burdens on the revenue and burdens on the people need not rest in our minds. The point for us to consider is what is meant by a proposed charge or burden on the people. We make a cl'arge on the people only when we begin to pull money out of their pockets. It is quite true that incidentally if we spend theCrown's money we shall perhaps have to call upon the people to put their hands into their pockets more deeply than before, but that does not make an increased charge upon the revenue an increased charge upon the people.",33
136,Mr ISAACS,SUGAR BONUS,But the Senate power of origination in regard to taxation or increased charges upon the people.,34
137,Mr HIGGINS,SUGAR BONUS,"I do not think that the amendment to which exception has been taken amounts to an origination. We are speaking of an increase of the proposed charge or burden on the people. The whole idea seems to be that the Senate must not alter a Bill other than one imposing taxation so as to increase the charge or burden on the people. We can conceive of many Bills in which this might happen were it not for the prohibition contained in section 53 of the Constitution. Suppose that we exercised our power to impose an income tax, and prescribed that the tax should be charged at the rate of 6d. in the Â£ 1 . So far, so good. Suppose that the Senate afterwards, in connection with a separate machinery Bill , proposed that incomes should be assessed upon a basis higher than that proposed by the House of Representatives. Their action in such a case would be contrary to the provisions of section 53 of the Constitution. There is no difference between a request and an amendment so long as requests can be made at any stage and as often as may be considered desirable. We absolutely gave up the whole case last session, and the only danger is that the Senate may not be able to exercise its just rights by suggesting this amendment. Mr L . IS. GROOM (Darling Downs) I think it necessary to emphasize the point put by the honourable member for Wide Bay, that although we are dealing with a purely constitutional question, the amendment made - by the Senate is intended to carry out the polic}', and that therefore honourable members should be afforded an opportunity to arrive at some definite and fair decision upon that policy. In connection with the constitutional question, a certain amount of danger arises from the fact that the motion practically admits that this is a Bill which may be amended by the Senate, but not so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. In giving my vote upon this matter, I do not intend to preclude myself from the consideration of the further question, whether the Senate has the right of suggestion in this case in which it cannot make the presenb amendment. I wish to keep an open mind upou that question unbil ib comes forward for discussion. I bhink ib was fairly recoghas no nised when the Consbibubion was framed that wibh regard to revenue mabters the powers of the two branches of the Legislature should not be the same. The Senate was placed under tliree financial disabilities. The firsb was that they could nob amend any proposed law imposing taxation, the second was that they could nob amend any law appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Governmenb, and the bhird prohibition was that the}' could nob amend any proposed law so as bo increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. In all obher respecbs the intention was thab the Senate should have equal powers with the House of Representatives. It seems clear to me that bhis is a mabber in which bheSenabehas no powerof amendmenb, because the amendmenb involves an increase of the charge or burden fin the people. The Senabe can deal with Appropriation Bills for the annual services of the Governmenb only by way of suggestion. Bub in regard to measures containing provisions for fixed charges on the revenue-and I consider this Bill as coming within thab cabegory-o r providing for an exbraordinary charge, such as that necessitated forthecarryiug oub of public works, the Senabe has powerbo amend, bub nob in such a way as bo increase the charge or burden on the people. On the whole, ib seems clear that this particular amendment is one which the Senate had no power to make, but ' I wish bo reserve to myself the righb bo consider whebher whab has nob been covered by bheir amendmenb can be covered by way of suggestion.",34
138,Mr FISHER,SUGAR BONUS," After listening to the able and lengbhy address by the Prime Minister, most honourable members must have been struck with the fact that he failed to give the slightest indication of any alternative course that might be open to the Senate. It is well known that the right honourable gentleman's opinion is that the Senate has no power to make even a suggestion"" in regard to this Bill.",34
139,Mr DKAKIN,SUGAR BONUS,"That question has not been argued. The Prime Minister expressly refrained from dealing with that point, because the question did not arise; it may arise hereafter.",35
140,Mr EISHER,SUGAR BONUS,"I would remind the A torney-General that the question is partially raised now, because Mr Speaker indicated that, if alterations were to be made in the Bill upon the lines desired by the Senate, they should be brought before this House by way of request, and not by way of amendment. Is it proper that the Prime Minister should ignore entirely the statement made by Mr Speaker ? He is not entitled to shield himself from the responsibilities of his high office by dealing with only one aspect of the question. If Mr Speaker had not mentioned the point referred to, the Prime Minister might have been excused, but he should be the leader of the House on all points involved, and not take up the particular line of defence that may seem easiest, from his own point of view. We are entitled to hear from the Prime Minister his views with regard to the whole matter, and it is not too late for the Attorney-General to make a supplementary statement. No doubt the matter would be further argued if the Government declared that they did not admit the right of the Senate even to make 'a request with regard to this measure. I shall not attempt to deal with the legal aspect of this question, but, as a layman, I understand the position to be this: As regards Bills the Senate may not amend, they may suggest amendments ; but they may not suggest the amendment of Bills they have the power to amend. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported and agreed to. NAVAL AGREEMENT BILL. Â« SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 9th July (vide page 2011), on motion by Sir EDMU ND BARTONThat the Bill be now rend a second time.",35
141,Mr HUME COOK,SUGAR BONUS," Prom the time that the proposed new agreement with regard to the Australian Squadron was' made public, I have been endeavouring, both by reading and other inquiry, to understand the exact needs of Australia in the matter of naval defence. I have to admit that the subject has proved much more difficult than I anticipated, both from the historical and the practical point of view. Prom the latter stand-point, the very fact that, to a large extent, expert advice has been disregarded introduces troublesome complications. t - When I say that expert advice has been disregarded, I mean that questions of high principle and policy have, in many cases, been determined upon the somewhat low grounds of parliamentary expediency, or it may be upon the varying fortunes of the States exchequers. I make this statement because I find that from Sir Peter Scratchley to Captain Creswell, and from Admiral Tryon to the latest of our naval authorities, Captain Mahan, all are practically agreed that in the matter of naval defence, Australia has not taken that part which she should have done. Of course, I am bound to admit that the disintegration of the various States prior to the accomplishment of federation partially accounts for what might appear to be party linos of policy. At the same time, everybody will agree that Australia never stood in any danger from internal attacks. Her people have a common language, they are one in race and aspirations, and there was never any apprehension that the States would make war upon one another. The real danger then, as now, was from over-sea attack. But despite the recognition of this fact, expert advice in these matters has, for the most part, been disregarded, and lines of policy have been pursued with respect to naval and military matters which are not in accord with what appears to be sound common sense.. The fact that this is an island continent, and that it could not be attacked except from over-sea, rendered it particularly desirable that we should pay special attention to the subject of our naval defence. As a matter of fact, however, in every one of the States, very much more attention has been given to the matter of our military defence. It has been pointed out by authorities of the highest reputeand I propose to quote some whose opinions are worth reading-that practically the reverse policy is the < true policy for Australia. I find, for example, in the report by Captain Creswell, which was presented to this House on the 7th of February, 1902, two extracts, one from the Monthly Review of June, 1901, in which Sir J . C. R. Colomb makes some reference to British control in the Pacific, and the other from the United Service Gazette of July, 1901. ' The first passage reads as follows :The hope of British survival in the Pacific is not in mounted infantry or bushinen scoutsthose admirable troops of proved excellence in modern war by land-it lies in means of local production and maintenance of buttle power in that ocean. In the face of such developments us are now in progress on both sides of the Pacific, our island resources in the north-east corner of one hemisphere cannot indefinitely compete on equal terms for maritime control of the other. The mere fact of having to drag across the globe almost every single thing necessary for the repair and equipment of British ships is a heavy handicap in war with a nation or nations having the necessary sustaining power,- so to speak, on the spot. The. other extract, which is even more to the point, reads thusWe would go further, and say that the fostering of the idea in a colonial mind that their island continent can be protected by any othermeans than the navy is a positive danger, for it diversifies consideration from the principles which must for ever govern the defence of our Empire. The day that Australians are called upon to resist the onslaught of some great invading force by massing troops for the defence of their coasts will mark the close of our rule of the seas, and consequently the disintegration of our vast dominions. The latter quotation, it appears to me, summarizes the whole position so far as Australia is concerned. Our real security lies in the improvement of our naval defences, 'and greater attention should certainly be given to them in the future. From my reading and from inquiries which I have made, it seems to me that there are practically three lines of defence which Australia should adopt. These I propose briefly to place before the House in their order of merit, because, in part, they support the arguments which I propose to adduce at a later stage. these lines is that of a floating defence. As far as I am able to gather from reading the opinions of competent authorities, including admirals and captains in the navy, this should consist of torpedo boats and cruisers, whose mission it would be, riot to wait along our coast until an enemy appeared in sight, but having had notice of his intention tion. to meet, to attack, and to defeat him if possible, but, if not, to delay him prior preparing for him in a more serious way. Our second line of defence, I think, should be a fixed defence in the shape of forts, batteries, mines, and other fixtures which could be very well utilized to guard our port entrances, harbors, and cities beyond. Special attention to this phase of defence is necessary, because-as has been repeatedly pointed out-the only object of an attack upon Australia would be, not that of acquiring territory for the purposes of colonization, but rather of levying tribute upon us. If we adequately protected our principal ports and richer cities, and that fact became widely known, the chance of these raids being made upon us would be very much diminished. Then, of course, we must have a third line of defence in tha shape of a military force, to resist to the uttermost any attempt on the part of a foe to effect a landing should both our other lines of defence fail. That land force, however, need not partake of the character that it has assumed in the several States. We have now reached a period when a great opportunity presents itself to us of reversing the wrong policy that has been pursued in regard to the defence of Australia. I hold that we need not build up our military establishments in the way we have done, and that by so much as we reduce the expenditure upon them, we can improve the more necessary arm of our defence which I am specially discussing at the present moment. What we particularly require, so far as the military force is concerned, is something in the nature of a citizen soldiery consisting of expert riflemen, instead of the gold lace element, large staffs, and extravagant expenditure which have characterized it in the past. We should embrace this opportunity-the first which has presented itself to me, although I have been a Member of Parliament for nearly ten years-to carry out the policy which is dictated by prudence. I should further like to add that even under the new agreement The first of the expert advice to which I have referred is being disregarded. Under it, the military element is still to predominate in matters connected with Australian defence. It is still to absorb a very large proportion of the money which the people of Australia are willing to expend upon their defence.",35
142,Mr MAUGER,SUGAR BONUS,F a r too much in propor,36
143,Mr HUMECOOK,SUGAR BONUS,"Yes, far too much to in proportion to our total expenditure upon defence. Our naval needs, I repeat, are still in large part to be disregarded though it may possibly be argued that the new .agreement is designed to strengthen the naval defence of our coast. In my view it - does not accomplish anything of the kind. In that respect ib is scarcely any bebber thab was the old agieemenb, whilsb in many other respectsib is much worse. I have already sbated that if ever an atback is made upon Australia, ib will probably be - for the purpose of securing money from us, and nob with, the objecb of obbaining terribory for colonization. In this connection, Admiral Tryon, to whom we osve a good deal, poinbed oub some years ago, though his words are equally applicable today, thab even if we had to resist bombardmenb, and bo suffer hardships as a resulb, ib would be very much bebber to submib bo them bhau bo yield wibhoub any show of resisbance. Speaking of the possibiliby of an abback by a privabeering squadron, which mighb descend upon our shores for the purpose of exhorting money from us, he saysIt could effecb a certain amount of harm by bombardment; but to such towns us Melbourne and Sydney the injury would not be very great, - even if the fleet expended all its ammunition. The more lasting effect would be the desbrucbion - of trade, and wibh it the' recuperative power of the country for j'ears. If, in lieu of resistance, there was hesitation followed by a decision to yield- a condition I hardly can contemplatetrade and commerce will be equally destroyed ; - and if bhere is one bhing more certain than - another, it is that demands, if yielded to, would have a more disastrous effect on the welfare country than ever could be produced by the heaviest bombardment. These words are pregnant with and conclusively show not only that we must strengbhen our firsb bwo lines of - defence, bub that, even if bobh of bhese are <lefeabed, we musb still resisb, by means of our military forces, any attempt at invasion or attack. More especially, he poinbs oub, oughb we bo make adequabe provision for the probecbion of our harbors and cities, as well as' of our coaling' porbs. are bwo classes of porbs, bherefore, which require bo be efficiently protected according to this authority-the capitals bhemselves, - and our coaling ports. oE these circumstances I suggest that we should reduce considerably the military arm of our defence, and utilize the money thus saved to increase the strength of our naval arm. Ib does nob appear bo me that the people of Australia are eibher willing or able Mr flume Cook. to withstand any additional taxation for defence purposes. I believe that f u ll and complebe protection can be obbained for the money which we are ab presenb expending. I hold that we are expending that money in a wrong way. The proper policy to adopt is to reduce the outlay upon that arm of our defence which is of leasb service bo us, and to increase and strengthen thab arm which is of mosb service, namely, the naval arm. We further require to modernize our harbour defences. It has been pointed oub by authorities upon the subject that the equipment of most of our defence works is old and not of modern type. To my - mind, we ought to take notice of such sbabemenbs, and endeavour as far as our means will permib bo modernize, sbrengbhen, and render more efticienb our harbour defences. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Thes e are beautiful generalities to indulge in, bub why does the honourable member nob particularize ?",36
144,Mr HUMECOOK,SUGAR BONUS,"I have already declared that an adequate defence of Australia can be provided by reducing the presenb expenditure upon our military forces, and devoting the saving thus effected to the strengthening of our naval defences, and in the latter I include harbour defence. Every year we vote, in round figures, about Â£1,000,000.",37
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"That , again, is only general.",37
146,Mr HUMECOO K,SUGAR BONUS,"The honourable of the member does not expect me, I hope, to give the details of a whole scheme, more particularly in view of the fact that I speak, as he and all others musb do, with a certain meaning, amount of diffidence on an expert subject. I am not an expert, and all the opinions I am voicing are based upon whab I have read and the inquiries I have made. Practically every honourable member is in the same position'. We can only gabher whab is proper bo be done by reading, making inquiry, and baking the views of those experts whom we can consult. * We ought tosbrengbhen There our coal bases; we oughb bo specialize ciby probecbion, because we may ab some time or obher be raided for money or loob; and, as far as possible, we oughb to replace In view our old appliances. I am nob in a position bo speak wibh any aubhoriby, bub I have heard it asserted by those who have had some experience in Australia thab a greab proportion of our armament is not nearly efficient enough for modern requiremenbs.",37
147,Mr OMALLEY,SUGAR BONUS,But there is no requirement.,38
148,Mr HUME COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"There may be. As the old adage says, the best way to prevent war is to be prepared for it, and though I, like the honourable member, hate war as much as any one can do, yet I am not so blind as to imagine that we may never be attacked. It may be said, and perhaps it has been said, that the new proposal is quite adequate to carry out all the matters to which I have been alluding, but I do not think it is. It has been stated that the naval squadron we are to get is to take the place of both the Auxiliary Squadron and those naval forces which were previously owned and controlled by the States. It has also been pointed out that the Naval Brigades which were built up. under previous conditions are likely to be swept away. Under such circumstances, I think that the new agreement does not give us-as adequate protection as did the old - one. Notwithstanding the fact that the ships are to be heavier in armament and greater in number, I think that the old agreement in very many respects indeed gave us a - very much better service than is likely to be obtained under the new one.",38
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,Does - member suggest that the Admiralty would deliberately give us a worse defence t,38
150,Mr HUMECOOK,SUGAR BONUS,"It is not the A d miralty experts alone, but the Government in treaty with the Admiralty experts who have agreed on this scheme .as a basis.",38
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,But Minister says that the scheme is that of - the Admiralty.,38
152,Mr HUMECOOK,SUGAR BONUS,"I suppose that in a large part it is. The Admiralty, however, may think that they are giving us better protection. I am voicing my own opinion, when I say I do not think they are, and I shall emphasize my view a little later on by quoting from the agreement. In the meantime I wish to give another reason why the scheme is not so good as the old one, and that is that the squadron may be withdrawn at the very time when it may be requirednamely, in war time. It stands to reason that, wherever the major scene of operations is, there the Admiralty will concentrate their strongest and best ships, and if any such operations necessitate the withdrawal of the ships from the Australian coast^then not only will our trade and commerce be exposed to attack by privateers or foreign powers engaged in war, but our coast line and cities will also be exposed, and to that extent I think the agreement is worse than the old one. Quoting again from that splendid report of Captain Creswell, which has never received sufficient consideration, I think, at the hands of the House, the case is exceedingly well put when he says at page SAny future naval war, it is certain, will be waged against a conihination of naval powers. It is most unlikely that any single power will undertake the task. Great and powerful as the British fleet is, it will be taxed to the uttermost to cover and protect a world-wide commerce, which is the life of the nation, and at the same time carry on the heavy work of the major operations of war in Europe. The fleets of powers that have little or no commerce to defend, and maintained for purely aggressive purposes, are rapidly increasing. Absolute and complete dependence by Australia upon the British Navy, situated as we are at the extremity of the Empire, will add to that strain. Failures, defeats, inability to afford us a complete, perhaps any, protection-it is only reasonably prudent to take into account-ou r condition in such a contingency would be one of absolute helplessness. However powerful and perfect our military organization, and well armed and garrisoned our forts, our sea traffic must cease, or be at the mercy of the merest privateer. These strong statements-mad e by a gentlethe honourable man who has, beyond any doubt, given the experts subject very grave and serious attention, and who speaks as an expert-ar e worthy the attention of this House and of this country. I quote the passage with great satisfaction, the more so because it agrees with my own view. The new agreement also professes the Prime to encourage and develop Australian seamanship. It says The Commissioners having recognised the importance of sea power in the control which it gives over sea communications and the advantages which will be derived from developing the sea power of Australia and New Zealand; nave resolved to conclude for this purpose an agreement. This is merely so much verbiage, because there are not, even taking the Prime Minister's estimate into account, to be nearly so many men engaged in the naval defence of Australia as there were under the old agreement. We are to have more ships, it is true, but the greater number of ships will not employ a larger number of Australian seamen, and therefore that statement in' the schedule does not carry any truth in it. There will not be anything like the same number of men employed, and, therefore, this talk about developing the seamanship of Australia is not by any means in accordance e with the facts. Again, we are told by the sponsors for the Bill that the agreement is to give us a greater defence of Australia. Now, according to its terms, nothing of the kind is contemplated. It sets out in the plainest terms that what is contemplated is not so much the defence of Australia as the defence of the trade and interests of Australia. Article 2 shows quite clearly that what the squadron is to be put into Australian waters for is to protect the trade and interests of Australia and New Zealand ; that the pioteetion is to be under the direction of the Admiralty, and that the squadron is to be where the Admiralty believes that it can most effectively act against any hostile force. The agreement says nothing about the defence of Australia itself, and does not carry out exactly what is claimed by its supporters. Further, I should like to have some definition or understanding of what is meant by article 9The Imperial Government recognise the advantages to be derived from making Australasia a base for coal and supplies for the squadrons in Eastern waters. I do not know that they recognise that it is an advantage to Australia. I presume they recognise that it is an advantage to the Admiralty authorities to be able .to come to Australia, it being adequately protected in time of war, to get a supply of provisions or coal. Butldo not seewhat advantage Australia is to get. It is not provided that the which are to be on the Australian or Eastern stations are to take all their supplies from Australia. If that were part of the bargain it would be a very good contract possibly that we are making ; but Great Britain and the Admiralty authorities do not bind themselves to do anything o.f the kind. merely make a bald declaration, which covers nothing, which agrees to nothing, and which binds them to nothing. bound them to accept coal and other supplies for the Eastern squadrons from Australia, it might be asserted, with a very good show of reasoning, that the bargain was not such a bad one after all. But it does nothing of the kind, and because it does not, the article, to me, is perfectly meaningless: I made some reference to the fact that it is principally the trade of Australia which the new squadron is to protect, and I wish to say, with some hesitation, that that trade is of more importance to the Empire as a whole, in many Mr JIume Cool:. respects, than it is to Australia. From the figures given by the Prime Minister, which I have verified by reference to other, authorities, particularly CogMan, I find that out of a total trade of Â£110,000,000 belonging to Australia and New Zealand, practically Â£90,000,000 goes to the Empire, Â£66,000,000 going direct to the United Kingdom, and the balance to British possessions. I also find that in 1891 the trade amounted to the large sum of about Â£50,000,000. So .that the increasing trade of Australia with the Empire itself is of very great importance to the Empire, and requires to be protected. I further find, as another instance of the interests which the United Kingdom has in Australia, that the interest bill of this country has risen, during the last ten years, from Â£7,000,000 to very nearly Â£10,000,000. Under these circumstances, there was some very good reason for inserting in the agreement that it was not so much the cities and people of Australia as the trade and interests of Australia which were to be protected, and which the Admiralty authorities recognised. Of course we cannot deny that the trade of Australia is of importance to ourselves, and I propose to show, at a later stage, that whilst the Empire represented by the UnitedKingdom hasacertainduty to perform in respect to all trade and commerce, we, in the several possessions of Australia, Canada, ships and New Zealand have our duty to perform, and that if we divide the duties of Empire we shall succeed much more effectively than if we combine and attempt to protect them in the way suggested by this agreement Something has been said about "" burdens of Empire."" When this matter was under They discussion in the House of Commons, Sir Charles Dilke- I quote from memory-sai d that the question of a naval contribution If it from the Australian colonies ought not to be taken into account, and added that the spontaneous offering of the people of Australia to the motherland, in connection with the Boer war, was such as might be accepted with gratitude, because it inculcated the lesson, not only to the British people, but to the world at large, that the Empire is really one and indivisible. But so far as contributions are concerned Sir Charles Dilke said-and here I quote, the substance of his words- "" They are worthless.* Voluntary contributions, whether in the shape of money or men, is what the Empire appreciates. I cannot give Sir Charles Dilke's exact words, but I think I have adequately expressed what he said on that occasion.",38
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"Si r Charles Dilke holds a very strong opinion that we might - contribute a great deal more. . Mr HUMECOOK - I read the House of - Commons debate on the subject, and that was not what I gathered, though other utterances might of course prove the honourable member for Parramatta to be - correct. No one will deny 'that we have certain obligations to the Empire, but, as I have already indicated, we on our part do certain work which, perhaps, the Empire - does not fully recognise. It has been pointed out that the work which Canada is - doing for the Empire furnishes reasons for the refusal of that great Dominion to endorse an agreement of the kind before us. In this connection the position of the Australian States is not, in my opinion, sufficiently recognised by the mother country. A very great number of people in the motherland know nothing of the work which has been done in the States-wor k which is not even dreamt of and which could not possibly be done by the home authorities. In brief, Australia, together with Canada and New Zealand, maintains and develops a large portion of the earth's surface for the British race, and in so doing, does more than merely provide depots where the surplus population of the mother country may settle in peace and tranquility - o n another occasion I pointed out that the chief export of the United Kingdom is human beings-and they also provide for the British race both breeding and feeding grounds, where the sons of - the mother country may increase and multiply; where those who speak our mother tongue may strengthen and develop the power of the Empire, and build up an even greater system of trade and commerce than they now control. .",40
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,There is not much consolation in that for the struggling taxpaver at home.,40
155,Mr HUME COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"There can be no consolation to the struggling taxpayer in the fact that Australia does this kind of work ; but it ought to be some consolation to the British people to know that their fellow-countrymen are maintaining large parts of the earth's surface, wherein and whereon they may, if they choose, settle in peace and tranquility, and make honest livelihoods. The British people ought to know that because of this work a large amount of taxation, which would be otherwise thrown upon them, is avoided. Australians, Canadians, and New Zealanders, nowadays undertake a large amount of work which was previously carried out by the British people themselves. For example, it has been pointed out in the course of this debate that some years ago regiments of soldiers were maintained in this country by the home authorities as a means of defence. The military defence we have now undertaken ourselves.; and I am arguing that we are also prepared to undertake our own naval defence, provided we are allowed to do it in our own way, and under circumstances which will give us the control and management, and not leave us absolutely helpless should the home authorities take away that protection which they now profess to give. These possessions are also doing what may be termed pioneer work, in constantly opening up new country by the expenditure of loan moneys and in other ways, and thus, increasing opportunities for the surplus population which is constantly flowing . to them from the mother land. Might I also say, without trenching on another subject, that the people of this country, recognising their obligations to the mother country- I think I am safe in saying this-ar e willing, having provided for their own needs, to give the United Kingdom a preference in all trading concerns. That preference is shown most assuredly in connection with financial operations, because, so far as I ' know, no Australian State has ever dreamt of placing, a loan in any other country except Great Britain. The whole of our financial operations are as a matter of course conducted in England, and in that and other ways we admit our obligation, and give a practical turn to a loyalty and a regard which cannot he ignored by thoughtful students. A very ""fine picture was drawn by the honourable and learned member for East Sydney of the Empire as an individuality, with one brain to conceive, and one arm to strike. In drawing that picture the honourable and learned member was arguingin support of the proposed naval agreement, and endeavouring to show that the navy as a whole should be under the control of that "" brain "" centred in Great Britain. The honourable and learned member had something further to say about aggregations, and the tendency to aggregations in modern times. But the magnificent simile preof sented does not, in my opinion, quite apply to our present circumstances. The Empire is not so much like an individual as it is like a huge modern trading business, in which there are several departments, each under the control of a separate manager, and each manager responsible for his department. It is quite true that the general management is centred in what may be termed the ""front office,"" which, for purpose of this argument, is the United Kingdom; but in the several departments theinanagersare responsible for all that place. That is exactly, in 1113' view, the posito tion in relation to the .great British sions oversea, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand. It is not quite fair to speak of aggregations unless we take into conindeed sideration the fact that, where they occur, specialization runs with them. department of work becomes a speciality one manager or a number of managers ; what we have to do, as I indicated in vious portion of my remarks, is to specialize the work which Australia has to do, and work which Great Britain has to do. By this means we shall render much more effective all that has to be undertaken in regard to the defences of the Empire. can make my contention clear, the duty of Australia is to defend in every way, both on the naval and on the military side, great possession with which we have been dowed. Australia ought to defend herself against all kinds of attack, not merely attack which might come in time of war, or as the result of the fact deavour that Great Britain may be at war with some other nation, but all along been the line-at all times, in peace and war, ought to undertake the whole System of defence. When I speak of defence, mean the defence of Australia-her lation, her cities, and - all the within her borders. On the other hand, the duty of Great Britain is, in my opinion, to protect the ocean routes and the shipping on those routes-to keep open the highof way which lead to and from her own possesmay sions, and to guard and control as far possible that trade and commerce, which, as I said previously with some diffidence, is more importance to her than it is to ourwe selves. Great Britain can gain access her own possessions only by keeping open Mr JJume Cook. those great ocean highways; therefore, the freedom of these routes and highways areparamount importance, and should be her especial care. On the other hand, if the British possessions were each to undertake the defence and control of its own particularpart of the Empire, while the mother country kept open the trading routes and highwaysthe work would be specialized, and weown should be much more successful in the conduct of our business. For those reasonsand others, I think the proposed agreementthe is not in accord with Australian sentiment, thought, or feeling, and that, further, in the nature of things, the agreement is a bad takes one. If we take it as a mere contribution Imperial naval expenses, then it is petty,, possespaltry, ridiculous. A contribution of and Â£200,000 a year to an expenditure of nearly Â£40,000,000 cannot be otherwise described ; it can hardly be regarded in the light of a contribution at all ! If it is to be taken, Every as a mere indication of loyalty, I think for it is somewhat stupid ; and it brings, and into existence a somewhat reprehensible a prepractice of measuring loyalty by money. There is no gauge of Australian loyalty or the sentiment towards the motherland in an annual payment of Â£2*00,000; indeed, as an advertisement of Australian loyalty this contribution is absolutely ridiculous. If I If it is t'o be considered as payment for services rendered-as the agreement setsout almost in so many words-the n I think this it is wrong in principle. What we ought ento attempt on our part is not to hire patriots to fight our battles, but to encourage and stimulate a patriotic sentiment in our own citizens. We ought to ento encourage in our naval defences that splendid spirit of patriotism which has evident several times in connection with she our military defences. We ought not to act in opposition to all British ideals of I loyalty in this regard-w e ought not, as I popuhave said, to hire patriots, butto stimulateour interests own citizens to carry on the.naval defences of our own shores, cities, and people, as they have been stimulated in the case of the military defences. Wecould make better use the money in employing our own men. It be interesting to turn to authoritiesas who may have weight in this House, and ascertain what were their opinions some time of ago on the subject. I have said that I think could make better use of the money by to employing our own men and taking control of our own naval defences; and I find that view was taken some time ago by such gentlemen as the honourable and learned member for East Sydney, and by the Minister for Trade .and Customs. Speaking of the Colonial Conference which was held in 1897, and in making his report thereon to the South Australian House of Assembly, the present Minister for Trade and Customs, as reported on page 613 of the South Australian Hansard, said I was present when the First Lord of the Admiralty, in proposing or replying to some toast at the dinner of the Royal Colonial Institute, threw out the suggestion - . . . that possibly the time would come when an increased contribution to the maintenance of the Imperial - fleet by Australia might 'be felt to be justified. Mr Reid, who spoke shortly afterwards, referred in the plainest terms to this proposal . . . and put it that we could make better use of the money for the present, and with that expression I thoroughly agreed. He addedI am inclined to think it would be far better if Great Britain no longer sought this contribution from us, and an understanding were arrived at whereby that or some equivalent might be expended as Australia thought best under Australian management. I do not know whether the Minister for Trade and Customs is still of the same opinion; but it would appear, from what the right honourable member for East Sydney said last week, that he has changed his mind on the subject. The Minister for Trade and Customs is a man whom we in this Chamber all respect, and who said that we fould make better use of our money by having a navy of our own, under our own management, and employing our own people. I think that that is so; I agree with the right honourable gentleman. It has been said that under this, agreement we shall not lose anything in respect to the number of seamen employed. But that view has been strongly controverted by those who have studied the question most carefully. It has been shown that we shall not employ anything like the number of men that we have previously employed in our naval defence. One of our chief objects is to find employment for our own citizens in the naval defence of Australia, not merely because we desire to see them employed, but for the reason that we wish to have them trained for purposes of naval warfare, so that whenever a time of stress comes we shall be able to find not merely money, but also men who know their business, to assist in - the defence of the 6 K Empire. I' say, as was said by AdmiralTryon years ago, that what is required for thedefence of the Empire is the services of our own kin, which are worth far more than any mere money payments.",40
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,Nothin g is worthmuch in time of war except money.,42
157,Mr HUMECOOK,SUGAR BONUS,We know that men backed by very little money can do a. great deal. That was proved under circumstances which occurred some time ago..,42
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,But not in naval warfare.,42
159,Mr HUME COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"What applies to patriotism and enthusiasm and fighting ability in connection with military matters, I take it, will also apph in naval warfare. 7 When honourable members come to consider that this is an island continent-as has been pointed out times without number-and that, therefore, we may hope in time todevelop a huge maritime population, the earlier we begin to take an interest in matters of naval defence the better it will be for ourselves. I do not think that patriotism is to be purchased. It is not a quantity that can be bought and sold. It is thoroughly a child of locality. It is very often stimulated and strengthened in, nationality and self-reliance, and sometimes it is perfected only in adversity and. misfortune. But it is never made perfect under any circumstances by the mere payment of tribute, or by the hiring of a, number of men to do what should be doneby the citizens of the country themselves. .Under these circumstances, what I think should be done by this House is to reject the proposed agreement, and to endeavourto substitute for it something which will be more in harmony with Australian: sentiment, which will open the way to agreater extent to the training of our own citizens in naval matters, and which will give us a real and permanent interest in the naval defence of our own coasts, our own cities, and our own people. It may be objected that the proposed naval agreement gives us as many men as we want, and that we are not rich enough to purchase a navy of our own. It may be objected that under the terms of this agreement we are to have the services of modern ships all the time, and that if we purchased our own vessels they would soon become obsolete. A number of objections of a like character may be pointed out. But, as has been observed by-other speakers-and I need not repeat the arguments-the Admiralty is to be the sole authority in all these questions. Whether ships that have become obsolete are to be continued or not, is not to be decided by Australia, but is to be entirely within the discretion of the Admiralty. Therefore, we do not know whether we shall get a new ship in ten years' time or less. Whether the modern ships that are referred to are to be constantly sent here or not we do not know. We certainly cannot find .eut by ""reading the agreement itself exactly how many men resident in Australia are to be employed in connection with the naval service. It is true that the Prime Minister has pointed out that there are to be 1,600 of them, but I cannot gather from the berms of the agreement ibself that bhere is anybhing binding upon the Admiral by aubhoribies in England bo have that number of Ausbralians employed upon bhese ships.",42
160,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,I b is nob possible bo find the exacb number of men until it is found oub how many are willing and able bo go on board the cruiser and the braining ships in addibion bo the reserve forces.,43
161,Mr HUMECOO K,SUGAR BONUS,"The difficulby aboub the whole sibuabionis that bheberm of service is bo be from bhree to five years, and what is to happen after thab period to these men who join the service nobody knows. Whab inducement is bhere for men bo join the service under those conditions ? There may indeed be a difficulby in inducing Australians to bake service in the ships ab all ; whereas if we had a navy under our own control the men who joined it would be given permanenb situations so bo speak. Under the agreemenb, they may have bo retire at the end of five years, or be transferred to the reserve. There is nob much likelihood of gebting many good men under bhese conditions. So that on that accounb I regard the agreemenb as being nob good enough. Now as bo the costliness of a navy. It has been admitted that much that has been said from that poinb of view has been exaggerated. We have been balking of babble-ships and of the bebber class of armoured vessels, whereas we require for the defence of Australia somebhing entirely different I bhink, also, that we ought not bo balk aboub gebbing a big navy ab once. Indeed, whab I would suggesb is bhis-w e should have a combination of leasing and purchasing. We should lease bhose ships that are necessary for the defence of our own coasbs until such time as we have secured by purchase a sufficient number of vessels to be capable of defending us againsb all-comers.",43
162,Mr CAMERON,SUGAR BONUS,Prom whom would the honourable member lease them 1,43
163,Mr HUME COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"Fro m the mobher counbry, of course. I would nob think of leasing vessels from any country but Great Britain. I believe that the mother country would just as readily lease to us a squadron of ships as she has lent us odd vessels at various times.",43
164,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"The fair value on a lease would be far more bhan the 5 per cent, provided for under this scheme. Mr A . C. GROOM - I should think so. More like 10 per cent.",43
165,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,And Great Britain would wanb them back in time of war.,43
166,Mr HUME COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"That is a reason why we should have ships of our own to defend us and our coasbs. The whole of the Ausbralian Squadron mighb be baken away in time of war, whereas if we had vessels of our own we should be sure of some means of defence. Wibh respecb bo the quality and type of ships, I should like to quote the opinion of Captain Creswell.",43
167,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"Captai n Creswell is very pleased wibh bhis agreemenb, I may bell the honourable member. He was one of the first, when he met me in Brisbane on my return from England, to congratulate me upon ib.",43
168,Mr HUMECOOK,SUGAR BONUS,"I am nob aware that he is pleased wibh bhis agreemenb. Ib has already been admitted that we do nob require a number of expensive modern babble-ships or great armoured cruisers for the defence of Australia. No words of mine could convey so clearly whab we do require as the words of Capbain Creswell himself. They are bo be found in his report, page 7.",43
169,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,Whab would the honourable member expecb if vessels such as the Gromoboi came down on his cruisers 1,43
170,Mr HUME COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"Whab Capbain Creswell says furnishes an answer bo the Prime Minister's inberjecbion. He saysShips of the Royal navy may be called upon bo serve all over the world ; they are built, armed, and fitted accordingly. Such a ship must be able to steam great distances on end, and carry on operations away fromabase for a comparatively long time. Long distances steaming compels great coal capacity. Long absence from a base requires that ther e shall be large stowage room for stores and provisions. The whole space and tonnage of a vessel of war is roughly divided as follows :-(I ) Engine and boiler-rooms, (2) coal and stores, (3) crew's space, (4) guns arfd ammunition, (5) armour. Tonnage being limited, none of the space under the above headings can be increased unless at the expense of the others. To increase coal stores and armour would be to decrease engine-room and boiler or crew's space. Ships of the Royal navy, being designed to steam great distances, and to be absent from their base for long periods, a very large proportion of the tonnage is set aside for coal and stores. This compels reduction in armament, aud they are therefore very lightly armed in proportion to bheir tonnage. Service in Australian waters would not be at any greab distance from a base ; all ports would be open to our ships for replenishing their coal. The generous allowance of space or tonnage for coal and stores (especially for stores), required by theBritish cruisers, would be unnecessary for Ausbralian service. By udapbing our design to the favouring conditions of a long coast-line with many coaling ports we can reduce the coal and stores Space, and increase largely armament and gun power. There can be no greater waste than to carry hundreds of tons of coal and stores more than necessary. Gun power can, therefore, be so largely increased in an Australian ship that she would be equal to a ship twice her tonnage. Besides greater fighting efficiency there is a large economy in purchase-money, maintenance, and up-keep of the smaller vessel. The answer to the Prime Minister's interjection is, as I have indicated, partly to be found in thab sbabemenb. Ib is also bo be found, in the obher parb,- in whab is recommended by men like Capbain Mahon, Sir Peber Scrabchley, and Admiral Tryon, all of whom have suggested thab whab we need is a class of ships wibh comparatively small store-space, and greater armament and guupower, to be backed up by torpedo boats, thab would harass an enemy that attempted to atback our porbs and harbors. I have almost concluded whab I have to say on this subject; but, to summarize, what we require, as far as I able bo judge, is a combination of leasing and of purchase, in order bo begin our own navy. We require a special bype of ships, effective for the defence of Australia herself and her inberests, and nob the same type of ship as Greab Britain generally builds for service in all parts of the world, which in consequence lose something in armament and gun-power.",43
171,Mr SAWERS,SUGAR BONUS,What would they cost't,44
172,Mr HUME COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"The authority from, whom I am quoting says that while a batble-ship would cosb a million of money, the cosb of the class of vessel which Australia would require would be from Â£250,000 bo 6 E 2 Â£300,000. I bake ib bhat if we reduce our expendibure in connection wibh milibary mabters, we can afford to purchase one of these ships every year or bwo.",44
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,In the meantime whab aboub our defence ?,44
174,Mr HUMECOOK,SUGAR BONUS,I have already said we could lease more ships for defending our coasbs.,44
175,Mr CAMERON,SUGAR BONUS,Does the honourable member know that Greab Britain would be willing to lease them to us t,44
176,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,It has never been done yet.,44
177,Mr HUMECOOK,SUGAR BONUS,I presume that she would lease them if we were prepared bo pay for bhem.,44
178,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,Grea b Britain does not keep a time-paymenb furnibure shop.,44
179,Mr HUME COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"The more we were prepared to pay the greater value we should get for the money expended. We are now paying for services rendered. If it is not leasing, it is something pretty well akin to it ; but I only suggest the word ""leasing"" as being perhaps something a little different from what this agreement proposes, and in order to avoid confusion. Under a leasing system we should absolutely control the ships on the Australian station, whereas under this agreement we have no voice in their control. I wish also bo say that my position with regard to this agreement is not merely a selfish position. I oppose ib, albhough I agree wibh the Prime Minister when he said bhat we oughb nob lightly to pass over our obligations bo the mother country and bo the Empire bo which we belong. I do not desire bo do anybhing of the kind. To my mind, the question is how we can best carry oub our obligations bo the mother counbry, how besb maintain the Empire as a whole, and how besb, having a thought to these things, defend our own shores against invasion and attack. It seems to me that the principles and the plan which I have laid down best serve that end. I cannot see thab anybhing less would be satisfactory to Australia. I think, too, that ib is the only way in which to sbimulabe pabriotism which, in circumstances such as the agreement dictabes, mighb never have the opporbuniby which otherwise would offer. Vice-Admiral Penrose Fitzgerald dealing wibh bhis subjecb in the Spectator on 7bb December, 1901, saidBub what appears to me bo be the cardinal defect in the presenb plan is thab the ships are not Australian ships, that they do notflyan Australian Hag, and the officers and men do not wear a distinctively Australian uniform such as the troops wear. These are not the words of a man who is a republican or of one who wishes the Empire ill . They are the words of an admiral in the British Navy, who declares that what Australia requires is something akin to the plan which I have been endeavouring to map out. She requires to give every opportunity to her own citizens because, as I believe, she is willing to undertake her own defence.",44
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"It is very interesting .to know of these ideas, but it would also be interesting to know what it would cost to carry them out.",45
181,Mr HUME COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"Thes e questions must necessarily involve the further consideration of how far we are prepared to go in the matter of expense. I do not think it is proper in the course of a second reading debate to enter upon the full details of proposals of this k in d; but I have endeavoured to point out in a general way that I consider first of all that we have neglected expert advice, that we have consistently and persistently built up - the military arm of our defences at the expense of the naval arm, although the - naval - arm is the more important. It is undoubtedly more important, because any attack to which Australia is likely to be subject must come from oversea. I think that we require less military and more naval expenditure, and that by .reducing our military outlay we should be able to find sufficient funds to increase and strengthen our naval defence, without imposing an additional penny of taxation upon the people of this country. B y adopting that course, we should give greater satisfaction to the people of Australia and to the Empire as a whole, while we should also give a greater stimulus to patriotism by opening up wider avenues of employment than would be available under the terms of this agreement. If we divide the duties in the way I have suggested - if Australia takes upon herself the duty of maintaining these lands for the British race, and if Canada, New Zealand, and other British possessions, follow the same lines, the Empire as a whole undertaking to keep open and to preserve all the trade routes and ocean highways over which the surplus population of Britain is to flow to these distant possessions, and through which trade and commerce is to flow back to her-rthe n we shall really specialise in such . a way as to improve the defence of the Empire, and to make its indivisibility surer than it will be under the terms of this agreement.",45
182,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS," We have had some very able and elaborate speeches on this subject, andtherefore I do not intend to detain the House at any great length. What I have to say to-night will be perhaps largely a repetition of the views I have expressed at different times as well as of those which have been put forward by other honourable members. . I desire to say at once that I have every sympathy with those who wish to see the development of an Australian Navy. Some time ago, during the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Defence Bill , I drew the attention of the House to the cost which the proposition involved, and with all respect to the - opinion of certain gentlemen connected with the colonial navies, I do not think that they have' yet dissipated the fear that it is almost impossible to look forward to the immediate establishment of an Australian Navy. I read with a great degree of interest the paper presented to the Government by Captain Creswell, and also that read before the Colonial Institute by Senator Matheson, which apparently was largely founded upon Captain Creswell's estimates. It does not appear to me that the accuracy of the calculations as to the preliminary cost of the construction, or the maintenance of such a squadron as Captain Creswell contemplates, has been sufficiently demonstrated to enable us to take up the matter. It seems to me that if at a later stage we have a Government in power which supports the sentiment of an Australian Navy, it will be desirable for them to institute some form of inquiry by experts as to the cost of establishing such a navy and as to the time within which the scheme could be carried out. Unfortunately it appears that we have in power a Government which is distinctly opposed to the idea of an Australian Navy. It is not merely that they are unwilling at present to initiate such a project, because they see financial difficulties staring them in the face; but according to the statement made a few nights ago by the Prime Minister, he has no sympathy with the proposal that we should have a separate navy. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence within the last few days have made statements to that effect in the House. They are influenced by the theory that we, as part of the British Empire, must join forces with, and practically merge our naval defence, in the general defence of the Empire. I for one do not agree with that idea. I was quite prepared to support the previous agreement, on the understanding that it was merelv a tentative - one, to operate until we should be i u a position to do something towards the - creation of a navy of our own. I regret to say, however, that the present Ministry - seem to be imbued with a very different feeling. The Prime Minister said that the - suggestion that the contribution from.Australia should go towards the creation of a - fleet that would work as one, to meet an enemy wherever it might be most advantageous to do so, was the idea which he - entertained before he left Australia, and we know that that same opinion was put forward very strongly by the Minister for Defence in the minute that he forwarded to the Prime Minister just prior to his - departure for London. I do ""not look at this matter as one who is desirous of immediately bringing into existence an Australian Navy, because, after all, the most that we could hope to do for some considerable time would be to bring a small squadron into existence. As the result - of every inquiry I have made, the fact has been brought home to my mind with .greater force every day, that it is impossible to look to the adequate defence of Australia by any one squadron. I learn from Brassey's Naval Annual that, during the last British naval evolutions, Admiral Wilson, who was in command of the attacking squadron in the English Channel, was able, in spite of the fact that a fleet, numerically stronger than his own, was on the look-out for him in the same waters, to proceed without molestation over a distance of over 170 miles, to relieve . some of his torpedo boats and destroyers that were shut up in Alderney, and. to return over the same route, without even being sighted by the defending fleet. The moral of that incident is that it is idle to imagine that any one squadron would be able to .defend Australia, or to offer anything like a show of defence, against the attack of even a few raiding cruisers; because, whilst the combined squadron would be able to dispose of them Mr JOSE PH COOK - That is an argument rather in favour of this agreement, which provides for three squadrons.",45
183,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"Surely the honourable member is overreaching himself. The agreement does not provide for the continued presence of even one squadron in Australian waters. That is where the honourable member is in error. It provides for the presence of three squadrons in Australian-Chinese waters; but it does not provide that they shall be on this coast when they are required. It seems to me that that is a very material difference. The point I was endeavouring to make was that it is impossible to expect that any one squadron would be able to adequately protect us from raiding cruisers. I think it is also impossible to expect that any squadron in these waters would be so # strong that, even if it were cut up into sections, any one of those sections would be able to cope with a possible enenry. If that be so, we have then to look to what is the next best means of defence. I for one think that we shall have to expend a very considerable sum upon our ports and harbour defences and such like works, before we shall be able to believe that anything like adequate protection is afforded to our shipping and commercial interests. We have at the same time to undertake a very considerable expenditure upon military equipments. We have the contention of those in authority today-that, with but very few exceptions, all the field-guns in Australia are obsolete, and that in the event of war they would be of no value. We have also the admission on the part of the Minister for Defence that until recently we had only some 13,000 magazine rifles in Australia. We have now a further, instalment of some 7,000 . of these rifles; but I contend that even the total number is wholly insufficient, having regai-d to the fact that the rifles have to be distributed over the whole area of Australia. In addition to that fact, if we are to have an enlightened administration of the Defence Department, we require one if not two ammunition and small arms factories in the Commonwealth. We shall probably require more than that number. That, again, must lead to expenditure. In my belief, if the Government have a proper regard for even that portion of the defence of Australia which can be achieved by' means of land forces, they will have to spend, during the next few years, at least Â£250,000 per annum-in addition to what is now being expended on our forces-in the acquirement of up-to-date armament and equipment. I know that the members of the party to which I belong have been taunted with a cheese-paring policy in regard to defence.",46
184,Mr FOWLER,SUGAR BONUS,They say .we spend too much.,47
185,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"Kyabra m charges us with spending too much, while others say that we are too economical in the matter of military expenditure. Mr J OSEPH COOK - They will no longer be able to say that of the honourable member.",47
186,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"I object to extravagant expenditure upon matters connected with the military forces that are not essential. That is the point. In the past we have spent vast sums upon the training of a more or less efficient number of men, but we have made no provision for arms for them or for supplying them with ammunition. That is a most wasteful and wickedly extravagant expenditure.",47
187,Mr MCCAY,SUGAR BONUS,And we have made no pronight. vision for field equipment of any kind.,47
188,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"So the honourable and learned member has informed me. I do not pretend to speak for the other members of the labour party, but personally I should have no objection to a reasonably large vote to place the equipment of our forces upon a satisfactory footing. I would sooner vote for the expenditure of Â£1,000,000 in providing guns and rifles than for the expenditure of Â£100,000 in training men who had no rifles to use. That is the. way in which the matter appears to me. To get back to the subject immediately at issue, if we are to expend that large sum upon a purely ""military or semi-military establishment of defence; if we are to thoroughly arm and equip our troops, to thoroughly defend by guns of position the various ports and harbors and coaling bases, by furnishing them with torpedo and other available defences of a naval though not of a seagoing character, is it likely that at the same time we can get from the taxpayers a sufficient amount to instal a fleet for Australia? I do not think we can. Jf we have to choose between the two evils of doing without a fleet, and of doing without adequate local defence on land and of a semi-naval character, I for one say that we should choose to do without a small naval squadron, because I contend that we cannot get adequate protection from any one squadron. There is another aspect of this question, which, in present circumstances, .appears to me even to transcend in importance the considerations to which I have already referred. While a number of us-and , I think, a large proportion of the people of Australia/-ar e quite prepared to continue the old agreement, or an agreement on the basis of the old one, pending an opportunity to establish an Australian Navy, we find that the Prime Minister, animated by the spirit of a new-born Imperialism-whic h seems to me to be a rather dangerous element to animate a gentleman representing such a small fraction of the total white population of the British Empire-has , in this instance, tentatively agreed to an arrangement by which we altogether lose the control of a fleet that formerly had some special Australian significance. I listened with a great deal of pleasure to the remarks of the right honourable the. leader of the Opposition on Thursday In a way in which few in this House or in Australia could have dealt with the subject, the right honourable gentleman put the objections to the agreement as at present formulated and submitted to this Chamber. He pointed to the gradual evolution, as he termed it, of this extravagance of Imperialism that was altering the old agreement into the shape of the one now proposed, from a provision for an Australian squadron to a provision for a tribute to the general naval strength of the Empire. I admired exceedingly the clear and concise manner in which that new aspect of the question was explained, and I was correspondingly astonished when I found that, notwithstanding all these considerations, the right honourable gentleman was still going to vote for the Bill .",47
189,Mr OMALLEY,SUGAR BONUS,I think the light honourable member made a mistake.,47
190,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"I think he did make a mistake. I think that any honourable member of this House who holds opinions so strongly adverse to the spirit in which the proposed agreement is framed, is indeed making an error when he allows any consideration to weigh with him ingivinghis vote for it, and for this reason : That every vote given in favour of thisproposal will be taken as expressing an approval of the spirit in which the proposal is framed, and it will be an encouragement for those who have engineered the present undertaking to go a little further in the same direction when the opportunity presents itself.",47
191,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"Why use the term ""engineer "" ?",48
192,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"I use it deliberately. I submit that the people of Australia are not behind the extension and expansion of this agreement. In view of the imminence of the elections, and the fact that we must go before the country in a very short time, I say it is a proper thing that the people of Australia should have an, opportunity of expressing either by a direct referendum, or through the members whom they will elect to this House) their opinion upon the subject before this agreement is ratified. I say most distinctly that if this agreement is carried, the squadron supplied will have - ceased to be an Australian Squadron. It will be no longer one upon which the people of Australia can rely in the slightest - degree for their coastal defence.",48
193,Mr SAWERS,SUGAR BONUS,We shall get our money's worth anyhow.,48
194,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"That is a matter of opinion. If the honourable member for New England believes that we have a right to make a general contribution towards the British Navy, apart from Australian defence, he is welcome to that belief, and I have no quarrel with him, although personally I do not agree with such a view. I agree rather with the attitude which Canada has taken up. The Prime Minister said a few nights ago, when Canada was mentioned in connection with this agreement, ""Although the - Canadian Ministers have not agreed to this plan, I find signs of weakening. I spoke in Canada on the broad Imperial aspect and received the greatest encouragement."" That is roughly what the right honourable gentleman said. But I find that so far from there being any alteration in the attitude of the Canadian Ministry since the holding of the conference in London after the - Coronation festivities-- ",48
195,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,I never suggested that there was any alteration on their part.,48
196,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"On e might imagine from the importance attached by the right honourable gentleman to the influence of his speeches in Canada that the Ministers of the Dominion had caved in as a result of what he had to say. But instead of that I find that Sir William Mulock, speaking on behalf of the Canadian Government at a gathering of the Empire League, on just such an occasion as we can imagine he would be expected to voice the opinions of the Ministry of which he was a .member, is reported to have spoken as followsHe first deprecated the idea of nations engaging in an exhaustive process.of a war of armaments, and thought the policy of disarmament would better contribute to the peace of the world, leaving nations to rest the justice of their cause to a large extent upon the public conscience. Of course, in anything he had said, he did not mean to convey the idea that Canada should not make preparation for self-defence. And this is what I particularly desire to direct the attention of honourable members toHe thought, however, that Canada would best serve the cause of Empire and its own interest as well by populating its vacant lands and developing the country rather than voting millions for military purposes. That is a report of the speech appearing in the Toronto Globe of 26th May last.",48
197,Mr BATCHELOR,SUGAR BONUS,He would be called a pro-Boer out here for that.,48
198,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"He is classed there as a patriotic statesman, and as he was one of those who assisted Great Britain in South Africa a little time ago, I do not Suppose that it is any feeling of disloyalty which causes Sir William Mulock and the members of the Ministry of which he is a member to take that view.",48
199,Mr SAWERS,SUGAR BONUS,-The difficulty of Canada is not from the sea. She has a very large frontier to defend.,48
200,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"Canad a has just as great difficulties to face, so far as the sea is concerned, as we have. She has a greater trade anda big coast line, I do not know whether it is as extensive as ours, but she is also much closer to the bases of the navies likely to attack her. Certainly Canada's case so far as that is concerned is in my opinion worse than ours. Notwithstanding that, so far as the contribution to the main Imperial Navy is concerned, Canada takes up the attitude that it is not her duty as a portion of the Empire to contribute in that fashion. Getting back to the apparent suggestion of the honourable member for New England, I say that if the honourable member holds the view that we have a right to contribute to the general up-keep of the British Navy as an institution, I, for one, dissent from that view. I say that even as most loyal subprovision jects of the Empire, and desiring, as we-all should, to see the Empire extended in all leason and developed to the utmost possible saved. extent, it is still no part of our duty to help forward or maintain the British Navy as a n . Mr WATSON institution. It is, however, our that those responsible at the head of the Empire are not placed in a position of anxiety because of our inability or lingness to defend ourselves when the Empire is in trouble. It is our duty to keep ourselves free from any possibility of succonsulted cessful attack. I am quite prepared to anything I can in order to secure that object. Our duty of defence, it seems me, is to secure, so far as possible and ticable, the immunity of our own shipping and our own ports. To say that we should take part in a general movement for the expansion of the Empire and for the mainbefore tenance of the British Navy, no matter what aspect the navy may take or to what extent it may grow, is to put forward a view with which only a comparatively small section of the, peqple of Australia will sympathize. Just imagine what those who take up a position of that sort undertake. If we are equally interested with the people of Great Britain in the maintenance of the British Navy, then it is not enough that should contribute Is. per head towards it, but we should rather contribute a fair proAustralia portion on that basis, which is 17s. 6d. head. I ask the honourable member for New England and other honourable memsulted. I movebers who support the view to which he has given expression, if they are prepared to go before their constituents and that seven-eighths of Â£ 1 per head should be raised annually in order that they may tribute their share to the up-keep of the tish Navy? I say it is meanness on the part honourable members to say that we are. for an equal contribution, that we have same liability, and yet are not prepared meet it. I say we are not prepared to it.",48
201,Mr SAWERS,SUGAR BONUS,No one said that Ausas tralians are equally interested with the people of Great Britain : but to some extent they are similarly interested.,49
202,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"Then the whole case is given away. If we are not equally liable and 'have not the same general interest, that we can reasonably be expected to do to provide for our own defence. But I say that this agreement goes far beyond for Australian defence, and it leaves us just when a crisis arrives at the mercy of the enemies from whom we desire to be=",49

204,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,F e a r of the Chinese was the inducement used the last time the unwilagreement was before Australia.,49
205,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"J u s t so. I say that the people of Australia have a right to be in regard to this matter. I cando not conceive that any honourable memberson either side will object to that being to done. Even the Prime Minister himself pracmust admit, as has been pointed out by the right honourable the leader of the Opposition, that this agreement constitutes a very wide departure from anything of the sort entertained. A little time ago the right honourable the Minister for Defence quoted myself as being in favour of a per-' petuation of the existing agreement. There is, however, no use in making such quotations, because it might as well be said thab those of us who hold that view are bound to support any agreement, though it may befor the maintenance of a navy in the Arcti c regions. I say that that does not bind uswe at all. We are in the position, it seems tome, of having to justify to the people of a departure altogether foreign to per anything they previously contemplated, and upon which they have never yet been conafterThat the word ""now' ' be omitted, and thab the word "" time "" the words "" on this dayrecommend six months "" be added.'",49
206,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS," Thus far conthere has been a total absence of acrimony Briin connection with this debate. This quesof tion has no individual aspect, and each liable honourable member who has spoken has the placed himself on solid ground by exto pressing the view that the question we meet are considering is not one of loyalty, but of mebhod. Therefore, all who hold, I do, the view that ib would be disasbrous bo Australia to divide Imperial and Australian inberesbs so far as the navy is. concerned, sbill are prepared bo concede that bhose who hold diamebrically opposite opinions are loyal to the Empire. A debate all of this kind should not degenerate into a. is discussion of motives. I agree with the view expressed by the leader of the Opposia tion that loyalby does nob depend upon public protestations. Every man who has been long in public life knows that some the most loyal speeches ever delivered uttered by the greatest rascals in the munity. It is essential for men who value seat in Parliament, perhaps more highly than their own honour, to secure votes nefarious ways, and they are prepared make patriotic speeches to delude the munity, and to thus secure some supportthe necessary residue of votes being obtained - because of their known private opinions-one section of the support being obtained public protestation, and the other by secret connivance. Therefore, there is no need for protestations of loyalty in connection a question of this kind. As with a man's honour, we take loyalty for granted. As the case of other things in politics, so it .with loyalty. Some of the ablest speeches are made by men . who have no beand lief in the views the}' are expressing. - desire to direct attention to the statemaintain ment made by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, which was to a certain extent an echo of the views expressed by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. Both these honourable and learned members contended that beevery cause experts had expressed certain views we should be absolutely guided thereby. I take it for granted, however, that resolves no man would ever accept the opinion of an expert in regard to anything to beyond a certain point. An expert's opinion witli regard to the navy or anything else only of special value if the expert himself is possessed of rare ability. Training cannot entitle a man to express an authorato tative opinion. A number of men who Our have been connected with the navy, and who have ottered advice with regard to it, - have owed their positions in that service an accident of birth or some other equally fortuitous circumstance. When we find perts of rare ability with receptive brains, able to embrace new ideas and to argue logically, we are justified in attaching value to their conclusions, but it is useless to the ordinary expert. Works of construclaid tion, such as railways and harbors, strew the face of the world as monuments of - error, on the part of experts. A business man requires, the expert to make clear views, and to show that the basis of his - conclusions is sound before giving his herence. If, however, we are called upon consider the opinions of experts, why should we pay special regard to those which appiy of not to latter day conditions, but to a were state of affairs which has changed. If comwe have forced upon us the opinions of a experts concerning the Admiralty, why not accept those of the present day? If in an able expert gave an opinion twenty to years ago, and another equally able excompressed an opinion today, we should prefer to be guided by the latter. The opinions of the Admiralty experts of today are in favour of the proposal before us, by which virtually contemplates that there shall be no separation of Australian and Imperial interests so far as the Navy is conwith cerned'. Every honourable member who has spoken has granted that there must be no in separation of Imperial and Australian inis terests generally. It has been conceded by all that if Britain goes down, we must go down, that if the British Navy loses its power I we cannot stand. We could not hope to an independent position among the nations without the aid of Great Britain. Every man desires to preserve, as far as he can, the bonds of kinship and affection, not only with the British people, but with those of America and others of our own race in part of the world. That is the end we should have in view. Therefore, it may be plausibly argued that the whole question itself into one of method. The first argument with which we are brought face face in connection with the opposition to this measure - is that based upon the fact is that we have an Australian Army, which, it will be granted at once, has done good alone work-betterr work than we had a right expect from the training it has received. men did well in the forefront of battle, because they were possessed of that acumen may and intelligence which was bred in them to from having to rely upon themselves in their struggles with nature in this vast continent. exNaturallj' we are proud of our army. It has been argued that as we have an army that has done so well, we should also have a navy. None of the authorities either of afew quote decades ago, or of the present day, have it down that the Army and the Navy should be considered from the same standpoint."" The main duty of the Army in Australia is to remain at home; its main work his being very much that of a garrison in a fortress, namely, to protect the country and adto destroy the enemy, should he reach here. to The object of the Navy, however, is to seek I the enemy and destroy him wherever he may be found. Some - rather homely examples have been used in connection with this debate, and I will give one which strikes me as fairly applying to the relative positions of the Army and the Navy. When rats are known to infest certain houses their destruction is brought about by the use of traps and cats. The trap is placed in some sequestered spot that it is presumed will be visited by the rat. The rat may not go there, but if he does he is offered such inducements that he will probably remain. The cat, on the other hand, instead of being stationary like the trap, travels from the basement to the ceiling:-anywher e that the rat is likely to be found. The usefulness of the trap depends, so to speak, upon the volition of the rat, whereas the effectiveness of the cat as a destructive agent depends upon its own volition. Thus the Army remains at home to destroy the enemy should he land i/n our shores after having escaped our cruisers abroad. The Navy, however, goes out into the blue water to find the enemy no matter where he may be and to destroy him there. Sincean Australian Navy would have to work in concert with the Imperial Navy it could not stay at home. The honourable member for Bland has pointed out the vast extent of the water-way surrounding Australia. Our Navy must go out to fight, and that is why the honourable member contends that we cannot afford to build an Australian Navy commensurate with the work which it would have to perform.",49
207,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,Not at present.,51
208,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"But if we cannot have an Australian Navy, we should provide for the next best thing. The honourable member proposes to do nothing.",51
209,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,We propose to do a great deal.,51
210,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"However , it must parent that the control of the Navy, working, as it will, with a world-wide responsibility, and with a world-wide scope, must be different from that of the Army. I need not labour the question, order to prove that which must be apmaintenance parent to every"" honourable member as truism. The proposal now before us is give Â£200,000 as a contribution or tribute to the British Navy. The best way in equally which we can look at this question is by considering what would be secured to us by the expenditure of that sum in that asked way, and, on the other hand, what we that should get by the expenditure of that sura upon a navy of our own. That fairly well covers 'the question of the contribution itself. I have no desire to labour' this question by quoting figures having reference to the number of war-ships, their capacity in horse-power, or anything of that kind. But for the sake of comparison I will mention the fleet at present in Australian waters-bu t which does 'notcomprise all the vessels of the Australian fleet, and is not limited to them. These include the Royal Artlvwr, Ringarooma, Tauranga, Karakatta, MUdura, Katoomba, Wallaroo, and Boomerang. These aggregate a tonnage of 18,000, with, a horse-power of 40,000. Their guns, roughly speaking, number 117, and they can }' a complement of 1,580 men. Let us endeavour to reach the crux of the; situation by means of a small sum in simple proportion. Under the new agreement it is proposed to provide us with eleven ships, so that if a complement of 1,600 men be required upon eight ships, it is obvious that the complement of the new fleet will number at least 2,000. I am leaving altogether out of consideration at this juncture the question of the training of 1,600 Australians and New Zealanders, who would form the basis of an Australian Navy. This is what England offers us for an annual contribution of Â£200,000. We are to have eleven ships kept fairly well up to date, and the crews of which will number at least 2,000 men. What would it cost us to obtain these advantages for ourselves? The initial cost of providing the ships would be from Â£2,000,000 to Â£3,000,000.  read Captain Creswell's report ?",51
211,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,Yes .  be apI member tell us that tale?,51
212,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"I repeat that between Â£2,000,000 and Â£3,000,000 would be required to - furnish a navy similar to that which Great Britain offers to provide for in an annual contribution of Â£200,000. Itswould cost at least between a Â£400,000 and Â£500,000 a year. If we are to an integral part of the Empire, as honourable members unanimously assert, if \ve areinterested witB Great Britain in the preservation of the highways to the mother country, it is apparent that the contribution for is a very small one indeed. Seeingwe desire a navy of a certain calibre,. comprising a certain number of men, and can obtain it from Great Britain for Â£200,000 a year, whereas if we ourselves we shall require to spend between Â£400,000 and Â£500,000 a year in its mainhas tenance apart from the initial expenditure nexion. of Â£2,000,000 or Â£3,000,000, I hold that we are making an. extremely good bargain.  end of ten years after having paid able Â£2,000,000 by way of naval subsidies?",51
213,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"We shall have had proserve tection for that period.

214,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,"The Prime Minister stated that only 2 per, cent, is to be voted to a sinking fund,",52
215,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"I shall deal with that aspect of the question at a later stage. Australia desires to make a cheap bargain, then never was a cheaper bargain than offered to any community. Is not this a time of cheapness ? The honourable member for Bourke spoke of the difficulty which is exthan half perienced in procuring certain rifles. I tell him that we can only get rifles for every man who desires to qualify himself to take be found. part in the defence of his country by paying the ful l price for them, with freight charges added.  to be had.",52

217,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"That is the policy of the same Minister who desires to contribute Â£200,000 annually to the naval defence Great Britain.",52
218,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"I find no fault with the "" stomach "" was not the term used. attitude taken up by the Minister for fence. My political creed renders that possible. But leaving the question of politics out of consideration, my common sense suggests that it would be unfair to so. Whatever the abilities of the Minister for Defence may be, the right honourable gentleman cannot, any more than could the Israelites of old, make bricks out The House has refused to provide him with the money necessary to purchase the reprovide it quisite number of rifles.",52
219,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,That is not correct. He never asked for straw in that con,52
220,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"The Minister thought that the money which the House voted was not sufficient for all purposes. Honormembers protest that defence is wanted, and that it is essential that we should prethe bond that exists between us and the mother country. If those protestations have basis at all, if they be prompted by any feeling of loyalty, we must do something to her, and this is the cheapest thing we can do in the cheapest time that Australia has ever known. At the present time this continent, as far as the Federal Parliament is concerned, is not being governed in keeping with ideas of economy, but of parsimony. deIf one desires to secure a "" lean-to"" in one of our country towns, or some other necessary work, he will grow weary and If grey-headed in Ins attempt to obtain it. If the proposed bargain is not a good ope this for us, seeing that the senior partner invests between Â£2,000,000 and Â£3,000,000 in the ships, in addition to paying more the annual expenditure of will maintaining them, it is difficult to know where, out of Kyabram, such a bargain is to  member's idea of making a bargain. He wants something for what he pays.",52
221,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"As a rule, I am inclined to believe that there is a little human nature even in Members of Parliament. Still, adhering to the question of costI believe it has been said in the beMaranoa district that ""money makes the ",52

223,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"Did the honourable member ever see a bulldog with his upper lip curled and his teeth showing? If so, he would know that such a dog could walk down the street a dozen times without any other dog desiring to try conclusions. It is only the dog which timorously crouches near the wall that other canines wish to attack'. Similarly when a nation breaks down, every other nation rushes into the aiena eager to fight.",53
224,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,"I knew a man took a bulldog down the street, and it got beaten nine times in one night.",53
225,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"I thought it was necessary to use a simile that honourable members would understand, and the remark of the honourable member for Kennedy shows that I was not mistaken. If we have a navy of our own we must have one which is fit to fight something, and if we have a navy we must be prepared to pay for it. What has Great Britain spent upon her navy? Â£200,000,000 at .least is the value of the British Navy today, the yearly expenditure upon which amounts to from Â£35,000,000 to Â£39,000,000. That is the cost of the Navy which Great Britain has built for her defence and our own-for the protection of the man by the banks of the Yarra just as much as for that of the man by the banks of the Clyde. It is obvious that honourable members do not desire to spend Â£200,000,000 in the building of an Australian navy which could meet that of England. It is not necessary to go into details regarding the navies of Germany, Russia, or Prance, but, speaking generally, the naval strength of each of those powers is about one-half or one-third thab of Great Bribain. Their cosb bherefore would represenb possibly approximabely Â£100,000,000. if we decide bo esbablish an Ausbralian navy we cannob meet the navies of bhese nabions.

228,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"If I pay abbenbioft bo every inberjecbion I shall be led off bhethread of my argument Bub the reply bo the honourable member is that England might as well have met her enemies in the who - Transvaal as anywhere else. During the course of his remarks the honourable member for Bourke made some reference bo Chinese junks. I ask-""Can we build an Australian navy which will be fit to meet bhat of Japan?"" The Japanese navy must have cost at leasb Â£20,000,000, and the expense of ibs. maintenance and improvement cannot be less bhan Â£3,000,000 or Â£4,000,000annually.

Some honourable membersmay ask why ib is - if ib be truethat Australia is in danger because shedoes nob possess a navy-bha b Brazil and the Argentine Republics are nob in similar danger. The answer is that they are nob exposed bo danger for the besb. of all reasons, namely that the moment any European power interfered with thembhe Monroe doctrine would stand as a barrier in its way. No foreign powerwould dare to run up its Hag in any part of South America, because if it did so the wealth, prestige, and power, of the UnitedStates would be found behind even the smallest of the South American Republics.",53

232,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"If honourable members will look into this matter they will see that this would be about the capacity of a navy costing Â£200,000. I am taking it for granted that honourable members do not desire to increase taxation, that they wish to tell the people of Australia that they willnot spend more money for defence purposes than is absolutely necessary at the present juncture. If that be so, instead of devoting this money to Imperial purposes",54
233,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,The honourable member is the only speaker who has admitted that the money is to be voted for Imperial purposes.,54
234,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,I grant that it is to be voted for Imperial purposes.,54
235,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,And not in . the terests of Australia.,54
236,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"And specially rests of Australia. I see no difference between Imperial and Australian interests in this case. I regard the future of Australia, except as part of the British absolutely and utterly hopeless. Those who are unwilling to agree to this contribution, and tell us that the money should be tions used to build an' Australian Navy, are talking absolute rubbish. Nothing can be done with Â£200,000 in the building of war vessels. This is how the case stands : Great Britain has spent Â£200,000,000, ab least, building her Navy. Australia has made, and is to make, no contribution to initial cosb. Bub if our inberesbs are bound upjwith bhose of Greab Bribain, if ib would mean ruin bo us if Greab Bribain wenb down, oughb we nob to contribube bo the mainbe tenance of the Navy ?

238,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,This Parliamenb is not being asked for a larger conbribubion. We cannob discuss the questions that were placed before the Conference in England ; we can deal with the matter only as it has been placed before us. Two hundred thousand pounds is an amount which is a mere nothing inin the expenditure of Great Bribain. I look upon ib more as a vobe bo show our sympabhy in the inte- - wibh the mobher counbry.,54
239,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,"On the honourable member's line of reasoning the presenb conbribubion of Â£106,000 per annum is sufficient bo Empire, as show our sympabhy.",54
240,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"The contribution that we are now asked for is so small, and the addito the fleeb so large, that the arrangemenb is a very cheap one for us, and much more satisfactory bhan the old agreement to us. Australia cannob refuse bo conbribube on the ground of poverby.

Now, that leb me burn bo whab appears to me the to be the vital, and perhaps the most one plausible part of the argument of the honourable members who oppose the Bill . They claim that an Ausbralian Navy would be always on the spob. The honourable memfor Bland referred bo that aspecb of the Ib is bherefore reasonable bo ask, in parb of Australia will the Ausbralian ib Navy always be found? The people of Sydney have visions of ib desbroying the enemy righb comigainsb Porb Denison. The people of Mel- , oourne imagine that a bloody babble will be foughb on the pellucid waters of the Yarra. The South. Australians expect that an engagement will take place in Largs Bay; adjoining the precincts of the evangelical, city of Adelaide, while the Western Australians imagine that the squadron will always be found off Freraantle, at the mouth of that magnificent streamlet, the Swan. Every coastal village and seaport town has the fantastic notion that the naval battles of the future will be fought on the adjoining ocean. Are honourable members aware that Australia has a coast line 8,000 miles in extent, so that to circumnavigate the continent is to travel as far as one-third of the distance round the world, or two-thirds of the distance to England ? Before an Australian Navy could steam once round the continent, war vessels could arrive from Africa, from India, from China, and from the Mediterranean.",54
241,Mr KENNEDY,SUGAR BONUS,Would not the same thing happen if we had vessels of the Imperial Navy here ?,55
242,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"No ; because the vessels of the Imperial Navy do not wait behindfortresses until the enemy attacks .them. They come out into the open and destroy the enemy wherever they find him. If the vessels of an Australian Navy are to wait behind fortresses, and to remain in the vicinity of the coastal cities, how many shall we require? How many will there be to protect Sydney ? How many will lie off Port Phillip? How many will be required to protect our coast and trade? It is obvious that, to keep open the highway of the sea, our ships must not wait for the enemy. Our navy must be strong enough to seek out the enemy, and destroy him wherever he may be found. That is the difference between having a navy and having a few torpedo boats or cruisers to protect our ports. essential is to control the sea by destroying the enemy. I have pointed out to honourable members that an Australian Navy could not do much in the way of patrolling and protecting our coast. Let me now put another case. Suppose that Russia had a fleet of 23 vessels somewhere south of the China Sea. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Sh e has 52 vessels there now.",55
243,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"I am taking, for the sake of argument, a problematical number. Suppose that England had twenty men-ofwar, equally armed and of the same power, and a battle was imminent. Whatever we may think of the courage of our seamen, we must admit that in modern warfare, when boats are equally armed, one cannot be perfectly sure that the Britishers will always'win. There might be six men-of-war in Australian waters, which, if they joined the British squadron, would turn the tide of battle. Would they remain skulking under the protection of the fortresses of Port Phillip or Sydney Harbor, waiting to be eatenup in detail by the conqueror? On the contrary, would not Parliament with united voice say, "" G o to the help of our allies"" ? Would not our ships, instead of being kept on the spot, be sent where they could do the best work ? Would they not be found where Australian ships and Australian men should always be found, in the forefront of battle ? Obviously this notion of an Australian Navy remaining in port rests upon a rotten foundation, and need only be dealt with in the most casual way for the whole argument to evaporate. There' are several propositions which I should like to put before the House which fairly cover the whole situation. In the first place, the agreement is a cheap one. There can be no doubt about that.  member propose to get over the difficulty which will be caused by having two rates of pay on board the boats ?",55
244,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"That is a detail which we cannot discuss now. My second proposition is that we pay nothing for deterioration. Many honourable members are, perhaps, more conversant with the historical aspect of this case than I am, and they know that in a few months during the war between the Federates and Confederates of the United States of America it was proved that the wooden warship was obsoWhat is lete. Then came the ironclad, and, almost simultaneously, the monitor. The naval world passed through two evolutions in marine architecture, and discovered the uselessness of the fleets in which they had been accustomed to put their trust, in the course of a very brief period. Some honourable members will see the enormous risk that a nation runs which puts Â£200,000,000 into her naval armaments. We escape that absolutely. It may be mean to escape it, but we do. It is cheap from that stand-point. I do not desire to speak lengthily about local matters; but take the case of the Cerberus, lying in Hobson's Bay today. Built 30 years ago, she cost Â£117,000 of good Victorian money. In her best days, she could travel at the enormous rate of 9 | miles an hour. She had good guns for that time, and what is she today ? Simply a dismantled hulk, which might as well be turned into a hen-roost. I know that it is proposed to re-arm her. It is a toss up whether it is worthwhile to do anything with the boat which cost Â£117,000. What have the authorities determined to do with her? To make her a floating fort. Every man knows the disability under which a floating fort lies. There is no elevation. A few good guns here and there, behind a few sandbags, would be of more value to Hobson's Bay than the Cerberus. There is an example of loss from the evolution in naval architecture. The vessel has ceased to be valuable, and so if an Australian Navy were built in the course of a decade or two, a similar result >vould possibly happen. We escape that j;osition. Then, no navy within our means could patrol this vast continent. It is of no use to talk aboub patrolling the continent. We have to destroy our enemy. The nexbpoint is bhat wibh the means that Australia is likely bo devote to such work, we cannot build a navy which is capable of fighting any considerable battle.  the Transvaal war, when they mounbed a 4 7-gun ab Kimberley. they could nob make anybhing ab the Cape ; bub they made guns.",55
245,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"Because they had bo. All those things were makeshifbs. There were unfortunate incidenbs which should nob have happened; provision should have been previously made. I do nob wish bhis community to find ibself unprotected on the threshold of a war. Bub we shall be absolubely unprepared, unless we adopt some such proposal as that which is submitted to us. The fifth point is that 1,600 Australians will be brained as the nucleus of an Australian force. Finally, a navy costing Â£200,000 yearly, with no provision for initial expenses, would simply expose us bo the derision of the world as a nation, unless we had the British flag behind us. These six points fairly well cover the view that I desire to submit. The honourable and learned member for Corio in his speech made some reference to the question of taxation without representation, saying that this subsidy meant taxation wibhoub represenbabion. Nobhing more ludicrous than that was ever urged in any Parliament in the world. A r e we not the representatives of the people? I frequently think that honourable members opposite misrepresent them, but speaking generally we are the representatives of the Australian people. A proposal for expenditure is submitted which we can accept or reject. Therefore, when it is passed by the Australian Parliament it cannot - be said to be taxation wibhoub representation. It is a subsidy of which the people approve in the only way possible-throug h their representatives. It might as well be said thab the Vancouver mail service, bo which we give a subsidy, means baxabion without representation.  has an idea that we are to be represented in the councils of war.",56
246,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"Tha b is foreign to the question I am discussing. When the topic of baxabion wibhoub represenbabion is spoken of, the idea that flies into the mind ab once is the unwisdom of Bribain in regard bo the United States. The greab question the colonies fought out was the principle of taxation wibhoub represenbabion. Whab were the facts? Benjamin Franklin, the accredited representative of America to London, was in close communication with men like Burke and Chatham, and we all know the Ib was said that views they took in regard to the American rebellion, or whatever it may be called. They prepared a Bill for submission to the British Parliament, and the American people approved of ib, so far as we can judge, through their accredited representative. The B i ll laid down the fact that the Americans were prepared not only to give a subsidy toBritain,'butalso bo accept the responsibilibv of a portion of the national debb of Bribain. The point ab issue was nob the voting of the subsidy, but the fact that the British Parliamenb, unwisely, refused bo recognise the local Legislatures in America in dealing wibh the question of taxation. If the"" views of Franklin, Burke, and Chatham had been accepted, there would have been no friction. Ib would have been posbponed. Ib mighb have come sooner or laber; bub bhere would have been no immediabe quarrel with the colonies : it would have passed over. This proposal comes to us exactly in the' way that men like Benjamin Franklin, the accredibed representative of the . American people, claimed that a question should go before theLegislatures of the American colonies. The - experience of America and the unwisdom of Britain, for which she paid very dearly, - affords no parallel. I wish people to remove their minds from the past. must understand that we are progressive - that Britain has learned her lesson, that all nations are learning their lesson, and instead of being today "" those - colonies"" of which they used to speak in the House of Commons, we are now the sons of the Empire. The feeling in regard to us today in all parts of the United Kingdom is as friendly and parental .as it is in regard to their own people in Britain Thus far I have dealt with the case absolutely from the stand-point that every man in this Parliament and every man in the community believes that the best interests of Australia were served by the preservation of the ties and responsibilities the mother country and us. There may, however, be some who believe that Imperial interests are so widely separated from us and so widely spread over the whole world, that we should be safer if independent. wish to say a word or two to any honourable member or to any person who believes that it is possible for Australia to go alone. AVe may fondly believe that in our great wisdom, our wonderful power, and - our great acumen, we have dealt wibh the question of white Australia. done nothing of the sort. The House has dealb as reasonably and as wisely as it could wibh only one aspecb of that question. AVe have Kanakas whom we have agreed to deport AVe passed an Resbricbion Act with one idea in viewto keep what away? - the silenb invasion of bhese people.

The men we have dealt with and warned off our shores are only the pioneers of myriads of men behind themonly the ripple thab is a forerunner of the greatest storm which the world has ever seen when the whibe man evenbually in bhese latitudes faces the yellow man in deadly war. AVe may nob see the day, bub our children will.

Wit h this war-cloud ""no bigger than a man's hand"" arising on the horizon, which will eventually burst with all its attendant horrors, for us who have developed Australia, and have children growing up, to break the only alliance that will see us through the great crucial difficulty, appears to me to be a malignant act. Australia, if she does not preserve her kinship with kindred races-Grea t Britain and America especially - wil l in the course of 100 or 200 years be simply a heap of ashes- a few embers from which are dying out the last flickers of civilization. We talk about our democratic legislation, our eight hours law, our "" white Australia,"" and what we have done for the labouring classes. We all take credit for the onward march of progress and democracy, and we value that progress. We know that the broader we lay the basis of government and representation, the more wholesome it is for the State; but if, after having done all this, we were to break the only alliance which can save us from utter destruction, it would be the work of madmen or fools, or worse than fools. W hy will not honourable members open their eyes ? Cannot they see the change coming.? Dare we warn the alien from these shores for ever unaided ? Hundreds of millions of yellow men will yet coalesce against the white man; and we shall want every particle of power which the white man has in every part of the world to save Australia from being submerged. Mr JOSE PH COOK - A terrible picture!",58
253,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"It is a true picture, nevertheless. Why have nations fought in the past? Por a little bit of land on this side or that side of a' boundary, or some triviality with regard to succession. But once racial hatred is aroused, there will be a fight to the death, and Australia will be in the maelstrom. I regard this as a qqestion so far above that of fiscal policy, or another, that it formed one great reason why, at all hazards, I desired to have Australia united - The men who have made Australia what it is will surely not separate from their kinsmen in the face of. the great troubles that are before us.",58
254,Mr SPENCE,SUGAR BONUS,"Does the honourable member think that our friendship is only worth Â£200,000 ? Does it mean separation if we do not pay ?",58
255,Mr EWING,SUGAR BONUS,"It does not mean separation, but my feeling is that it would be a singularly ungracious act to refuse to do the little we are asked to do. It is so small an amount that I cannot understand any man, while he believes in the Empire and the future of the race, refusing the request, whether he advocates an Australian Navy or not. I should like to say one word further on the question of the Australian Navy leaving our shores in time of war. There is no doubb that at such a time the navy, whether it be a purely Australian Navy or otherwise, will go away; indeed, it should not remain here if better work lay elsewhere. The men of our navy must nob skulk behind the forbress; they must go out upon the sea and do their work. The honourable and learned member for Corio, who, I have no doubt, would give a very good account of himself under any circumstances, seemed to havevisions of destroying Australia's enemies by a gallant foray down Litble Bourke-sbreeb, or a greab babtle on the side of Alberb Park Lake. Bub ib is absolubely immaberial whebher the babble be foughb 10,000 miles away, or within the precincts of our cities, so long as the enemy be desbroyed. I grant the plausibility of the argumenb that the Ausbralian Navy should be always wibh us; bub Ausbralians would nob permit the navy to remain here if there was better work to be done elsewhere. And if the navy did remain, it would be only to be eaten piecemeal by the conqueror. The best way to state a case is to give the. other side. If Great Britain were in trouble, all the ships of the Australian Navy would go to her assisbance, bhough ab besb bhere would be bub a handful. Bub if Australia were in brouble, whab would come to our assistance ? If the hand of the aggressor were laid on Australia, whab would come bo our aid ? Ships from every parb of the world ; and the vision is one bo make our blood bingle ! If Australia were in brouble bhere would be a musber of British ships bhi-eshing bheir way from the Arctic Circle, from the sweltering Caribbean, from the coasb of China, from all parbs of the world. The British Navy was nob builb for the probecbion of Bribain alone, bub for the protection of the Empire; the ships would come from Africa, from the Mediterranean, and from Britain ibself. And what a marvellous spectacle it will be if ever the fiery cross goes out to the British Navy that it is wanted in Australia. They would come with one mandate, ""Hands off; these are sons of the Empire."" The proud position of over-lord of the sea was won for Britain by the dauntless courage of our ancestors, and preserved by the. selfabnegation and self-denial of the British people ever since. This Continent of Australia was not thought of little more than a a century ago-it s very existence was doubted. B ut if the hand of the aggressor were laid on any portion of this continent we should have this mighty muster of warboats-Â£200,000,00 0 worth of iron and sbeel manned by the greabesb army the world has ever seen-rushin g bo our assisbance. No one doubbs the valour of the British tar; and it is because I have visions of the sbrengbh of Britain-becaus e I believe in the cohesive action of the navy under all circumsbances-bha b I urge that - under no circumstances ought Imperial and Ausbralian interesbs bo be divided, and that under no circumsbances oughb we to ungraciously refuse the small subsidy which is asked.",58

258,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS," I am sure that even bhose who differ from the conclusions of the honourable member for Riphmond, musb compliment him on a speech marked wibh an eloquence which he can employ when he wishes, and wibh a fervour which cerbainly justifies us in assuming an inbensiby of conviction. have unfortunately to differ from the honourable member, but I am sure that he will give me credit for quite as earnest a desire on in the direction of Imperial inbegriby. Whabever' the method we adopb for recognising our Imperial responsibilities, we are all actuated by motives which - we believe will ultimately conduce to the true consolidation of the Empire. When the honourable member was dealing with the latter part of his subject, I really could not help thinkingthattheBill-whic h I, perhaps, had not carefully read in all its details-wa s one dealing with the separation of the Empire ; because his remarks would have been quite as applicable to a proposal that the union of sentiment and of affection, with a loose political texture, which has done so much for the British race throughout the world, was to be dissolved if this Bill were not accepted by the House. I think that a request for an increased naval subsidy is really but part of the Imperial policy of the last 20 or 30 years, under which England was to become the Centre of a great world State, whose members were to become entitled to all the privileges, whilst participating' in the responsibilities, of Empire. Since the publication of works such as Seeley's lectures On The Expansion of England the ideal of a great Imperial union - with all the perfect co-relation of the parts of a highly-organized State-ha s begun to take clear shape. I believe that this Bill is really the beginning of a ful l recognition of a .deep and radical principle of a by no means salutary character; and I am therefore bound to vote against it. The idea of Seeley was expounded in his Oxford lectures. We must remember that Oxfoi'd and Cambridge are really the centres in which the first political education of the leaders of English opinion takes place. Under the conditions of electoral representation which prevailed until a few years ago, and which, to a great extent, are operative still, owing to social conditions, want of funds, and so on, those universities of ""England are the training grounds for the men who subsequently come to lead in great movements. Therefore, when we find that lectures like those by Seeley on The Expansion of England are delivered in a university, we may look, if not for an explicit adoption of them, at any. rate, for their influence in the action of those who subsequently lead in politics. Sir John Seeley's idea was this-that the day of small States has gone, and that if England is to retain her position of eminence, if not supremacy, amongst the great nations of Europe-if she is not to go down before such colossal growths as the Empire of Bussia and the German Confederation-sh e must draw the scattered members of her Empire into the unity and strength of an organic whole, and must enter into some definite form of political union with her colonies and possessions. This is the lesson taught by that celebrated work which marks an epoch in these matters-The Expansion of England. Sir John Seeley says-in fact I may express his meaning by a quotation which embodies the result of his lecturesThe lustre of Athens grew pale when Macedonia rose, and Charles V. speedily brought to an end the great days of Florence. The result has been this, first-and honourable members must have read it in the papers for the last five or six years-that the members of the Empire that were related to one another, either by geographical contiguity or by homogeniety, should be broughttogether as co-ordinatefederal groups, and that from these minor combinations was to come the ultimate Imperial federation. We have started with an Australian Federation. This was the policy of the Imperial Federation League of 1884, which had, I think, as one of its first presidentsperhaps its first-the Earl of Rosebery. There was to be some form of political union ; there was to be complete recognition in local matters of the independence of the colonies or the federated groups ; and as a beginning of complete Imperial Federation there was to be concentration, for the purpases of defence, of the various forces of the Empire. But in 1884 no doubt that proposal was premature. It was beyond the thought even of England at that time. So that the programme in 1892 was modified, and it was declared that as a beginning of political federation an advisory council should be established, but even that was a matter not completely within current politics, but for the not too near future. But as a beginning, and as leading up to Imperial Federation, there was to be unity and central control for the purposes of defence. The advisory council which was regarded as premature in 1892 is one of the recommendations of the Imperial Conference, or one of its suggestions ; because if honourable members have read the Blue-book that has been circulated amongst them they will find that it has been practically arranged that once in about every four years the Secretary of State i for the Colonies is to call the representatives of Australia, and of other parts of the Empire, together, for the purpose of consultation upon matters of Imperial moment. So that we find that this, which was regarded as premature in 1S92, has now taken definite shape; and that we have also this proposal made by the Ministry, which in combination with the advisory council, was to form- The baby figure of the giant mass Of things to come at large. How quick thought moves in these matters ! Perhaps it will be a little out of place to take Mr Chamberlain as a specimen of variability of type in politics, be very sorry to take the developments of such a protean politician as typical of the versatility of the average Englishman. But at the same time it is significant that about two or three years ago, when Mr . Hedderwick Suggested some'form of political union, of some Zollverein, Mr Chamberlain ""damned with faint praise"" in the House of Commons the idea of a Customs Union. We know what he thinks about it now. He then set up all possible forms of the Imperial union merely to, by analysis, knock them on the head. But what do we find him saying ab the Imperial Conference, according to the Blue Book which has been circulated ? He saysIn my opinion, the polibical federation Empire is within the limits of possibility ; and thab, in facb, if we book a proporbionabe share of the burdens we could have a corresponding voice in the councils of the Empire. So far as regards some leading politicians ; bub leb us go further. .Have honourable members noticed that this really is a military as well as a naval question ? Have they noticed that the Secrebary of Sbabe for AVar, Mr Brodrick, at one of the meetings of the Conference of Premiers, suggesbed that bhere should not only be unity of control and responsibility in naval mabbers, bub that the same principle should also apply bo military matters ? I can prove that this is the policy of England as expressed by leading statesmen and organs of public opinion. Mr Brodrick suggested that, following the example of Imperialistic New Zealand, which in 1900 established a reserve of a milibary characber liable bo serve in any portion of the Empire, for an expendibure of Â£180,000 a year bhere should be raised, as a Mr Glymi. beginning, wibh possibilities of subsequent development, a force of 20,000 Imperial troops - raised in the colonies for service throughout the Empire, and in the remobesb confines of ib. We bhus find that the beginnings of an Imperial policy are marked not only in naval mabbers, bub also in regard bo milibary organization. Is ib nob bherefore significant that while the Conference was sibbing in London a series of articles upon milibary organization was published in the Times, in which this idea of Mr Brodrick was also suggesbed and sbrongly advocated? Ib is all the more significanb, because the Times is generally supposed bo be named from being the I should echo of the Ministerial opinions of the day-in fact, as being-withou t being recognised as such-bh e emissary of the political thought that is responsible for the official lead of the Empire. Now to come a little closer to the Bill before us. In reference bo the concrete question, upon which we are now touching, take the opinion of Sir John Colomb, who, in 1879, published a book on The Defence of Great and Greater Britain. In that book he suggesbed that we cannob possiblyseparabe the question of naval defence from the question of Imperial representation. In facb, he scoubed the idea of any levy being made upon the colonies, excepb on a principle which would give bhem some parb in cenbral represenbation. of the B y such an experb aubhoriby as Sir John Colomb bhis Bill would have been scoubed. Whab does he say ? These are his wordsThe whole problem of defence resolves itself in practice into one of cosb ; cosb in ibs turn resolves itself into taxes; and taxes cannot be separated from representation. We are all at once brought face to face with the naked fact that Imperial representation lies at the root of the problem of Imperial defence. And he asks, supposing the position were reversed, would Greab JBribain consenb bo a conbribubion of money without a share in the control of its disposition? He saysGreab Bribain would certainly decline to pay bills for war purposes without control over the items or any voice in that question which rules the total-peac e or war. According to him, then, we may say that this Bill involves a subsidy without control; it involves, I will not say taxation, bub certainly a levy without representation. And as representation would mean a radical, and I believe pernicious and dangerous, re-arrangemenb of the political sbrucbure of the various parbs of the Empire, ib opens up bo us a far bigger question than strikes honourable members at a cursory glance at this subject. ask honourable members- "" Do they really think that this is a temporary arrangement - that the United Kingdom expects us to play with a policy of central controlwith what has been declared to be a matter of tactics leading to concentration-for a period of eight or ten years, and then, when perhaps at some crisis that policy might become affective, will allow us to drop out ?"" I say that it is a deliberate principle which they are asking us to affirm ; but because some of the colonies are strongly attached to the principle of independence in political matters, and are disinclined give up control in these affairs, to get their reluctance, a temporary arrangement is proposed. But is it to be supposed 'that it is intended that this shall be merely temporary arrangement? By'agreeing to it we may open the way to a further exclaration tension of the principle, if we may judge from the speeches of Imperial Ministers, from publications in England, from our Blue Books, and from contributions to the press. If we agree to give this in The subsidy or to affirm this principle we canlutely not hereafter, at a moment when perhaps are; danger to the Empire may thicken, with where any sense of self-respect or of honour, ask localization to be allowed to back out of it. If Parliathe ment affirmed this principle, and were to attempt to back out of it after eight or ten years, our action would appear in a very Halifax. paltry light in the eyes of the other members of the Empire. My objection to it is it involves a principle the adoption of I cannot advocate. Mr JOSE PH COOK - How could the mination of a definite agreement of this kind do anything of the kind ?",59
259,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"No doubt, technically, and on a lawyer's examination of the text, it could not do anything of the sort; but we must find out what the professed tendencies are when the suggestion made. If this principle is necessary centration, and for the efficiency of Navy, it was never contemplated that we should back down after ten years. principle is adopted, and becomes perfect throughout the other parts of the Empire, that perfectness would be marred by the withdrawal of Australia. We cannot template such a position.",62
260,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR BONUS,It does not prevent assistprinciple ance in another form.,62
261,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"No ; it does not prevent I assistance in the form which I would advocate, and which we say is the true method of keeping the Empire together. The affection that binds us to the Empire is quite "" - as potent without any political change. Distance seems to have made more perfect our relations ; the sea, which usually estranges, has made made us the better friends. What does this principle involve ? It involves one navy, one liability, and one control. Under this measure, the absolute and complete control of the fleet within the sphere of operations is vested in the Admiralty. Of course that control will be to in the hands of the Admiral of the fleet, over who in turn is subject to the control of the Admiralty at home. What does Mr Chamberlain say as regards this a policy ? I quote - him merely to show that you cannot always take a statesman's deas the measure of his action. Heaffirms the principle by which he wishes Australia to be guided, but which he hesitates to apply to the United Kingdomreal problem which the Empire has to face the case of a naval war is simply and absoto find out ""where the ships of the enemy to concentrate the greatest possible force these ships are, and to destroy these ships. . . . It follows from this that there can be no of navid forces in the strict sense of word. There can be no local allocation of ships to protect the mouth of the Thames ; to protect Liverpool; to protect Sydney ; to protect Is there a localization of ships to protect that the mouth of the Thames ? What does Sir which John Colomb say has been a necessary part of the security of the Empire ? The localizatertion of fleets for the purpose of investment in the neighbourhood of England. Those of us who have read the excellent pamphlet by Senator Matheson will have noticed that he quotes Brassey's. Naval Annual as his authority for the statement that there is certainly one squadron at Home whose is sphere of operations is confined to a for conradial distance of about 60 miles from the the United Kingdom, and whose function, according to Sir John Colomb, is, first of all, f the to prevent the cutting-off of the communications of the Empire at the centre of their convergence ; and, secondly, to protect the shores of England itself against raids or coninvasions. The principle is that there should be an Auxiliary local fleet, but the recommended to us by Mr Chamberlain is that we should have no Auxiliary fleet, for the purpose of local defence, such as is employed by every other maritime nation in Europe, but that we should simply place absolute dependence upon the successful operation of the ocean-going fleet.",62
262,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR BONUS,Because the other Continental powers are alongside England ; only a narrow strip of water separates them from her.,63
263,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"But there is no particularly narrow strip separating England from Russia, or even Germany or Southern Europe. ""We cannot say that any particular nation is on terms of antagonism, or in alliance with regard to England. The alliances vary from time to time, but this policy is continuous:",63
264,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR BONUS,But the fleets would move from the shores of England if a distant power were involved. .,63
265,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"But does not the honor- that small- ' able member think that the abandonment of all local defence would be a far greater danger to an isolated country like Australia than it would be to England ? The convergingstreamsof commerce must necessarily attract a fleet to the neighbourhood of England. I shall say one or two words presently as to the class ""of fleet that is recommended as a local one by some authorities who ought to be considered experts in this matter. The proposition of the fleet? experts to whom I refer is that you must have as your first principle an ocean-going fleet. That is a policy which has been preached in books for the last 20 or 30 vears. Sir Charles Dilke, in his Problems of Greater Britain, has pointed out time after time that the defence of English possessions may be made perfect perhaps in the Baltic-that it is by closing up the ports of exit very often that you stop the possibility of invasion by an enemy.",63
266,Mr GB EDWARDS,SUGAR BONUS,That policy is as old as Pericles.,63
267,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"That is the professed policy of great naval authorities. mentioned Sir Charles Dilke and Sir John Colomb as an indication of the class of men who have declared for this policy, which has been followed for at least 20 or 30 years. They do not rely on that policy alone. Whilst admitting all that is said as to the power of concentration at definite points, and as to blockading the ports of the enemy at the outset of a naval war, they insist that there must be an auxiliary fleet to secure perfect immunity.",63
268,Mr GB EDWARDS,SUGAR BONUS,"Does the honourable and learned member recognise that the investment of England by an enemy's fleet for three weeks would starve out the .nation, but that such an investment would not starve out Australia 1",63
269,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"What is the Channel fleet for but to prevent that possibility ? I desire to put a question to honourable members. Captain Mahan for instance, when dealing with Imperial defence, and not alone that of the defence of the United Kingdom, says that a sound defensive scheme is the foundation, but an offensive scheme is the superstructure thus joining the two ; and thatOffence therefore dominates, but does not exclude. The present Governor of Victoria, Sir George Sydenham Clarke, also admitted in 1896 raiding expeditions may evade a superior navy. Wherever national resources necessary for the purposes of war are accumulated, local means of resistance against a raid are necessary. When we find these authorities all stating definitely that we must have an auxiliary, as well as an offensive fleet, why should we be asked to accept Mr Chamberlain's suggestion that we should dispense altogether with the defence of our coast by a local",63
270,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR BONUS,Was not Sir George Clarke speaking of - forts ?,63
271,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"I do not think so. I do not think his remarks were confined to land defences. Certainly the remarks made by Captain Mahan were not, and I may come closer home by quoting a report by semi-Imperial authorities. The Conference of naval representatives which met, as the precursor of federation, in 1899, at Melbourne, recommended the very principle that the authorities I have mentioned have declared themselves in favour of. At that Conference three resolutions were I have carried. The first declared that a Royal Naval Reserve could not be raised in Australia on conditions required by the Admiralty. Those conditions included the giving of two sets of pay on the same vessel, a suggestion that has been condemned by Admiral Bowden Smith, who, speaking on the occasion of the lecture delivered before the Colonial Institute by Senator Matheson, said that to have two rates of pay on board the same vessel might lead to a mutiny of the Imperial sailors. Bub whilst the Conference declared in ibs firsb resolution that a Royal Naval B,eserve could nob be raised in Australia on conditions required by the Admiralby, ib werib on bo saybhat a naval force that would be efficienb and available For service in vessels of war, can be raised on rates of pay and conditions of service suitable bo the colonies. The next resolution was in effecb that the conbrol of such a force should be vesbed in the Federal Parliamenb, while the bhird was that the Admiralby should' provide the necessary ships, but that they should be manned by the Federal Governmenb. Ib may be said bhat the weakness of the proposal was bhat the Admiralty should provide the ships. I believe, however, that the Admiralty had expressed their willingness to do so. Ib was pointed oub in the report of the Conference that all that was really necessary could be secured by a fleeb of five vessels, at an annual expenditure of the tobal of Â£191,000 a year, bhen devobed bo naval defence by the various Sbates. That esbimabe apparenbly made no provision for inberesb on cosb of consbruction or any allowance for depreciation.",63
272,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR BONUS,No r for the higher rabes of pay bo Australians.,64
273,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"I b made provision for that, although I do not bhink ib was based upon an allowance of 5 per cent, for the cosb of the vessels; but even bhen the bobal cost would only amount to something like Â£240,000 per annum.",64
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,F o r only five ships?,64
275,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,Yes ; and that is all we should require for the purposes of local defence. We do nob need to go in for a branch of the Imperial ocean-going navy.,64
276,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR BONUS,We cerbainly require efficiency.,64
277,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"Of course we do, but",64
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,The five would nob be worth twopence wibhout the Imperial fleet around ib.,64
279,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,We might as well try to fight a pibched babble wibh outposts.,64
280,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"Does the honourable member think that by providing a local navy we should really give up all obligation on the parb of the Imperial Government to allow us a share in the immuniby from abback which is afforded by an Imperial fleeb ? Is bhat the British policy ? Does the British policy suggesb that unless we provide for our local defence the operations of the Navy will nob be permibbed to conduce bo the safeby of Australia ? No doubb that is the policy of some petty carpers in the pages of the Times; no doubt it is the policy of Mr . Loring and others who have written bo bhat journal, but is ib the policy of responsible English statesmen ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - The converse of that. policy should nob be adopted by us.",64
281,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,I b is a reasonable mean between the two.,64
282,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,Tha b is what I have suggested.,64
283,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"Not in the way of contribution. There is one paragraph in the report of the Naval Conference to which I have referred that I think is somewhat significanb. Ib sbabes bhatIb has been the invariable policy of the motherluud bo encourage all her colonies and dependencies in self-defence, to encourage the organization of forces suited bo meet and resist the particular danger to which they are exposed. The Cape, Canada, and India, are all cases in point-al l have land frontiers requiring military defence. Australia, having uo military frontier requires for her defence a sea or naval force. I consider that we should not be too ready to regard the deliberate judgment of these naval representatives of - the States, which met in 1899, as being an obsolebe or misbaken policy. Leb me again quobe Sir John Colomb upon .'bhis very point He recommends an auxiliary fleet for all parts of the Empire. 'He advocates a local fleet of small dimensions and points out thatA single cruiser bringing her guns to bear on one of our coastal depots would in a few hours paralyze the action of thefleebfor months.",64
284,Mr OMALLEY,SUGAR BONUS,Q u it e true. Look at Paul Jones in Scotland.,64
285,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"Hemention s the Alabama, and he points out thatThe danger can in several instances be met by porb defence vessels and torpedoes. A very small local force, if trained and provided with these weapons, would meet the requirements. All the maritime nations of Europe employ both methods of naval defence. They employ an ocean-going fleet, and, as the corollary of that, a local fleeb. According to Brassey's Naval Annual, in 1900, when a large expenditure was made to meet the ocean-going fleet of France, provision was also made for a corresponding increase in the fleet for local defences. It is also pointed out in Brassey's Naval Annual that a very large vote for local defence was ab the same time passed .by the French Parliament. I think it is very clearly admitted that fleets for the purpose of local coastal defence are necessary as an auxiliary to the Imperial fleets. They are, of course, different in character. The only nation, perhaps, that ever lowered the pennant of England in a naval war was that of her own children-America .",64
286,Mr CAMERON,SUGAR BONUS,What about the '.Dutch ?,65
287,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"I think that, on the whole, that is the only case where there was a final defeat of the British Navy. There may have been temporary checks, but there has not been in English history a single case in which England eventually, at the termination of a war, went down. But in the war with America there is no doubt she did. England was defeated in fifteen out of eighteen pitched naval battles with the American fleet, and authorities say that the reason was that the American fleet was founded on the principle of local defence, with armament far greater in proportion to the size of the vessels than that of the British ships, and as a consequence the British guns were completely outranged.",65
288,Mr OMALLEY,SUGAR BONUS,On l y one American squadron was defeated on Lake Erie.,65
289,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"Captain Creswell, in a report-no t the papers circulated amongst honourable members-point s out that we should treble the power of our present squadron, and he saysUniversal world service thus spells very light guns, and comparatively small fighting efficiency! The same is the opinion of Captain Mahan. In fact, Captain Creswell points out that the Wallaroo, of the existing Auxiliary Squadron, though it is in size three times that of the Protector, which we now understand is to be sold, has a gun capacity -70'per cent less. Captain Mahan, speaking upon this point, saysBy sacrificing power to go long distances, defence ships gain proportionate weight of armour-that is, defensive and offensive strength. I say, therefore, that those who are entitled to be considered experts, whether Imperial or local, are clearly of opinion that an auxiliary fleet for purposes of coastal defence is also necessary.",65
290,Mr GB EDWARDS,SUGAR BONUS,"Surpris e was pressed that the Protector, a coastal boat, should be recognised as a good boat when she went to China.",65
291,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"The Protector' is still coastal boat, and her gunsare proportionBritish ately efficient. Captain Creswell points out that, although a good type of coastal defence boat, the Protector is efficient even over distances such as that from Australia to China, and that was absolutely proved by the experience gained in getting her to the Gulf of Pechili.",65
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,Does the honourable and learned gentleman know that Captain Creswell approves of this agreement?,65
293,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"I do not attach great importance to what a person says the moment he meets the Prime Minister on his return from England. We should not take that statement in the face of two carefully prepared reports, one of which has been presented to this House, and the other to the public.",65
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,That is not saying much for Captain Creswell.,65
295,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"I know Captain Creswell personally, and I have the very highest respect for his authority, but we cannot take a casual statement made to the Prime Minister as conclusive against the tenor of a report presented to the House twelve - months ago, the tendency of which is diametrically opposite. This Imperial policy - assumes also the continued supremacy of the sea-going fleet of the Empire at every period of a war. Though one does not wish to disparage, and there is no historical justification for doing so, the prowess of the English seaman, it is the duty of the statesman to be prepared for the worse, and surely in this case. . . ' modest doubt is calFd The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches To the bottom of the worse. Since the Crimean war English naval conditions have changed. The British Navy has not been engaged in any big naval warfare - unless we consider the American war of 1861 as such-since 1854, coast in which ironclads were really brought into action. It was pointed out some j'ears ago in the pages of the Nineteenth Cem.tn.vry that the great days of English seamanship, the time when England was displaying, to the envy of the world, her marvellous prowess in seamanship, passed with the evolutions of some of her ships under the exwalls of Sebastopol. Lord Brassey states that the personnel of the English Navy is suffering - He points out that the foreign blight is upon the British Navy, and that a in 1900, 47 per cent, of the seamen on board merchant vessels were foreigners. I know that the old spirit of the British is still there just as strongly as in the days - when Campbell addressed his patriotic, apostrophe to "" Ye mariners of .England."" But surely when the proportion of British seamen drops, the efficiency must come down. There are still, no doubt, throughout the Empire men of the type of the heroes and idols of our childhood-Jac k Babblin and Tom Bowling-me n who seem to have affection been born for the sea, "" to be cradled the rude imperious surge""; but half tractiveness of the deep passed with the of the sailing ship, so that there are fewer youths led to the life by the glamour of the old conditions, and there is smaller scope for the display of those special qualities which established the unfailing supremacy the past. Though I say that, I say it as whose confidence is still unshaken in the comparative efficiency of the British seaLet man ; but we must note the tendency of times and the changed conditions, and. it the duty of statesmen, T repeat, while being confident, to be also influenced by healthy caution. I acknowledge-and I am not doing so now for the first time, because I did so in 1891 in a series of Edinburgh Reviewarticles in one of the Australian papersthe great obligations of the British Posfavour sessions to the British Navy. I acknowfound ledge that to' a great extent, if we were to eliminate local conditions of develop- merit, our contributions to the Imperial ing Defence Eund are ridiculously small. I think that of the total export and import trade of England, about one-fourth or fifth is with British Possessions, and in we are interested jointly with England. According to the latest returns there is trade with British Possessions amongst selves, and with foreign countries, that never touches the shores of the ""United Kingdom, totallingÂ£254,000,000,and which equally with the other part of the foreign trade of the Empire secures the prowhich tection of the British fleet. But what are the figures 1 If we take the white population of the Empire to be 50,000,000, and the naval estimate for 1901-2 as have referredÂ£32,000,000, we find that we pay in Australia about 6Â£d. per head, on the basis of the Â£106,000 contribution, to the deimmediately fences of the Empire; and the whole of the British possessions outside of the United Kingdom, inclusive of ourselves, only 4d. per head. I acknowledge also we have a very strong impulse of affection, apart altogether from the baser monetary considerations, to join in the naval defence of the Empire. We are parts of a mighty system whose members are invigorated by the pulsations of the little heart at home. The circulation may be slower and more fitful at the extremities, but the quality of the blood reaches us still, and we must, to some extent, feel the promptings of the ties of and the instincts of the old race, in inducing us to make larger contrithe atbutions to the monetary expenditure era upon the sources of Imperial defence. now But with me it is not any faltering recognition of the obligation; it is merely a question of the most efficacious method, and of the one which suits the conof ditions of Australia equally with those of one England. Upon this point let us not look only toan insularopinion or a local authority. us take some journals whose authority the will be generally recognised, some periis odicals of power in the United Kingdom. I take, for instance, the Spectator, the Monthly a Review, the Edinburgh Review, and all strongly advocate the method of .contribution by local defence. To quote only the A strong movement exists in Australia in of obtaining control of the navy, and ib expression, we believe, at the Colonial Conference. The tendency is inevitable. State sovereignty is inextricably bound up wibh military power. No colony can be really self-govern which has not also control of ibs own forces. The Spectator gives a whole-hearted adherence to the method of which I am an oneadvocabe, as one of bhose who support that the principle of. local defence. I mentioned the polibical bendency and the a ulbimabe polibical development to which this themmust lead as regards contributions. We have heard about this paltry contribution of Â£200,000, but this, according to the authoritative sbabeinenb of Imperial Minisbers, is simply bub a modesb beginning of a policy is bo be subsequenbly developed. Leb us see whab was said by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. It will be found at page 5 of the Blue Book, to which I ' The disproportion to which I have called your abbenbion cannob, under any circumstances, be remedied, but 1 think that something may be done- I hope that something may bo done-c o recognise more effectually than' has hitherbo been done, the obligation of all to concontribute tribute to the commonweal. that The right honourable gentleman says there that he does nob bhink it can be immediabely remedied. These remarks were made on a I proposal that bhere should be a paymenb of Â£387,000 a year as the contribution of Australia.",65
296,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,No such proposal had been made then.,67
297,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,That was the suggestion of Earl Selbome.,67
298,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"That was made afterwards, and not before Mr Chamberlain had spoken.",67
299,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"I know that I read it i the papers, and it appeared made before Mr Chamberlain spoke.",67
300,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,I heard nothing of it.,67
301,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"The Prime Minister w i recognise that that suggestion was made the Earl of Selborne, who did not come down to the Conference without some understandwhich ing with the other representatives of Imperial Cabinet. He came there to speak as the representative - of the Admiralty, and the suggestion he made was that payment should-be Â£387,000 a year as our share of a sum of Â£467,000 a year, includcating ing the contribution from New Zealand. That was the commencement agreed upon to be recommended to the Premiers of the self-governing colonies at the Conference. Take the Times, which, as I have said, is a large extent the echo of British Ministhe terial policyPerhaps from these modest beginings quate and equitable system of Imperial defencewould may some day be evolved. Is not this a declaration of a tendency some day must be developed. These are the modest beginnings-the proposal for the payment of Â£200,000-bu t what will they mean hereafter ? The increasing naval expenditure will be beyond our control. The Naval Estimates for 1890 amounted to Â£14,000,000. In 1900 they had crept up to Â£29,000,000; in 1903 to"" Â£34,000,000 and if I am not mistaken I saw a telegram last week to the effect that owing to the new outlay upon ships the total - next year will probably be Â£39,000,000. cost Â£367,000. The statistician of the Board of Trade declared two years ago in the Nineteenth tury that the immunity which England clude the other. should have against invasion and the power of protecting her communications could be met by a smaller expenditure than Â£40,000,000 per annum upon the navy. Admiralty estimate. In fact, the Times at that time mentioned that England must not stop short of any sacrifice required to place her absolutely a position of supremacy.",67
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,The statistician of the Board of Trade is not a naval authority.,67
303,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"I may quote a statistician as well as naval authorities. If the honourable member desires authorities, I can refer him to some in all classes of society.",67
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,The trouble is. that they aie mutually contradictory.,67
305,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"Sir John Colomb n is quoted, not as a constitutionalist, but as to have been a naval authority.",67
306,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"The organ of the Cobden Pree-trade Society says that the true contribution of Australia should be Â£3,000,000, l l. and of Canada Â£4,000,000. In fact, one of by the strongest condemnations of our carelessness in this matter comes from that organ, I am sure the honourable member for the Parramatta will respect, as representing the views of the committee of the Cobden Club. The Imperial Federation League the is circulating pamphlets showing the insufficiency of our contribution, and advoan increased contribution. I merely point out what must be the result of this policy, if we once affirm it. We cannot honourably refuse hereafter a proportionate contribution in the face Of that to being now declared to be the goal at which Imperial Ministry are aiming. W it h regard to coastal defence one must speak with an adea certain whispering humbleness, but I again remind honourable members that the initial cost of an Auxiliary fleet of five that cruisers would be under Â£900,000. Lieut. Biddlecombe, who supported his estimate by the opinions of experts, put the total capital outlay at about Â£900,000. Senator Matheson, in a letter which honourable members may have seen, points out that an outlay of less than Â£900,000 would, on the admission of the Admiralty, be sufficient for ; the beginning of a coastal defence.",67
307,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR BONUS,He says that the maintenance of five second-class cruisers would,67
308,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,I am dealing only with Centhe capital outlay. The one does not. ex,67
309,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR BONUS,"He puts the interest and not sinking fund at Â£125,000, and allows Â£242,000 for maintenance. That is the",67
310,Mr GLYNN,SUGAR BONUS,"The Admiralty estimate of the cost of the new cruisers and gunboats in is Â£850,000. The sum of Â£125,000 includes Â£45,000 a year for capital outlay. Senator Matheson assumes, on the A d miralty's own figures, that something under Â£1,000,000 would be the capital outlay upon the fleet. Then let us take the estimate of the experts who in 1899 reported upon the matter for the benefit of the States. They gave the capital outlay as Â£900,000. Allowing 5 per cent, on that amount for depreciation and interest,, that would give Â£45,000, or a total annual outlay of Â£242,000 for a fleet which, they say, would be adequate for the purposes of our defence. Those who rely upon this method of recognising our Imperial obligations have a concrete suggestion for carrying them out. We may find then in the creation of some sort of local navy a way to recognise and acknowledge our responsibilities - to the Empire and to the Commonwealth. As members of the Empire we must bear a reasonable share of its burdens and responsibilities. The method and extent, however, must pay some regard to the local desire for independent control and the vast differences between the interests at stake. Proportionate contributions are not_ called for by any excessive intermeddling on our part in international affairs, nor as a premium upon risks voluntarily incurred by us and covered by the Imperial fleet. But as units in the great Imperial system, whose real strength lies in the voluntary co-operation and independent development of its various members, we must and do acknowledge an obligation to bear some part of the cost of naval defence, and we are prepared to do so by a method which will pay some regard to local necessities and instincts, and will not in substance oppose Imperial desires.",67
311,Mr FOWLER,SUGAR BONUS," While I am unable to realise with the honourable member for Richmond that a bloody Armageddon is awaiting Australia if we do not endorse this proposal, I believe with him that we are now dealing with a very important matter ; a matter so important that I endorse the suggestion of the honourable member for Bland that the people of the country should be given an opportunity to realise what it means to them. This is not a question of pounds, shillings, and pence. The contribution of some Â£200,000 to the very large outlay upon naval defence annually incurred by the Imperial authorities cannot be of much moment to them, and therefore we cannot find, in the amount of the subsidy, a satisfactory explanation of their desire that we should pay it. Neither can I see that England, the weary Titan, is so very weary of his load as to require our assistance. As a matter of fact, in spite of the very heavy additions to the armaments of Great Britain of late years, at no period in its history has such expenditure' been borne by the community with less difficulty. Neither do I believe that we 'are being drawn by the Imperial authorities into what an honourable member of this House calls a vortex of militarism. In that respect Great Britain has not adopted, and is not likely to adopt, the attitude of some of the nations on the Continent of Europe with regard to military affairs. At one time militarism was a much more serious thing to the people of Great Britain than it is now, and I believe that Carlyle's famous picture of Dumdrudge villagers being led like sheep to the slaughter on the battlefields of Europe is no longer possible. Whatever temporary waves of militarism there may be, the people of the motherland are not likely to commit themselves in cold blood to a policy which is entirely foreign to the instincts of the nation. Statistics to some extent bear out the statement. I have made, that, so far as her expenditure on military and naval matters is concerned, Great Britain is in a better position now than she was ever in before. For that reason I cannot see that there is any need for the Imperial authorities to drag us into the so-called vortex of militarism, assuming that desire to exist. In my opinion, the true significance of the proposal of the Government is to be found in a departure indicated in the measure before 'us. The principal difference between the proposal embraced in this measureand the old arrangement between Australia and the mother country, lies in the fact that the Admiralty proposes to retain power to send the Australian Squadron into other waters, presumably, of course, in our interest. Whilst. I listened to the speech of the Minister for Defence, I could not help admiring his courage in saying that he was thoroughly convinced that the Imperial authorities would exercise this power wisely and well in respect to Australia. I think that the right honourable gentleman, in common with other representatives of Western - Australia in this House, is beginning to entertain some rather disquieting ideas with regard to the attention given to Western Australian interests, even in this impartial Chamber. Here we have a voice in all Australian matters, but what say does the Minister suppose that we shall have in Imperial affairs ? If he shares with me the fear that the interests of Western will not always receive the consideration they deserve at the hands of the Federal Legislature, surely he is rather rash in agreeing to hand over the entire control of the tralian Squadron to the Imperial authorities - control in which we have no representation ab all. This is an important of which the people of this country should be fully seized before the measure is passed. It has been stated that the proposal embodies the principle of taxation representation, but to my mind the question is not so much one of taxation representation as one of contributing money, in the expenditure of which we shall have no voice. Here, I take it, is the precise point of departure. AVe are asked to become a partner in a large concern in which we shall no doubt have a certain interest, but at the same time. I contend that we could more effectively safeguard Imperial interests in this part of the world by refraining from taking part in any such arrangement. There is another matter of some importance to which reference has not yet been made. AVe are reminded of the large expenditure undertaken by Great Britain in connection with defence .matters generally, and it has been argued that - we should, to some extent at least, imitate the mother land in that respect. I find, however, that the incidence of taxation in Great Britain is very different from what exists here. For some years past there has been a growing desire on the part of British statesmen to place the incidence of taxation upon a truly scientific basis. Direct taxation has been increased, and indirect taxation has been steadily reduced. At the time of the Crimean AVar, about 50 years ago, the proceeds of indirect represented 66 per cent, of the total revenue, whilst 34 per cent, was contributed by direct taxation. At present direct taxation yields 51 per cent, and indirect taxation 48 per cent. That means, of course, that the wealthier classes are being called upon to bear increased taxation, whilst the masses are being correspondingly relieved. Now we are told that,in contributing towards the maintenance of the Australian Squadron, we are paying our money into a fund for the insurance of capital, and that, in fact, J Mr Folder. w e ' ought . to be glad of the opportunity which Great Britain affords us. The protection given by the Australian Squadron, whilst it undoubtedly exAustralia tends to even the poorest individual in the community, means a great deal more to the wealthier classes. This has been recognised in Great Britain as is shown by the Aus- changes made in the incidence of taxation. What, however, is the condition of affairs in Australia? According to Coghlan, the principle contribution to the revenue in the form of direct taxation amounts to 12s. 6d. per inhabitant, as against Â£ 2 7s. 9d. per inhabitant derived from indirect taxation. In without other words, the masses would have to pay four times as much as the wealthier classes without towards an insurance fund intended to confer the greater amount of benefit upon the latter. I contend that this is a phase of the question that requires consideration, and that until our taxation is placed upon a more equitable basis than at present, the Government should hesitate to commit Australia to even the expenditure now proposed._ AA hen we have that measure of taxa7 tion reform which has been granted to the people of even Great Britain, there may be some reason for asking us to contribute to an insurance fund for the protection of capital.",68
312,Mr THOMSON,SUGAR BONUS,That argument applies also to a local fleet.,69
313,Mr FOAVLER,SUGAR BONUS,"Yes . Whilst I certainly think that the consideration of this matter ought to be postponed until the people have had an opportunity of realizing its full import and of indicating their attitude towards it, I should be equally hostile to any proposal in favour of the early establishment of an Australian Navy.",69
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,What is to be done in the meantime ?,69
315,Mr FOAVLER,SUGAR BONUS,In the meantime I think that we should adhere to the old contaxation dition of affairs.,69
316,Mr CAMERON,SUGAR BONUS,The honourable member has affirmed the principle involved under the old agreement.,69
317,Mr FOWLER,SUGAR BONUS,"No ; I have endeavoured to point out that there is a very radical distinction between the old agreement and the new. I have attempted to emphasize the fact that under the latter we are invited to enter into a partnership in which we shall have no voice as to the expenditure of the money. Under the old system, while retaining our connection with the mother country, we did not, as in-the present instance, endorse a proposition that Australian interests should be absolutely intrusted to the British Admiralty.",69
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,The adoption of the amendment will obliterate the whole thing.,70
319,Mr FOWLER,SUGAR BONUS,"I am entirely opposed to the proposals of the Government, and desire to give the electors of Australia an opportunity of indicating their wishes upon this matter. Reverting to the point raised by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr . Cameron, I would remind him that the arrangement proposed by the Government is more than likely in time of emergency to recoil upon those very Imperial interests which some honourable members are so anxious to conserve. This fleet, under the control of the Admiralty authorities, can be ordered by them into any part of the Chinese waters. Let us assume that 1 the mother-country is at war, and that we are taking a hand in the trouble. Let us imagine that it is rumoured that a hostile fleet is somewhere in Australian waters. Naturally the people of Australia and New Zealand would be anxious to secure the protection of the Australian Squadron. The Admiralty authorities, however, may decide that the interests of these countries will be best conserved if that squadron is despatched to the vicinity of Hong Kong to look after the welfare of our coloured fellow-subjects there, as I. believe they are regarded in some quarters. If a descent were made on any port in Australia or New Zealand whilst the Australian Squadron was in other waters, honourable members can readily imagine what would be the result. The uew agreement with the Imperial authorities would then be denounced in the most effective fashion. Indeed, such a contingency might possibly lead to that very calamity which so many honourable members are anxious to avoid, namely, the complete severance of our connection with the'motberland.",70
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,No such contingency is likely to arise.,70
321,Mr FOWLER,SUGAR BONUS,In my judgment it is a very possible contingency.,70
322,Mr CAMERON,SUGAR BONUS,What would be the position if the English fleet were defeated in Australian waters?,70
323,Mr FOWLER,SUGAR BONUS,"Then, of course, we should have to face a very serious position indeed ; but it would be free from any ill feeling, such as would be engendered by the reflection that our interests had been subordinated to those of others in a different part .of the Empire.",70
324,Mr CAMERON,SUGAR BONUS,They are of the same flesh and blood.,70
325,Mr FOWLER,SUGAR BONUS,"We are ccertainly of the same flesh and blood as the people of the motherland, and that tie, of itself, will always be sufficient to bind us to them, and to insure that our best efforts will be directed towards the common good. But I hold that the new agreement contains elements of danger which may well make the Government pause before committing the country to it. I realise the significance of the proposed change so fully that I heartily support the honourable member for Bland in his demand that the people of the country shall have an opportunity of expressing their desires upon a matter which is of vital importance to them and to the. true interests of the Empire as a whole.",70
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"Parramatta) The point which has particularly impressed me during the course of this debate is that nearly every honourable member who has spoken in opposition to the proposal of the Government has asseverated, in the most solemn manner, his desire to assist the Empire in every possible way. The trouble is that every one of these gentlemen has a different notion of how that assistance should be given - Ami d so much conflict of authority and opinion who is to decide ?",70
327,Mr FOWLER,SUGAR BONUS,The people of Australia.,70
328,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"The possibility is that they may have as many different opinions upon the matter as we have heard expressed in this Chamber. What is the issue to be placed before the people when they are consulted ? May I remind the honourable member that if that is the object which he and his party seek, they have gone a very strange way about accomplishing it. They have adopted the course which is usually followed when an endeavour is made to kill a Bill outright. When an honourable member desires to defeat the second reading of any measure it is well-known that he submits a similar amendment to that proposed by the honourable member for Bland. That amendment, I would point out, contains nothing indicative of a desire on his part to take the sense of the people of Australia upon this matter. H a d he merely been desirous of doing that, rather than of killing the Bill outright, it would have been the easiest thing in the world to have incorporated - some such provision in the amendment he has submitted. Instead he has simply moved an amendment which has for its object the killing of this proposal at the present time. If it were' carried bhere is no provision made for the continuance of the old agreemenb, leb alone the question of the new relationship to the Empire.",70
329,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,We have to give two years' nobice before ib can lapse.,71
330,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"-Tw o years is libble enough. I .bake ib that if we are going to appeal to the people of Australia on a mabber of bhis kind, the bwo years will have expired before we can be ready again bo deal wibh ib.",71
331,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,There is no need to give the nobice.,71
332,Sir JOHN POHREST,SUGAR BONUS,Bu b the ships gebbing old.,71
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"I should like bo know whab honourable members propose. Eibher they propose bo consulb the people of Australia on bhis mabber, and bhen effecbuabe ib if the vobe of the people be favourable or the}' do nob. There is no plan befoie the Ptouse bo carry that resolution into effect.. What are they going to put before the people ? Are they going to ask the opinion of the people of Australia on the subject of the proposed agreement, or are they going to put it before the people as an albernabive bo a scheme of bheir own, and if so, whab is that scheme 1 I have no objection to the course baken .by honourable members, if only they will make bheir proposal inbelligible, bub I rabher suspecb. that the only objecb which the honourable member for Bland has in view ab the presenb momenb is the defeab of bhis proposal without any regard as to what is to eventuate. I think it would be very much better and more straightforward if he had moved his amendmenb wibhoub making the prebence of saying that ib was for bho purpose of consulting the people of Australia on the question.",71
334,Mr FOWLEK,SUGAR BONUS,Will the honourable member suggest a way of improving the amendmenb?,71
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"I am nob in favour of the amendmenb, bherefore I am nob likely bo suggesb a way of improving ib. The thing which struck me in the debate was the way in which every one wishes to help the Empire in ibs defence. The honourable and learned member for Corio was quite pained the obher night thab any one should suggest any defectiveness in his loyalty to the Empire because of the attitude he assumed, and said thab he hoped we should always be on affectionate terms wibh the Empire, and that the silken bonds and crimson threads would be perpetually mainbained, while in almosb the nexb breabh he said- "" My responsibiliby is alone bo Australia."" That is a rabher selfish way of showing his loyalty to the Empire. An y man who believes in the mainbenance of the ties bebween the mobher counbry and bhese Sbates musb go further bhan that, and recognise that bhere is nob merely a responsibiliby for Australia, bub a responsibiliby bo some degree for the Empire as a whole. There is no escape from that conclusion that I can see.",71
336,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,On the same line of are reasoning we should share in all the liabilities of the Empire.,71
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"Nobhin g of the kind. The argumentof the honourable member-and it is the one used by his leader-amounb s bo bhis : That because a son has equal responsibiliby wibh his fabher for the mainbenance 'of the family relation, bherefore,' even bhough he be earning only Â£40 a year, he should bring home as much as his fabher bowards the mainbenance of that family. The idea is ridiculous. He bakes a responsibiliby according bo his means, his position, and his relation in the family household. Similarly in pledging ourselves to bake our share in the burdens of Empire we are nob pledged bo a pro rata conbribubion bo"" bhis navy. We are pledged bo do whab we can for the mainbenance of the Empire, having in view ab the same time our own peculiar position and condition of development That is all that is set up by honourable members who say, as citizens of the Empire, we have a righb to take some of ibs obligations. The honourable and learned member for Soubh Australia, Mr Glynn, commended bo me somebhing bhat was beingdone by the Cobden league, and he was quibe sure that I would pay some attention bo the Cobden leaguers. If the Cobden leaguers on bhis question of Imperial defence choose bo put themselves in a ridiculous position, that is no ground why their mere ipse dixit should appeal bo my reason. I decline bo be guided by the Cobden leaguers on the question of Imperial defence. In bhis agreemenb bhere are some things of which I do not albogebher approve. I take exception to what the last speaker regarded as the vital principle of the Bill , namely, the evident desire of the Imperial authorites to make a navy here merely an adjunct to the fleet of the Empire. I should like the Prime Minister to consider whether that is not a matter which might be modified with advantage to the agreement? As I read the document, I take it that there is a desire on the part of the naval authorities at home to make use of this squadron for the purpose of policing the diplomacy of the Empire in the Eastern and Pacific waters. Article 2 lays down what the base of the force is to be, and says that the sphere of operations shall beThe waters of the Australian, China, and East Indies stations, as defined in the attached schedules, where the Admiralty believe they can most effectively act against hostile vessels which threaten the trade or interests of Australia and New Zealand.",71
338,Mr FOWLER,SUGAR BONUS,"""Trad e or interests"" is a very elastic term.",72
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"It is so elastic a term-as I pointed out when the Prime Minister was speaking the other nightthat the probability is that if this agreement were in force our fleet would be in Chinese waters now. We were told by the right honourable and learned gentleman that there is a foregathering of the fleets of the Empire in that direction ; that no less than 52 Russian war vessels are there; and that it is a matter of the gravest concern to the wisest heads in the Empire today. I take it that that article in the agreement would enable our fleet to be moved up into Chinese waters at the present moment. Sir JOHN FORE EST - And suppose it were, whab would happen ?",72
340,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"I shall tell the Minister for Defence .what I object to. While I am prepared to agree to the Bill as to the disposition of that force, I - do not think that we should be adopting a wise policy in agreeing to any proposal which would make our fleet the means of policing the diplomacy of the Empire in these seas. The honourable member knows as well as I do that every time there is a difference of opinion concerning a matter of policy, one or two war boats, or a squadron, goes to the scene in order bo be ready in case of evenbualities.",72
341,Sir JOHNFORREST,SUGAR BONUS,We do nob pay the whole cost; ib is nob our fleeb only.,72
342,Mr FOWLER,SUGAR BONUS,"Tha b is the poinb ; ibis not our fleeb, and we have no control over it.",72
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"The Minisber for Defence will ab leasb admib that ib is a new departure so far as we are concerned. I submib that our shores oughb nob bo be lefb undefended when our fleeb is sent merely to police British interests in parbs outside Australia. The agreemenb does nob provide that the fleeb shall go away only in case of war, bub that ib shall proceed bo any poinb where the Admiralby deem our interest to be threatened."" I feel strongly that bhis provision in the Bill oughb to be modified. I am willing thab the fleeb should be senb away in case of war or of positive danger, bub nob that ib should go on mere policing expeditions of the kind I have indicated. This provision is a blob on the agreement, and I hope thab before the measure emerges from Committee it will have been removed. A tthe same time. I support the. agreement as the best way oub of a very serious difficulby. Whab have honourable members bold us they would accepb in place of the agreemenb? The honourable and learned member for Bendigo the obher night bold us that his idea was bo have a fleet of five light cruisers to probect our commerce in our immediate waters. But I ask, as I asked before, of what use would five cruisers be aS a means of defending Australia if it were not for the fact that the Imperial Navy is behind ib ? Honourable members who make bhese propositions seriously must know that bhere is somebhing which they are keeping from the Commibbee, or they are baking' a very superficial view of the position. The honourable member for Bourke bold us bo-nighb that we oughb to reduce our military expenses by anobher quarter of a million per annum, and use the money in purchasing a ship each year towards the formation of a navy. The honourable member would begin to form the Ausbralian Navy wibh one boat for the first year, two boabs for the second year, three boabs for the bhird year, and so on. Bub the pei-binenb question arises-Wha b is bo become of Australia with a navy of one boat flying ibs flag bravely bo the breeze and challenging the whole world bo mortal combat? The idea is too ludicrous for serious notice in a House of bhis kind. The honourable member for Bland suggesbs that we should vebo the proposed agreement, and, wibhoub a squadron, organize better land defences until we are in a positiofi to form an Australian Navy.",72
344,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"I said I was quite prepared to support an agreement similar to the existing one, until we were able to form an Australian Navy, but not to provide a fleet for China.",73
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,The honourable member for Bland went on to say that the agreement provided for one squadron in Australian waters.,73
346,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,The agreement does not provide for that.,73
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"It doe's under normal conditions. There would, under the agreement, be one squadron in Australian waters, but liable to be called away ; and that one squadron the honourable member regarded as useless as a means of defending Australia. I interjected when the honourable member was speaking that the Bill provides for three squadrons.",73
348,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,At the other end of world.,73
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,The China Sea After and the Indies are not at the other end the world.,73
350,Mr AVATSON,SUGAR BONUS,Ver y nearly ; the China Sea goes as far as Siberia.,73
351,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"One of the strongest points in the Prime Minister's agreemenb ab all 1 speech was as to the inter-relation of these various fleets, and the possibility of their converging at any point of danger. The normal condibions.. Prime Minister laid it down clearly that the nava-l policy underlying the agreement was .that each fleet should go to the assistance here ? of the others in case of necessity. In answer to that, we have the honourable member Perth, who says he can conceive trouble arising in the China Sea, and, while fleet was there, some roving, marauding squadron pouncing on us in Australia. what would the Admiralty be doing all only that time? If that kind of thing be posterrible sible after eveiy precaution has been taken, I must say that our squadron, even if chained here, would not be able to prevent a calamity to Australia.",73
352,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,Why does England keep a squadron always in the English Channel 1,73
353,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"Because England is near to points of contact with possible enemies, and to constant sources of danger.",73
354,Mr AVATSON,SUGAR BONUS,The Channel Fleet is kept there because there is danger.,73
355,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,Undoubtedly .,73
356,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,And there would be danger to Australia if our squadron were away in China.,73
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"No doubt of it ; but the Admiralty engage with the whole British fleet to look after that, and I hope the honourable member will disabuse his mind of the idea that I want the Australian fleet to go to China, unless there is real danger of eventualities. Does the honourable member suppose that, even under the old arrangement, if there was real cause of danger to the Empire in China, we should keep our fleet idle here 1 If we desired to do so, I believe that, even under present conditions, the Imperial Government would order thefleebaway.",73
358,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,Then the old agreement is a fraud.,73
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"Nothin g of the kind. I do not think that any agreement we could make would stand in - the the face of any crucial position into which the Empire might find itself driven. all, the aim and end of the Navy is of the defence of the Empire, and I take it that our local agreemenb would nob sband in the way of a supreme naval necessiby in which the whole Empire was menaced.",73
360,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,Then why have any,73
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,For the purpose of securing and dealing wibh the fleeb under,73
362,Mr AVATSON,SUGAR BONUS,AVhe n ib is nob wanbed the honourable' member would have the fleet,73
363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"I take it that for the fleet is wanbed ab any time and all the time; that the chief value of our a fleet is bo preserve peace, and not merely bo geb us oub of scrapes when we But are in bhem. Is the honourable member's idea of a fleeb that of fighbing in some struggle for supremacy 1 My idea, and I think the common idea, is thab a fleeb is a sorb of insurance bo the Empire, and tends to prevent actual conflict.  7 keep a fleet for show 1",73
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"We do nob want a fleet for show, but for the purpose of making war impossible. I want a fleet to preserve my own skin, and to preserve the skin of the honourable member for Maranoa, to give the reply as vulgarly as the honor# able member pub his question. I have no objecbion to the agreement as a whole, .but I think some modification might be made in the second clause. The honourable member for Bland quoted the case of Canada, and argued that we might follow the lead of that country at the present moment. I do not think that Canada furnishes an example which we can follow. We are told that Canada will not contribute anything to the naval defence of the Empire, although she is near to menacing continental navies. But the honourable member for Bland forgot to mention that Canada is a great deal nearer than we are to the greatest defending navy of them all.",73
365,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,"The only naval "" power Canada has to fear at all is the United States; and the United States small payment, boo. must protect her because of the Monroe doctrine. ,",74
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"When considerportance. ing the position of Canada, I always ask now. myself the question - would Canada go to any trouble to establish a naval defence force for herself if she had no relationperial ship to the Empire at all? Should we upon be as careless as honourable members seem to be of our naval defence if we were connected with the Empire at the present moment ? I venture to say that if we were not connected with the Empire we should be spending hundreds of thousands of pounds in the creation of at any rate the nucleus of an Australian Navy in Austrareadily lian waters, and that Canada would doing'the same. Therefore, because Canada chooses to take refuge under the flag of old country-choose s to rely upon that British already overburdened country for her naval defence-it is no reason why we in Austrafence lia should do the same. Another very imincrease portant point has been raised by the honorbure able member for Bland as to what obligabeen tions in regard to expenditure we have towards the Imperial Navy. He says declines to recognise our obligation to the Imperial Navy as an institution. First all I ask myself-a m I a cibizen of the Empire or not? If I am a cibizen of the enemies. Empire I bake ib that I have an obligabion for the defence of the Empire as a whole. I have already explained that bhis does nob involve equal or even pro rata expendibure on our parb.",74
367,Mr FOWLER,SUGAR BONUS,Does ib nob involve some represenbabion in the Councils of the Empire?,74
368,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"No ; and beburden cause of difficulties of anobher kind. 6 F difficulby I see is a geographical one. If we were nob separated from the old country by the sea, we should "" make no bones' aboub discussing bhese problems wibh bhem Ib is only because the sea separates us, and it would be inconvenient and perhaps dangerous for us in bhis portion of the Empire, 12,000 miles away from where bhese questions are considered, bo be represenbed bhere, that we are nob represented. But thab is nob a question which inheres in the nature of the bargain ibself. Ib arises from our geographical position.",74
369,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"We should only have a still small voice "" if we were represented.",74
370,Sir JOHN FORREST,SUGAR BONUS,And make a very,74
371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"I suppose we should have a voice proporbionabe to our imHowever, this is not in question We have to consider also how much of England's present expendibure on the Navy is due bo the demands of her Impolicy. How much of ib is resultant her having these colonies belonging to her? England's inflabed expendibure ab the not present moment is largely owing to the troubles which have arisen in Soubh Africa. Ib has gone up by leaps and bounds, and her trouble is to geb ib back again. Her Governmenb find that ib cannob do so. They have gob bo a level from which they cannot very recede, and that is causing trouble at be the present moment. She wants 30,000 soldiers as a permanent garrison in Soubh the Africa. Whab for ? Nob for the purposes of trade, as some people have suggested, but for the purposes of protection and deof the Empire. A great deal of the in the naval and milibary expendiof Greab Bribain in recenb years, has owing bo the desire of Greab Bribain bo keep the Empire intact, and to establish he better relations with her colonies.",74
372,Sir EDMUND BARTON,SUGAR BONUS,It is the practice of of some people bo draw every inference againsb the Empire and in favour of her,74
373,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"I do nob wonder that people in the old counbry are saying that ib is time we began bo recognise our obligations. The taxpayers of England are having a very rough and a very heavy time of ib, particularly the working classes.",74
374,Mr FOWLER,SUGAR BONUS,Thei r baxable burden is being sbeadily reduced. They carry bheir wibh less difficulby bhan did bheir The predecessors 50 or 100 years ago.,74

377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"Thatdoesnottouc h the point I am making. The question is much of that burden is involved in the maintenance of present relations with colonies. As a citizen of the EmEmpire pire, I maintain that we have an obligation for the maintenance of the Navy as an existing institution. The question of whether at some time in the future we may set up a fleet of our own, relieving Great Britain altogether of the obligation of defending these for shores, is one that is quite consistent what I am saying. That would be one of discharging our obligations to the pire. But I insist that at present have a definite obligation. For these sons, I urge that the bargain made by Prime Minister, apart from the blemishes I have pointed out, is a good one for us. is a cheap and adequate way of providing for the defence of these shores- a defence, which I believe, is becoming every day more and of adequacy. more imperative. One feature of the agreement which appeals to me is that for the first time in our history it provides for adequate training of our marine volunteers. Apart altogether from other considerations, think this is a matter which we ought not to treat lightly. In my opinion, it gives an immense advantage. An y one who sires that we should have in the near future an Australian Navy-and I am not looking with an unfavorable eye on the proposal, because while I dismiss it for the present, as I do not think it is practicable, I believe that the time .will come",75
378,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,"How does the honourable member reconcile the proposal for an Ausof tralian Navy with the notion of concengo trating the naval forces in one spot, perhaps thousands of miles away?",75
379,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,I do not think that the two proposals conflict in any way. I take it that if we have an Australian cumstances. Navy completely under our own governance we shall then require to make a working alliance with the Imperial Navy.,75
380,Mr WATSON,SUGAR BONUS,Primaril y for Australian,75
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"For offensive and defensive purposes, and not a one-sided",75
382,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,Would the honourable member be in favour of the adoption of the same course in connection with our land,75
383,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"Thes e are really technical points ; we have already shown the Empire that we would do the same with how our land forces. The moment an emergency arises our fleet and our land forces, too, the would be placed at the disposal of the for the purposes of its defence.",75
384,Mr MCDONALD,SUGAR BONUS,Would the honourable member support the insertion of a similar provision in the Defence Bill ?,75
385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUGAR BONUS,"I would not vote such a provision in the Defence Bill , with because I do not think that we need way - put to the front any more of these Emaggressive notions than we are comwe pelled to do. I should not vote for this reaagreement if I did not think that it the was the best that we could get, and if I were not under the impression that the It Admiralty have asked for it for special reasons. I take it that they have asked for it on strategical grounds, and on the grounds They tell us that by this means we shall obtain a more adequate defence than we should secure under any the other circumstances. The Prime Minister has made it clear that it is not for any I selfish purpose that the Empire suggests this alteration, but for the purpose of prous viding us with a more adequate defence dethan we have at present. At the same time, I tell the honourable member candidly that I would have much preferred to see the second article cast in very different terms. But the honourable member is raising technical difficulties when he inquires whether I would do this or that, or something else, in the case of a great national emergency. I contend that all agreements this kind, and, indeed, all Bills, would down before a great Imperial necessity, "" such as involved the fate of the Empire. That is why they do not assume the tremendous importance in our consideration at this moment that they would in other cirBut apart from all these blemishes, I say that the arrangement is a cheap one. It gives us an adequate defence instead of our present obsolete one. It has been suggested over and over again that the ships of the existing fleet are practically worthless. We must obtain a new navy of some kind, and I think that, under this agreement, we shall secure oue upon remarkably reasonable terms, particularly if this fleet is to be up-to-date, as we aro promised it shall be. For the reason, therefore, that the agreement involves a cheap and adequate defence, besides providing for the training and the development of the sea power of Australia, so as to prepare the way for any other arrangements that may be made in the future, I think we shall do well now to vote for it as it has been placed before us by the Government. Debate (on motion by Mr A . C. GROOM) adjourned. House adjourned at 10.35 p.m.",75
